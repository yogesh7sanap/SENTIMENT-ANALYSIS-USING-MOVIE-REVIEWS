        "review_title": "Never Have I Been so Wrong About a Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, \"Are you kidding me?!\" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.\n\nBoy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.\n\nThe story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and \"master builder\", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the \"special\" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for \"the piece of resistance\" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.\n\nIt all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)\u0085Batman!\n\nThe older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \"(leading) lives of quite desperation.\"\n\nFinally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around \"master builders\" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built \"according to the directions.\" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.\n\nThe Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out \"chose one\" clich\u00e9s and also rather poignant and touching.\n\nThe first thing one has to mention is the animation. Not only does it look like an amateur stop-motion film with a $500 million budget, but the amount of detail and creativity put into the visuals is just staggering. At times there's so much going on the screen it's almost overwhelming, yet if you look closely you can see that every single thing is comprised of recognizable Lego parts. The various ways the world shifts, breaks, is constructed again, falls apart and moves around is simply a joy to watch. The implementation of real-world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon \"Kragle\". The result is a film that looks unlike anything we've seen before.\n\nThe script is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious gag after another. The jokes come at you so fast you can't catch them all in one viewing, and blink-and-you'll-miss-it side gags clutter the screen. No running gag wears out its welcome, no joke is overplayed or overemphasised. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own. Batman especially is a riotous parody of the grim, dark versions of the Caped Crusader we've been stuck with for nearly a decade. And due to Lego having rights for nearly every IP imaginable, you won't be able to guess which mega-franchise is going to turn up next.\n\nDespite all this high praise, there are a couple of minor issues. During its third act the tone of the film starts moving to a more serious and emotional direction, which to me didn't work as well as the rapid fire comedy of the rest of the film. The voicework is great for the most part, but amidst all the others it becomes rather apparent that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are live, not voice actors. It's not that their performances are bad, they just seem rather flat and lifeless in comparison to the rest of the cast.\n\nThe Lego movie is a downright masterpiece, there's no two ways about it. Incredible visuals and animation combined with a hilarious script, dazzling creativity and good characters make it one of the best and most original animated films in a long time. Some minor hindrances can do very little to drag it down, and the end result is fantastic."

The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.\n\nA combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to.\n\nThe voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy.\n\nThe plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's \"resistance piece\". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph!

Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy this awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.\n\n(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop singing the \"Everything is awesome\" song played in the movie. Too catchy!)\n\nThe creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about Legos and making a new movie packed with humor.\n\nThe voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed doing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic as the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this movie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business. He gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh, smile, and want more Lego awesomeness.\n\nI give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best picture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all Lego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome, just like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film."

I'm not sure I'd consider it Oscar-worthy, but then again most Oscar winners I don't consider deserving.\n\nThe Lego Movie is a lot of fun and has reaffirmed my faith in them.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLooks incredible\n\nLot of fun\n\nThe Bad:\n\nStill pretty silly in places\n\nMore than a slight sprinkle of Hollywood excess and stupidity\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nThe double decker couch actually sounds quite neat\n\nWiping your bum with a hook for a hand is really hard\n\nIt's not expected for a person to marry a marshmallow"

There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the 'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children commented on this."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be honest \u0096 when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad. However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from what I realize \u0096 they are much different from this one). And in this age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one, needed no more reasons to see this movie \u0096 and I ultimately enjoyed it. The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord Business's alter ego \u0096 President Business \u0096 is ruling the whole world in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon 'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders. Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic. That isn't necessarily a bad thing \u0096 actually, the movie has an explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable \u0096 but the movie does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action scenes \u0096 and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities. The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top and funny \u0096 and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good, ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover, another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson, Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun, feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie. Rating: 8/10"

And the worst was the characters, which aside of Batman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.\n\nTo me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.\n\nPeople really like this movie, and that's great!

Maybe it's the outstanding animation, the self-aware and clever humour, or the messages about Lego and different builders being unique, or maybe just all of them together.

But the LEGO Movie is awesome and I'm not just saying that, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.\n\nPlot - The Story is about a ordinary guy named Emmet who is said to be the special. He eventually goes on this Journey with some Master Builders from stopping Lord Business from doing the evil stuff that he is supposed to do. Surprisingly the plot is really smooth. It takes a while to get adjusted during the beginning but towards the middle, you are totally adjusted to the plot. And the plot seems to work out just perfect not too much not too little.\n\nCharacters - The cast of this movie is like, to be honest, one of the best casts in an animated film ever put to film. We've got Christ Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnet, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, even Morgan Freeman put in the films main roles. Each actor portrays the emotions of the character so well. The voices just work with each individual figure. So the characters are portrayed very carefully and well during the film each one at the right time.\n\nAnimation - The Animation in this movie is so good. You literally feel like you are inside a LEGO world. The animation looks like Stop-Motion, but it's actually computer animated which actually makes everything look a it better. You literally could imagine this happening on your kids or your LEGO's. It's like you are watching little tiny Minifigures going on an adventure. Also when things are blown up or smoke is coming out of vehicles, it's all LEGO bricks manipulating everywhere. It is genius animation, just it just fits with the LEGO movie.\n\nWhat to Except - Pure satisfaction and maybe even more. This is one of those kids films were parents enjoy it just as much as their kids EQUALLY. There is a ton of Pop culture references in the film that everybody today can relate to so much. There is literally non-stop funny humor throughout the film. And a some of it is adult humor to keep the adults very entertained and into the film. What mainly to expect is \"Getting Super Surprised\" When you here about a movie about LEGOs, your just thinking \"it's going to be a huge advertisement for sure.\" But it felt like it wasn't advertising anything at all. There were so many life lessons in the movie that are not hard to catch especially to the parents. Family lessons that aren't just any silly all life lesson, but something deeper and more. All these lessons and heart-warming moments are fit into one whole 100 minute movie very smoothly surprisingly. In the end is what will really get you but I can't spoil it because that would ruin the whole movie. So parents, children prepare for a surprising film, trust me.\n\nOverall - Overall the LEGO movie is a enjoyment for the whole movie but not just like any old good animated movie. This is something more. Something more, something movies these days should have. It's been more than a decade until we've had amazing movies like this. Disney still has there A-Game on, but I think Warner Bros. Is starting to step up their game. So should you buy it on. Blu-Ray or Watch it? Both. You can watch this so many times and always keep on being entertained. The LEGO movie is one of the, or just maybe, the greatest animated film ever played on the big screen. (A+)"

I am glad I used passes or I would have been harsher if I spent good money on it. Compared to Clutch Powers The Lego movie was not as polished and the heroes I wanted to see that were in the commercials were only in the feature for a few seconds. The ol' bait and switch like Wreck It Ralph pulled IMO. I also felt dizzy watching some of the action scenes and lost track of what was going on. Thanks goodness I skipped 3D or it would have been worse. I would recommend waiting to see this on video instead of at the theatre. This kids liked going out to a movie but enjoyed talked about the one we saw on Netflix more at the end of the day."

They found one extremely satisfying way to make \"the\" LEGO movie and tell a beautiful story (watch until the end!). Had they done something like \"G.I. Joe\", \"Battleship\" or the likes, they would have failed. 2) The way they're using LEGO bricks for EVERYTHING, including and not limited to fire, water, foam, smoke, explosions, laser beams, LED bargraphs, clouds, force fields, motion blur (!) and more, is just mind-boggling and alone warrants watching the film. Everything is awesome!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had no excitement in seeing THE LEGO MOVIE. Mostly because in Italy it wasn't that known nor advertised when it came out 5 years ago. But one Sunday after lunch I catched it on TV and man I was amazed! I really loved it from beginning to end and I also appreciated the style of the movie.\n\nThe movie begins with Emmett, a Lego construction worker (voiced by Chris Pratt) that has an ordinary life in the Lego universe. He is soon approached by Lucy and Vitruvius the prophet and they pester Emmett saying that he is the chosen one of the Lego people and the only one that could save them. In fact, there is danger in the air: President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) wants to create the most powerful glue ever made because he wants to glue the entire Lego universe making it static. So it's up to Emmett, Lucy, Vitruvius and many other characters made in Legos (including Batman, C-3PO, Green Lantern, Han Solo and Superman just for naming a few) to stop President Business' evil plan.\n\nWhat I loved about this movie was its sense of style and CGI animation, with colors so vivid and fresh, like a Lego construction coming to life. All the actors do their best, and let me say it: with a voice cast that includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, Channing Tatum, Shaquille O'Neal as himself and even Liam Neeson, how can you go wrong? It was also a surprise the part where we see in the attic Ferrell and his son moving the Legos and changing the story just how they wanted to change it. And the songs are very cute.\n\nIf you never saw this movie before and you happen to catch it on TV, watch it! It's one of those rare family movies of these days that manages to delight and entertain properly both children and adults."

I can't give away the plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a message everyone can relate to. I enjoyed the ending, although when it came I was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half. This movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail, the humor, and the funny story. A definite 10."

I loved the villain's weapon and the McGuffin, I loved and understood all the characters (especially Unikitty), I loved the jokes. Half of the twists are unexpected while having a story easy to follow. I can't give it a 10 though because it has a boring scene towards the end. It's not long, but it can make the perspective about the entire film confusing. Also the movie didn't took great risks, it's a pretty standard story, even with the twists and parts of originality. Definetly worth a watch and still a very good movie despite my nitpicking."

If I were saddled with trying to use Legos to make a movie, I think I'd cry uncle in the first minute. The creators of this little exercise in excess not only met the challenge, they knocked it out of the park.\n\nStill, this movie was a little too quick and frenzied for my taste. I would have wallowed in the wacky world created a little more, simplified the plot a bit, even if it meant going with a shorter run time. My first thought getting out of the theater was, I'm glad there isn't another hour of it. And that's a shame because this movie was truly inspired.\n\nI particularly liked its anti-fascist politics. It was doubly enjoyable knowing some conservatives consider this film an attempt to indoctrinate their children. To me that's just icing on the cake, I couldn't agree more with its cause, but I don't really believe this movie is likely to influence many kids at all. Its position on freeing people's creativity isn't very radical, and the opposite position of making everyone follow rigid rules was not that well developed. But, then, how could it be without inducing a giant buzz kill?\n\nI would not advise skipping this movie but don't expect too much and you'll be better prepared.

The good news is that it does work, yes it is a little rushed at times, especially towards the end, and the last half hour got a touch complicated (if the pacing had slowed down then it would have helped). But what was so brilliant about The Lego Movie was how it took this merchandise and managed to make such a colourful, clever, imaginative and enormously entertaining film out of it when it could have easily been the opposite. The animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, wasn't that \"Awesome\" song catchy or what? The Lego Movie's chief selling point is that it is an outstandingly well-written film with snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark, by far the funniest film I've seen in a while. The action is also block-busting in the very best of ways. It's not all hilarious though, because there is a lot of heart in The Lego Movie and the message will be an inspiration to anybody. The characters have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well, the most colourful being the villain President Business. And what a fine voice cast too, with Will Ferrell stealing the show, he is a hoot, but Morgan Freeman's dignified blind seer and Will Arnett's splendidly dour Batman are worthy of note too. Chris Pratt is a likable, chirpy protagonist but not quite as memorable as the supporting roles. To conclude, a brilliant and near-perfect film, animated or otherwise, that people of all ages and the whole family can enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Then you have people like Finn who like to build their own things and don't follow the instructions. Master Builder is a term that is actually used by LEGO and it refers to people who make all of the instructions for the company's toys. Being captured by Lord Business is a metaphor for LEGO hiring people who grew up loving LEGO and then being taken in to the company. Lord Business represents a consumer/collector that always wants more sets to add to their collection. I think this was a very bold movie for LEGO to make, because it questions both the company and the community itself. I truly love this movie for so many reasons but mainly because it makes me appreciate what The LEGO Group has done."

If you are a true LEGO fan and still buy them for yourself or the kids...you'd totally enjoy it...the animation and characters are true LEGO style. And with the trademarks they can use they've done a fun but 'not-so-great' job.\n\nAt my age, I'd think they could do a lot more with the licensing they have...but if I saw this 20 years ago...I'd definitely be mind boggled!!\n\nI am remembering my childhood days when watching the Flame animation and faces...but its not enough to rate it at par with the all the other wonderful animated movies I have seen this year. For a fact... if you have never ever played with LEGO toys, there are tonnes of better stuff out there...which I personally would say you should watch...with a little bit of Google assistance."

Many of the film's best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles, and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen must be possible to construct in the real world. It's a good mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great foundation to build on."

Because if the LEGO movie doesn't make you chuckle at least once in the hundred minutes of on screen time then I cannot say I know what will.\n\nThe fresh faced witty humour of the characters was refreshing and led to shrieks of amusement from the prepubescent's that filled the cinema and the belly laughed guffaws of parents alike. Unlike many children's films to date, the film featured none of the thinly veiled innuendos and stereotypes (commonplace in Disney films). Deviating from the norm, the 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and unprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main lessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to be someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do so. Instead of portraying heroism as something designed for the 'elite' and privileged few who have been 'destined' for greatness since birth, the recurring theme within the movie is that anyone can be a hero.\n\nFull review http://thatgirlreadallaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the- lego-movie_24.html"

Also, this film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a kid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this film, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the film itself.\n\nThe film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a hero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film that has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the writing, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out loud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle.\n\nThe animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D film with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the animation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of animation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful for the cinema world over.\n\nThe music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed \"everything is awesome\". Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the animation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the 3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too.\n\nI am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters with more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the kid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie sounds like a sneaky excuse for Hollywood's lack of new ideas, and so they have to pick a random popular material to adapt it on screen as an easy cash-in. I mean there is so little reason for this to exist since the product has been so popular in years, thus a full-length advertisement won't be that necessary. Fortunately, it hires the right people to bring it to life and the right choice of animation to make it look more appealing than the typical CGI animation. Overall it's all quite fun, probably too fun it sometimes forget to think through its plotting, but no one in the world will ever care about it because if a movie is having a good time, so will the audience.\n\nThe plot gives relevance to the toys: it's a fight between how they use them, it's either for playing to build more creativity or just displaying them as models. It's a clever way to justify the source material and it's obvious that the people behind it are really enjoying playing around. At some point the action becomes too fast and unstoppable which makes it difficult to concentrate at the exact storyline. But things get fixed when it finally introduces the central theme because right there it gives a whole lot of sense in this crazy world of blocks.\n\nThe animation is the landmark here. Though they're not actual toys being animated into stop-motion, but the amazing computer effects make it look like it is (a little like Flushed Away but with more life-like graphics). In spite that the action runs almost forever, they're just limitless fun. It takes you from place to place without betraying the aesthetics of the traditional stop-motion and it looks quite magnificent. The entire cast is full of delight. Chris Pratt is very likable as Emmet and that friendliness is what the character needs. Morgan Freeman brings an obvious gravity to his role. Liam Neeson and Will Ferrell are both pretty fun as the villains. And Charlie Day is just hilarious in his, although single but memorable, punchline.\n\nThe Lego Movie might be just a long advertisement and we know product placement at the large extent is the creepiest thing we might encounter at cinema's very existence, but the quality it provides is a huge pardon from that fact, because it brings a genuine heart and sincere affections to the source material which keeps it from being nothing more than a cynical cash-in blockbuster. It sometimes needs to calm down a bit, but again, no one would even bother. The Lego Movie is just filled with excitement, nostalgia, and wonderful animation that is impossible for one to dislike."

        "review_detailed_main": "NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW\n\nI have not written a review before but I find the other reviews misleading. I am 57 and have found that the reviews by people over 45 are most helpful for me because when you get to be our age you have seen it all so a movie had to be well written to be worth seeing. When I saw the reviews of 7.7 from men my age, I talked my family into going.\n\nThe movie was very good. I won't give any spoilers but it is funny, has somewhat sophisticated humor in some cases, and some slapstick that is funny. Characters, voice acting, story line are all pretty good. For me the first 20 minutes were a little slow and other parts were slow, but the good parts made it overall worth seeing. The problem I have is people gave it such a high review. To me a review of 7.7 is only for a movie that I will watch a second time when it comes on TV. This was good but not that good. I would give it a 6.8 but you can't do that so I put 7.\n\nReading the reviews I think I figured out why they were so high. People who played with Legos as a kid gave it a high rating. I never played with Lego (at least not that I remember) and so that was not special for me. The problem with reading the reviews is I was expecting a fantastic movie and ended up with a good one. If I had expected a good movie I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nFull disclosure my wife and 18 year old daughter HATED the movie and were VERY bored. My 21 year old daughter and I liked it. I think the key here is if you tend to like movies with subtle, sophisticated, ironic and satirical humor, this is for you. If you prefer action movies and romantic comedies this might seem boring to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like building things with Legos, either it is following the instructions on Lego sets or building random things with the bricks, Legos are fun to build with and it is easy to be creative with them; which is why I think making a movie of Lego is possible, it just has to be done correctly and have the people making the movie like the product to make the film good. The film The Lego Movie (2014) was excellent with it having fantastic animation, great voice acting, fun action, lots of creativity, funny jokes involving how Legos operate, a familiar but different enough premise, and an entertaining villain; while watching the film you can tell that the makers of the movie love Legos because not only do they come up with a way to explain how the Lego worlds work, but they are clearly having fun with this movie by how many characters they put in, how many things they can make fun of when it comes to stories that involve a prophecy, and the term \"Master Builder\" was a cool and fun way for the characters to be able build things on their own.\n\nChris Pratt was great as normal construction worker Emmet Brickowski, making him a likable character who is learning about being a master builder, that there are more Lego worlds outside of his, and learn why he is being called \"The Special\" by everyone else despite not knowing what is happening; I like how he gradually comes up with ideas that can help with saving the world, regardless of those ideas being smart or not. With Emmet we have Elizabeth Banks also doing a great job as Wildstyle who I thought was a cool character with her being skilled building things and trying her best to help Emmet on their adventure; also, she has a good progression of not believing in Emmet being special, to her finding his ideas helpful and thinking he is worthy enough to take down the ultimate weapon being used. Lastly, we have Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius being this funny wise mentor who believes in Emmet, Charlie Day as Benny the spaceman who had an occasional funny moment, and you have Will Arnett as Batman; having Lego Batman in this movie was great, and he had quite a few funny moments.\n\nWill Ferrell as President Business/Lord Business was an entertaining and funny villain, with him getting the weapon called the Kragle, he wants to stop the protagonists from using a special piece they call the \"Piece of Resistance\" to stop his plan of gluing the Lego world together so the heroes cannot build anything, along with him having a hate for master builders thinking they are messing with things he made perfect; also, we have Bad Cop/Good Cop voiced very well by Liam Neeson who was also funny with how he switches between bad and good cop. I love that the animation looks like it is in stop-motion animation, but it is really using CG animation that makes it look realistic with how the characters move around, the details in the Legos on the characters and backgrounds, and how stylized or cool the action sequences look; there were pretty Lego locations, the film was funny beginning to end, it had effective emotional moments, and it has a nice message by the end with a twist.\n\nThe film The Lego Movie (2014) was excellent with having fantastic animation, great voice acting, fun action, lots of creativity, funny jokes involving how Legos operate, a familiar but different enough premise, and an entertaining villain; you can tell that directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller love Legos because of how they made this nice-looking Lego world and making fun of in a way at the prophecy trope in movies, like in The Matrix (1999), which this film weirdly has similarities to. Lastly, if you love to build with Legos, then you will love this movie, even those who have not played with Legos before will like this movie; that is because this is a great and clever animated movie."

Only one more week until The Grand Budapest Hotel which could possibly stand to be my Best Picture throughout the whole year, who knows. However, so far, the year is starting on mild disappointments. Though perhaps I just had my hopes up a little too high. The Lego Movie is good, but it's just getting way more acclaim than it deserves. It's being treated as the new Toy Story for a generation. Quite an overstatement for a film that's likable and quirky but doesn't have the gravitas in its emotion for quite a bold statement. It really could have been a disaster though, they pulled off the marketing perfectly. Completely nailed the idea that this is a film with breezy awesome attitude.\n\nThe beauty is in the little personal touches as each lego peace has their natural imperfections. Chris Pratt is the perfect casting choice for the lead, I'm very glad he's starting to blow up because his personality shouldn't be limited to Parks and Recreation. He's ideal as a Spongebob-esque naive blank-slate protagonist. The Lego Movie is kind of like The Matrix plus Wreck-It Ralph but unfortunately I just found the film far too manic to register what was going on. Impressive animation especially how it adds so much depth in 3D but too often it just felt all over the place. Not that I couldn't follow the story, I just couldn't catch the details. I never felt jeopardy or tension and it was too messy in its stakes to care deeply. Just a good time. It's a film that deliberately wears its themes on sleeve being very on-the-nose about individualism and so forth.\n\nIt wants to be a satire but it doesn't commit enough to its observations. While it breaks the fourth wall sometimes in attempts at dissecting its screenplay formulas they just seem like winks rather than deconstructions. It's just a way around using clich\u00e9s rather than truly criticising them and using them inventively. But perhaps I'm taking a light film a little too seriously, at least its wonderful optimism makes up for what it lacks in conviction. It has several clever ideas and integrations into the real world that make it connect a little more though I do feel like the meta story takes stuff away rather than adds, especially with the melodramatic execution. However, as fun as the film is, I still don't think it can quite get passed the fact that it's a 100 minute advertisement for a toy. It is marketing the spirit of the toy with a touch of nostalgia, but seriously, go buy the toy.\n\n6/10"

What has the world come to?\" But, a few years on, and I was heavily obsessed with Lego, and so I decided to buy the DVD of The Lego Movie to see just what I'd missed. And, my God, it was incredible! It was immersive and witty, hilarious and genius, and no doubt one of the best films I have ever seen! The plot is creative and engaging, and the graphics are incredible, right down to every tiny scratch and fingerprint on the Lego minifigures that add that touch of realism. If you've not seen this film, then get on eBay and buy the DVD! It'll be the best purchase of your life!"

Innovative animation mixing stop-motion and CGI (where it stops and starts I don't know, that's the charm and wonder of the technique, like Robot Chicken if it had a budget, which one of the guys who does the show worked on the film so that makes sense), and almost non-stop comedy - even when it's not all huge laugh-out-loud laughs, there's endless cleverness but always with a goofy wink and slapstick. It's the Looney Tunes for our times. The ending isn't perfect - the message of everyone being \"special\" I think gets muddled with \"everyone be creative\", which aren't the same things though the directors try for both ways. But that's a nit-pick really; this is on the level of popular-innovative entertainment as Toy Story."

However, it turns out to be possibly the best animated movie of all time. After seeing this movie, my siblings would not stop reenacting the movie with toys, playing the video games, etc. The film is extremely funny and charming and jokes are timed so well that it looks like a beautiful piece of art. The characters are so separate and unique that their \"gang\" looks like the new toy story gang. The movie starts off a bit slow, to edge you into the movie, and sooner or later you'll be in love with all the surprises and events you didn't know could possibly happen in a Lego based movie. Overall, The Lego Movie is like the perfect animated movie to me."

Will Arnett is great as Batman, and Liam Neeson as BadCop/GoodCop was just epic. Also Charlie Day as Benny was brilliant and is the star of one of my favourite scenes in the movie (you'll know it when you see it). The rest of the cast are fantastic as well.\n\nLots of awesome cameos, including some unexpected (but still as awesome) ones.\n\nThe plot is simple, but that doesn't mean the movie is any less entertaining.\n\nOne of my favourite movies of all time and is still enjoyable on multiple viewings."

        "review_detailed_main": "Remember those times when you were a kid and used to make dramatic, action packed movies playing with your action figures and toys? Lego movie does just that, just much better than an 8 year old though. I'll put this right there, I am not a fan of Lego! I had a wannabe Lego set when I was young (Thank you, China!) and later on I did have my own authentic legos as well but I just couldn't get what all the hype was about. They started making video games on every other franchise out there and I never touched one and when the news came that these guys were upto making a full length animated Lego movie, I was rolling my eyes. So when it finally released, I thought to give it a shot. Well I couldn't possibly ignore the rave reviews, could I?\n\nFrom directors, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller who previously gave us the uproarious 21 Jump Street comes Lego Movie. I was in as soon as I heard these two names were attached with the Lego project. You also have to count Cloudy with a Chance of meatballs which was some pure entertainment for kids and adults alike. Lego Movie tells the story of Emmett who's a hapless construction worker, a nobody, who's taken on the ride of his lifetime when he stumbles on an artifact. Joining his adventure is the ravishing Wyldstyle and the wizard Vitruvius and spanning across a wide range of Lego universes. From DC Universe and Star Wars to Lord of The Rings and TMNT and then some more.\n\nBrilliant animation which is actually computer animated but made to look like its stop motion and has been maintained till end. I started searching if there were anything not made out of legos and I was surprised to find none, even the water, fire and smoke was made out of legos (There were of course some 'relics' which was obviously real world things). The 3rd act was what surprised me. And I liked the inclusion of\u0085.you know what? I'll let you have that surprise. It might not work for some but I am glad it did for me. And that inclusion made all the difference, it was that stroke of sheer genius that made Lego movie from being good to 'awesome'.\n\nBrilliantly voiced characters enlivens the screen and some big names are attached as well. From Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, to Will Farrel and Elizabeth Banks. You of course get Chris Pratts amazingly voiced lead Emmett and makes the character adorable and endearing. But the real show stealer? Batman. I laughed hard every other gag the Batman was involved, and all thanks to Will Arnett's perfect voice over.\n\nMy only qualm about the movie was that it would have been perfect in 2D, the me-too 3D feature kinda trampled the experience to some degree. In the end I am still am not a fan of the toys but I've convinced myself to become a fan of the franchise, both the games and movies. With splendidly written characters, fast paced and humorous narrative, and excellent voice overs, The Lego Movie promises truckloads of fun. It could have all been a 100 minute promotion for Lego, a huge ad for Lego considering the movie has squeezed in everything they could and what results is not a convoluted piece of junk but a good movie which offers true entertainment."

Wyldstyle is searching for relics and Emmet get stuck with one on his back. She rescues him thinking that he is the Special One.\n\nEmmet and Wildstyle are fine but the movie really gets fun when Batman and the rest join the movie. Unikitty is hilarious. Superman and Green Lantern are a great comedy duo. The only small minor complaint is that the visual style is very ADD. The Lego part of the movie could have some more scenes without movement. Sometimes the frenetic visual overwhelms the movie and the jokes. Slowing down some sections could improve the joke retention. It's a small problem. The movie is just good fun."

But, and here comes the big BUT: it's not ideal for a small child (which of course would be the ideal audience for LEGO).\n\nThe movie has SO MUCH going on, it's - as a reviewer mentioned before - overwhelming. They've put so much stuff (besides love for detail) in this movie, it's just packed with stuff. And this is the sad thing, apart from the very high speed with which all is going down. Every joke is living for just about 1 or 2 seconds max. Way too much to process for a child - and even I as an adult and movie buff had difficulties taking it all in.\n\nOf course, not alle references and jokes are intendend for the children but their parents, but it's just all too much. Maybe they thought that they only will get this one chance for a movie and HAD to squeeze it all in... But they should have stretched it to two movies and toned the speed way more down. It would have meant more fun and especially more time to take the lovingly made details all in.\n\nAnd they are plentiful. Let alone the LEGO-made water in the sea, it's so well made and hilarious to look at. And nearly everything else is just plain awesomeness. It looks, as mentioned by another reviewer, like a brickfilm on a big budget - they made it look absolutely perfect.\n\nSo sad that children below, let's say, 8 or 10 will have a hard time watching it. Otherwise: hat tip to the makers, it's very nice.\n\nOf course, Will Ferrell is a big bonus :-)"

For me, that source was The Lego Movie. Released in 2014, this animated film didn't just entertain me; it became a lifeline during a difficult period in my life. Through its message of creativity, individuality, and the power of teamwork, The Lego Movie rekindled my passion for life and provided the motivation I needed to overcome my struggles.\n\nDuring a particularly tough phase, I found myself feeling lost and unmotivated. The pressures of school, coupled with personal issues, weighed heavily on me. I felt like a mere cog in a machine, just following the routine without any real purpose or joy. It was during this time that I first watched The Lego Movie. Initially drawn in by its vibrant animation and catchy songs, I quickly discovered that it was much more than just a children's film; it was a profound exploration of identity and creativity.\n\nThe character of Emmet, an ordinary LEGO figure, resonated deeply with me. Emmet's journey from being a conformist to discovering his unique talents mirrored my own struggle to find my voice in a world that often stifles individuality. The film's message that everyone has the potential to be \"the Special\" inspired me to reassess my own abilities and passions. Watching Emmet embrace his creativity encouraged me to start exploring my interests outside of school, whether it was writing, art, or building with LEGO bricks.\n\nMoreover, the film emphasized the importance of collaboration and teamwork. As Emmet and his friends united to save their world, I began to realize the value of surrounding myself with supportive people. I reached out to friends and family, sharing my struggles and aspirations. This newfound sense of connection made me feel less isolated and more empowered. I joined a local club focused on creativity and teamwork, where I found a supportive community that echoed the film's message about the importance of working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nIn conclusion, The Lego Movie was more than just an enjoyable film for me; it was a catalyst for change. Its themes of creativity, individuality, and collaboration helped me rediscover my passions and connect with others. The lessons I learned from Emmet and his friends reminded me that life is about building, both literally and metaphorically. Today, I feel more alive and engaged, thanks to the inspiration I found in a simple animated film. Sometimes, it takes a colorful world made of plastic bricks to help us piece our own lives back together."

The animation is jaw-droppingly detailed, with each Lego piece meticulously animated to capture the playful spirit of the iconic toy. The story follows the journey of Emmet, an ordinary Lego figure who embarks on a hero's journey with a colorful cast of characters, including the hilarious Batman and the wise Vitruvius.\n\nThe humor is spot-on, with countless jokes that had me laughing out loud, from pop culture references to character quirks that never feel forced. The voice acting, especially from Chris Pratt and Will Arnett, is top-notch and gives life to each character, making them memorable and endearing.\n\nBut what really elevates \"The Lego Movie\" is its message about creativity and individuality. It's a rare film that reminds audiences of all ages about the importance of imagination and thinking outside the box, even while celebrating the joy of working together. This theme resonates deeply, especially in a world where we're often encouraged to \"follow the instructions.\"\n\nIf there's one minor drawback, it's that the frenetic pace and rapid-fire jokes might be a little overwhelming for some viewers, especially younger kids. But ultimately, that's a minor quibble in an otherwise fantastic movie experience. With clever writing, stunning visuals, and."

The cinematography and animations are beautiful but since it was made via CGCIs it's a bit hard to understand why they would want to make it look like it's stop-motion. As for the scenario, the story is well thought-out but goes maybe a bit all over the place \u2014 especially at the end \u2014, you barely could have handled even 15 minutes more. All in all, great success for this first opus about the Lego world."

With how it ended, it must get a sequel, which already happened before I wrote this review.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of this more comical Batman. I find Batman better when he's more serious.\n\nI find it is a good movie for younger audiences and ok for parents to possibly watch alongside their kids, or possibly by themselves.\n\nOverall, I find this movie good."

I could imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching before bedtime, possibly something along the lines of the child ingesting Strychnine and a bottle of No-Doze. The Lego Movie can be an exhausting film to watch, but more often than not, the film is charming enough without pandering to children. It does transcend its corporate shackles, in what could have easily been a feature length toy commercial in lesser hands, but Phil Lord and Christopher Miller give enough soul to this material. The film is a lot easier to enjoy on a visceral level, as these silly lego characters don't really engage and the voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit. While not exactly deep subversive satire, The Lego Movie does have just enough substance beneath all the noise."

He has to escape the attentions of the evil Lord Business who wants to end the universe and the good cop/bad cop who is tasked with finding him by Lord Business. He is helped along the way by Wyldstyle who recognises that he is the chosen one.\n\nThe movie is fast paced with loads of action and cameos by numerous faces from popular culture. I will not spoil the surprise by listing these, but the film is great fun from start to finish. I suspect the humour will appeal more to adults than children, but don;t have anything to back up this gut feel. Good fun!!"

While there are better humourous moments elsewhere in the film, it seems to miss opportunities to satirize our modern world. It seems to get close to doing so but then stops short.\n\nOne such example is the rightly named character President Business. He is so mean-spirited, narrow-minded, vicious, and bullying that he could easily have been modeled after certain political leaders of today. There were missed chances to show how such a character is destroying Earth's environment. Instead, the film seems more to follow a far-out science-fiction fantasy premise.\n\nI know I'm of the dissenting opinions here as the film is very popular with high critical acclaim. Still, I could only like \"The Lego Movie\" to a point. In any case, I did appreciate its message that \"ordinary\" people might be smarter than what most people would think."

It was a nice change of pace from the dramas we've been watching lately as this one is mostly animated Legos with voices from various celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Will Ferrell. Since Warner Bros. is the distributor, it shouldn't be a surprise that characters owned by them like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are depicted here though we shouldn't take them for the real thing since they're Lego-based ones. To tell the truth, I didn't find the whole thing hilarious but I was pretty amused throughout and the constant motion of the characters and many moving backgrounds was enough to entertain me and my friend. In summary, I liked The Lego Movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in this sort of thing."

Also it's very refreshing for the lego franchise to use all of the different models to include other franchises in their own way instead of just referencing other franchises.\n\nThis film is absolutely jam packed with very creative and colorful action. The set design is really well suited for animation and the animators did a great job bringing everything into a beautiful visual wonder. The things they do with water and smoke and how they use the lego format is just really fun to watch.\n\nThe jokes are often funny but don't hit every time, mostly things like the jokes with a certain reincorporated side character got tired but not annoying.\n\nThe overall meaning behind the film is also very sentimental and I like the way they tackle concepts in a way an adult can interpret and also enjoy.\n\nReally great family movie, and very enjoyable for pretty much any age.\n\nHigh 8/10."

The sheer imagination and endless possibilities involved were what made them so great and this movie showcases those aspects beautifully.\n\nIt's also a good story in general and includes some really good twists. Admittedly the final reveal and ending can seem a bit bizarre, but I could stomach it without any major problems and many of my friends absolutely loved how out there it was.\n\nFurthermore, the voice acting is topnotch, the trademark characters are utilized well and with lots of humour and the original characters fit well with them without being overshadowed. But the greatest part of all this are the visuals. Everything has been built out of Lego blocks. Everything. And everything even has the Lego logo on it, every block. It's mindblowing how much detail they've managed to squeeze in and how painstakingly accurate they try to remain. Enormous extra points just for that.\n\nThe Lego Movie is excellent movie for children and adults alike. Children will enjoy the characters and the visuals, while the adults can indulge in nostalgia and the surprisingly profound message."

I hadn't seen this movie since when it first came out in 2014 but now 9 years later rewatching it I realize that everything is really awesome.\n\nThis movie has minimal mistakes/miscalculations, production did a good job honestly.\n\nThe dialogue felt fluid, character interaction didn't feel force.\n\nThe pacing of the story fit in well with the overall tone of the story.\n\nCasting was great, Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman, etc.\n\nI'm sure that for the people who are big fans of legos, seeing all their favorite Lego characters and seeing all of the creativeness of the builds in the movie was really cool the first time around. What else can I say? It's a good movie, the kids back then loved it and the kid in me today enjoyed it. I've only just discovered that this had a sequel so I need to go and watch that one as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Let's take extra care to follow the instructions or you'll be put to sleep, and don't forget Taco Tuesday's coming next week.\"\n\nThe directors behind this very creative and imaginative animated film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street), deliver a highly entertaining and hilarious movie thanks to a sharp script which is packed with extremely funny lines and hundreds of pop culture references. It also benefits from a talented cast who do excellent voice work here. Despite being a film that promotes its very own Lego empire, it still works because it has lots of heart and reaches to kids and adults alike. Kids who are fans of the TV series Ninjago will have a great time with this film, while adults will love the witty script beside the fact that it will touch their nostalgic senses. The Lego movie took me back to my childhood days and reminded me of when I played with these building blocks and invented adventures as I played with them. In a way this film felt like I was watching a very smart and creative kid playing with his Lego figures. I can think of no other movie where you get so many pop cultural references as this one. In what other film do you get to see an NBA star like Shaq share a scene with a Ninja Turtle, Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Wonder Woman all together? These character cameos keep on coming throughout the film with silly but hilarious and witty one-liners.\n\nEmmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary Lego mini-figure who is content with his life following orders from Lord Business (Will Ferrell) as well as most of the other citizens. What they don't know is that Lord Business is planning on gluing their universe together. When Emmet stumbles across a mysterious block he is mistakenly identified as the chosen one and considered to be one of the MasterBuilders called to save the world. He is drafted by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and is introduced to the different Lego universes that Lord Business has been keeping separated. He teams up with other MasterBuilders like Batman (Will Arnett), Unikitty (Alison Brie), Metal Beard (Nick Offerman), and several others all led by the old wise man Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Together they begin a quest to stop Lord Business from destroying their worlds, but they have to face fierce opposition from Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and the rest of the police force who serve Lord Business. A task which Emmet isn't really prepared for as he is simply an ordinary mini figure, but who everyone is depending on to save the world.\n\nThe plot is a little over the top and silly, but it works thanks to some great gags and witty dialogues. The script writers, Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, Lord, and Miller know their pop culture references and use it to their advantage. It took me a while to get used to the animation style as it was done by using Lego figures in stop motion and combing it with CGI effects. They did paint a colorful and imaginative world and soon I was won over by the style of the film. It's a fast paced movie and one that you will probably have no problem in wanting to go back and rewatching it considering the jokes are so fast paced that you might have missed lots of them."

If I had been in the position to go out and buy some Lego after watching it myself, I would definitely have done so...\n\nNote to the editors: If there is anything lacking or inadvisable in this, please please do not blacklist me, rather can the review and if possible let me know if and what..."

So I was a bit stressed when I sat down. The fact that the opening of the movie was very fast paced and there were so much happening at once did not help my mood. However, the humour kicked in quickly and each one made me at least chuckle. The story eventually slowed down (a little) and I was finally able to fully enjoy this movie.\n\nIt's indeed worthy of its praise: the pop-culture references are of good taste, the humour is excellent, the visuals (though hard to keep track of) are amazing. Even if the movie is fast paced, this is LEGO after all. Having the characters build something slowly than what you see in the commercials would not be LEGO. It's not my favourite movie but I am glad I saw it, and will definitely see it again. Beware: the theme song is very catchy."

This film tries to manufacture emotional depth without actually having any - kind of an example of the main problem, which is that just by wishing they made a movie with real meaning it could be so. Toy Story and Up and so many other movies actually HAVE emotional depth and real feeling, and the contrast highlights that this facsimile is using pure manipulation. And kids know the difference - my ten year old daughter left shaking her head at the end and wondering what had gone wrong and why we didn't just go see Frozen again, which would have been a better idea."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie. Everything. Genuinely everything. Every single little thing is awesome. The ultimate product placement movie instead becomes the ultimate 2014 blockbuster, as a likable but unremarkable construction Lego mini figure tries to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. The only 2014 movie I have seen more than once at the time of writing, TLM held up remarkably well. Some may find it annoying possibly, but for most you'll have to remove that grin from your face with a crowbar. It looks great and could have been stop motion Lego. The CGI is barely noticeable. It's also got an astonishingly good cast all giving fine performances. Even Morgan Freeman is in there. The action, humour and emotion is all spot on. The film is full of white knuckle action, gut bursting jokes and surprisingly thoughtful story lines which make it overall a very entertaining and rich animated offering for everyone. You don't even have to like Lego.\n\nThe key to movie success is the script. The script is brilliantly written here and absolutely crackles with wit and charm. It's also got some very thrilling moments and pop culture references galore. It's surely one of the funniest movies of the year and although the jokes are simple they're always devastatingly effective. The characters are very diverse and likable as well, and enhance the film's likability factor which is already off the scale. As it has some very nice messages in there too, it's a surprisingly touching film and the ending is unpredictable and moving. Another key element of the film's success is creating a compelling fictional universe for the film which is full of entertaining details. As for the Everything Is Awesome song, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. TLM is a great blockbuster overall which should have been terrible but is instead a total knockout. Outshining everything DreamWorks has ever done by a mile this might be the most fun you have at the movies in 2014.\n\n10/10"

The story, the animation, the cast, the characters, the humor, it was a thrill ride. It's definitely a good film to kick of 2014, and is one that you definitely don't want to miss. You could tell that they went all out on this. It's one thing to make stop motion in general, but doing with Lego and making it that good is just impressive. And let's not forget the strong cast which includes Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrel, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, and numerous cameos including Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Shaq among many others. But probably the best thing about the movie was it's sense of humor. Though the first 10 minutes was quite boring and seemed like a typical animated film, the film spiraled high after wards and will keep you laughing all the way through. All of the cast members like Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman who you would never expect to do something comedic gave it there all here, and that only made it 10x funnier. But if there's' some thing I didn't like about the movie, it would have to be the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there's this little twist in the end that was quite un-expecting, but a bit unnecessary. With all honesty though, the ending wasn't that bad, and some of you may even like it. Overall, The Lego Movie\" is a great movie that' sun for all ages."

But every now and then there is one that stands out and i feel inclined to go see it. From the trailer it was apparent that \"Lego Movie\" was going to be one of those stand out films. From the get go It showed quick witted quirky humor; catering to both the young and the older audience. It is funny, plain and simple. It mixes silly comedy with well thought out wit and the timing is at points impeccable. The story is that of a usual animated film; an underdog overcomes his mundane , mediocre life to become a hero. It's a standard plot in most animated films. But this brings a sharpness to it that others don't. The time breezes past and you can't help but enjoy it. And the visuals? Well they excellent and add to the enjoyment.\n\nA great film where the only disappointment was the 2 devilish children to my right. One of which didn't seem to grasp the concept of their juice being finished and continued to suck on the straw anyway. The other feeling inclined to stomp his feet throughout....ah the joys of children eh?\n\nThose two demons aside it was a very good film - 7.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Most people would ridicule considering it to be a children movie just like what happened with Toy Story. Those who are still child in curiosity will in some way or the other end up watching this movie. From the makers of The Lego, the classic plastic toy known for it's brick type models for children fun fair, the story is a mere fairy tale. The movie starts with a bossy, arrogant politician President Business who snatches away the Kragle from Vitrivius, the foreseer. Kragle, the most powerful device capable of destroying the entire universe is taken away. Vitrivius says a prophet and falls down from a cliff that a simple man will come and take the Power of Resistance from underground and protect all evil. Later after 8 and 1/2 years Emmet, a simple constructer worker who turns out to be a super hero is all about the movie. He is portrayed in the form a normal man who is not envied or amused by his colleagues or neighbours, living in loneliness. He ends up capturing the Power of Resistance from underground earth accidentally onto his back as he tumbles at his work place. He is adored by Girl friend of Batman but she ends in dismay about the lack of spirit in Emmet. All but the following events of ridicule and exaggeration of people and super stars like, Batman, He Man, Super Man, Ninja, Power Rangers, Transformers and many more, who are keen about saving the universe are devastated with Emmet to be believed as a saviour. In the ending Emmet's life takes a major turn as he saves the entire universe from destruction by sacrificing his own life by disconnecting a detonator primed on the Power of Resistance which is stuck on his body, by jumping down through a time warp. The movie gradually jumps to a wake up scene of Emmet who sees real life humans in the surroundings. He sees a table on which the entire set up of his world is there made purely out of Lego Toys and that he is also a toy. The toy role of Emmet is an imaginary character played by a boy who is 10 year old probably and is using the business place of his dad, who seems to be working as a construction business man or something. The dad asks his son to stop playing everything right away and picks Emmet from the home table and puts him on another table thereby making him unable to save his friends at misery with President Business who is freezing all the world with the help of bad police as his force of destruction. The movie is shown on a perspective of the boy who explains dad that he must not destroy what he made. His dad talks to his son. In the movie this dialogue is between President and Emmet. Now that President is Dad and Emmet is the boy. With a very pleasing end, the movie comes to a nice closing of how much humans sabotage for mere greed.\n\nThe movie is definitely worth watch. For it is not for kids fun alone, but carries a rich message for grown ups and society.\n\nThe connection between the imagination of the boy playing Lego and the Lego world in which we travel is really well knit.\n\nWith a little bit of boring sensations in the middle, the movie is far amazing to watch till climax. It is overall a treat for fun and entertainment. Go Lego! I give you a 8.5 out of 10. Amazing!!\n\nLove and Care,\n\nNaren Pillai,\n\n15/03/2014."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego company is a toy company that has truly stood the test of time. Not only by staying ahead of its competition, but by also being able to adapt and stretch itself across the entire board of the toy-making domain. Think about it, how many franchises are out there that the Lego company has fed off of and co-produced a series of toys after? Numerous, too many to count. Anyone who's a Lego fan will enjoy this movie. There are lots to find entertaining from its design, creative story, action and characters.\n\nThe story is about the everyday Lego man named Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt). A construction worker who lives his life by the book. Literally, a Lego construction book. And like any other day, his day goes just fine until he makes a discovery that turns his life upside down. The discovery involves a special fragment that could save the Lego universe. Little does Emmet realize is that the world he lives in is a set-up (no pun intended), where a ruler called President Business (Will Ferrell) is a chronic perfectionist who longs to hold a structured order to the Lego universe. And the story only gets more creative from there, partially because of the characters involved. Accompanying Emmet in his journeys is Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who makes sure Emmet doesn't lose his head and saves him whenever possible. Then there's also the head master known as Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) who gives some very funny scenes.\n\nBut the one character who steals the screen the most is Batman (Will Arnett). There are just too many scenes to count where Batman has a line that makes every intended funny scene even more genuinely funny. There's even a Lego spaceman that I can only imagine any person who played with Legos must have had at one point in their life. But that's not all, there are even more cameos than one could count, most of which viewers saw in the upcoming trailers to this movie. They all have their own special parts. Even the bad guys are memorable. President Business had good scenes and his henchman labeled as Bad Cop / Good Cop (Liam Neeson) is one heck of a character. In a way, the character reminded me of Man- E-Faces from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983).\n\nWhat really helps make this movie funny though is the mix of a clever, imaginative story that blends in great with its respective animation. The story was created by Kevin and Dan Hagemen who also worked as writers for the Lego TV series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011) and Hotel Transylvania (2012) which also was a very entertaining animated family feature. But the reason why their writing works so well is because of the animation. Kudos to the animation department because they did an amazing job by sticking to what Ray Harryhausen would do - stop motion animation. By using the physical Lego pieces and not CGI, helped limit the characters movements making them funnier to watch. Yes it is apparent when the CGI kicks in but boy oh boy do the animators get creative with how the Lego pieces make up every single thing you could imagine of. Plus, isn't that kind of the whole thing behind Legos? It's also the moral to the story, where Legos were created for people to get creative with.\n\nFinally let's not forget action and music, it is one sweet ride. Much of the action scenes are fast paced, include quick wit dialog and some intense scenes as well. Helping that of course is composer Mark Mothersbaugh's score. It has every single kind of the emotion you would want. Hopefully it will be released for the film score collectors to enjoy too. There's even a theme for the movie even though it's not from the score, that is the song \"Everything Is Awesome\". It's a very catchy and bumpy song that'll want to make one get up and dance. I did not see one thing to pick about which is rare.\n\nThis is one epic Lego film. Every element to the film works great, thanks to its well written screenplay, comic relief given by its voice actors, entertaining action sequences, memorable characters and old fashioned animation."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, read the upcoming phrase carefully, because it might come as a bit of a shock.\n\nThe Lego Movie is the best animated film, and the best overall family film since 2010's Toy Story 3.\n\nPick up your jaw, and hear me out. The Lego Movie screams, embellishes, breathes creativity, heart, and soul that has been lacking severely in most animated movies in recent years. It is a skillfully directed movie that has so much detail you might need multiple viewings to catch all the fun. This movie hits on every single aspect of filmmaking, and took everything that worked on the Disney Renaissance and the Pre-Cars 2 Pixar era and gave it a nice whimsical spin thanks to the concept of the building block toys that stand out in American culture.\n\nWhere do I start? The Lego Movie is the perfect blend of kids, adult, and nostalgic entertainment that will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen regardless of age. Whether it's the fun, joyful sounds and colors and visual jokes that will make the kids happy, or all the fun subtle pop culture and nostalgic jabs that will entertain adults, there is something for anyone involved. The animation was astounding and easily has some of the best meticulous visuals since Ratatouille.\n\nThe best kinds of stories for animated movies are those that start out simple for the tykes, but secretly contain layers of content for the more established minds. This is what made your earlier Pixar movies so appealing for a vast audience; it never talks down to the viewer but doesn't overwhelm the kiddies. In The Lego Movie, what starts out as a simple tale about a prophesy defeating a tyrannical villain from taking over the environment morphs into a beautiful story about finding your voice and being original.\n\nLike previously stated, all aspects of this movie work. The voice acting was phenomenal, especially Elizabeth Banks as the lead female, Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman (he does a better Batman than Christian Bale\u2014seriously). The musical score was on-point, the humor and action run plentiful, and there's plenty of heart and soul that will tug the heartstrings. Just wait until you arrive at the final act. Unlike practically every movie nowadays, you won't see it coming.\n\nIt might be hard to believe that a movie with serious marketing and product placement implications becomes the best around since this past summer with Before Midnight. It might be even harder to believe that Warner Brothers has managed to surpass the usual suspects of Pixar (notice all the movies I've referenced in the review) and Dreamworks at their very own game. Nonetheless, this shocker of a gem is the perfect family cinematic package. From top to bottom The Lego Movie delivers. If this isn't one of the best films of 2014, then we are in for a spectacular year of cinema because this movie is seriously a work of kinetic brilliance.\n\nRecommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are."

In the lego movie, we see the best of legos, we see lego as we've never seen it before...it's the closest thing to being a lego.\n\nPersonally I hate animation but I gave this movie a chance as it has all my favourite characters (batman, superman, Gandalf and even Dumbledore) at first the movie seemed boring and full of clich\u00e9s and it felt awkward watching 1.5 hours of stop motion, but as the movie progresses it seems to grow to the viewer, it got my full concentration after the first 20 minutes, and the movie became great.\n\nThe directing in the lego movie was amazing I loved it, it made the movie seem like a big budget epic, and really helped me in understating the story.\n\nThe lego movie's story was very average and very generic at first, all that \"believe in your self\" clich\u00e9 but as the movie progresses the story really stands out, even though the message is very common amongst animation movies, the lego movie seems to pull it off, adding excellent elements and a lot of humour...I mean A LOOOT!\n\nThe voice actors are of coarse amazing, Chris Prat was perfect as Emit, and Elizabeth Banks was great at WyldStyle, and Will Ferrel was brilliant as always, one thing I did not like was Will Arnett's batman voice, it just wasn't batman.\n\nOverall The Lego Movie is a great film, it was OK at first but it gets much better towards the end."

        "review_detailed_main": "In The Birds by Aristophanes (414BC), Mr. Trusting and Mr. Hopeful erect a perfect city in the clouds, to be named Cloud Cuckoo Land -- an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The Birds (414BC) is described by critics as a \"perfectly realized fantasy remarkable for the gaiety of its songs\".\n\nScratch the surface, and there is darkness underneath.\n\nThis is also an underlying theme of The Lego Movie. In the opening, main character Emmitt sees a TV show where the president lets on that the world will end in three days. And then everyone goes back to being happy, as the costs of everything go up, and all the jokes and songs are repeated. Everyone follows instructions.\n\nLater, Emmitt is interrogated by \"Bad Cop\" -- and occasionally reassured by \"Good Cop\". While the Good Cop makes everything seem okay and perfect, the Bad Cop is never far away.\n\nLater, they go to Cloud Cuckoo Land (!), \"a land up in the clouds where there are no rules, no limits, no bushy mustaches and no bedtimes.\" There they meet Princess Unikitty, who has no negative thoughts. Wyldstyle remarks on how often she says \"No\" in the place with no rules.\n\nLater still, there is a wonderful place, but with signs saying \"Do Not Touch\" and \"Off Limits\" everywhere.\n\n--- and I'll stop Lego Movie = Greek Comedy there ---\n\nThis is one of those movies with a lot of layers. I wondered how I would describe the movie. Action Thriller? Superhero? Love Story? Horror? Comedy? Tragedy? Sci-Fi? Fantasy? Western? Cataclysm? I thought about how I could argue the case for any of these.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the zippy, intense, manic drive of the movie, and liked many of the jokes -- but also frequently saw the underlying darkness that was being hinted at. Well, perhaps not hinted -- many of the references were blatant, but maybe they expect that most people will be distracted by the action and not try to process something important, just like Emmitt at the start of the movie.\n\nFun and exciting, but underneath, it's like Batman, where everything is dark."

There are no dull bits or boring bits in it at all. i think it's epic how they put in Lego city, Lego star wars and loads more! This film I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone.

We only wished the film was a bit longer because my three kids couldn't get enough of it but I suppose that was for the better as it leaves room for more in the future. The Lego Movie is a bit reminiscent of a childhood cartoon I used to watch called \"GoBots\" where my favorite character or hero was sort of the weak link of the bunch. In all, Lego Movie was fun for ages 5 to 80 and the marketing has been off the wall! I give this movie a 9 out of 10 simply because the \"Awesome\" song was sung in the car all the way home."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie finally arrived in Australian cinemas last week, so I took the chance to see it since having so much high-anticipation since reading IMDb user reviews and the hype it had! I can admit that this was indeed a fun movie to see!\n\nThe storyline here is obviously children aimed, but I was surprised that so many adults my age and older were interested in this, it felt like too it was aimed at both children and adults. It had humor, imagination, moral and even heart in its tale, delivering a strong feel good feeling of who who we are and what we are capable of.\n\nAnimation is a major feature in The Lego Movie and I can admit that it was astoundingly achieved by Australian visual effects company Animal Logic (the creative team behind Happy Feet 1 and 2). So much detail and thought was given into the Lego universes featured in the film, it gives a strong sense of what the imagination from the mind can do! The 3D itself gave an amazing sight to behold this amazing Lego world, sure hope in future that Animal Logic wins awards for their hard-earned work (and maybe even Best Animated Film in the 2015 Academy Awards).\n\nOverall, an exciting move that takes fun to a whole new level in terms of story, film-making and even genre. Can't wait for the Blu Ray release later this year and the already confirmed sequel in the future."

Having grown up with Lego through the 70's & 80's and liking nerdy things (Star Wars, Super Heroes and fantasy/Dundeons & Dragons), this movie was just pure awesomeness . Along with the nerd-fest, the CGI (computer graphics) actually looks more like old school stop-start motion animation. To be honest, I have grown to hate CGI. It is over used and has a certain cheap look to it. The animation based company that did the animations in this film have achieved perfection here by making the movie look like stop-start motion animation and creating a sense that the Lego is real. A big thumbs up to the Australian CGI company that was hired for this job. Oh yeah, the Star Wars scene was awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie is something of a miracle. It rushes along at breakneck speed, zipping through gag after gag as if its creative and smart visuals would tire the eyes. The movie builds upon itself unceasingly, aware of its nature as what is essentially a feature- length commercial for Lego and blasting through that bar in a burst of color and wit. It will bring parents delighted relief, children unbridled joy at watching their imaginations interpreted and expanded onto the big screen. It makes regular use of the far- reaching trademarks of its brand for good and consistent reason. And wouldn't you know, there lies a touch of heart within its blocky exterior. It's better than Wreck-It Ralph; it's lighter on its feet than Toy Story. Everything is indeed quite Awesome. You will see what I mean.\n\nThe film is a majestic hybrid of two distinct comic presences: the directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller had previously churned out the manic Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, while co-director Chris McKay is known for the animated sketch comedy show Robot Chicken. Assemblies of different presences helming a single project have oft been the cause of a film's shortcomings, as voices struggle to meld harmoniously while making themselves heard over the others' rabble. Judging from the way this movie glides through the entirety of its running time, the three could be an a cappella group.\n\nThe story sets its sights on one particular character in its collection: a construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt), who is so unremarkable that a wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) prophesied that he would one day become the Special and save all of Legokind from the clutches of Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his superweapon, the Kragle. This is to be accomplished by obtaining the Piece of Resistance through a quest that spans so many different Lego worlds and setpieces it would make children's overclocked imaginations whirl. Stop me if all this sounds a little like one of those adventures you would have with your Lego set, giving things fantastical names and generating countless scenarios through a process transcending convenience.\n\nI'm getting ahead of myself. You see, Lord Business has seized control of the world and monotonized and streamlined the lives of his adoring citizens without their noticing his despotic presence all about their cities, from their strictly unvarying 9 to 5 (each person comes with an instruction manual on How To Live Your Life) to the absurdly overcharged coffee. Out of all the children's movies to have nailed the social commentary on commercialism (and conformity) so expertly, it's one that indulges in it under the table. The snag is that it works; Hollywood could take notes from this, \"the best way to sell is to make a good product.\"\n\nTo probe further is to get in too deep, and really, I've revealed all the necessities. The Special is to be aided in his quest by a legion of Master Builders, some of whom are a spunky female fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a magical hybrid animal named UniKitty (Alison Brie), a 1980s space astronaut referred to as \"1980s space guy\" (Charlie Day), Superman (Channing Tatum), MetalBeard the pirate (Nick Offerman), and Batman (Will Arnett). Batman steals pretty much every scene he is in, which is faint praise in this case considering that this movie is a continuous frenzy of characters stealing scenes from everyone else.\n\nThis also goes for Business's top henchman, a two-faced cop that's played by Liam Neeson with an Irish snarl that's impossible not to appreciate. Apart from the accent, his particular feature is- oh, I've already said.\n\nWhat haven't I said already. The animation is damn impressive, as everything on-screen is convincingly modeled after Lego pieces \u2013 to the point that it never lets out where the CGI ends and where traditional hand-based animation, if employed, starts. There must have been parts involving actual Lego pieces crafted by hand; the attention to detail is too great, and the movie is too meticulous. At any rate, it makes for action sequences that leave you breathless from absurd momentum. There are parts that resemble the segments in those commercials where children construct Lego models through jacked frame rates. The hands are absent, but the tempo remains.\n\nIf you are seeing this with children, God be with you. I am writing this a week after having seen it in a packed theater of young and old, and I am still vibrating from the residual energy the movie has left me with. It is an enduring experience. I feel as if I have taken a glimpse into the future of merchandising cinema. And I have no complaints."

Even when the pace is awesome for the most part, the slow parts where they develop the characters and story still felt a bit too boring. Understandable because the targets are the little kids, but for some reason the last act gets so predictable in every sense and sooooo family friendly or more kid friendly that my real enjoyment ends basically 30' before the credits (with some fun stuff in between of course, including the action), which is too much time to give it a bigger score, considering plenty of other movies for kids have me from the start with no problem."

I know the Lego franchise has gone waayy beyond expectations with the toys, models and gaming industry (Lego Harry Potter, Lego Star Wars etc etc), but a Lego film I never thought would work, and if one was released, it would be so childish I would never lay eyes on it...... How wrong could I be, as this film could easily have just made it in AT LEAST my top 50 of all time.\n\nFirst of all, this film will probably only appeal to so many friends, unless you're all super perfectly in sync with another. I saw this tonight with 3 other people, and only 1, as well as myself were laughing throughout, the other 2, didn't get any of the humour at all. The humour is witty, very immature in places, but perfectly timed. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUOTE THE FILM FOREVER FILMS!\n\nHowever as funny as this film is, and as much as I have already quoted Batman in the past 2 hours since seeing the film, it's not the humour that has pushed this film waaaaay beyond expectations. Without giving too much away, this film has a really deep back story, and a massive surprise towards the end with the story entering a world that I never thought would exist in the film, and it really did help explain why the film was as random as it was, and just brought everything together. Kudos Lego Movie, Kudos.\n\nCan not wait to add this to my blu ray collection (the film is stunning)."

This is especially remarkable when you consider what it is. Whoever heard of a movie based on a toy (that has no actual story associated with it) being good?\n\nDirectors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have previous on this, though. Their first movie was Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, which is as goofy a title as I can remember, and no more than a one-gag set-up to boot... and yet they imbued it with a surreal humour that attracted audiences. Then they revived 80s TV series 21 Jump Street, and the record for that kind of adaptation is very patchy at best, but they pulled that round too.\n\nLord and Miller seem to have their finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist. Supported by a genius idea for an underlying theme, The Lego Movie looks stunning too. The graphics are impressively composed entirely from Lego blocks genuinely available to the public, assembled into whole scenes and settings. The animators took the opportunity to throw in a million blink-and-miss-it sight gags, in a remarkable show of attention detail.\n\nI have to say that, in contradiction to other views I have heard, I found the song 'Everything is Awesome' by Tegan and Sara, which is a prominent part of the film, to be annoying but catchy rather than actually good, although that is still a credit to T&S because that is the role of the song in the film. It is improved by the comedic rapping of The Lonely Island in the full extended version, heard over the end credits.\n\nA host of star names, both playing their most famous characters and playing other characters of note, enliven the proceedings. This is appropriate, given that the Lego franchise's recent revival has been built on adapting iconic series such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman into games using the Lego block style.\n\nA sequel seems inevitable, and I hope it is still this good, now that they have the weight of expectation on them.\n\nFor my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"

The start of the movie could almost be seen as a satire of life in modern China; the romantic subplot (the figurine fancied by the hero turns out to already have a boyfriend - Bat-man - who takes some beating) seems truer to life than most romantic comedies. The presence of Bat-man is just one of many ways the film exploits the vast range of Lego figurines now available, from the ordinary to the iconic - and the film's ultimate message, that ordinary should not mean anonymous, is also a softened version of the naked positivity usually found in American kids' films. What the film lacks is the wonderful reflective pace of 'WALL-E'; it's perpetually noisy and busy, holding the attention of the younger half of its intended audience with a whirligig of flying bricks. For me, it was a little too frenetic to be truly awesome, and of course it's all advertising for the product, but it transcends its modest premise by some margin."

And do you know what? It made me want to go out and do just that.\n\nThe film follows Emmett, (Chris Pratt) a construction worker who fits in perfectly with the LEGO world around him - he fits in so well, in fact, that he is never noticed by anyone, until one day he accidentally stumbles upon an ancient artifact, naming him 'The Special.' We then follow Emmett into a web of conspiracy and strange characters such as Wyldstyle, (Elizabeth Banks) Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and Benny (Charlie Day) as he teaches the world to be creative, and with a fantastic third act that will definitely catch some viewers off-guard, and others will see coming a few 2x4 red bricks away.\n\nThe pacing is very fast, which is a little annoying for the first 10-20 minutes, but after that you really get into the groove, and it feels awesome. The voicing is also a little quiet against the background music, but i can cope. Morgan Freeman made it all okay.\n\nThis is definitely one of the better 'kids' films I've seen in the past few months - and not just kids will like it, the parents will love it too. GO. SEE. THIS.

I think the movie deserves props for its CGI, creative visual imagination, pop culture characterizations and voice work. But I felt they overreached trying to turn \"You Are Special\" into a transformative moral and I found the cutesy factor wore thin as the movie dragged on. I watched this in preparation for its sequel, which opens later today, to see if it would be worth seeing in a theatre. It fell a little flat for me and there was nothing there to interest me in a sequel. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Adventure Animation}"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had little interest in seeing The Lego Movie until I heard Mark Kermode's verdict in his blog about Liam Neeson. Even then it wasn't enough to make me buy a ticket. It took Roocayke, the nephew who last month subjected me to Walking With Dinosaurs 3D, to force me into it. Would this be two strikes against him or could he earn a redemption?\n\nEmmet (Chris Pratt) is a bog standard, Lego mini-figure construction worker who smiles, sings, follows instructions and is completely unremarkable until he is mistaken for the Master Builder, the chosen one, who will fulfill an ancient prophesy, find the Piece of Resistance and thwart the evil plan of the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Accompanied by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and her egotistical, vain boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet journeys through every conceivable Lego theme in its universe on a mission to save their world from being glued together, and of personal discovery.\n\nWithout doubt, The Lego Movie is a fantastic merchandising film. It is one long, feature length video catalogue that you can be thankful was released in the spring rather than prior to Christmas. But whereas The Internship was just a horrible, humourless Google commercial, The Lego Movie is a clever idea that entertains first and foremost. Oh, it's far less subtle than the product placement of Toy Story but you won't emerge feeling bludgeoned by the marketing bods.\n\nThe plot is simple enough for the youngsters to follow but there is little time for boredom as the screen is constantly filled with action and movement and the dialogue rattles along with little time to reflect on the gags as they whiz by. As you'd expect, the scenery is beautifully constructed with Lego, the model numbers of bricks and components tumbling across the screen like Sherlock's (the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch incarnation) thoughts.\n\nThe Lego Movie's 100 minute running time is perhaps too generous for the plot and its demographic, and there were too few children's giggles and too many shuffling bums but, if Roocayke was anything to go by, it will be a big hit with the under tens and an acceptable movie for the parents to enjoy rather the endure, as is more often the case. There are plenty of gags, references and in-jokes that sail over the youngsters' heads to entertain the adults and, though there is nothing to make us laugh out loud, The Lego Movie contains plenty to amuse.\n\nThe vocal talent, too, will be of little interest to the kiddies but there is an impressive roster of stars having fun including half the cast of Star Wars and, in the battle of the scene thieves, Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius) narrowly beaten by Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop. Add to that Alison Brie, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum...\n\nThe Lego Movie is no Fankenweenie but it is a lot of fun. Just ask Roocayke. In amongst the gabble of enthusiasm that accompanied us home were two gems:\n\n\"I really liked the lady (Wyldstyle) but I don't want to marry her.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Uncle Yed, I seriously want to see that again!\"\n\nThe Lego Movie is not quite a joy, though it's certainly a pleasure. But be warned, it contains the nastiest brainworm on the big screen so far this year. It's a marketer's dream but an accompanying uncle's nightmare! Trust me on this: the drive home is a painful experience with a six-year old singing non-stop Everything is Awesome!\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

It was moderately enjoyable for our kids, but I think younger kids would enjoy it more. It was boring. In fact, my husband nearly fell asleep.

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Lego Movie' is exactly what you expect, but also at the same time, something unexpected. It's a bright, fast-paced, well-intentioned kids' film, but it also has quite a few genuine laughs and touching moments - not that they're out of place, just that they add some levity to the story, which sometimes does get a little too \"meta\" for it's own good.\n\nThe storyline is quite straightforward - ordinary guy gets thrust into an adventure to save the Universe, defeat the bad guy (Ferrell) and find love, even though he's \"normal\" - obviously, it turns out everyone's \"Special\"/unique, not just those that are prominent. What makes it stand out is how they've taken something we all know & love - I doubt anyone born in the last 40 years hasn't played with Lego as a kid - and translated it to a living world. We get to see this through Emmet (Pratt)'s eyes and it's pretty funny how they integrate corporate America - coffee, music & TV shows - into this Lego world. And it's great how the Lego looks real and only animated to move facial effects - and the animated water is great. My favourite bit was seeing Ben the 'generic 80's astronaut' (Charlie Day) - and his enthusiasm for building spaceships - who even had an authentic helmet crack where the chin strap always broke! I remember building weird spaceships for him.\n\nOne of my main issues is that they've gone to such great effort to animate this world, but then they fly through most of it so quickly that you don't actually get a chance to appreciate it all! Thanks to being a Warner Brothers film, we get the benefit of seeing DC characters - Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern (a great sub-plot with these two!), and especially, Batman. The casting of Will Arnett as Batman is genius - his gravelly voice perfectly suited, as well as his comic timing. The ending - combining live action with the animation actually works - is pretty good and wraps everything up nicely, while also making you care for some of these characters, even if they're little yellow blocks!"

So, I decided to give this movie a chance and could not have been more impressed. Yes, it is funny but the thing that is incredible is the visual effects. It did something that few have done before but it was the first to do it successfully.\n\nYou do not have to be a four year old to enjoy this. The Lego Movie is something that we all can appreciate. The plot was somewhat clich\u00e9 but the way it turns towards the end and gives itself a new direction is really impressive and definitely separates itself from other films of its category. T he visual effects were the thing to talk about. It takes a second to get use to but once you do, you become entranced in the world of legos. Also the way they so quickly build legos like it is a video game and putting it on the screen is stunning.\n\nThe decision to make all of the characters from famous lego sets as characters in the movie was very amusing and the only thing that might have did wrong is not having Harry Potter in it. The rest though such as: Batman, Abe Lincoln, Green Lantern, Superman, etc... all did great job in adding something to the plot.\n\nAs far as voices go for movies, the Lego Movie did exceptionally well. Then again, with Morgan Freeman being a voice in a movie, it is hard to go wrong. The rest of the cast: Chris Pratt (Emitt), Elizabeth Banks(Wild Style), and Will Arnet(Batman) all did amazing well and I believe the movie would not have been as good with them.\n\nBasically, The Lego Movie is a great choice to go see at the movies and will no doubt be in the line up for the Oscars next year.\n\nFor more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "This very amusing and imaginative film from the makers of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs absolutely delighted the children in our auditorium, to the point where one kid cried out, \"This is the best film EVER!\" I wouldn't go that far, but in the afterglow of Pixar's Golden Age, it's definitely one of the better ones.\n\nThe plot concerns Emmet Brickowski, an everyman (voiced by Chris Pratt) \u2013 everyfigure? \u2013 thrust into the role of \"Master Builder\", on a quest to vanquish the dastardly Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Business, president of Octan Corporation and the world, intends to glue everyone in their place. Emmet and his crew are out to stop him through the power of ideas \u2013 e.g. building and re-building stuff. It's a modern American story, initially about individualism and entrepreneurism, and later about cooperation; sort of an anti-superhero film, with a light subversive streak.\n\nThe plot is fairly generic, but there are numerous surreal interludes throughout the film. Mostly these are enjoyable (I loved the visual allusion to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but there are certain 'fourth wall' scenes toward the end of the film that I found a bit sinister. I mean, obviously the film is an advert for Lego, but is there really a need to make the marketing so manipulative? The \"Man Upstairs\" scenes unashamedly employ soft-focus sentimentality to associate the product directly with parental love. Obviously young kids aren't going to care much about the ideological use of marketing, but I think the otherwise perfectly laudable message of the film was enough without these overwrought scenes.\n\nNow, back to the good stuff.\n\nI don't know what methods were used to create the look of The Lego Movie, and now I've seen it I don't want to know. It may be all CG, but it has the look of stop-motion. It has a charming jerky grace which is unique in modern mainstream animation. The action scenes are frame-hoppingly chaotic, but I think this works nicely, capturing the way that children arrange their toys in tableaux (although they probably wouldn't use the word \"tableaux\").\n\nIn the main role, Pratt plays the part with dorky charm, while Ferrell channels his best Mugato as the villain. Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are on rare loose form as Vitruvius and Bad Cop/Good Cop respectively. My personal favourite is Batman, played by Will Arnett as a bitter, self-absorbed bully.\n\nProduct tie-ins could well be the shape of things to come, and if they can always be this smart and funny then I say bring them on. Manufacturers have made toys based on films for decades. This time it's simply being done the other way around \u2013 and it proves that the result needn't be Transformers."

He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The masterbuilders can only count on the \"Special,\" a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.\n\nThe Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or capitalist system, in order to \"expose\" it.\n\nIn the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain is \"Lord Business.\" After all, there are barely any better capitalist ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.\n\nNonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a boring infomercial for Legos.\n\nThe problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the way to the bank."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie is a movie about, plainly speaking, Legos. When President Business(Will Ferell), threatens to glue the Lego universe together using an adhesive called Kragle, it is up to the 'MasterBuilder', Emmet Brickowoski(Chris Pratt) to stop him using the Piece of Resistance. Emmett is helped by other MasterBuilders like, Wyldstyle/Lucy(Elizabeth Banks), Batman(Will Arnett), Unikitty(Alison Brie), Benny(Charlie Day), Abraham Lincoln(Will Forte), Wally(Dave Franco), the all-knowing Vitrivius(Morgan Freeman), Superman(Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman(Cobie Smulders), Green Lantern(Jonah Hill), Barry(Jake Johnson), Shaq(Shaquille O'Neal), Metal Beard(Nick Offerman) & Shakespeare(Jorma Taccone). The only problem is, Emmett has never had an original idea throughout his life. Also, standing in the MasterBuilders' way is President Business, Bad Cop/Good Cop(Liam Neeson) & the president's various robotic lackeys.\n\nThe Lego Movie is mind numbingly outstanding! The animation is first rate, considering that all the characters & the environment in the movie look like Lego figurines & Lego building blocks. Phil Lord & Chris Miller have proved their directorial skills, once again. The duo's directing skills vary from animated movies like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs & The Lego Movie to hilarious adult comedies like 21 Jump Street(can't wait for the upcoming sequel, 22 Jump Street). The voice acting is exceptional, with an all-star voice cast. Chris Pratt is brilliant as the protagonist, Emmett Brickowoski. Will Arnett is hysterical as the Lego version of Batman. Elizabeth Banks is great as Wyldstyle/Lucy. Alison Brie is adorable as Unikitty. Charlie Day is eccentric & hilarious as 1980s something space guy, Benny. Will Ferell is diabolical & menacing as President Business. Will Forte is impressive as Abraham Lincoln. Dave Franco is effective as Wally. Morgan Freeman is mind blowing as the wise elder, Vitrivius. Todd Hansen is great as Gandalf. Channing Tatum is outstanding as Superman. Cobie Smulders is good as Wonder Woman. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Green Lantern. I would have liked to see more interaction between Superman & Batman since we have to wait till 2016 for the Batman/Superman crossover film. Jake Johnson is effective as Barry. Liam Neeson shines in his varied portrayal of Bad Cop/Good Cop/Pa Cop. Shaquille O'Neal is effective as Shaq. Nick Offerman is ovation-worthy as pirate, Metal Beard. Anthony Daniels, Keith Ferguson & Billy Dee Williams are great as Star Wars veterans, C-3PO, Han Solo & Lando respectively. The supporting characters are effective as well. The soundtrack is foot-tapping & catchy at the same time. I would like to conclude by saying, The Lego Movie is a must watch & will go down in history as one of the classics, animated or otherwise."

Oh, and it's funny and keeps kids entertained too! My kids were laughing throughout the movie, and although they didn't understand the underlying symbolism or any of the \"adult\" oriented jokes, it was entertaining enough to keep kids, adults, and even elderly in the audience entertained at a purely superficial level. At a deeper level, there's plenty of brilliant use of words, symbols, names, and a very deep story of creation, cosmic laws and free-thinking that will leave you pondering this movie for weeks to come. A must-see for all, and I would recommend NOT waiting for this to come out on DVD as the 3-D effects and animation are incredible!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think it's safe to say that most movies based off of toys never really end well. So that brings up the question: does \"The Lego Movie\" fall into the same sad category such as the \"Transformers\" series and \"Battleship\" or does it break that problem that has plagued toy adaptations for years? The answer is, happily, the latter.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" is about the journey of one tiny Lego figure named Emmet. In an ancient prophecy it was foreshadowed that a mighty hero would come and save the Lego Universe from a terrible villain who planned on gluing the entire universe together.\n\nJust like the toy that inspired it, this movie was brimming with imagination from top to bottom. From the Lego city that Emmet lives in to oceans of the Lego Universe this was imaginative all the way through. And honestly, that alone is worthy of praise. Many films now are mainly just recycled ideas without any true inspiration put into them. However, this was not the case with \"The Lego Movie\". Watching this movie you can tell the filmmakers had an absolute blast going into such an imaginative world. The possibilities were endless and that is really what made the difference.\n\nOn top of imagination, this film is also filled with an intelligent (and even satirical) look at everyday life and a look at the role of the government (and our roles included). Just having a look at Emmet's life in the city you could tell this made fun of ordinary life, not in a mean way but an honest way. We wake up everyday and go throughout our daily lives greeting people, working at our jobs (whatever they may be), going home to relax for the next day alone or with people we care about, and getting up the next day. This sequence was exquisitely done, from the first scene of the President giving a vague, yet threatening, message to his people being undermined by the plain brainwashing of his people to the overall idea of being who we truly are. Wonderfully done.\n\nA lot of this is due to the excellent work by its A-list voice cast. Chris Pratt did wonderful work as Emmet, with him portraying the poor naivety of the Lego piece and his transition to someone willing to think for himself. The same can be said of Elizabeth Banks (hilarious as Wyldstyle), Will Ferrell as the villain, and Will Arnett (as Batman who ironically enough became the funniest character in the movie). Thanks to the great cast these characters will definitely be remembered for a very long time.\n\nSo adults, I just want to remind you that this is a movie that you will enjoy, maybe even more than your children will. Not only is it a smart satirical look at government and everyday life but it also has a self-aware humor mixed with pop culture references that will have you rolling on the floor laughing. A prime example of this is Batman and the wonderful way they play to his cynicism. In the movies and comics we know Batman as the cynic he is but in such a colorful world there is just so much material to play off of it would've been a miscarriage of justice to ignore it. Well done Lego.\n\nIn the end, this is a wonderful way to start off animation for 2014. Already at a stronger place than animation was this time last year, \"The Lego Movie\" has definitely raised the bar where toy adaptations (and maybe even animated movies in general) are concerned. Wonderful storytelling mixed with great characters, beautiful visuals, plenty of humor to spare, and a great message about finding the hero in all of us; \"The Lego Movie\" has proved that there is life for toy adaptations after all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't worry, this is not just a nostalgia movie catering to the retro LEGO nerd, while alienating anybody who had video games or friends growing up. \"The Lego Movie\" is shockingly entertaining, even if you're like me and the only LEGO interaction you've ever had is that one time when you accidentally stepped barefoot on one of your little brothers LEGO pieces.\n\nSide Note: Yes, I am aware that there are Lego video games, but those are lame, so\u0085 Containing Star Wars LEGO jokes, Harry Potter LEGO jokes, Ninja Turtle LEGO jokes and Superhero (The Justice League) LEGO jokes (with LEGO Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) portrayed accurately as a jerk, or how a billionaire playboy turned Superhero would most likely act in real life) \"The Lego Movie\" is from the minds of writer/director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the writer/directors of such child friendly films as \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" and\u0085\"21 Jump Street\").\n\nSynopsis: An average construction worker LEGO man (voiced by Chris Pratt) is mistaken for a LEGO prophet after stumbling upon a mysterious piece of plastic known as \"The Piece of Resistance\" and then asked to save the LEGO universe from the tyrannical President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell). To tell you the truth, I was actually dreading going to see \"The Lego Movie\", after taking one glance at the trailer and believing that it was just another animated, early year, straight to DVD release that the studios were attempting to masquerade as a feature film. BUT, to my surprise, what I got was an animated feature which contained the foundation of an extremely clever script riddled with laugh-out-loud dialogue, together with quite impressive LEGO inspired visuals (LEGO-mation) that while does take a few moments to adjust to, should force this film into the awards conversation next year.\n\nCaveat: Chances are \"The Lego Movie\" will be more entertaining for adults than small children, and here's why: Written by the guys who wrote and directed \"21 Jump Street\", most of the jokes caught me off guard with how comically sharp they were, but after a while I did notice numerous children, in the theater I was in, becoming visibly bored with the witty banter, while their parents continued to laugh out loud until the final credits rolled. Something to think about if you are planning on taking your little one.\n\nFinal Thought (Caveat # 2): As funny as \"The Lego Movie\" is, it is also hampered by an overly sentimental and tonally misguided ending, which takes most of the wind out of the sails of the final twenty minutes. This was actually the biggest problem I had with the film, even getting to the point of openly wishing it would end, just so I wouldn't have to witness one more second of Will Ferrell showing off his non-range as a dramatic actor. Still, if you are a fan of LEGO's or any offshoot of LEGO brand video games, then you will more than likely be able to outright ignore any flaws \"The Lego Movie\" has to offer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whatever stigma exists about movies based on toys both in general and in your mind, \"The LEGO Movie\" will dismantle it \u2014 brick by glorious brick. The writer/director combo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,\" \"21 Jump Street\") prove themselves yet again as masterful comic storytellers with an endless stream of wit and imagination, turning a movie adults were quick to dismiss into one they will be overjoyed to watch with or without children.\n\nThe world of \"The LEGO Movie\" is made entirely of LEGO pieces and though it was created using digital animation, contains the photorealism of stop-motion films, which is the first of many spot-on artistic choices Lord and Miller make. Even water, smoke and explosions are all made of bricks. So the way the film looks and operates remains unpredictable throughout the film, keeping the visuals engaging from start to finish.\n\nIn terms of the story, Lord and Miller (along with Dan and Kevin Hageman) follow the instructions as far as family films go, but there are plenty of twists and the film's message is both unique and true to the experience of those who love LEGO. Emmet (Chris Pratt), a LEGO construction worker living in Bricksburg, where everything is awesome (as the city's number one hit song goes) because everyone follows the instructions, conforms, works together and is happy all the time. Turns out that's because Lord/President Business (Will Ferrell) wants it that way. Many years before, he stole a weapon called the Kragle from the master builder Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and now he plans to use it as a doomsday device, as it will stick pieces together and keep everything as it should be. When Emmet comes upon the Piece of Resistance, the one thing that can stop the Kragle, he starts to fulfill a prophecy, and with a team of LEGO friends, tries to stop Lord Business.\n\nAll eras and styles of LEGO get some spotlight as the adventure grows in scope and imagination. There's the highly skilled action heroine, Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett), Benny the '80s spaceman (Charlie Day), Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and a host of other cameos from the DC Comics universe, \"Harry Potter,\" \"Lord of the Rings,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and more. References to Octan, the brand featured on many LEGO products of old, proves just how aware Lord and Miller are of their audience.\n\nBut it's the brilliance and hilarity of Emmet that makes \"The LEGO Movie\" work so well in terms of the story. The childlike wonder that launched Pratt's career on \"Parks and Recreation\" plays perfectly into the movie's humor. He's a constant laugh reel and a strong main character; his ineptitude is the butt of the other characters' jokes, making him the unlikely hero who has to prove everyone wrong.\n\nPerhaps not so coincidentally, Ferrell is also perfect casting as the dastardly President Business. Both he and Pratt have that man-child silliness in their comedy, and let's face it \u2014 LEGO fans are quite often man-children. This is something the film never loses sight of, as an unusual reveal late into the film puts LEGO within a context that its fans will truly appreciate.\n\nThe reason the Danish building blocks have been around so long is their ability to capture imagination, and that's the primary thing \"The LEGO Movie\" does so well. The characters are constantly building new eye-popping creations to problem-solve their way through the conflict. Although the film is hilarious, so much of the humor comes from its creativity. There are even clever uses of non-LEGO items that play major roles throughout the film.\n\nAudiences who fell in love with Disney's \"Wreck-It Ralph,\" which takes place in the world of video games, will find \"The LEGO Movie\" to be a kindred spirit. So many different styles and genres converge in a diverse cinematic landscape fueled by the endless creative minds of animators and filmmakers. Both also take time to build emotion connections, not just creative worlds. \"The LEGO Movie\" will really speak to people who have spent countless hours building with LEGO, but its message will resonate with all ages and LEGO \"experience\" levels. In other words, Lord, Miller, the Hagemans and the entire creative team have dug down to find what makes LEGO a universally beloved brand and brought out the best of it in a wildly funny, creative and meaningful story.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading!

But in my opinion the best voice came from Nick Offerman as the pirate.\n\nThe graphics are really top notch. It looks like you're really watching a stop motion Lego movie with great lightning and nice cinematography. This movie proves animation can still be different and unique in ways of how they look!\n\nAll in all a good movie you can enjoy as an adult or as a kid!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is likely that at some point you have put together a LEGO set, or at least sat in a doctor's office as a child and fiddled with \"Duplo\" blocks. The innovate building toy has been around for over 60 years in various incarnations, and over time has become ingrained in our culture- so much so that the licensed lines are commonplace. With licensing came comics, innovative and fun video games, and alas, short and full-length films. A feature-length film is really a culmination of years of success coming to a head. While not an entirely empty excuse to rake in more cash, \"The LEGO Movie\" falls short. At best it brings forth a few guffaws, and at worst it's pun overkill, forced emotion, and boredom.\n\nPlease, allow me to 'build' my case 'brick by brick' (see, I can do pun humor too!). Until the first \"LEGO Star Wars\" video game arrived in 2004, I was blas\u00e9 about the brand. The gameplay was immensely enjoyable, and the cut scenes interspersed between levels were light and humorous. Additional \"LEGO\" games were made, each seemingly more unique than the previous one. This led to the creation of short films, beginning in the \"Star Wars\" universe, and they've been excellent- made with the right balance of pun humor and quirky fun for adults and children. Like any good farcical comedy, the creators turned the subject on its' head, poking fun at the material whilst revering it. The entire LEGO media experience has been rewarding for myself and my child until now. Everything was awesome (see the film to understand that statement).\n\nKeeping that in mind, you'd think it would be a drop in the bag that I'd enjoy this immensely, but that's not the case. I can't help but compare \"The LEGO Movie\" to everything else the company has put out thus far, and in comparison, it doesn't hold up. The story is pretty straightforward- Emmet (Pratt) is a 'regular guy' who literally falls into an interesting situation. Adventurous Wyldstyle/Lucy (Banks) sees him as the 'special'- the one meant to overthrow malicious \"Lord Business\" (Ferrell) and keep him from permanently gluing everything together. Of course, that's just the WORST for LEGO figures, as they love to build. There's also a blind shaman/wizard (Freeman) guiding Emmet, and somehow he teams with Batman (Arnett) and a host of other random mini-figures (including Han Solo and crew?) to stop the 'lord' from doing his 'business'. See what I did there again?\n\nNone of this is silly through the eyes of a child, however. The viewing I saw was chock full of cheering little ones. The frenetic nature of the film may be a big draw to those kids, but it just wore me out, to the point of restlessness. Maybe it had something to do with the 'stop-motion' style of animation. Maybe it was just the hyperactivity of the plot, or the way that certain characters spoke. Maybe I'm getting old enough that these kinds of things finally hit me, and I've turned the corner. It would be easier if I could say the film was dull, that I didn't laugh at all, or that it was an empty enterprise.\n\nNone of that is true, and one can tell the care the creators put into the film. Consider this- most animated films of later years have done their best to make the film enjoyable for kids and adults alike, and thus its made for everyone. That's a benefit to everyone- the audience doesn't have to fake it and snore through 90 minutes, and the kids actually remember it afterwards.\n\n\"The LEGO Movie\" may have been aiming to please everyone, but what made LEGO media work before is missing here. Tack on a confusing, sappy real-life scene at the end between father and son and it shifted into overkill for this reviewer. It performed so well that we can expect a sequel. My suggestion? Hire those responsible for the earlier fare, and recapture the original spirit that didn't need such clamor to work."

It seemed like they all had a blast playing their roles. And what a fantastic job by the writers too. The story line was very much reflective of the society we live in, in America.

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a song which plays at several points in the Lego movie called \"Everything is Awesome.\" The song itself is a generic, unremarkable, annoyingly catchy piece of techno pop, which some of the main characters make a point of deriding. But it perfectly sums up the Lego Movie, because everything in this movie is awesome. There is so much action, so much humor, so many characters and settings. It would take all the money in Hollywood to make a movie with this many explosions, car chases, aerial chases, giant robot battles and magical worlds, not to mention the problems with continuity and logic. But with Lego none of that matters because a world made entirely out of interlocking plastic bricks has its own.\n\nThat's why a lowly construction worker can become the chosen hero by falling down a hole and touching a glowing brick, then find himself on the run from every cop in the world with a beautiful mysterious woman, all with no idea what's going on and barely more exposition than I've just given here. That's why Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Abraham Lincoln, the 2002 NBA all-stars and a cat/unicorn thing that talks like certain infamous ponies can all be characters in the same movie, and can go from a modern city to the old west, \"Middle Zealand\", the bottom of the sea and a giant office building above \"the void of nothingness\" with no complicated explanation. Heck, in a world made of Legos it doesn't even matter why the evil Lord Business and his henchman Bad Cop want to destroy the world, or why they don't have better names than \"Lord Business\" and \"Bad Cop.\" None of this matters because it just doesn't and because everything is so awesome. The frequent action scenes continually outdo each other in spectacle and ridiculousness. The jokes are constant and come in every variety from simple puns, slapstick and sight gags to subtle film and historical references, witty social commentary, and in-jokes about this movie's lack of logic. Plus the movie makes full use of the alternate logic I mentioned earlier. If something catches on fire, fire shaped Lego pieces cover it. Ocean waves are shifting piles of blue studs. Polish remover can get rid of unwanted alternate. The fact that anything can be taken apart and turned into anything else isn't just a cute gimmick; it's a major plot device. And it's hard to imagine a movie that's not in Lego featuring a decapitation and keeping a G-rating.\n\nAnd then comes the twist; the kind of twist to make a young and still talented M. Night Shyamalan jealous. A twist that not only changes everything, but explains everything: the extremely loose continuity, why the characters that aren't recognizable pop culture figures are generic clich\u00e9s, even why the elderly wizard's advice sounds like a mix of worn out platitudes and recent pop culture slogans. It's a twist that's so obvious in retrospect but so works perfectly anyway. What I'm saying here is that it's a really good twist. And even better is what the filmmaker's do with it, turning a sprawling fantasy/ sci-fi epic into a charming tale about the power of childlike imagination. The first hour is pure fun and will delight children of all ages. The imagination and depth of the last fifteen minutes make the Lego Movie the best animated feature since Toy Story 3."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my favourite movies of all time! it is a hilarious movie that will be loved by both young and old. I am a teenager and I thoroughly enjoyed it, it wouldn't be a lie if I said this was one of my favourite movies to date. I loved playing with LEGO when I was younger and I still show a great interest in it. I used to hope that they would bring LEGO to the big screen, but as the years went on I started doubting that it would happen, so I'm so happy that I got to see it when I'm still young. there is a great cast including some of my favourites - Chris Pratt (who I did not know before seeing this movie, who I love after seeing the Lego Movie. So when 'guardians of the galaxy' came out a reason I wanted to see it was because Chris was going to be in it.), Liam Neeson and Will Ferell. There are also a lot of other amazing actors involved including Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett. Overall this movie is definitely worth seeing. You should definitely, (like I did), BUY IT."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego movie has an imaginative original story, great characters, dialogues and message. The story mixes a bit of surrealism, absurdity and child-like stories and mixes it with a bit of super-hero stuff and a bit of social critique. The dialogues are funny and witty. The narrative is perhaps my favorite part of the film.\n\nThe animation is excellent, however this is not the sort of visuals I enjoy. I say this because the film is visually overwhelming, too much happening on every scene, too many figurines in each scene, too much is too much. Besides, the movie has no tempo or pace, or the pace is just run run run -- Lego on steroids. So I watched this movie with some sort of visual anxiety if that can be said. Unfortunately, it is not just a bit here and there, it is from beginning to end, so I felt it was an exhausting watching despite me liking the story overall.\n\nThe same story, the same Lego pieces, with a bit of more air and a different pace would have produced a rounder more enjoyable film, at least to me.\n\nThe Lego Movie tries to remind us all of how important is to play with toys, to develop our imagination, and how being silly is actually quite smart at times. Playing with toys has no rules, no limits, it can be as silly or senseless as you want, as long as you are having fun, all is possible."

It's so much fun, and could you ask for much more?\n\nThe Awesome: Everything Is Awesome! (pun intended) The voice acting by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and more all step up their game to deliver great performances. The animation is flawless, with a cute quality that screams Lego. The humor is spot on, with jokes so fast paced and lively that younger viewers could find it hard to keep up. I kept up fine, and man was the humor amazing. Also, the emotional turn near the end works perfectly, bringing the story full-circle in a tender and sweet way.\n\nThe Terrible: Nothing really, umm no end credits sequence? Even that is pushing it.\n\nOverall, The Lego Movie is an absolute blast. It's highly recommended to anyone who wants to see not just a great animated film, but a great piece of cinema in general.\n\nThis review is from my profile on Letterboxd: http://letterboxd.com/silentdawn/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie was one of 2014's biggest blockbusters bringing over $257 million domestically, so the chances are you have seen this already. But if you were reluctant as I was, you may still be thinking about it as award season rapidly approaches.\n\nAs the budget for the animated movie is reported to be only about $60 million, it is no doubt that sequels, prequels, and related projects are rapidly in the works at Warner Brothers, proving once again that there is vast market for good, family-friendly movies.\n\nWait, did I say \"good?\" Well, much to my chagrin, I did wind up liking the movie more than I had expected. The animation is outstanding. The voice casting is spot on and quite diverse \u2013 Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks, the 3 Wills (Forte, Arnett and Ferrell), Tom Welling, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Morgan Freeman, among many others. The story, while not original, has enough twists to keep it interesting for young and old. But be warned, the theme song \"Everything is Awesome\" is just catchy enough that it will stick in your head more than you want or are willing to admit.\n\nAs with most good movies aimed mostly for the young audience, this movie keeps the grown-ups interested with a non-ending stream of insider references. You do not need to catch the director's knowing winks to the audience to understand the story, but it is enjoyable to see how many they sneak in.\n\nIn short, you can safely watch this with your children without fear of wasting their time or yours. You can even watch it if there are no children in the audience."

It all felt the same after about fifteen minutes. Boringly the same.\n\nLots of reviewers have commented that it was very funny, but whatever humour was in it bypassed me. I barely smiled at anything in it. And I'm not normally the curmudgeon in the crowd.\n\nPerhaps the nadir came when the human characters were introduced. Just in case we didn't quite get the heavy-handed messaging, we needed real humans to show us what it really looks like. And the message was simply philosophical romanticism married to pop psychology. Pleeeeaaaase can children be fed with something more helpful, if they have to be given these \"moral lessons.\" If this movie was meant to recapture the pleasure of playing with Lego as a child, it didn't do it for me.\n\nThree out of ten only because I've got to leave room for other even more dreadful flicks. One of which is most likely going to be Lego Movie 2 scheduled for 2018. Ugghhh..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just The LEGO Movie\ufeff. It is awesome. It was flawless in so many ways. As the characters travel through different realms of the Lego world, the film style changes. In Western Land, the mood and style reflects that of old spaghetti westerns, including sound effect references to \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\". The visual aspects are incredible and EVERYTHING is made of actual Lego pieces. Even the muzzle flashes, something that is on the screen for only a frame or two, are made of Lego pieces. That said, the sky was the limit with what the pieces did. Even stepping away from the details film enthusiasts love to catch, the film was seamless in it's delivery. It had laugh out loud comedy that shifted to heart-pounding action and back in moments, in addition to heartwarming and tearjerking moments that resonate with the audience in a personal way. And finally, the film lived up to a claim that millions advertise and fail to deliver; it is the epitome of a family movie. Unlike every summer kids movie, The Lego Movie is not a kids movie that throws in a couple of jokes to help the parents sit through it. The Lego Movie is a kid movie, an adult move, and quite frankly, an everybody movie. There was every form of clean humor in the book, slapstick, bad puns, random silliness, pop culture/ referential humor, etc. Not a person alive could sit through this movie without laughing. So if you've ever built anything with Legos in your life, and I know you all have, go see The Lego Movie.\n\nSide note: Lego Batman is the best character ever, of all time."

The movie while watching it may seem childish and stupid (still fun and funny just nothing you haven't seen before) but say with it because there is a scene at that make it just so Awesome. The voice picks are great. Something new was that they finally got the Justus League. They did what DC should of done and just make the movie and trust the audience we know who these carters are. Of course the animation is great I fell I would need to see it 100 times to get every thing in the back round. Also the comedy is great. It's probably like the first Anchorman ya it's funny the first time but when you see it again it just gets funnier because you see things that you didn't before. The movie is very quick and you just don't want it to end. Another bad thing is the song will stay in your head for ever."

There is a lot to like about this movie especially having seen it in 3D which enhances just how entertaining this is. A obvious comment - this is Lego brought to life! I loved how well thought through this movie was. Whilst it references popular culture both through characters of other stories but also Internet memes such as Batman's capacity to achieve anything. It has aptly timed humour that was refreshingly unexpected. But most of all I really enjoyed how to the story unfolded with the presence of real world items; the end result being an acknowledgement of the creativity found in a child's mind and how adults can inhibit this. Brilliant.\n\nOn that note I really appreciated the deeper meaning in this film and how well rounded the message is: creativity shouldn't be limited to those who think freely and originally. Anyone is capable of creativity whether it be complete new, a slight different, or a revised of something already present. But beyond that independent creativity thought should be applauded communal creative thought should be too. As well as creative thought derived from instructions.\n\nToy Story 3 was the last animation film I saw which was explored childhood and what it meanings, including growing up. It was a masterpiece which hasn't been topped. Lego Movie is not as good and is different but what it does share is an equally relevant showcase of experiences children have.\n\nI trust you, like me, walked away from this movie wanting to play with Lego, play Mindcraft or do something creative. Wonderful!"

You don't care about the characters one bit and Batman its only funny the first time. All the good jokes were in the trailer so that doesn't help either.\n\nIts just trying too hard, without much plot or character development.\n\nI watched at least five people leave the theater early and my little cousin say that we should have stayed home instead.\n\nIt relays on other movie classic characters too much but I'm sorry, the cameo of Han Solo and C3PO is not enough.\n\nMy recommendation: don't be fooled by the ratings and avoid this movie.\n\nMaybe Lego bought the critics as a marketing strategy.\n\nSo disappointing."

This was an incredibly well-crafted and entertaining animated film, and I hope to see it at the Oscars this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "LEGO was a big part of my childhood as it was for many others, but that wasn't the main reason I was interested in seeing this film. I wanted to see it because of the excellent cast and because of directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who directed my second favourite movie of 2012, \"21 Jump Street\"). I had little to no expectations, which was perhaps for the best because I really enjoyed The LEGO Movie.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable things about The LEGO Movie is it's bizarreness and just how strange a lot of the plot is. It's very over the top, silly and often hilarious. Some of the jokes fall flat, and the humour becomes tiresome at a few points but the rest of the movie is so damn good that it's forgivable. Characters are very well developed, with more depth and emotion given to minifigures than I ever thought would be possible. This is a movie about LEGO that actually manages to illicit an emotional response. As unbelievable as this may sound, it's true, and the filmmakers deserve some serious applause for it. The film is very fast paced and rarely slows down, which may be a problem for some viewers but I didn't mind it. The movie manages to showcase lots of different branches of LEGO without feeling like an advert or promotion, which is a major problem that the movie could have easily fell subject to. There was a point where I became worried the film was turning into something not dissimilar to the Spongbob Squarepants movie (which I hate) but there was no need to worry, as the movie took this reason for worry and turned it into possibly the best thing about the movie.\n\nThe voice cast is excellent as well. Chris Pratt is continuously climbing the ladder into Hollywood stardom and The LEGO Movie will only help push him up further. He proves he has a great voice for animation and does an excellent job leading the movie. Supporting cast members including Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Charlie Day, Will Ferrel, Allison Brie and Nick Offerman are also great. Will Arnett deserves a special mention for delivering one of the most memorable Batman performances ever, and Jonah Hill does a better job as Green Lantern in a minor role than Ryan Reynolds did in a full movie.\n\nArguably the most impressive aspect of The LEGO Movie is it's animation style. A someone who has made a lot of LEGO stop motion videos in the past, I found some of the visuals in the movie absolutely mind blowing. I know that the movie is CGI mixed with stop motion, but there aren't any obvious CGI sections, it all blends together flawlessly. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller do an incredible job directing and deserve all of the praise they will inevitably receive, I wouldn't be surprised to see them receiving some huge projects in the near future. The soundtrack is excellent, and at it's core The LEGO Movie has a wonderful message, which I won't spoil but I will say this; while watching The LEGO Movie, all your worries disappear and you're taken back to your childhood, a time when everything was simpler, and everything was awesome. If that's not a good enough reason to see The LEGO Movie, then I don't know what is."

And while the animation was original and well done while and I don't have any qualms with the actors or direction, this film is just another Hollywood film about the hapless hero who finds it in himself the power to save everybody - if he has a lot of luck - and proves to everybody that he is \"special\".\n\nLike many others, when I first heard of the premise of the film I thought I would not see it, but then I heard so many people describing it as a cool movie that, in the end, I gave up and watched it. Yes, it is nicely done, yes it has a lot of nods to other movies, yes it has some funny scenes, but in the end it is just... not special.\n\nAnd I am not saying this because I am mean or because I think a Lego movie should be deep and profound and morally ambiguous so that adults would get it, not just little kids, but because the message of the film is as clich\u00e9 and conformist as they come. In a story about people removing the constraints of set rules and following instructions, the main message is \"be yourself!\". That's original.\n\nSo, yeah, it is a good movie, but it was so over-hyped that I couldn't enjoy its story mediocrity. Huge amounts of money were poured into this film, with good actors used for voice only, cool animation, but the bottom line is that... I've seen this before."

It was an absolutely hilarious and awesome movie. They actually poke fun at the clich\u00e9s, and it works perfectly. It has now also became of my favorite franchises ever. I have always liked the character Emmet after watching this movie, because he's pretty much just like me. I wasn't very creative when it comes to building Legos, and was always following the instructions. Batman was awesome in this movie as well. I have even seen the Lego Batman Movie recently last month, and it too was awesome. I hope the same thing will happen to the Lego Ninjago Movie six more months later. Now, THIS movie feels like if it was influenced by Yellow Submarine. I know this movie was actually inspired by stop-motion Lego brickfilms, but this movie also feels like Yellow Submarine. And yes, Legos are made to move like stop-motion, unless in video games, maybe. But either way, I love the Lego Movie."

Interesting, though not that original, plot. Very funny, snappy, dialogue. Generally, a good action-comedy.\n\nObviously, the thing that stands out most is the use of Lego for everything. Incredibly original in that regard.\n\nGreat casting for the voices: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, Will Arnett, Jonah Hill, among others. Best of the lot, in my view, is Will Arnett as Batman. Very funny.\n\nNot perfect though. Plot gets quite random, almost silly, towards the end. The novelty of the graphics wears off too. Plus there are scenes where the Lego graphics don't do the movie any favours - you sometimes struggle to figure out what you're seeing.\n\nOverall: good entertainment."

And so many more. I also like that the actor Chris Pratt was in it, he did pretty good. So I highly recommend watching this the actors were great, the art work was stunning, and the story line was fantastic! I would also think you should watch it if you like cats, batman, and of course Legos. What i'm saying is it's fun, funny, and good for the whole family. There is nothing in this film that is bad. Oh and they also have a good song named. Everything is awesome. So check out this fun filled comedy action adventure. Enjoy."

The fact that LEGO has come out with so many video games and straight to video films in the past did leave me a little worried at first, because I too afraid they would not take the \"motion picture\" thing too seriously and just treat as though it were another straight- to-DVD thing. I am so glad I was wrong about my assumption. This movie restored my faith in the fact that just because a company may produce films and games that are sometime less than ideal, does not mean for a second that they are not capable of creating something truly awesome!"

This movie is so cool it is amazing! There is a cool pirate ship and it is big, a pirate named Metel beard is on it! Batmancame with is bat place and flew through the sun! The main character Emmett made a giant robot with a wrecking ball on the back and a bulldozer scoop for a hand. This movie is so exciting! ON the big ship they needed a hyperdrive for a plane and the Millennium Falcom came and Batman went in and took their hyperdrive! Superman was in Cloudcoocoo Land and he did not like Green Lantern! The Batplane flew to a knight and shining armor place and the Batplane turned into the Batmobile! In conclusion now you know the Lego Movie is a great and funny movie!

But this movie totally disappointed me. I heard how brilliant it is many times, as well as I saw the rating from both critics and usual users. All this made me hope for a good animated film, but it turned out to be worse than I expected. Many jokes are not funny, though some of them are. The animation may be well-performed, but it's not pleasant to watch. The plot itself is a typical and trivial story about the chosen one. Later we discover that he is not, but it doesn't change the situation much, since we don't know about it till the end and the story remains the same. The characters I didn't like as well. If not for some good jokes and some interesting scenes such as the ending with reals humans, it would be undearable for me to watch it till the end.\n\nSome people here compare it to Toy Story, but don't be fooled. The Lego Movie doesn't worth such comparison. It's better to skip it if you're older than 12 and you've seen at least some movies and animation, cause the only original thing in this film is it's being about Lego."

Even the supporting characters of Green Lantern (Played by Jonah Hill) and Superman (Played by Channing Tatum) had great moments in the film as well.\n\nThe movie's script is also a strong suit of the film. The script is fun and imaginative, and captures the imagination of playing with Legos. The script is also a great satire about conformity. The writers show that anyone can be special if you just be yourself. Along the way the script also pokes fun at Green Latern and Batman as well.\n\nOverall The Lego Movie will be remembered as one of the greatest animated films of all time."

The film follows the history of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary and generic lego construction worker who found the Piece of Resistance and is prophesied to be the \"Special One\", the hero who will save the universe from lord Business (voiced by Will Farrel). As I said this movie is a parody of chosen one histories where Emmet is \"the most interesting, important and talented person of the world\" but when he is just a generic lego toy. The irony about this film is that it somewhat criticizes capitalism (the monopoly of big companies , being alienated by these companies, etc.) but it's one of the biggest product placement of all time to be presented in a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather poignant film that will appeal to kids and adults. The story is about a nondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally happens upon a mythical \"Piece of Resistance.\" Aided by the Master Builders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by Lord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes its way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was aware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and audiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The story is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for most of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and pop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did make me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman, Superman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble voice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord Business), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were practically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn which I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The end makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't quite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those things is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam. In the end, it is something that both kids and adults can get enjoyment out of, even if it's more fluff than substance"

It was so amazing how much detail they put into this film, because if you make a film with stop action, it will take a lot much longer to complete than using regular animation and filming. And besides the way they made the film, the story of the film was humble and very interesting to watch. Also very family friendly, as well. I think The Lego Movie was one of the best movies released in 2014."

The message itself is delivered so beautifully on multiple occasions and the characters are so full of depth you can actually feel like you are connected to them.

        "review_detailed_main": "Many of us have played with LEGO toys in our childhood. Creating our own worlds, characters and stories, building things out of our imagination and creativity. That's where the heart of LEGO movie lies making it a really heart warming ride. Even those who aren't familiar with the LEGO toys will enjoy the stunning animation, humorous script and many of its pop-culture references.\n\nThe story is set in LEGO universe where everything is made of LEGO bricks. Everyone in this LEGO world follows set of instructions and rules meant for them everyday. Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary guy who follows his daily routine/rules and there doesn't seem to be anything special about him. He suddenly becomes a part of a bigger picture when a mysterious object called 'The Piece of Resistance' gets stuck to his back. And here his adventures begin. He encounters some group of peoples called 'Master Builders' and hears some prophecy about the 'Special'. Well most animation films have similar theme about a not so special person discovering his or her potential and specialty.\n\nDespite having such a similar theme The LEGO Movies has original feel thanks to its beautiful stop-motion animation. Its dialogues are witty and humorous and sometimes small kids wont understand all of it while adults will enjoy. Still there are stupid gags meant for just kids yet the condition and timing make them laugh-out-loud moments for all. You will be shocked and have a big laugh when you see what 'The Piece of Resistance' actually is. There are also superheroes like batman,superman and even characters from Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. many of them among the master builders. Batman voiced by Will Arnett was ultra-cool and has made me really excited about the LEGO Batman movie coming up. Also Liam Neeson was bad-ass as an alter-ego good-bad cop.The voice-cast is splendid with likes of Morgan Freeman and Elizabeth Banks doing a fine job. Chris Pratt though steals the show with Emmet. The song 'Everything is Awesome' is really catchy. At the end it tries a bit too hard to deliver its underlying message but it is all set in surprising premise so I didn't care much. Watch it on your own I don't want to reveal anything.\n\nI hope LEGO Movie wins the Oscar and other awards for best Animated feature of 2014. Its better than last years 'Frozen' for sure. Saw it second time before writing this review so as to make sure me loving it is not just some first time effect and it didn't disappoint. Watch 'The LEGO Movie' now if you are tired of routine animation flicks, its a treat for people of all ages.\n\nRATING: [4/5]"

It has a great message that anyone can be special and uses the oldest kind of story telling, the hero's journey, in an artistic & beautiful way. However, this movie managed to tell a timeless story using a simple storyline. And that's one of the biggest reasons why this movie should have been nominated for the Oscar's best animated feature, instead of Boxtrolls!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Drawing a lot from other films - Matrix, LOTR, Batman, Star Wars, etc - the story lines of the film are like using the Lego blocks themselves; seemingly driven by imagination and creativity, the producers have a whole bucket of possibilities to play with. They can go two ways; use their skills to replicate the world around them in miniature, or let their imaginations run wild and build things that would be impractical to create using anything else. The most notable thing about the film is the animation. It is so cleverly done to replicate the Lego feel there are times it could be stop motion animation. The way the blocks fit together, the way they move and other idiosyncrasies. There's no hair swishing here or head nodding. It's just like you're playing with your Lego at home, only without having to take the roof off to move the figures inside.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch. Morgan Freeman is once again - as always - helping to solve white (yellow) mans problems, this time as Vitruvius, a sort of Gandalf meets Dumbledore sage. Liam Neeson steals the show as Bad Cop, a great portrayal of both his normal, angry, gruff action persona, but also a happier, smilier character who resembles Wayne Knight's \"Officer Don\" from Third Rock From The Sun. Even Will Ferrell keeps the crazy in check to play the megalomaniac Lord Business at the right tempo, so he becomes a pastiche of evil, rather than parody all the traits you would expect. It's funny, but I don't know whether the producers intentionally used Jonah Hill in the way they did, but the way his character is treated does sum up the way I think about him in every movie he's in!\n\nYes, it's an animation, but it's actually quite dark and violent in places. My toddler son plays with Lego, but there are a few scenes he wouldn't get. It is rated a PG after all. There are also lots more references to the older sets (I did have to pause one scene and go through how many of the characters I'd had as a kid) and the use of individual blocks, compared to the modern sets with there premoulded pieces, which would seem to appeal more to the older audience. And this is the greatest irony of the film - though not surprising - in that Lego has actually released sets to make the creations from the film using premoulded pieces. It's not good enough just to use your own imagination to try and recreate what you've seen in a similar form, you can remake their vision. And this, sadly lets the film down; it's too formulaic. With all the freedom Lego allows, they do stick to the usual film tropes like glue. It's a good film, with a very catchy song, but it could have been built slightly differently."

And it wasn't all that special, but it was more enjoyable than The Boxtrolls on many levels. But it should've been nominated for an Academy Award because it's better than 'Big Hero 6' also, that little-teen, generic movie. I found 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' a better movie than The Boxtrolls and kept me engaged throughout despite a little brat in there. Unlike \"Big Hero 6\", it actually makes you laugh throughout the film. It also makes you feel scared of the villain, pretty much the most well-thought out character I've seen in a while.\n\nI got this movie on DVD, expecting something cute and surprisingly breathtaking like \"Wreck it Ralph\" but it was somewhat boring like 'Big Hero 6' with some entertaining parts. The movie is too weird like Emmet can get annoying with his talkative self and Unikitty (I don't remember much about her).\n\nThe ending was an okay one, but it was just added in there as a cloying part. It was too sad, too, but then everything's okay.\n\nI don't think that many people over the age of 9 will enjoy this thoroughly.\n\nAll in all, The Lego Movie is an overrated film that is not for everyone and I really recommend Wreck-it Ralph more. It was an engaging and hilarious film from start to finish that will be something to watch over and over again. Don't expect much special from it."

The movie is very clich\u00e9. The villain didn't feel threatening at all, and it was a clich\u00e9 villain. The jokes were repetitive.I had absolutely no feelings for the characters. I found them all annoying and trying to be funny but failed. And the ending was horrible.I would recommend not seeing this movie unless you have a kid that would want to see it. since this movie is for kids and only kids will laugh at it.

        "review_detailed_main": "The LEGO movie is nothing short of a delight to watch from start to finish. It's an example of a great idea for a film executed extraordinarily with great animation, hilarious writing and cameo after cameo after cameo.\n\nThe story follows as a random builder who is believed to be the special who is needed to take down Lord Business and bring freedom to the world once more. The story reflects how LEGO is always played. You'll have those who want to make everything their way and then you'll have those who just want to have fun and build in the world of LEGO. The story really goes to show this adding some really interesting drama alongside the comedy that you'll be able to relate to no matter how old you are.\n\nThe animation is just the right style mixing both stop motion with a lot of computer animation giving the film not only a distinct look but also well suited for the Lego franchise reminding me a little of the old Lego Star Wars games and how they move so quickly and comedic. Besides that it also creates some great designs that will make you feel like a kid again with the beautiful worlds ranging from the wild west to an epic space adventure, something which Lego is all so perfect to do.\n\nThen there's the main thing that separates this film apart from just about every other film in that it gratifies our fantasies by having some of the greatest characters come together. We get to see Superman, Michaelangelo, Batman, Abe Lincoln and so many more random brilliant characters on screen together. There are so many great cameo characters in this film that it makes Wreck it Ralph seem like a generic reference. So many cameos within the film keep you entertained non stop, with each one more entertaining than the last. The only fault with them being that you love them so much that you want to see even more, but when the only fault is that you want more of what's there, that's no real fault.\n\nThe best way to phrase it is that it's an incredible idea that has been executed brilliantly. The premise is a tough one to pull off right, but clearly it's been done right here creating one of the funniest, most heart warming and fantastic animated films with a style that stands out and separates it from all the other animation franchises. They've already announced a sequel and I am already looking forward to seeing it."

I can imagine warehouses of Legos needed to make this movie. It just had incredibly witty clever script and I like the message is delivered. Know when to use your imagination and when to follow the rules and finding a common ground between the two. The old plane Legos vs. the new Legos with instructions. Emit is a construction worker who just wants to be accepted. He accidentally becomes \"The Special\" and is tasked to save the word. Timeless reluctant under-dog hero story like The Matrix and almost every super hero movie. See this movie and later buy the Blue Ray because I bet there will be some neat extras and I can't wait to see them."

Other than that, I wasn't sure if the film would have anything interesting to tell us. It sounded like a bad idea, one that would have some decent child humor but nothing beyond that. For like the 10th time in one year, I was wrong. 2014 was full of surprises, and \"The LEGO Movie\" was a big one.\n\nBesides the many stars in the movie, all of the characters are interesting, mainly because we know a lot of them from other films, shows, LEGO sets, etc. but here they play a caricature of the real thing, exaggerating their characteristics. It's actually quite funny for anyone at any age. That's the main great thing about this film, its wide appeal to people of all ages. It's the definition of \"fun for the whole family\".\n\nThe story in \"The LEGO Movie\" is hectic and not entirely serious, but there are actually a few interesting lessons to be taught. Not of morality or life choices (obviously, it's a movie about LEGOS), but ones about freedom to play with LEGOS how you want to. Sound silly? That's because it is, and it's proud of it. So yes, the movie has a nice, interesting, visually awesome story.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is how interesting the movie is visually. EVERYTHING is made from LEGOS. Look in the backgrounds, everywhere, it's all LEGO. The creativity is massive, and the visuals and colors alone will entertain kids. Add in some really clever humor coming from the voices of stars we've come to know and love, and you've got an excellent family film that will be remembered for a long time."

The result - with incredibly fast action sequences even I had trouble keeping up with - was something that both bored and bemused my boy... who luckily, had a big bag of sweets to keep him entertained.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the ending... which was so \"deep\", \"metaphorical\" and \"clever\" that parents all around me were consoling their children with the promise that it was almost over...\n\nUltimately, what let the film down was an unclear target audience: in an attempt to cater for parents and 20-something nerds, it left parents frustrated by the fact that their 6 year olds just didn't get what was going on for the most part and lost interest as soon as their popcorn ran out.\n\nOthers may complain that this film was nothing but an advertisement for Lego toys, but come on, wasn't that the whole point?"

Emmet is recruited by the Master Builders to bring peace to the world by using the \"Piece of Resistance\" and some creativity.\n\nThe movie is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and features the voices of Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. The original screenplay is written by Lord and Miller.\n\nDirectors Lord and Miller made an excellent job in the direction of the movie by replicating what playing with LEGO's feels like, capturing the essence of imagination and bringing it to life in a very creative and unique way through the movie. Lord and Miller made an awesome job in the script too, by creating an original story full of comedic moments and pop-culture references that has as well a heart and sends a message, that if you believe in yourself, work as a team and have a little creativity, you can do everything. Everything is possible, and awesome.\n\nThe live-action part of the film was very well connected with the animated part. It was really great how the filmmakers managed to relate the relationship of Emmet and Lord Business with the relationship of Finn and his father, \"The Man Upstairs\". The cameos by familiar figures from licensed LEGO franchises, pop-culture and history that range from Batman, Han Solo and Dumbledore to Shakespeare, Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neil are very well received, seeing them in LEGO form was awesome.\n\nThe cast did a great job in voicing the characters, each member of the cast added a little of their personality to their respective character. Animal Logic, the studio in charge of the animation, did an awesome job too. The studio tried to replicate the feel of stop-motion films and they achieved it in a way that's both funny and charming.\n\nAll this elements make \"The Lego Movie\" a great film that provides lots of fun for the whole family, and like the movie's main song says, \"Everything Is Awesome!!!\""

This is a fantastic film and one of the best of the year. I thought that it was very creative and the Lego style animation was really well done and unique. The highlight for me though is the voice over work by an all star cast. Chris Pratt (notably of Her, Parks and Recreation) and Elizabeth Banks (recently of The Hunger Games movies and 30 Rock) have the personality and wit to bring these characters to life. Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and Morgan Freeman also provide plenty of humour (yes, you read that right: Morgan Freeman was hilarious!).\n\nI also loved that the characters in the movie were a random mish-mash from comics, major Hollywood films and current pop culture and the adventure that ensures is ridiculously silly and a lot of fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected as this was very cleverly written (I had a hard time keeping with the humour at times as I was still laughing from a previous gag). As it concluded, it also took an unexpected and touching turn and reminds us that sometimes it's good to embrace uniqueness and think outside the box. A useful lesson for young and old alike and humorously ironic given the Lego toys this is based on. Funny, witty and surprisingly entertaining, this is not to be missed and is great fun for all ages.\n\nWas my review not horrible? Great!

It's kinda like a modern day Mel Brooks/Month Python Lego movie. It's got an all-star cast, which doesn't always mean a good movie, but, in this case, it does. I can't watch this movie without a permanent smile across my face the entire time. There's no shortage of laughs, and the adult humor is subtle, but hilarious. It's a very rare movie that is enjoyable for both adults and kids equally. If you haven't seen it yet I definitely recommend watching it, especially if you like to laugh. It's a fun movie made entirely out of Legos, with some of the craziest characters, and something for everyone in it."

Morgan Freeman's character had a bit more humor to him and he was an all around more likable character. Will Ferrell is surprisingly great.\n\nBy the end I felt it was well worth the watch, I don't know if I'd place it in the top 250 but it's a very well done movie that doesn't disappoint."

The exceptionally well-designed and colorful animation creates a visually very impressive film, however perhaps its best feature is the intelligent and creative writing that produces a touching story, with a plethora of comedic inputs along the way. For the most part the film relies heavily on its humorous aspect, offering numerous pop culture references and a satirical view of different genres and various notable film characters. Yet, The Lego Movie ultimately uses its imaginative approach to communicate to its audience many deep and highly significant ideas, inspiring creativity and individualism in its viewers. Overall, it is a delightful comedy adventure with a stimulating story in its core, thus making it a film well-worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look at the risk of sounding like some type of Grinch everything is not awesome with The Lego Movie, perhaps the first ever movie to be 100 minutes of pure product placement marketing at its finest and a movie that gives all new meaning to the word ADD.\n\nVisually fantastic and designed in an absolutely flawless way there is no doubting that The Lego Movie is a feast for the eyes and in many senses a throwback to the age in which I am sure we can all remember, the Lego years. Tapping into what might just dwell in all of us the movie does bring out a feeling of nostalgia when it comes to the many pieces of yellow bricks we have all spent time with and it's a credit to directing duo Miller and Lord that they worked so hard with the team at Animal Logic in Sydney Australia (yay go Australia!) to produce such a detailed and thriving world but with that you get the feeling someone forgot to make an engaging or in any forms original story.\n\nFilling the film with a formidable voice cast which includes the man of the moment Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell amongst many others it's sad to say that the actual characters here are not that endearing. What makes an animated movie like Toy Story or The Lion King such a joy for ages young and old is its ability to tell a meaningful story with a bunch of characters that go beyond their existence as animated beings and The Lego Movie doesn't do this. Emmett is a lame excuse for the antihero and other characters are all cookie cutter caricatures from better movies. With the characters hard to fall in love with the story also fails at producing the goods with it way too confusing for any child under the age of 10 and with a motto that seems to be throw as many jokes at the screen in as short a time as possible the film suffers from a desire to be funny far too often.\n\nNo doubt appealing to many people the world over (reviews and box office clearly attest to this) and as a kid I can imagine this being a pure visual joy, The Lego Movie is also a sad reminder than it many ways the simplicity of animated tales has been hijacked in favour of a sugar riddled tale that sadly works for children of the modern age whose attention spans are shorter than a goldfish's and want everything faster and sooner than ever before. Great work by the marketing gurus at Lego and Animal Logic, they must be laughing all the way to the yellow bricked bank.\n\n2 and a half bricks of Lego out of 5\n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out -\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you search on YouTube for Death Star, Eddie Izzard and Lego, as you do. You will find a Izzard voiced skit that some smart Alec has painstakingly animated frame by frame using Lego toys. The words are funny already but combined with the visuals, this is a match made in heaven.\n\nIf someone can pull this off in their bedroom, imagine what you could do with full brand licensing in your pocket, A-List acting talent, millions of studio dollars and ability to rummage in the back catalogue of popular super hero and sci-fi pop culture.\n\nOf course placing all these elements together could still foreshadow a disaster. No matter you have Morgan Freeman voicing a Gandalf style self aware wizard and a post Christopher Nolan styled Lego Batman, this is still animated Lego with a lick of CGI wizardry.\n\nFox studios need not have worried, the film has been a massive hit not only for the younger audience but the film has that most elusive element, crossover appeal, guaranteed to generate big box office returns.\n\nFollowing a prelude with \"Vitruvius\" (Morgan Freeman - Voice), attempting to protect a super weapon \"Kragle\" from Lord Business (Will Ferrell - Voice), we are introduced to Emmett Joe Brickowski (Will Arnett - Voice). Emmett is an ordinary construction worker with no special skills, he gets on OK with his crew but remains largely anonymous.\n\nFollowing the completion of a \"most catchy tune ever\" montage, our nascent hero spots his dream girl \"Wildstyle\"(Elizabeth Banks - Voice), apparently even Lego figure have desires to attend to. Literally falling for the girl, Emmett finds \"the piece of resistance\" leading to his anointment as a \"Master Builder\" and brings him to the attention of \"Good/Bad Cop\" (Liam Neeson - Voice) the trusty lieutenant of \"Lord Business\".\n\nCan Emmett save the world, is the plot an excuse to have huge amounts of self aware fun with many action set pieces and great throwaway jokes, certainly we answer affirmative to the latter.\n\nClealy the film makers have been given carte blanche to utilise many sacred brand names, Batman, Wonder-woman, Star Wars, Green Lantern to name just a few and they make the most of the opportunity.\n\nAs Batman states in in his post ironic Christian Bale style drawl \"I only build in Black and sometimes, very, very dark grey\" This works on many levels, the kids will love the action, the bright colours and the ability to re-enact the movie post credit scrawl, once parents have been bankrupted buying all the toys.\n\nTo be fair, it would have been easy for the filmmakers just to make a movie length Lego promo with blatant product tie-ins but the film has been constructed with care, love, a lot of thought and attention to detail. The end is certainly not where you expect to find yourself when the film starts and again is a risk that pays huge dividends, revealing the film has a beating sentimental heart.\n\nDifficult to criticise as there is not much to dislike, the whole energy of the film is quite infectious occasionally the spell is broken and you realise you are watching animated Lego, but as someone once said, everything looks better in Lego Hugely enjoyable caper movie made entirely of Lego with clever use of words, cameos and situations, both breaking out of the confines of the genre yet satisfying those who just want a fun film for the kids to watch.\n\nSummary\n\nA no brainer must see and with a sequel already in the works, one could say without doubt that \"everything is awesome\""

Somehow he gets mistaken for the prophesied Special and is recruited as the one true savior from an evil mastermind's plot for Lego universe domination.\n\nThe Lego Movie is proof that commitment to and passion for your craft\u0085.just kidding! Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have mastered the quirky referential comedy down to a science with the same unexpected vigor experienced from 21 & 22 Jump Street. The Lego Movie is fresh, smart and new rather than following the standard expected by family oriented films set to capitalize on a franchise and rake in the dough. It satiates entertaining children and adults equally the with seamless duality that can only come from true dedication to storytelling.\n\nAt first glance, The Lego Movie is a fun family-friendly adventure film. It is also a cheeky satire to those intellectuals able to catch the never-ending barrage and chronic lampooning in the form of cultural references. Every single sentence within the dialogue of this film is an exploited opportunity to parody anything and everything.\n\nWith such an underwhelming year for animated films, The Lego Movie is the stand-out winner. It may be a bit too manic for some viewers, but that's okay because everything is awesome! Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: For some unknown reason, I really enjoyed this funny movie. It really does have something for everyone and although the storyline is completely ridiculous, it really did make me laugh. There is a great mixture of characters and the references to other movies were well written. I was shocked to see the cast list and I was amazed that Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman agreed to do this movie because it's completely out of there character. The originality of the film was refreshing and the directors done well by making all the Lego characters actually look the Lego. The annoying \"Awesome\" song made me laugh and Batman was a great addition to the many different characters. In all, I was surprised with the outcome, after hearing all of the hype behind the movie, and judging by the money that it took at the box office, I'm not the only one that thought that this was a great watch. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman have to have the two most striking voices in cinema. I couldn't really tell who Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was but it was good to see that the director used the real Billy Dee William and Shaquille O'Neal. Will Ferrell was great in person and his voice as Lord Business really did work. Don't get me wrong, the movie is extremely far fetched and the concept was crazy, but that is what makes the movie work. They have already planned a sequel, which isn't surprising after that gross, and as soon as I saw this movie, I put the Batman Lego movie straight on my rental list. I honestly think that you will see something new every time that you watch this film because there is so much going on and the pace is quite fast. I haven't been that impressed with a lot of animated movies that have come out recently but after watching this film, my faith has truly been restored.\n\nBudget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $468million (WOW!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there heroic animated movies about a everyday construction worker who has been told that he has a gift to save the world. 7/10"

Well, I don't find this the least bit surprising. The film already has a nostalgic element that might draw many adults to the movie. Additionally it has something many kids' films don't--it's very, very watchable for the adults who have been drug along to see it! It's often very funny and never takes itself seriously.\n\nThe film is about a meanie in the Lego world named President Business (the voice of Will Ferrell). He's determined to destroy their world by using his ultimate weapon--a tube of Crazy Glue! But the inhabitants of the world are mostly clueless and think he's a great guy. Later, this turns out to have parallels in the real human world.\n\nAs I said above, the film often was very funny as it often made nice cultural references or made fun of Lego. It also had the silliest soundtrack I've ever heard--with songs whose lyrics almost sound as if they were written by 7 year-olds! And, interestingly, you'll find yourself humming along with these catchy tunes! Clever and worth seeing, my only worry is that they'll bring out some sort of sequel--and although I really liked the film, I'd hate to see them ruin the franchise as the film seemed very complete and doesn't need followups."

Only Emmet is even more average than the average Average Joe, as evidenced by the fact that even the people he works with aren't really sure who he is. In true dystopic fashion, he lives in a society that demands unthinking and unquestioning obedience to the status quo, making it easier for those in positions of authority - particularly the arch-villain Lord Business - to accrue ever more power without any pesky resistance from the effectively pacified unwashed masses. Until, that is, Emmet is informed that, unlikely as it may seem, he just may be the long-awaited Messianic figure, know as The Master Builder, whom, it has been prophesied, will one day appear on the scene to mount a revolt against the tyrannical system and lead his fellow citizens to freedom.\n\nEven though he's essentially an animated Lego figure, Emmet turns out to be the single most endearing everyman hero we've been asked to fall in line behind in quite some time. And the always under-appreciated Chris Pratt (\"Everwood,\" \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Guardians of the Galaxy\") deserves much of the credit for that. So, too, do the writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who co-directed the film as well.\n\nTo add to the spirit of anarchic fun, a host of historical and pop culture figures, from Lincoln and Shakespeare to Superman and Batman to the casts of \"Harry Potter\" and \"Star Wars,\" make cameo appearances in the film.\n\nThere's also a parallel story that takes place in the \"real world\" that underlines the part imagination and role-playing have in bringing people together.\n\nImaginative plotting, first-rate animation and sharp, snappy writing - backed by outstanding voice work by Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman - instantly place \"The Lego Movie\" in the pantheon of great computer- animated films."

A few years later, they directed \"21 Jump Street\", a hilarious and thrilling action-comedy. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are amazing when it comes to switching genres. From a friendly rated-PG animation- comedy-family flick to a rated-R action-comedy blockbuster.\n\n\"THE LEGO MOVIE' is like the last two movies directed by the duo.......amazing and unique. I love how the movie provides a simple and not too complicated plot which follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO minifigure who is mistakenly pulled into the world of the Masterbuilders in order to help stop an evil tyrant from his diabolical plan.\n\nWhat can I say? Amazing direction by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. They did something similar to what they did with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, this time, with a lot more ideas and uniqueness. The voice performance of the cast was very splendid. especially Chris Pratt, who made the perfect \"chosen one'. Will Arnett and Liam Neeson did an excellent job providing the voices as \"Batman\" and Good-Cop/Bad-Cop\". Morgan Freeman was great too. The script was great too, delivering humorous jokes and a story which does not go too far.\n\nAll in all, The Lego Movie is the ideal blockbuster that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of my most anticipated films for 2014 due both due to the fact that Lego was a big part of my childhood and the animation style was so unique and refreshing that, being the animation geek I am, I had to see this.\n\nMy tip for viewing this is to not question what the heck is going on for the first 10 minutes of the film, you just have to go with it and you will be pleasantly surprised. The plot seemed non-nonsensical and almost completely random at points and it does require some understanding of the toy and films that are referenced. Adults will also enjoy the pokes at politics and consumerism.\n\nIn one scene the characters go to 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' where they follow a cat with a unicorns horn into a building shaped like a dog's head in order to meet with famous Lego figures, then a robot pirate jumps through the window and tells his back story, and an argument causes Abraham Lincoln to fly on his jet powered chair through the roof. The whole 100 minutes is stuff like this. But its immensely hilarious and doesn't have a dull or unfunny moment.\n\nThe sentimental side introduced near the end was nostalgic and a good twist, but didn't make me all that emotional in the way that films like Up or Toy Story 3 did. I also wanted more from the side characters, pertculary Superman and Green Lantern, and more of the awesome action sequences.\n\nFun and entertaining for everyone,particularity families, and one of the funniest films I've seen in months."

There is a ton of humor in it some of which might go over the kids heads but for the adults watching would be enough to get a smirk or even a chuckle.\n\nThe story is pretty good and keeps moving along at a decent pace.

        "review_detailed_main": "For anyone who spent a lot of their childhood banging lumps of plastic together, creating outlandish plots and dialogue for them to act out, and pretending that all that lurked beyond the edges of the bed is a sea of molten lava, then you'll get The Lego Movie. It's hyperactive, fit- inducingly-colourful, and very, very funny, but it's the message behind the movie that makes it so wonderful. It tells a silly prophetic story about a simple construction worker thought to be 'the Special' - a plot deliberately made to sound like it's the product of an imaginative child - but his world of instructions manuals, mass consumerism, moronic pop songs and diabolical sitcoms is our world: the adult world. The Lego Movie makes you want to find your inner child again, and go back to those days where you could transport yourself to another world in your bedroom by using your own brain.\n\nEmmet (Chris Pratt) is a naive and simple everyman, routinely watching popular sitcom \"Where Are My Pants?\", singing along to \"Everything is Awesome!\", and using an instruction manual for every aspect of his life. Left behind on a construction site one night, he comes across the mysterious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who seems to be searching for something. After accidentally spooking her, he investigates himself, and comes across the 'Piece of Resistance', a glowing object that gives him visions and knocks him unconscious when he touches it. When he awakens, he's being interrogated by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), and finds the Piece has attached itself to his back. Believing him to be 'the Special' from a prophecy, Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to the Gandalf-alike Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), who teaches Emmet the way to becoming a master builder.\n\nWhat could have been a mindless 90-minute advertisement for a global product, The Lego Movie dodges the bullet by actually attacking mass- consumerism, placing the importance on creativity and individuality. The big bad buy is Lord Business (Will Ferrell), a helmet-wearing, caped corporate devil who wishes to control everyone by gluing them in place with 'the Krakle' (a mispronunciation of Krazy Glue), oppressing the freedom to travel between Lego worlds (including The Old West, Middle- Zealand and Cloud Cuckoo Land). This is also a stab at collectors, those strange types who like to keep their toys in boxes and display them, rather than getting them out and using them for what they were designed for. Toys may have become ornaments, ways to make easy money on eBay.\n\nIt could be argued that such satire has no place in a kids movie. But these are the same kids who now have their own iPhones, bombarded with in-game advertisements and growing up in a world of reality TV, with programmes consistently celebrating wealth, stupidity and branding. Wyldstyle, concerned that Emmet may have never had an original thought in his entire life, asks him what his favourite restaurant is. \"Any chain restaurant!\" he gleefully replies. This is the man who is supposed to save the world, the greatest master builder to have ever lived, only to be a master builder, you need to have an imagination to create something amazing out of nothing. The best that Emmet has come up at this point is a two-level couch. It maybe useless, illogical and absolutely pointless, but it's something.\n\nBut The Lego Movie isn't all metaphors, it's also beautifully animated (it occasionally replicates stop-motion, as if the movie is actually made of Lego bricks, although it is entirely CGI), exceptionally witty, and features an outstanding vocal cast, who make up an entourage of Lego characters based on other mediums. We have Batman (Will Arnett) as Wyldstyle's arrogant yet lovable boyfriend, and the likes of Han Solo, C-3PO, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Michelangelo the Renaissance artist and Michelangelo the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. It's an absolute joy, as if looking into a child's toy boy to find a bunch of random and unconnected figures from years of collecting. And that sums up the film - like looking into the past and realising that that same person, who could lose hours putting on silly voices and concocting ridiculous stories, is still in there somewhere.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Seeing the incredibly high reviews that \"The Lego Movie\" was receiving it persuaded me to check this film out; originally I wouldn't have given this movie the time of day as I've seen from the trailers it seemed to be a film that purely relied on cheap jokes such as referential humor and fart jokes; thank God it wasn't that. I went in the Lego Movie with moderately high expectations since the review scores were so high, and I left feeling it truly deserved those scores. The film had absolutely breath-taking amount of detail when it came to making the computer animated graphics look as though it was filmed entirely in Legos bricks, also the wide variety of characters in the film from a punk chick that's dating Batman, to a hippie mystical wizard gave the film a sense of worlds colliding as well as charm; but what was the most surprising thing about this film was how much depth the story had with its commentary on modern America. How an everyman listens to only poplar vapid music, to drinking overly priced coffee, and to have absolutely nothing that makes them special in anyway. Also the main villain being called Lord Business owning a huge corporation that runs charities, taco night Tuesdays, as well as ballot boxes, huh you never see a kids film put that much emphasis on the corrupt business. But the message the movie tries to convey at roughly the last 15 minutes in the film truly turns a hilarious comedy into a touching ending that rivals ending like Toy Story 3. The Lego Movie brought me back to the days were I used to play with Legos every day, and although it one huge commercial for Legos it worked as I wanted to buy some Legos and relive my childhood again. 8.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lego played a big part in my childhood. Receiving a new Lego set was the pinnacle of excitement for me as a child, whether it be Star Wars or Harry Potter, I played with it for hours upon hours. So when I heard that The Lego Movie was being made, I hoped that it would assert the same nostalgia as Toy Story evokes nowadays. Thankfully, it does.\n\nThe Lego Movie revolves around a stereotypical builder by the name of Emmet (Chris Pratt), who one day breaks the monotony of his life by discovering the 'piece of resistance'; an object which will defeat the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrel). All of this is foretold by a godly figure called Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), who gathers a team compiled of many heroes such as Batman (Will Arnett), an adventurous girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) & a 1970s astronaut figure (Charlie Day). Constantly on the tail of the group is a bi-polar police officer played by Liam Neeson, who is wholly loyal to Lord Business.\n\nIn case it isn't clear, there's a lot of celebrities featured in The Lego Movie, all of whom present their characters in an incredibly entertaining fashion. It's often argued that animation movies should hire 'real' voice-actors to play roles, but I genuinely think that The Lego Movie would be considerably worsened if people like Morgan Freeman didn't participate. From start-to-finish, the cast make the on-screen action all the more enjoyable to watch, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.\n\nThe Lego Movie is also just a fun movie to watch. Although it's highly likely that the majority, if not everything was produced through CGI, within the world of the movie it is all Lego. Even the ocean is made with thousands of individual pieces of Lego, which just makes it a very fun film to take in, and draws you in even more. I'd imagine the fight- scenes within the film took a very long time to produce, as every explosion and gunshot is created entirely out of the globally-recognised pieces of plastic.\n\nSimilar to the many great films Pixar have produced over the years, the humour in The Lego Movie appeals to both children and adults. I found myself laughing consistently throughout, some times far more than in any comedy I have watched recently. There's not as many jokes which appeal exclusively to adults which may be found in movies like Toy Story, but the humour definitely isn't dumbed-down for the sake of the main audience. I'd easily recommend it to anybody and be surprised if they didn't find something to like.\n\nThe only major issue I held with The Lego Movie was the twist towards the end. Without spoiling anything, it will either undermine the movie for you or make it even more enjoyable. I personally found it to do a bit of both, and actually result in a slightly emotional scene, but some may argue that it detracts from the film as a whole."

        "review_detailed_main": "A few years ago, back when I had only two nephews, I was on a quest for real Lego\u2014those loose pieces that come in all sorts of shapes, colours and sizes, the kind you could build into whatever you wanted, the kind that didn't come with a set of instructions and a specific purpose in mind. I wanted to give my first nephews, Jon and Isaac, the kind of Lego I grew up playing with. But all I could find in my local toy stores were Lego kits, designed more for crafting predetermined ships or boats or planes than to stimulate the imagination. It wasn't until I stopped in at Toys \"R\" Us in Times Square that I was able to find a box of the prized pieces.\n\nToday, I've got three nephews playing with that New York City Lego (young David joined the gang about six years ago). I'm proud to say that all of them prefer making their own Lego creations to sticking with the instructions. They love the kits, too\u2014they're a new generation, after all\u2014but once they've finished following directions, they take the finished product apart and start inventing their own versions.\n\nAs much as my nephews and I love Lego, we weren't on board right away with the idea of a Lego movie. When Isaac and I discovered the movie's poster during his recent visit to Ottawa (the boys live in another province), we were left wondering what on earth the plot would be about for such an obvious marketing piece.\n\nJon had the same doubts, although they were quickly turned around once he saw the movie last weekend. \"When I started watching it, I was thinking, 'How can a movie about Lego have a plot?'\" he says. \"And then after, I realized it was pretty cool how they took Lego and made it into a huge movie.\" It's a huge movie, indeed. The Lego Movie comes from the genius writer/director team behind Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Here, they've created a brilliant, self-reflexive animated flick that, in the words of fellow Lego junkie Thomas J Bradley, \"perfectly captures the ideas of Lego.\" So what is the plot? I won't reveal the overarching premise, but the main story follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), a regular Joe Lego man presumed to be the \"Special\" destined to save the world from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell), who rules over all things Lego and insists that everyone always follow the instructions. Emmet joins forces with a fantastic group of rebel figurines, including Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Spaceman Benny (Charlie Day) and the wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Standing in the way, alongside Lord Business, is Liam Neeson's conflicted Bad Cop.\n\nThe Lego Movie holds together with shrewd observations about the real world and very clever plays on sayings, words and product names. It turns ideas on their heads and offers hilarious insights into the way children interpret their surroundings \u2014 all without alienating the parents in the audience.\n\nSean, my brother-in-law, dutifully took the boys to the movie, but he was pleasantly surprised by how much he himself enjoyed it. \"There were a lot of adults laughing their heads off in the movie,\" he says. \"It was well done.\" Sean also commented on the \"nostalgia factor\" the movie tapped into. For example, Spaceman's faded logo, or his broken chin strap. \"That was what would always break first on those things.\" There's no question that The Lego Movie is an unabashed marketing campaign. The filmmakers deliver a fabulous one-two punch, targeting grown-up kids who were raised on Lego, just as much as the kids who play with it today. But they've also built a smart, inventive flick that shows what's at stake when imagination is squelched for the sake of compliance, and concludes perfectly by driving home the idea that one person's happy ending isn't necessarily the same as everyone else's.\n\nMore to the point, The Lego Movie is piles of fun. It's hilarious and visually awesome, and it makes it very clear that playing with Lego (or at least being creative, taking risks and believing in yourself) forms the building blocks of a happy childhood and an accepting, inspired adulthood.\n\nI don't want to spoil the surprise by rattling off too many examples of what's so funny and clever about the movie. So I'll keep it to just a few of the best bits, according to my nephews and me.\n\nDavid: \"Everything is AWESOME!!! I liked the Lego lava at the beginning. It's so cool when it boils, Lego hot stuff goes flying up in the air. They used a lot of Lego pieces for that. Except it's not so realistic Lego. I love how that spaceship guy was screaming 'SPACESHIP!' the whole entire time he was flying; it was so funny. How does that work, Lego people talking? I guess people were dressing up as Lego blocks.\" Isaac: \"I liked the rocket ship guy. And the Millennium Falcon. I thought it was funny. The ending was really funny. I don't know what my favourite part is; I just like building Lego. I just finished building a Lego castle, it's like six little rooms, each side of it has a roof and then a base on top. It has walls and a sniper tower. And I added more to the Lego ISS.\" Jonathan: \"I really liked the part where the bad cop keeps changing into a good cop. I liked the plays on terms. And the ending was pretty funny. I read a lot about it in Isaac's Lego magazine so I kind of knew what was coming. It was really good.\" Me: \"I loved Batman's song, Untitled Self Portrait: (To the barking beat of the Batmobile's subwoofers) DARKNESS. NO PARENTS. SUPER RICH. KINDA MAKES IT BETTER.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "If you asked me about The Lego Movie back around September to October, I would've said, \"Pfft\u0085 A movie about Lego's? That's dumb!\" One day, in November, I was on the front page of YouTube, and I saw that The Lego Movie trailer was up. So I decided to watch it. And I cracked up. That's what got me excited for this movie, making it an honorable mention for my Top Ten Anticipated Movies of 2014 (go ahead and read that, if you can, please). So today, I invited some friends, and went to go see the movie. And boy, did I have a good time. The movie stars you average joe Lego figure named Emmet. He's nobody special, completely blends in with the crowd; he's someone that would be completely forgotten. However, his life completely changes around when he touches the relic and discovers that he is the prophecy. He then is tasked to stop President Business from doing his evil deeds. In case you didn't know, this is some serious business (haha pun). I'm going to start out with the visuals, and let me tell you\u0085 they're OK. Yeah, I'm just kidding. They're absolutely wonderful. Everything looks gorgeous and actually looks like a Lego world. Everything is made of Lego's to a realistic degree. It almost looks like stop motion. That's also another reason why I like this movie. All other Lego forms of media all had weird, almost spaghetti kind of animation. This movie actually looks like how Lego's are supposed to look. It's a joy to watch, and even quite beautiful. The voice acting is absolutely perfect. Everybody does an absolutely fantastic job in this movie. I personally thought Will Arnett, Will Ferrell, and Morgan Freeman did the best jobs. Everyone still does excellent. What I also liked about this movie is the humor. Most of the jokes at the beginning of the movie weren't very funny, but after a while, the movie takes a turn to hilarity. This movie is just fast paced, non-stop, laugh out loud moments. It has it all, from slapstick comedy, to pop culture references, to the jokes that whiz over kids' heads. It's absolutely entertaining. My true negatives have to do with the story. I think the whole concept of a movie entirely of Lego's is genius, but the story is nothing special. I mean, it's still a solid story, but there's nothing that really stands out. It's kind of predictable, and it's a storyline that you've seen multiple times in kids/family movies. The story isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it doesn't push any boundaries, and that isn't good enough for me. I also think that this movie is a little too long. There are multiple Lego worlds showcased within this movie. With this combined with the plot where a lot of things are happening kind of makes the movie drag out for too long. I feel that if they took out one of the Lego worlds, then this movie would be perfect length. This movie is about, I'd say, ten minutes too long. Overall, this movie is a blast. The animation is beautiful, the jokes are hilarious, the characters are highly entertaining. My favorite character was Batman, and his introduction was my favorite part of the movie. This movie also had a lot more heart than I was excepting, which is always a plus. This is not an animated family movie that's in the same caliber as movies like Toy Story or The Lion King, but it's a fun ride that shouldn't be overlooked. And let me finish by saying, January, thank you for being over so that the good movies can come out."

There are Constant Character References that are Already in the Brain and Make for Easy Access and Satire, and of Course the Toy Set Itself (the word Lego is never mentioned), that has been Around Since 1949.\n\nUltra-Kinetic and Cut Like a TV Commercial (like just about everything else Today), it Seems to Embrace the Attention Span Deficit as though it is Sacrosanct and Young People Cannot Live with a Micro-Second of Reflection. This Works for Awhile but can be Overwhelming to Anyone Needing to Take a Breath.\n\nIronically, the Movie Comes to a Crashing Halt when Live Actors Show Up, Things Slow Way Down, and the Final Fifteen Minutes Go from Wacky to Completely Out of Whack. It's Light Speed Pacing Collides with a Brick Wall and Never Recovers.\n\nThe Film Could have been a Complete and Persistent Piece of Art Without the Worn Out Preaching from an Unenlightened Dad and the Writers. It is a Flaw that is just too Big to Ignore and Drags the Thing Down to a Normal Level that the Movie Abandoned So Well.\n\nUntil then the Audience was in a Completely Different Time-Space Continuum and One Wonders Why such a Misstep was Included.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always said the best kind of animated films are films that can only be done with animation. Toy Story, for example, is a film that would not work in anything but animation, while a film like Shrek could be done with live actors and makeup. The Lego Movie is more of the former. This film is just filled to the brim with interesting characters, great visuals, and a hilarious script.\n\nEmmett, the Lego mini-figure this film follows, is one of the most interesting and deep \"chosen ones\" since Harry Potter, and you really do root for him throughout the film. Liam Neeson's Bad Cop is another interesting character, mostly because of how conflicted and deep his character is for a film about Legos.\n\nThe film, being CGI but using Legos for everything, looks amazing. The best visual scenes is where the characters are in the ocean and the blocks move around like waves, and the end where you really see how much effort went into making this film.\n\nHowever, the film would really only be OK if it was not for the script. The Lego Movie could be the best comedy I have seen in a long time, and it almost all thanks to one character. Batman. Batman literally has some of the greatest lines of any comedic character since Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, he is that good.\n\nBesides the great script, the film is just a huge love letter to being a kid at heart and playing with your toys. At the end, the film began to hit home for me and I really began to feel for the main character and the villain as well. The way our generation views Toy Story will be how this generation views The Lego Movie. One of the best animated films in a long time."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is an atrociously boringly unfunny and predictable movie, though it's beautifully shot. All the faults lie with writers and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\n\nThe synopsis of the movie is pretty decent and should have resulted in a good movie. A regular Lego construction worker, Emmet, finds out that he's the master builder of an ancient prophecy that states he'll save the world from the craggle and Lord Business.\n\nWhere the story falls short is the overused and clich\u00e9d jokes and characters and they were telegraphed so early you knew they were coming. For example, Emmet has only had one original design idea - a double- decker sofa; so when asked to build something when they are trying to escape from Bad-Cop and his minions, he builds (you guessed it) his double-decker sofa while everybody else builds the submarine; then when the sub is destroyed by Bad-Cop guess what survives... yep, you're right the sofa. I was groaning and shaking my head. All too predictable.\n\nNext major fault is the direction, there are lots of scenes that are dragged out too long, in particular, the scene where Bad-Cop / Good-Cop (which was a very inventive idea) is interrogating Emmet. Bad-Cop gets angry and goes mental and kicks a chair around the room. It's not that funny a scene and it becomes boring quite quickly as the directors stretch the sequence out and actually diminishes the scene.\n\nAnother thing the films suffers with is the vocal talents. With the exception of Will Arnet as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, and Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, the rest of the voices just don't quite fit their character. I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell though I have to admit he's not too bad here as he reigns in some of his outlandishness. However, he should have been more intimidating, mean, and menacingly voiced for his character of Lord Business. I felt embarrassed for Morgan Freeman as he sounded tired, for the most part, in his rendition of Vitruvius. Then there was the grating and annoying tones of Unikitty, played by Amanda Brie, who had me reaching for the remote and the off button. I did like the way that they incorporated original voices into the cast as C3P0 was voiced by Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando - shame they couldn't do it with the rest of the \"Known\" cast.\n\nThe only good thing this film had going for it was the Lego itself and it's CGI generation. Had the rest of the film been as good these scenes it would have been a masterpiece of filmmaking. However special effects cannot carry a film alone.\n\nTo be honest I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. There are a lot of much better kids films out there... So go treat yourself and watch one of them. I wouldn't even push this for the Batman element, even though he's one of the main good elements he's still not enough... and he even starts to wear thin as the movie progresses... I'm now a little worried for The Lego Batman Movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Lego Movie\", directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.\n\nThis would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.\n\nStill, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by \"The Matrix\" (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.\n\nYet this is never enough to sour \"The Lego Movie\", which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be."

Emmet is an everyman construction worker who works for the Octan Corporation, the only company in the very conformist Legoland and whose president is the evil Lord Business (for a movie that includes a brand in its title, its tone is surprisingly anti corporate). When Emmet unexpectedly finds a piece called the Piece of Resistance (whom a Gandalf-like wizard called Vitruvius has prophesied would be found by the chosen one who would overthrow the tyranny of Lord Business), he is sought by the henchmen of Lord Business, while he is helped in his escape by the rebel girl Wildstyle. Funny and entertaining (the movie includes an extended part of a Lego Batman), surprisingly profound at times (the movie in some way is a paean to common man Emmet) and with nods to such films as The Truman Show and The Matrix. The dazzling computer animation and the intelligent script help a lot. Among the actors giving voice to the animated characters are Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. Towards the end, two human actors (including Ferrell) appear to give the plot a tight ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie in 2014 with my uncle in 2014 for my 19th birthday. Weird right? Well that's besides the point. I thought I was going to get a really cool epic awesome movie for kids based off a fun toy with a punch. Too bad there is no punch part. Let's get into why this is the 3rd most overrated animated film of all time.\n\n-STORY- The story of Lego Star Wars would have worked on paper. It has the set up. A world built. It's basically about a little Lego man who is too normal for his own good. So one day a Deus Ex Machina in female Lego form comes from the heavens to save the red pilled Legoman and whisk him off to become a hero. A somebody. Meanwhile, the evil President Business or whatever is plotting an evil attack to make the world normal or conformist or something by gluing all the character's feet down on Taco Tuesday. Now the protagonist must save the world by getting a team of unlikely heroes straight out of the Wizard of Oz. But not because they are pop culture references made to sell more Lego toys after the movie is over.\n\nThey basically save the world by being creative. The challenge here is that Steve is anything but creative. Which is funny. That is basically the only funny part for anyone over the age of 11 because the rest of the story seams to not have very funny jokes. The story basically has the characters win by default. After all if I forgot to tell you, this is a chosen one story which is a dumb cliche and is probably written ironically, (just like every piece of dialogue in this film)\n\nThe conflict between President Business and Steve boil down to daddy issues. I'm not even joking that the resolution happens to be that the real life son has a dead beat dad played by the hilarious HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH FUnny manchild Will Ferrell who has his own creation of Legoland or Legotopia or whatever. The dad turns out to be president Beezwax and wants to glue down the world for perfection. But the two realize they can be creative together.\n\nNone of the things could be explained in this film other than Legos. No science. Just pop culture references.\n\nHonestly, if I watched it the second time. Maybe I'd truly love it. Because as of now I don't. I'm sorry but this movie has a mediocre story. Almost any Pixar movie is better.\n\n5/10\n\n-CHARACTERS- Steve is a character that is nice but too Mickey Mouse for his own good. He is blah. So he must transform and know the truth. Now which of the 2 things do you think he does? That's right he learns the truth. But he does like I said become more creative even though any other character could do better.\n\nWyldestyle- She is cool, probably the best character. She is a hot goth chick Lego.\n\nBatman- The film's sweetheart. But really he isn't even that funny. He's actually trying to hard to be childish that it isn't funny by pointing out the tropes of what Batman does best. I hate the cynical irony it has. It's like 2000's making fun of the 1980's and not showing any love. He does cool stuff. That's it. He's annoying.\n\nUnikitty- She's a funny little sidekick that is too cute for her own good that it's annoying.\n\nVitruvius- The oracle voiced by Morgan Freeman and it's HAHAHAHAHAHADHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Awesome le Epic. Not not really.\n\nPresident Beezwax- He is supposed to be a menacing villian but he just like 90% of the characters comes off as childish.\n\nGood Cop Bad Cop- The main antagonist of the story. He get's his good side taken away. He's pretty cool for a lego.\n\n7/10 I think you'll like them\n\n-ANIMATION- In terms of art this movie is truely amazing. I've never seen a studio try to Mimic childhood stop motion animation movies through computers. It was so amazing. The lighting effects. Every location looked unique. That's all it really had going for it.\n\n-SOUND- As I said before the dialogue is trying to hard to be childish ironically. But the Sound is unrivaled. I can't stop singing that stupid song everything is awesome.\n\n-FINAL VIRDICT I couldn't get into to the Lego Movie. Try as I might, but I feel that I'd rather play with Legos than watch a badly written film about them.\n\nAt least it's better than the Emoji movie."

Though I'm always skeptical of celebrity voice acting, all the actors do a great job here, especially Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Will Ferrell.\n\nThe story riffs on the oft-used \"chosen one saves the world\" plot and comes across as something a child would make up as they went along. It is this quality that transports the viewer back to his or her own childhood. I didn't much play with Legos as a kid, but I do remember using my dolls and whatever else was around to create crazy characters and adventures.\n\nA wonderful flick. Do make sure to see it in a packed theater, because the mirth and laughter are absolutely infectious."

It was obvious the directors knew what story they were telling and never let it become an over sized advert. The film was totally intrinsic, there never was a scene that felt totally out of place or irrelevant to the plot, all be it there was some quite irritating plot exposition, but it worked well with the tongue and cheek style of the film none the the less. What is most interesting about 'Lego Movie' is that it isn't flat, everything felt lively, it always had something to say whether it was about today's ideals of fitting in or the implications of parenthood.It never falls into generic child fare instead transcends above that and, while comedic, gives quite poignant moments.\n\nDespite all its incredibly minor flaws The Lego movie was an incredibly enjoyable, sometimes poignant, ecstatically funny, intelligently rich piece of children's cinema. Worth a view and a 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I could see someone having some small problems with The Lego Movie, but if you leave saying, \"I didn't like that\", you are lying. This is an immensely likable, even lovable, comedy. Full of childlike ingenuity and imagination, it manages to be a pretty blatant Lego commercial while also being a critique of the museum-like treatment of Legos in modern times and a promotion of learning to play again. But most of all, it's just plain fun. Combining elements of Toy Story, Time Bandits, Naked Gun, and \"Adventure Time\", this is by far the most vibrant and funny movie of 2014. It's the story of a construction worker learning to break from his every day, humdrum existence to bring uniqueness back to his world. In order to do this, he must join a slew of pop culture icons, which looks like comic-con threw up Legos. The spoof like humor and great non-sequiturs are the bread and butter, offering constant and consistent laughs. However, the movie succeeds in so many other ways: it's a uniquely shot action movie, makes poignant points about thinking for yourself, and has some great commentary on the difference between truth and cynicism. Even with some potentially heavy-handed schmaltz at the end, the movie manages to just plain work. Perhaps the most impressive part is the animation, which is oddly and insanely beautiful, sticking to the limitation of real Legos. On whole, TLM is a uniquely refreshing experience, laugh-out-loud funny, and stacks of pure awesomeness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Living in Montreal, I worked for Mega Brands, Lego's #1 competitor in the world of construction toys. I spent the entire day with \"builders\" and \"designers\" who - like me - had always loved playing with Lego toys. They were brilliant people creating amazing toys with bricks, showing creativity and passion for toys and Lego.\n\nSo you can imagine that when I went to see the Lego Movie, my expectations were pretty high... and I was not disappointed one bit! Not only is it always fun to see iconic toys you played with being brought to life on screen, but also they actually wrote a script for the movie. I was expecting a simple use of a famous brand to make some dollars like the many catastrophes we've seen lately in theatres - Battleship, Transformers, and to some minor extent G.I. Joe. But luckily for us grown-up kids, they took good care of their bricks, our bricks, our Lego.\n\nThe story can be seen at different levels and refers to different layers of pop culture, literature, and art. This is why the movie is completely accessible to children, and definitely not boring for teens and adults; so you can make it a family moment, or just a you time. Up to you! And for once, Will Ferell actually serves the story in an efficient way instead of being a 90s evade from SNL who never really escaped his home TV show.\n\nSo yes, I would completely recommend it to viewers of all ages, from all places, and of course, to you Lego fans out there. We're a huge crowd!"

It went from really good, to great, to amazing!! The underlying message that's conveyed is a truly special one and the surprise ending put it way over the top!! This isn't just a great animation movie, the story behind it all is fantastic. It's fun, energetic, positive and 'everything is awesome'!! I fully recommend it!!

        "review_detailed_main": "Coming in to a movie called \"The Lego Movie\" made me instantly assume I was in for a full-length product placement of a toy brand that, frankly, I was not completely enamored with when I was a kid. If this is indeed an extended Lego commercial as the title suggests, then consider me bought because I have just witnessed one of the best animated features in many years.\n\nFrom the creators of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller constructed a relentlessly funny and hyperactive animated romp with a surprising final act that is emotional, inspiring and imaginative.\n\nMixing slick animation with slapstick comedy, as well as intelligent script full of zippy zingers delivered one after the other, the movie may appeal as much to nostalgic adult male audiences reminiscing their childhood Lego blocks, as well as young viewers who will be engrossed by the spectacular visuals and a lineup of hilarious and familiar characters from DC comics, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings doing their comedic turn amongst fresh and equally entertaining original characters.\n\nMinor Spoilers .....\n\nThe story is simple. It is about Emmet (Chris Pratt), a simple ordinary construction guy who listens to pop music (in this case \"Everything is Awesome\" a juvenile bubblegum pop that is also disturbingly catchy), pays expensive coffee and strictly follows Lego's instruction manual to live his life of daily routines.\n\nThe leader of this Matrix-like world is President Business (Will Ferrell). He keeps everything in place, so determined in fact he plans on literally using Kragle glue to keep everyone's feet firmly attached to the ground.\n\nEnter Wyldstyles, (Elizabeth Banks), our free spirited tomboyish heroine who also happens to be dating Batman, (Will Arnett). She meets Emmet and the adventure into the fascinating world of Lego begins.\n\nThe movie is downright riotous and chaotic, clearly reflecting how Lego is supposedly played. One second the screen is littered with pieces of Lego blocks, then an ocean of super creative buildings, planes and fascinating background that will inspire one's creative imagination.\n\nThis movie should be experienced in all its 3D glory.\n\nThe Lego Movie reminds us that the power of imagination and teamwork can go together in the process of building and creation, a message so simple yet surprisingly uncommon not just in animated features but movies in general."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, don,t get met wrong on my summary for it is a positive one. A movie about a toy product? Some would say it would be ridiculous, but if it is, this one is ridiculously awesome!!!\n\nLike the what the theme song in the trailer said, everything here is awesome: the animation, the characters, the theme, and the twist.\n\nThe animation here is very good. I don't really know if it's stop-motion or computer-generated, but it's pleasing to the eyes. It looks like the came zoomed in on lego toys. And you can see different locations made out of lego---the Wild West, the Middle Zealand, the city, the place in the cloud which I forgot what its name was. With everything made of Lego (even the waters are made of it, not kidding), the whole movie looks like a giant exhibit on Legoland.\n\nThe main character in the movie is Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt, who is just a regular guy wanting to be special. He's the scene-stealer because you really feel for him. Of course, there's also other characters voiced by famous actors like Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, and many more. But the side character I like the most is the Bad Cop (not Batman coz he's a dick in this movie). Voiced by Liam Neeson, he a cop with two sides: good and bad. He's bad but he's also good and hey, it's pleasing to hear Liam's voice in an animated movie.\n\nThe cameos of different lego characters is where I laughed the most. I'm not gonna spoil for it you but there's superheroes, athletes, space dude whose partner is a hairy creature, poet, president, etc.\n\nWhat's most important in this movie is the theme. It's centered on the product and for the people who owns legos and other toys--specially the older ones. Also not gonna say it. You have to watched to movie to find out.\n\nI didn't expect that this movie would have an emotional kick in the final act. The last 20 minutes left me with teary eyes like just like what the ending of Toy Story 3 did to me. And going home, I felt like I just wanna play with my toys.\n\nOverall, this is a must-watch for kids and adults and I will tell you this: Everything in this movie is awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood has a protracted history of taking adored treasures of yesteryears and adapting them into feature films. Suffice to say, results have varied. Instances include the much-maligned Transformers series and the G.I. Joe movies amongst various others.\n\nThe Lego Movie is the latest attempt to bring a beloved relic to the screen. Its immediate success lies in not succumbing to the dangerous precedent of being blatant product placement. Featuring an original story, The Lego Movie is surprisingly heartfelt and authentic, as opposed to an exercise in brand expansion (looking at you, Transformers).\n\nThe latest offering from Phil Lord and Chris Miller, directors of the imaginative albeit poorly titled Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the wildly rambunctious 21 Jump Street, follows the journey of Emmet (Chris Pratt), a construction worker who faces the unenviable task of saving the lego citizens from the evil ploy of the autocratic President Business (Will Ferrell). It becomes crystal clear that the directing duo has a great handle on comedy, as all the pieces fall into place (apologies for the pun).\n\nAn essential element of any animated feature is undoubtedly the voice work. Herein lies the movies' triumph. An impressive list of actors with expertise in the genre has lent their voices to the project. Among the standout performers are Will Arnett as the uber-awesome Batman and Liam Neeson as a schizophrenic police chief. The latter is not usually associated with comedy but delivers a pleasant performance nonetheless. Chris Pratt also excels as a reluctant hero thrust into the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, another profound facet of The Lego Movie is the creativity and artistry employed by the makers, who have given meticulous attention to detail. Each frame is composed solely of lego bricks. In fact, the team of graphic designers painstakingly built this world using more than fifteen million lego bricks, before using CGI to achieve the finished product. The image quality is also genuinely enhanced by the use of 3D, which is not just a marketing gimmick.\n\nYet another quality of the animated feature is that it appeals to a wide ranging audience. Since it involves several amusing gags, is laden with pop culture references and even stimulates nostalgia for lego users, particularly the old ones, it is likely to garner appreciation from adults as well.\n\nIn the age of sequels, spin-offs and remakes galore, The Lego Movie is a welcome antidote. It does not act solely as an elaborate toy commercial nor does it render 3D technology futile. Instead, it exudes charm and wit usually associated with Pixar.\n\nMuch like its catchy theme song, The Lego Movie is awesome. It proceeds like a child's imagination running wild and serves as a throwback for adults who may have dabbled with their own lego sets back in the day."

For all its craziness, it's very well thought out.\n\nMost of the way through this movie I would have given it 8 stars, but the final sequences are so utterly brilliant and unexpected that I had to give it 9."

So let's start with the story, while being a little clunky at times it's still very enjoyable and the story behind why all this is happening (and I won't spoil it) made this movie go from good to great. Too amazing. The animation in this movie is so incredibly creative. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING including smoke, water and explosions are made with LEGOS. I would've never thought to do something like that and I loved it. Enough that I saw this movie in theaters twice on the same day just cause I wanted to see all of that again. The over the top animation of the characters with the acting is hilarious. In the words of the movie's theme song, everything is awesome!"

I honestly believe that a lot can be taken from this title for everyone - young and old. It is a nice recap on your childhood as well which was an added bonus. Unlike some other good films where they can start off promising only to slightly veer off - this is certainly not the case with The Lego Movie, this film actually gets better as the film progresses building up to a great fun/action packed finale. I would fully recommend this to all the family."

        "review_detailed_main": "These days, too many movies are made with one eye on their merchandising potential. Tie-ins and merch - toys/books/Happy McMeals - are planned with as much gravity and focus as, well, the actual plot of a film. That's why The LEGO Movie should invite the greatest scepticism: it's a movie literally built out of LEGO, every kid's favourite infinitely- connectable toy bricks. It's a franchise masquerading as a film, and should be derided as such... right? Well, not quite. As it turns out, The LEGO Movie has fast become one of the best-reviewed films of the year - and for very good reason. Smart, inventive and truly hilarious, it's proof that a purely commercial enterprise can still earn genuine, heartfelt delight from audiences.\n\nEmmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is a perfectly ordinary LEGO figure - the kind of dude who tries really hard to fit in (ha!) and follows the instruction manual to the letter. He has no idea, of course, that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) has cooked up a nefarious scheme to bring permanent order to the LEGO universe, and that Master Builders across the galaxies are banding together in wait for the foretold Special: the Master Builder who will save them all. When Emmet accidentally bumps into spunky Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), he picks up the mythical Piece Of Resistance: the fabled relic that will stop Lord Business in his tracks.\n\nCue hijinks galore as Emmet is mistaken for the Special and swiftly swept up in an underground movement spearheaded by Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a wise, elderly Master Builder with a (stereo)typically sonorous voice. Emmet must find a way to save the world - something he's not sure he's qualified to do, especially when he's in the company of such diverse superheroes as Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Abraham Lincoln (Will Forte), Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders) and... uh, sparkling, rainbow-bright Unikitty (Alison Brie).\n\nThe chipper, joyful tone adopted by The LEGO Movie is what makes it such an utter delight to watch. Not only does the film trundle through one huge, action-packed set-piece after another (all gloriously executed in a combination of CGI and stop-motion animation), it's also shot through with a streak of cheerful, anarchic humour. Jokes fly thick and fast across the screen, packed so tightly together that if any one fails, there are about five more turning up in quick succession. It's hard to begrudge the film anything when its version of Batman is moody, broody, and willing to deal only in sombre-coloured bricks. This cheeky blend of irreverence and humour means that adults will find themselves every bit as entertained as the kids in the audience.\n\nIt's even more remarkable when the plot unfolds to display in full its surprisingly meta-rich complexity. Turns out that the toy franchise's many LEGO lines - each with its own story and characters - gets to play a part as Emmet and Wyldstyle go hunting for an answer to the world's dilemma. Even more impressively, the world of LEGO is effectively deconstructed in the film's third act and placed firmly in the hands of anyone who's ever tried to make something out of these little toy bricks - from carefree kids to obsessed adults. It plays on precisely what makes the brand so appealing: the seemingly endless potential wrapped up in these LEGO worlds, limited only by one's imagination.\n\nThe character work in the film is sublime, augmented by a wonderful cast of voice actors. Emmet - an everyman brimming with cheer and promise - suits Pratt to a T, and Banks struts her stuff as the independent, kickass Wyldstyle. Arnett is a highlight, his trademark deep voice played up to hilarious effect in Batman mode. The cast even includes sly winks to movie franchises (reuniting 21 Jump Street's Tatum with his co-star Jonah Hill, who voices Superman's super-fan, Green Lantern) and the clever-old-codger trope (Freeman is clearly having a blast as the slightly bonkers Vitruvius), while providing Liam Neeson with more acting range than he's had in a while as Lord Business' henchman, a cop with a personality split between good and bad.\n\nNot every element of The LEGO Movie works perfectly - in the tumult of surreal comedy and surprisingly emotional plot, not all the bits fit together quite as perfectly as they should. It's a mite predictable, for instance, that Emmet and Wyldstyle inevitably fall in love despite her ongoing relationship with the self-absorbed Batman. But it's impossible to get too upset about it when the final result is packed with so much silly, cheerful fun. In the words of the film's upbeat theme tune, \"Everything is AWESOME!\" And so it is - for the most part."

Also the star power gave this movie an added bonus because it was fun to try and figure out the actor behind the animated Lego character. The social commentary was excellent and now you may be wondering why I am not giving this movie a 10. This is because I went in already assuming this movie was going to be great therefore when it was stunning I was left without some of the aw that I thought I would have. Also it felt like the whole theater seemed to force themselves to laugh at the jokes just wanting the movie to be as great as they hoped which toke something from the film.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie was a very well done, and relevant children's movie that will also be very enjoyable for adults. This movie was a long time coming and they did a great job recreating a living Lego universe. This was everything I was hoping it would be and more.\n\nThis movie really made me feel like I was a child again. The plot was very well thought out and really felt like it brought to life what we were all thinking when we were playing with Lego's as kids. I really felt immersed in this world as I watched it.\n\nAll of the acting in the film was great, although cheesy at times (unpurpose). Will Ferrell really stands out for me as President/Lord Business as the main antagonist in the film. He's so ridiculous in his role that it's outstanding. It seemed he had a real interest in this project. I felt it was his best work in a few years. The real gem here though is the story. That is what makes this movie so special.\n\nI loved the fact that they were able to bring in many of the modern licensed products such as Lord of the Rings, DC Superheros, Star Wars etc. into the film. My only complaint might be that some of the larger properties, particularly those owned by Disney, were not in the film and some Lego owned properties, such as Ninjago, which are larger properties weren't in it all either. This is a minor complaint as at least some of this probably wasn't something they could really control. I doubt Disney would want a competing film featuring any of their characters.\n\nThe animation was really fantastic. It felt like I was watching living Lego pieces rather than an animated movie. I think this movie may not have been as effective if it was attempted even 5 years ago as the animation technology had to be just right.\n\nIn the end, The Lego Movie lives up to your expectations and delivers a very well done movie to go along with a much loved brand. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this movie right up until the finishing touches in order to make sure the movie did Lego justice. Well done to all involved as I'm sure a new lucrative franchise that will be much loved has been born."

        "review_detailed_main": "What could have been the easiest commercial bursts with energy and creativity to form a brilliant film throughout. From the moment this film begins, heart is immediately implemented, allowing the audience to fall in love with a loveable cast of characters that feel relatable and charismatic. Despite the child-friendly aspects it presents, lies mature themes of creativity, imagination, and belief in oneself generating accessibility for any age range. The fast, manic energy of colors and animation accompanied by self-aware comedy provides for an enjoyable time. It truly goes to show that when creative minds are behind the camera, and passion is felt for a project, the simplest of concepts can become masterful in execution. Despite the amount of love that is felt in every scene, the film can at times feel generic with its redundant plot and formula, making for a predictable route. However, the film manages to somewhat work through these concepts by creating animation that breathes life into a world of generic animated movies. Presenting complex themes, loveable characters, and a fun time, this film manages to deliver an experience most animated films lack, uniqueness and originality."

I don't see them just because of the kids. This one is among the best and I will try to explain why:\n\n#It is brilliantly animated. Really, those seem \"real\" Lego, down to the fingerprints on Emmet. The animation called for a lot of imagination to recreate blockbuster action \"special effects\" by using only Lego!\n\n# It is heart warming. The are truly naive animation sequences (you smile to the ingenuity portrayed) and the originality of the master builders is, well, awesome. This is an ode to the imagination of a child and the lost ability of adults to see with those dreamer eyes. You will remind yourself of that time.\n\n# It is smart. It has tons of references to Lego history and pop culture. It has jokes to all. It portrays criticism to western way of living, TV culture, capitalism... It makes you think.\n\n#It is funny. Some jokes seem like they are made for you, because of the multiple references to movies, characters, everyday life situations.\n\nI truly enjoyed this movie. It has all the elements right. It feels like a great idea brilliantly explored and polished to perfection. Awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "As if progressing from such experiences as Scott Pilgrim and Wreck-It Ralph, The Lego Movie fully embraces its decision to simple exist that what we get is magical, insane, inspiring, childish and so unbelievably happy. I had a stupid, stupid grin on my face constantly.\n\nEmmett is a construction worker living in a world of regimented order, social control and live literally by the book (they have instruction manuals on how to live.) But when an evil tyrant called Lord Business looks to glue their world together, he discovers that a prophecy deems him \"The Special\" and will save the world from a fate worse than death.\n\nWhat's incredible about The Lego Movie is how even critics like it. I'll be honest, perhaps a quarter of the way through I was asking myself: \"What am I actually watching?? This is literally an insane concept! Stupid.\" But those thoughts left as quickly as they came... A movie about Lego couldn't be (and shouldn't be) anything other than this!\n\nThis film is never on the rails; it is permanently unhinged and borderline surreal. We have wonderful animation techniques (CG stop-motion) that capture the plastic and printed nature of the toy, that looks charming up close and dissolves into absolute chaos when the bricks start flying! It becomes such a joy to watch, despite how airhead and loopy it is. You have tonnes of cameos too, Lego have rights to almost everything and here they do not pull their punches. Batman is a main character, Wonder Woman, Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Lincoln, Gandalf, even Shaquille O'Neal, all feature.\n\nThat should be your inner child sated, kids will love it. But if I may delve a little further, this movie's theme actually speaks about Lego as a creative medium too! What's more devastating in a child's mind than someone + gluing Lego pieces together?? That's terrible, and in terms of Lego plight that's as evil as it can be! The film goes further still, but I wouldn't want to tell you everything.\n\nIt is utter madness and there's a lot to be said about how it is a nonsense stitched together with a generic prophetic \"zero-to-hero\" storyline... But really, it says \"The Lego Movie\" on your ticket, this is what you should expect and, and a little bit more!"

I do not know if it was real stop motion, all computer, or the more likely combination of the 2 but the look is pure real lego all the way through. It is silly and fun and very well written with a great voice cast and some good self aware humor thrown in for the adults. This works both as a kid movie and an adult movie. If you like stop motion animation then this will probably be a no brainer choice to go see but for those on the fence I highly recommend it. A rare breed of lighthearted kids oriented comedy that doesn't talk down to the audience. Very well done and if you get a chance go see it in 3D, some very good use of it here. I predict this will have cult status in a few years."

I was brought back to my own childhood and my own little collection of Lego. I also loved the idea behind everything. As I do not wanna spoil anything for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, I will not go into detail. I will only say this - it was lighthearted and funny, yet slightly touching and with a great moral behind all of it. If you are slightly doubtful whether to watch it or not, just go for it and relax cause... everything is awesome!\n\nP.S.

        "review_detailed_main": "2014 is that rare year where Pixar and Disney don't release a new film. While that makes me sad, I have a theory that the other studios decided, \"hey let's put out our best films\". So now we have Dragons 2 and The Lego Movie dominating our screens. In The Lego Movie, we follow Emmet, a completely plain Lego construction worker living his day to day life by the rules. That is, until he get's involved in this grand quest with a fellowship of Lego Warriors to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. We've all seen this plot before, and this movie knows it. I LOVE this film, it's so smartly written and full of laughs. It feels like watching a really great Disney movie. You never have that feeling of \"blah been there done that\" and thats because the movie has all these pop culture references, breathtaking animation, and there's plenty of humor for us grown folk. The cast is made up of some pretty well known names; Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, and Will Arnett are a few, but it was Morgan Freeman and Liam freaking Neeson that show some great voice acting skills. As I said, the animation is mind blowing but beautiful to look at honestly. Believe me when I say EVERYTHING, even the explosions are made of Legos! If you couldn't tell by now, I was pretty amazed by this movie. The ending, was what made this a great animation movie. It hit me hard and surprised me. Kids will love it, adults will have a good time too. This is definitely worth a purchase, and I didn't even get into how awesome Batman is in this one. Awesome little Star Wars collab in this one."

Lego, Playmobil and action figures gave me thousands of hours of fun because I was able to create these really insane worlds where all these toys would interact. The stories I imagined were all more preposterous than the other but in my mind they were all as epic as Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings. And here we have a film that encapsulates all of that imagination in one story. The story is not important, it's bad against good but it's a fun unique out of the many story with twists and turns you would expect. The story has many action movie tropes such as a prophecy, a meeting of heroes, a \"heist\" and battles. This movie definitely was made for children in mind but adults will enjoy this film nonetheless with the many pop culture references and nostalgia linked with these imaginative toys. I still wish I had this sort of imagination and watching this film was having it back for an hour and a half."

The Lego Movie!\n\nThe LEGO Movie is a 3D animated film which follows lead character, Emmet a completely ordinary LEGO mini-figure who is identified as the most \"extraordinary person\" and the key to saving the Lego universe. Emmet and his friends go on an epic journey to stop the evil tyrant, Lord Business\n\nSo, when I was a kid, I was a big fan of legos. I was playing with them all the time. But now, when I saw this movie, I am thinking:\" Well, I still have my legos under the bed.\"\n\nThere is a fantastic crew of actors here. We have Will Arnett (Batman voice), Elizabeth Banks (Wyldstyle), Will Forte (Abraham Lincoln), Jonah Hill (Green Lantern), Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius), Dave Franco (Wally) and, of course, Liam Neeson (Bad Cop/Good Cop). And all of them done well. I wasn't expecting this much.\n\nHumour in this movie is for everyone. There are jokes that kids can understand, but parents and older crew will laugh as well. There was one joke that really reminds me of \"Two and a half man\", and it was, of course, \"Honey,where are my pants?\"\n\nAlso, song \"Everything is awesome\" is as well, awesome. It's so catchy that I must share it on facebook. The song is not complicated and it's good rhythm.\n\nThere is a lot of clich\u00e9s, but with everything mentioned up here, that's nothing. Some of clich\u00e9s really reminds me of \"Ice Age\" series which were having a lot of clich\u00e9s as well.\n\nSo, this movie is really entertaining commercial for legos, but commercial with humor and good acting crew. Definitely recommending it to everyone!"

Of course there are the many different worlds in the Lego worlds, but that isn't all, as you can guess by the 'Man from upstairs'.\n\nThe plot is good. It is of course simple, but what do you expect from a movie that suits for the whole family.\n\nThe humour is amazing - it has many different types of humour, since it's meant for people of all ages to enjoy.\n\nAnd the animation! I loved it, it looks so much fun compared to the typical Disney Pixar -type of animation.\n\nDefinitely a good movie. It should have won the Academy Award for best animation, simply because it's so much fun and it feels like there are so many different philosophical themes one could talk of."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego movie is a fresh take on the predictable cartoon storyline of recent years. The film displays an array of outrageous ideas capturing both the minds of adults and kids alike. The humor is combined with immense creativity just like the Lego blocks the movie depicts. Small gags and stand-up comedy is scattered throughout the entire adventure. Overall it is a solid animated movie that is fun to watch and leaves you feeling satisfied.\n\nThe Lego movie shows the adventures of an average citizen named Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt. Emmet begins his journey as a Lego construction worker, mindlessly following the directions and building the high-rises of the big city. After falling into a large hole by mistake, he stumbles upon a piece of red plastic the looks different from the rest of the Lego pieces. Emmet later learns that the strange object is called \"The Piece of Resistance.\" Because of this, Emmet is mistakenly labeled as the \"Chosen One,\" who is supposed to save Lego City from the evil Lord Business. Like the other citizen living under the constraints of Lego city, Emmet has been brainwashed to follow an exact set of rules. The Lego citizens all watch the sitcom Where's My Pants, all have the same favorite song \"Everything is awesome,\" and are all programmed to never break the laws. Longing for a chance to feel unique, he goes on with the legend of the \"chosen one\" until people began to find out he really doesn't possess the skills needed. Not to be setback by this problem though Emmet slowly learns to craft his own unique skills into something useful.\n\nThe Lego move sports a set of high profile characters. As one of the heroes Batman/Bruce Wayne is voiced by Will Arnett. Morgan freeman plays Vitruvius, a blind prophet who guides Emmet on his journey. There are cameos from Superman (Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman, The Green Lantern (Jonah Hill), Dumbledore, Gandalf, and Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal). Part of the entertainment of the Lego Movie is seeing all these franchises that have been licensed by Lego over the year. Where else can you find all these similar voices and characters in a single movie?\n\nThroughout the movie the screen is bursting with pop culture references and subtleties. It will take multiple times watching the movie to catch them all. The intentional stop-motion style results in scenes that actually look like they were built out of Legos. This gives the appearance that every piece was painstakingly moved for each shot, creating this jumpy feel that adds a sense of realism. The fire, water, and sands in the desert are all Lego bricks. Large waves that splash over the side of the boat disperse into Lego studs. On top of that small cracks and scrapes are etched in, like the 80s space man who has a cracked chin guard. The insane ideas and realistic looks took me back to the 10 year old me playing Legos on the carpet floor.\n\nJust when you think that this train ride of adventure and comedy begins to drag on too long, the movie takes a dramatic twist and adds a whole new element into the mix, enriching the already great story by adding another dimension both physically and metaphorically. You will have to watch the movie to find out.\n\nAll in all, this movie is jam-packed with entertaining scenes and comedy, whether you love Legos or have never touched them, this movie is 100 minutes well worth the time."

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 3/22/2014 --- 3 out of 10(Dir-Phil Lord & Christopher Miller): Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie based on a created Lego world with interesting animation trying to simulate what it would be like if Lego creations were alive. The story is about a normal guy being given the title of savior of a soon to be destroyed world(which is a much used theme). This Lego person named Emmett is a construction worker in a very formalized society who basically has to now think for himself as the savior and new master builder. This is not an easy transition for him and the movie uses this for comedic effect. Will Ferrell provides a voice over of the evil character in the story who wants things to stay the way that they are. Ferrell also has a brief real-life cameo and provides the best thing, in my opinion, in the movie \u2013 a song that rolls during the credits about darkness that he ad-libs as he goes. When a credits song is the best thing in the movie than you know it has problems, and this basically is my resolve(it is one big problem). An idea for a movie, complicated and without humor then becomes an overly expensive mess. My question is why was this movie even made ?? I really don't even think kids will get thru the movie without becoming bored. The animation may hold them for a little while but the complications in the plot will drop them from caring very quickly. Avoid this one."

Some of the best scenes include where Emmet realizes what he is able to do or to grab inspiration from all his debacles.The main point of appreciation goes to all those legendary actors who voiced the characters of Vitruvius,BadCop and GoodCop,Batman ad also the others.

The whole idea sounds bizarre on paper. Its actually lo-fi CGI with added inventiveness. So a clone worker is suddenly mixing it up with Batman, Gandalf and Han Solo (all legoised) as well as fighting the evil Lord Business.\n\nThe film then switches track with its underlying message that kids just want to have fun with toys and play with them rather than dad having a prized collection, all neat and tidy. Something I might be guilty of myself according to my offspring!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite its blatant marketing ploy and brand-oriented message, The Lego Movie is a delectable postmodern melange of pop-culture references, irreverent genre pastiche and elegant hyper-realist animation.\n\nThe casting is inspired. Chris Pratt is perfect as the hapless, bumbling protagonist (his predictable, generic style suits the role fittingly), Morgan Freeman excels in his overly familiar but enduringly effective wise-man role and Will Ferrell is hilarious just being Will Ferrell (when isn't he?). Complemented by strong performances from Elizabeth Banks and Liam Neeson, the cast is in good working shape.\n\nNot only a perceptive satire on the insidious perils of consumerist society (which alone couldn't sustain the adult appeal), but also a nostalgic homage to, and parody of, genres such as the Western, the Cop Thriller, the Superhero Movie (primarily D.C. it seems) etc., The Lego Movie sets up a number of levels of operation and sustains them successfully without tipping too far in any one direction.\n\nThe real genius of this film lies in the brilliant writer/director team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller whose razor-sharp scenario whips you along at just the right pace, somewhat in the vein of Edgar Wright (it shares a great deal in tone with that of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World).\n\nOverall, if you can survive being manipulated by a frustratingly clich\u00e9d 'message', and unfortunately you will be, then you will thoroughly enjoy this movie, as I did, for its many visual and conceptual treats."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't sure what to expect as I sat down to watch this movie, was it to be too childish, or will it be geared towards impressing adults also? Too heavy on the Lego promotion? Was it to have a solid story or be a weak mish-mash of brainless money spinning tripe? As the credits rolled at the end of the movie I can honestly say I have not been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in a long, long time. Hands down, it is fantastic.\n\nThe Lego Movie has heart, it has substance and great energy. It's clever, really clever and I appreciate the level of effort and thinking that has gone into making this movie. It is laugh out loud funny, not only in a slapstick way but also through witty dialogue and intelligent, sharp humour. The universe created for The Lego Movie is one of the greatest aspects, the attention to detail is fantastic and nothing ever looks out of place with some brilliantly witty props and surroundings. With spot on casting the Lego characters are brought to life, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all play their part especially well in their supporting roles.  The story is a simple one, easy to follow but is told in an imaginative and well paced with a good array of characters, clich\u00e9d but pleasant. It's the classic unassuming hero story, good vs potential evil with friendship and loyalty the driving points being the mission. There are plenty of funny moments, some surprisingly downbeat scenes and some well choreographed action sequences.\n\nMy only real negative is that I feel it was geared a little too heavily towards 3d viewing and when viewing in standard 2d it can feel a little over the top and choppy at times. It's clear which parts would look great in 3d but when viewed standard some scenes can look like quite poor animation.\n\nTowards the end, the movie makes a bold move, a move which could quite easily have backfired and undone all the greatness. Thankfully it was pulled off extremely well, delivering just how they wanted it to and didn't feel remotely wrong in any way.\n\nThe creators got it spot on. Promote Lego to the hills, kids will love so many aspects of it, adults will love it too and the money will come rolling in for sequels, this is a new Universe for the animation genre and I can see it continuing for many years to come. The Batman Lego Movie was released this year and with such an array of characters at their disposal, I expect to see plenty more movies in the future.\n\nA very solid 9/10"

There was so much to like in this movie, it was funny, creative, dramatic at points, fast paced, entertaining, and has a really good moral. There are cameos from some of our favorite characters that I won't dare spoil for anyone. And did I mention that it was funny, because it is, it's really, really funny. This is my kind of humor, fast paced with a lot of sarcastic moments that border on anti-humor. The characters, not just the copyrighted ones, are likable, entertaining and feel developed. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family, in fact there were only a couple of things I found wrong with the film at all.\n\nOne involved it's pacing, which is incredibly fast. For the most part it works and it does know to slow down once in a while, however sometimes a scene that should have been dramatic or slow paced goes by so fast or has so many jokes or jokes at the wrong moment that it ruins the drama. Then there is the ending, which while funny and very heartwarming seemed really confusing and brought up a lot of questions.\n\nYet this film is a blast from start to finish and I hope they make a sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is not recommended.\n\nLoud, hyperactive, and occasionally amusing, The LEGO Movie was surprisingly highly lauded by many critics and became a huge hit. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film tackles grandiose ideas of fascism, conformity, and corporate greed for the pre-school set, but the humor is mainly aimed for their parents with so many pop references and nostalgic touches.\n\nWith nice voice-over work by Chris Pratt, Will Farrell, and especially Will Arnett as the gravel- voiced Batman, The LEGO Movie has some satirical things to say, that is, whenever it calms down to say them. There is so many frenzied chase scenes and shoot-um-up sequences that they overpower the slim story.\n\nWe are dropped into Lego World where our hero, Emmet, a dim-witted but contented construction worker type runs into an evil dictator named President Business who wants to control this world. He unites the other Lego figures to fight with him against this tyrant.\n\nThe crude animation is a disappointment. One sees far more clever results on cable television's Cartoon Network or Matt Groeing's far superior Futurama or The Simpsons programs. While the computer generated / live action film stays within the confines of the Lego block design, this option also limits the creative spark. Movement is clunky and awkward like the short, stocky, and generally unappealing Lego figures themselves. The film seems rather schizophrenic, like one of its characters, a two faced Good Cop / Bad Cop figure. It wants to condemn big business and consumerism while willfully selling its product to anyone in the neighborhood.\n\nThe film resembles the noisy Transformers franchise, both in its overall look, sound design, and hectic movements, with its main goal being its tie-ins and product endorsements. In fact, The LEGO Movie appears to be one long commercial of Legos, by Legos, and for Legos, with a new shipment of characters arriving at the nearest toy store and a new sequel already in progress.

Especially as Lego fans, watching this move was extremely interesting and absolutely awesome for them. They totally and thoroughly enjoyed it. Animation is flawless.

        "review_detailed_main": "In the pantheon of films that manage to capture the essence of childhood wonder and the boundless creativity of the imagination, \"The Lego Movie\" stands as a towering achievement. It's a film that, with its kaleidoscope of colors and ceaseless energy, reminds us of the sheer joy of play. The narrative, a cleverly self-aware odyssey, follows Emmet, an everyman minifigure, who is as ordinary as one can be in a world constructed entirely of LEGO bricks. His journey from an unremarkable follower to a master builder is both a hero's quest and a metaphor for the awakening of creativity that lies dormant within us all.\n\nThe film's animation is a marvel to behold. It's a seamless blend of the tactile nature of LEGO toys and the fluidity of motion that modern animation allows. The characters move with a charming clunkiness that pays homage to the stop-motion animations that many of us attempted with our own LEGO sets in our youth. This stylistic choice is not only visually delightful but also thematically resonant, as it mirrors the film's celebration of imperfection and the handmade.\n\nThe voice cast brings a vibrancy to the ensemble of characters. Chris Pratt infuses Emmet with an earnestness that makes his transformation from the mundane to the extraordinary feel earned. Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle is the perfect foil, her character's initial cynicism giving way to a hopeful idealism. Will Ferrell's portrayal of President Business is both comically sinister and surprisingly nuanced, offering a critique of conformity and control that resonates with both young and old.\n\nThe script is a firework display of wit and humor, with jokes and references that operate on multiple levels. It's a script that respects the intelligence of its audience, never pandering, always engaging. The narrative is a deft blend of satire and sincerity, poking fun at the very tropes it employs with affection and purpose.\n\nThe frenetic pace, while a source of much of its charm, can at times feel overwhelming, leaving little room for the quieter moments that allow characters to breathe. The film's message, as uplifting as it is, occasionally veers into the didactic, its themes of individuality and creativity hammered home with a touch less subtlety than one might desire.\n\nThe reliance on a vast array of pop culture references, though often hilarious, runs the risk of dating the film, potentially alienating future audiences who may not be privy to the context of today's cultural landscape. And while the film's climax delivers a heartwarming twist, it's a narrative gamble that doesn't fully pay off for every viewer, straddling the line between clever meta-commentary and narrative contrivance.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" is a film that dazzles with its inventiveness and heart. It's a cinematic ode to the joy of creation, to the idea that from the multitude of pieces that life offers us, we can build something unique, something extraordinary. It's a film that, despite its occasional missteps, captures the spirit of its source material with a reverence and joy that is infectious. It's a reminder that sometimes, the simplest of concepts can yield the most extraordinary of stories. And isn't that what the best of cinema is all about?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I mean, it's just great. 'The Lego Movie (2014)' is a smart, unexpected and, frankly, hilarious animation that's actually much more than the sum of its parts - not to mention being much, much better than pretty much anyone anticipated, especially considering that it's essentially an extended advert of sorts (perhaps the best, most product-aware advert I've ever seen). The hit-rate of its humour is incredibly high. It's genuinely funny on more than one occasion, providing several big belly-laughs. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', there's something amusing or clever that keeps an ear-to-ear smile on your face, essentially, every few seconds. The piece is also remarkably heartfelt. It manages to keenly deliver a few important and considered messages, round off all its core characters in satisfying ways and conflate its masterful but somewhat 'out there' twist with its already established world, all while delivering a fast-paced, mile-a-minute, almost visually-psychedelic adventure. Seriously, there's a moment near the end that comes really close to making me tear up. That's not bad for a picture about talking plastic bricks. Speaking of which, the animation itself is stunning. Everything is made of individual digital Lego pieces, most of which have fingerprints and scratches on them. This, combined with the stop-motion style and dedication to only using replicas of real-world pieces (there's no cheating here), makes for an impressively tangible but delightfully playful feast-for-the-eyes, one that packs so much stuff into each and every plausibly (if nigh on impossibly) real-life recreatable frame. It's just great. It's easily one of the best animated features that I've ever seen. If one were to be cynical and say it were just an extended advert and not a proper film, then I'd fire back and say that, as I mentioned, it's straight-up the best advert I've ever seen, by a wide margin, that's better than a lot of 'proper', non product-placement containing pictures. It's an advert that I'd be happy to watch again and again. Well played, Lord and Miller. Well played, indeed. 9/10"

Everything ranging from the animation to the story and its laugh out loud jokes, this is a must see movie for all ages. The story follows a an ordinary construction worker named Emmet, who through a series of mishaps, ends up being mistaken for an unlikely hero. Sure the plot line is obviously close to the dozens of adventure, hero driven movies being made. What sets Lego apart is its execution that will make you burst out with laughter, while also adding a dynamic dramatic edge to it.\n\nComing from the pair that brought us Cloudy WIth A Chance Of Meatballs in 2009, I knew that this project was in good hands from the start. Still what makes this one better, at least in my eyes, is the satirical look into the whole story and for that I thank Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Plus, with the multiple pop culture references there will be plenty of familiar faces to recognize, not to mention Batman takes center stage as the character who will bring in more chuckles.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Lego Movie may be seen as a commercial movie given its brand recognition, however, I strongly advise you to watch this movie as not only will you have the time of your life, you will make your own interpretation of the story's true meaning\n\nRating: 8,5/10"

It assembles the visual of CGI for stop motion feel, vigorous cast and truly entertaining script filled with pop culture references. The movie is as exciting as getting your first set of Lego.\n\nEmmet (Chris Pratt) is a Lego construction man, the run-of-the-mill ordinary one. He stumbles across a mysterious piece after his work day is over. What comes is the heroic journey where he gathers friend to overthrown the nasty antagonist. This simple premise is used with very satirical tone, and also unexpectedly deep narrative. The movie doesn't dwell too seriously on already known formula, it administers them with unusually fresh variety. It delivers an underlying message that resonates not only to children, but also all ages.\n\nCast is simply wonderful. Everyone has their own distinguish over-the-top flair. The characters are representation of pop culture, from Batman, Morgan Freeman's prophetic Vitruvius to Liam Neeson's no nonsense Bad Cop. Glued by an amazingly witty script and lightning fast pace, the movie tirelessly delivers spot-on jokes, crazy one-liner in addition to surprisingly tender moments. The humor is sharp as well as cynical, they churn out humorous banter in nearly every conversations.\n\nGraphic is nicely done, nowadays film animations have their own different lively styles. However, The Lego Movie utilizes familiarity of its brand to the audience. It's compelling to see the minute details they put in, creative design such as the spaceship parts or the waves of ocean that imaginatively engaging, even if some looks simplistic. These features also contribute naturally on its many inside jokes.\n\nThe Lego Movie embodies the spirit of the toy, it's fun, ageless and offers delightful experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen this movie twice, one time I rented it from Redox and another time I watched it with my parents at home. I have to say, my nephews love this movie it is like their favorite movie. That's good for them that they liked it, but this movie didn't entertain me too much. I mean it had a good moral to the story, it had nice special effects but there were some things wrong with this movie.\n\nFirst off, I played with Lego's as a kid. I used to play Lego's with a couple of friends when I was a kid. I played with Legos up until I was like in 8th Grade. Rather then do the building I mostly just came up with my own stories with a friend and we would play with the Lego's with our own stories, having our own fictional worlds from our imaginations. Yeah, this is what the movie mostly looked like. It looked like an imaginative kids story. I mean there didn't seem to be much of a plot to it, I mean there is a plot but it does not seem like a memorable or good plot. The movie seems more about the special effects and Lego universe. Legos have been a popular kids toy for a very long time. They finally made a movie out of it. The movie also left us with a great message which might seem like a typical movie message for kids films, but still a great message. The characters in this movie seemed one dimensional. Now, that they finally came up with a Lego movie, it reminds me of a Lego game I played as a kid a couple of times called Lego Island. I didn't play that game that often, but it seemed to have more of a plot, and relatable world than this movie.\n\nSo, I'll say that there are a couple of movies that you like, or people with your taste will like them, but they aren't very popular. An example of that, is like my favorite movie is Earth To Echo which I also left a review on, and about half the reviews for that movie are positive. Luckily, that movie didn't flop as it had a low budget but it didn't make a lot of money and I feel like it's way underrated. There are also movies you don't like that are very popular an example of that is a movie that was pretty popular especially 10 years ago with all this franchise and people quoting the movie, Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't seen that movie in a long time, and don't really care for it, or find it entertaining. But, so many other people thought of that slow pace movie as entertaining. Now, to share an example of a TV show, There was one TV show I loved which aired in 2009 called The Othersiders on Cartoon Network CN Real, but that show got cancelled after four months because of the low ratings, and you can find very little information about that show.\n\nI'm not here to talk about other movies or TV shows. But, to me The Lego Movie seems like too kiddish of a movie for me, like a film more so for the younger audience and not as much for the older audience because of the lack of plot and being a little cheesy making the Lego characters not seem realistic, but fictional and one dimensional. I'll give this movie a 4/10 because it was clever, it did have good effects and a message. It's incredible to think adults could imagine this, I mean my Dad thought it was incredible to think of people imagining this. But, if you have my taste then you're much better off watching a film like Earth To Echo. I wouldn't recommend this film, but I'd strongly recommend that film. I also will say that this movie would probably entertain most kids under 12."

He joins a team of Master Builders and together they must plan their moves of stopping the imminent evil.\n\nIt's a movie based on the Lego universe which brings together with all their constructions and contraptions a lot of famous characters like Batman, Superman and others. Although it is based on a clich\u00e9 story of an ordinary guy that must save the world, it is mostly interesting and entertaining but you cannot miss the parody-like atmosphere and it's superficiality in several acts. Those wouldn't have been such a big problem if it wasn't for its finale which is too childish and disappointing. I had some great expectations regarding this one so I'm a bit disappointed, but that doesn't mean that it is a bad movie. It's just that I hoped that it would a wonderful animation movie with Lego which frankly isn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sweet, sincere and hysterically funny, \"The Lego Movie\" has an inspired crew working at a whirlwind pace to create dazzling visuals and very witty gags that both honor and gently lampoon the world of Lego. The result is a propulsive gem, a near-masterpiece that immediately envelops you and is able to maintain a consistency all the way through to its unexpectedly moving live-action conclusion. There's no sense in going through the plot, which is just a set-up for a series of chases through hallucinatory settings, but the film's flaw is contained there in its unnecessary send-ups of big business and religion; the movie needs them, I suppose, to give the plot its purpose, but they're not very developed and if the writers (which include the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) were trying to make points, they're not quite there. Far more successful is the relationship between adults and children from which the story germinates. But all that is secondary: with such entertaining material and such virtuosity in animation, it's hard not to absolutely fall in love. And of course, there's the song \"Everything Is Awesome\" which will tattoo itself onto your brain the first time you hear it."

It gives you non-stop jokes (that are ACTUAL jokes, not pop culture references), a surprisingly interesting story, great characters, and an all around good message meant for all ages.\n\nI did not know what to expect going into this. I just figured that it would be more or less a feature length advertisement with some funny moments. Instead I saw a decent contender for one of the best movies of 2014, depending on what else may come out. I don't foresee too many films surpassing just the over all enjoyment I had with this though.\n\nThe cg animation itself is also breathtaking. This is a must see in theaters, as seeing every single tiny Lego bit is mind boggling. You think it's impressive all of the way through, then you get to the ocean scenes and it's even more amazing.\n\nIs it an absolutely perfect movie? Certainly not, there is no perfect film. But it is perfect in its tone and execution. I give this a 10/10 without even thinking about it, I haven't been this impressed with a film in years."

I've loved this film since the very first viewing- and each time I watch it I find something new out of it. It's easily one of the best animated films of the 2010's- and the fact it was snubbed at the Oscars still hurts to this day. Not only is the animation clean and fun in a way that will continue to age well for many years to come- The LEGO movie itself is just a complete blast from start to finish. Between its stellar all-star cast and the creative minds behind other genius animated flicks and comedies (Phil Lord and Chris Miller)- it's quite amazing we can see a film of such great caliber- that also proves to be unique and incredibly original- despite it being based on a long-running toy brand. There are few flaws I have with the film, but mainly, lke Lord and Miller's other works, the flaws come with the sudden change in tone- it proving to be a bit too dramatic when it doesn't need to be. I feel this film handles it better than there other flicks, but still feels a bit awkward when the joking starts again from its gloomy undertones beforehand. Besides some tonal issues, The LEGO Movie can be quite a hilarious and entertaining ride- and surprisingly it can be quite moving as well. It may not be perfect, but its certainly close.\n\nMy Rating: 9.9/10."

I really disliked its style of humor. It's just pop culture references and random stuff. The jokes come too fast, which gave me the impression that the writer's lacked confidence. A confident writer would take time to setting up a joke and delivering the payoff. Watching this movie, I thought the writers weren't too sure which jokes would work and threw everything they could on the screen. And with all due respect to the animators, who I'm sure worked very hard on the movie, it looked rather garish to me."

And it was so much fun competing with each other to see who could make the most interesting objects. I am so glad this movie reminded me of how much fun I used to have with Legos.

One day, he is mistakenly identified as the Special, the one who can save the world from the nefarious Lord Business. Teaming up with the wizard Vitruvius, the female warrior Wyldstyle and Batman, the fate of LEGOs and the entire world rests in Emmet's hands. Supporting characters include Benny the '80s space guy, Uni-Kitty Metalbeard, Good Cop/Bad Cop and various LEGO characters, original and licensed.\n\nDirectors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller fill the screen with such LEGO creativity, energy and out-of-whack situations that it's really hard to keep up, yet it has such a free-for-all style that it's allowed to have that extra silliness. The script contains enough edginess in the humor to keep adults entertained, as well as effective messages about using your imagination and believing in yourself. The voice cast includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Will Ferrell. They add real vigor and substance to their LEGO characters that gives them real personalities. It's amazing how the animators can put so much emotion into these tiny figurines in much the same way the Pixar artists do with their \"Toy Story\" movies.\n\nSince this is obviously \"The LEGO Movie,\" it should come as no surprise that the animation, effects and set designs all resemble LEGOs. This film is animated with computers, but rendered to resemble the look and feel of stop-motion, which adds to the choppy movements of the LEGO figurines. What's also great is how the main LEGO theme of building is used to its best advantage with all kinds of vehicular designs.\n\nThanks to a clever and witty script and excellent animation, \"The LEGO Movie\" makes for some dandy, potent family entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a fast pace action, comedy, that shows that Lego's are more than just plastic bricks. The story is about Emmet (Chris Pratt) who is just an ordinary guy that always follows the instructions. However, once he finds a magical relic, he is now known as the special person who is supposed to defeat Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from launching an evil plan. So with the help of Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and more hilarious characters, he sets out to save the world.\n\nI love this movie! It has a \"Toy Story\" atmosphere to it that makes it entertaining. The writers don't try to hide the fact that the Lego people are plastic figures, they just write it in the way that Lego figures would move and act. Even the characters sort of know what they are, although they don't know everything. The jokes are always thrown at you and all of them get a laugh. It has a parody element to it that is surprisingly funny for kids and adults. When a company that has been around for generations and has so much merchandise, you can't help but admire the creators for making fun of their toy. It does is heart- warming how creativity is important. The animation is marvelous - the way the characters build structures, vehicles and double-decker couches is an experience to see. Just watching this imaginative universe makes me wonder, \"What can't you make out of Legos\"?!\n\nMy favorite character is hard to pick out of dozens of lovable characters. I would have to choose Good Cop / Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). I love this character's double personality and he cracks me up every time I see him.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Emmet talks to Lord Business about how you don't how to follow the instructions all the time. This scene shows and proves how Legos are important to people. How the simplicity of building a spaceship or anything, can spark inspiration for kids and adults to build.\n\nThe moral of the story is that everyone is special. Emmet does not think he has the mind or experience to fulfill his prophecy. He soon learns that if you believe in yourself you can do extraordinarily things.\n\nI give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5 to18-year-olds. This film reminds us on how Legos can change our lives. We all had Legos once in our lives, whether you follow the instructions, build or just played with them, it does not matter. Legos have been around for generations and these bricks have shown us new worlds to explore and enjoy. This film is timeless and I hope it will be know for a long time.\n\nReviewed by Keefer B. KIDS FIRST Film Critic\n\nThis movie is something special. This movie will make kids' dreams come true everywhere. What movie I'm talking about? Well it's \"The Lego Movie\" of course.\n\nThis great film has comedy, adventure, suspense, music, romance, LEGOS and a great story line.\n\nThe story is about an unlikely hero, who turns out to be part of a big prophesy and a lot of exciting battles and adventures. But, is this just all a part of a kid's imagination or do Legos truly come to life when we are not looking?\n\nI love so many things about this movie! A very unique part is the animation. It's plastic, smooth and looks a lot like real Lego pieces. At parts it feels like its stop motion but it's not. Most of the sets where were made out of hundreds of Legos. Imagine it, five adults playing with a whole bunch of Legos for work. I am sure most kids would wish to be a part of such production. If you add to the mix the voice- overs by amazing actors such as Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett and Will Ferrell \u2013 you get an animated film that will captivate your heart for sure.\n\nI have a couple of favorite scenes. First, when Batman, Emmet, Wyldstyle, the Wizard and Benny are all stuck in the ocean on a 'double decker couch.' Batman says \"It's not like a gigantic ship will show up\" and right when he says that, a ship comes out of nowhere. Then later, when they need a part and he says \"It's not like there's a spaceship or anything\" and what do you know, the Millennium Falcon drops by!\n\nI recommend this movie to ages 2 to 17. Older people may not enjoy the humor as much as younger kids. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nReviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst dot org."

Once emmet got to the human world I really got confused with what was happening. I was confused if Emmet turned out really being \"the special\" or if that whole thing was a confusion or something, and what ended up happening to bad cop/ good cops parents?!?

I was pretty skeptical about its animation and graphics in the start but soon that was discarded and story kicked a$$. The movie is especially awesome for movie geeks and internet activists. Why? Because some of the puns are so downright awesome and intelligent that only such people enjoy a hearty laugh. Apart from the comedy sector, which is as usual awesome concerning animated movies, this movie carries some nice messages. I found that this movie utilized the magic of an underdog rising to become special. We all know how emotional and cool that is. The main character is hypocritically enjoying his robotic life and then he catches a spark of unknown spirit. As anyone would be, he is hesitant at start but ultimately lives up to the idea. The mix of so many famous characters, especially comical, makes it at least worthy of applause. Imagine a movie that has all the special people in it, now wouldn't that be awesome? Anyways, this movie just has a hint of it but great impact made. I love how it carries several messages and introduces interplay of imaginative and real life world. This was something I saw for the first time. Anyways, the movie is really cool, funny and a bundle of joy. If you found it like an extended commercial of Legos, then you sir are not awesome. I found that it introduces a teaser at the last moment so unsure if there's going to be a part two then. Haha, got to google that now.\n\nNote: There is another deduction of this movie and it is that although robotic age is coming, it's the unity and quantity of simple, yet potential, people in the world that will over-rule.\n\nSource: http://pratikkataria.tumblr.com/post/76032132912/"

I belonged to an era when entertainment was started being plagued by Ads and it kept on becoming more annoying as I grew older to the extent that we were forced to watch our beloved programmes in between Ads. But this movie has set new standard in this evolution by dragging an entire movie well inside the boundaries of Ad affectively making it one long and never ending Ad. The movie is nothing but a deliberate attempt to market and sell Lego products. Pity for a movie of such good story, cool, crisp direction and voice performances, but I couldn't watch it completely as I hate Ads and I want my entrainment to be interrupt free. ."

Lego Batman is pretty much how every 8-year-old boy imagines Batman these days.\n\nOne thing I appreciated about the visual effects is that the Lego blocks have a definite tangible quality, making them look like the real things as opposed to simple CGI renderings."

        "review_detailed_main": "Combining excellent animation and a thoughtful story, The Lego Movie was a hugely enjoyable watch, not to mention excellent marketing for Lego. Emmet is an naive mini-figure construction worker who is happiest when he has a set of rules to follow, and takes pleasure in the most ordinary things. The spunky rebel Wyldstyle discovers and rescues Emmet when he falls into a pit at the construction site and the \"piece of resistance\" becomes attached to his back. Identified as the most extraordinary person who is key to saving the world, Emmet gets dragged on an adventure to defeat the evil Lord Business who wants to halt creativity and superglue everyone into place. Along the way, he traverses the different Lego realms and meets all our favourite heroes in Lego form (Batman, Wonderwoman, Shakespeare, Shaq O'Neal, Lando and company) who are master builders and held together by this common mission.\n\nAlthough the defeat-the-evil-tyrant storyline is nothing fresh, this particular variation was full of humour at all the right places. I loved how these pop culture icons were woven in. And the ending was just so clever, both in terms of resolving things satisfactorily and promoting Lego. The voices were really good and the animation was truly a visual feast, bursting with colour and movement. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages."

Nice messages and approach for the society we live in, but in some way it just was not good enough.\n\nDon't waste your time on it. I am really baffled by the really high score of the movie.

Didn't have the impact (of course) of the big screen experience - but still great fun.\n\nThis film absolutely rips along at high pace - such that even those with an attention span measured in nanoseconds would find it impossible to wander off.\n\nThe opening scenes in the city and building site are truly eye-popping, especially when seen on the big screen. These set the tone for the visuals which truly are AWESOME. The people who made this film need the Oscar for what they have done here. The visual impact is off the scale and sets new standards.\n\nI won't spoil the story with any form of description - but I will say that there is something here for everyone. Huge chunks of this are hilarious (eg, Batmans \"song\"!).\n\nThe Lego Movie is reverential to imagination and creativity in words and film - as the makers understand that Lego enables creativity and that films and books are great sources of inspiration. I will list the homage paid to some great films/TV series and stories: The Matrix trilogy, 2001 a Space Odyssey/The Time Tunnel (falling down the portal), Alien, The Blues Brothers, Bruce Almighty (Ok - that's not such a great film), Westerns in general, Batman, Star Wars, Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin), Toy Story. There are plenty of others - these are just the ones I can think of.\n\nThis film is really REALLY good for all viewers - do not be put off by any presupposition that this is \"only for kids\". It may be - but watching it will certainly bring out the kid in you....\n\nI'm not going to give this 10 out of 10 because that would put it in the best films of all-time category (like, Casablanca or Remains of the Day, or Toy Story). Nevertheless, this film rates a 9 and is.... AWESOME!!!"

Based on this alone, The Lego Movie scores high. But the creators clearly understood the universal affection these toy building blocks, born out of a Danish carpenter's workshop in 1932 to become a global brand, has garnered.\n\nCentered around Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a Lego minifigure, writer and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have worked a masterpiece of storytelling sensitive to generations of Legoists. Emmet, a construction worker who lives in Bricksburg where \"everything is awesome\", has his life disrupted when he falls upon a mysterious object called the \"Piece of Resistance\". All of a sudden, he becomes part of prophesy as the \"Special\" who will stop the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrel) from using a mysterious weapon called the Kragle to destroy the universe.\n\nIt smacks of childlike imagination, which is this film's brilliant embrace. We've all been there, creating our own worlds with toys and household objects. This story turns us right and clicks us back into that happy place."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have a confession, and it might seem shocking. I'm not exactly a fan of Chris Miller and Phil Lord's directorial work. I mean who really remembers Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? Because it went out of my mind a long time ago. I also have another confession, and it might seem even more shocking than the other. Ready? Okay. I haven't watched 21 Jump Street. I know, it's pretty bad. But don't get me wrong, I've tried to catch it. Believe me. But I seem to forget about it all the time, kinda like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Uncanny eh? Although, I have one final confession, and this one might be the most shocking of them all. Ready? Sure? Okay. I recently watched a film directed by Miller and Lord, and everything about it was awesome. I know. Did I really just come out with that? Excuse me but I couldn't help myself. The film you ask? Its The Lego Movie folks.\n\nYes, the iconic plastic pieces have finally got their own movie on the big screen. It's no real surprise is it? In fact it's about time. Lego has been apart of a children's toy box since the '40s and it was certainly apart of mine. So was I jumping around in excitement when I heard about it coming to the box office? Slightly. That was, until I heard Miller and Lord were directing it. I swear I don't hate them. But it made me think of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and that started giving me the shivers. All I was expecting was another forgetful animation, was I wrong? You bet I was.\n\nThe Lego Movie is pure magic. This animation is a film that dares to go big and give Lego the true thank you it deserves. Miller and Lord go to extreme efforts to impress, captivate and show their love for the retro blocks while sharing the love all-round. The big softies. Who knew they had a soul? I certainly didn't. But this block madness clearly reinforces that, with the duo creating a universe that is endless and visually spectacular in all it's plastic glory. Did I mention it's also bonkers? No? Well it is. Want Abraham Lincoln flying around on a rocket- powered chair? You got it here. Want Morgan Freeman as a wizard? You got it here. Honestly, the crazy possibilities will keep on coming as if you're constructing it from your own imagination. It's just wonderful.\n\nGetting amazed and swallowed into this universe was effortless. Not only is the world building captivating by Miller and Lord but the main protagonist is also. Introduction Emmet, the construction worker who is voiced by the enthusiastic Chris Pratt. Great casting right there. Not only does Pratt give Emmet a voice, but he also gives him a whole lot more. Charm, charisma and heart comes to mind right now. But Emmet only wants to be a sheep, trying to fit into the conformist ideology this film constructs early on.\n\nThis is soon abolished quickly and thankfully as Emmet accidentally comes across the \"Piece of Resistance\", this being the only item that can stop wicked Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from obliterating the world with his powerful Kragle. Resilient, rigid Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) immediately swoops in to identify Emmet as the Special, prophesied to be the most extraordinary person in the universe and swiftly whisks him off to join the Master Builders in a rebellion.\n\nAs we are introduced to a star studded cast of Master Builders it almost feels like all of Hollywood has rolled into town. We meet such characters like Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), douche bag Batman (Will Arnett), and spaceship junkie Benny (Charlie Day). Unfortunately none of them believe in Emmet including himself.\n\nThe film's narrative arc revolves around Emmet, following the traditional steps of a hero's journey. But, Miller and Lord manage to make it fresh by mocking the overall adventure, poking fun at it's clich\u00e9s and sprinkling it all over with plenty of gags and jokes. Both these are not limited to one audience either, oh no. The duo have conjured up a screenplay that will appeal to both kids and adults. It's subversive and playful attitude echoes throughout the hour and forty minutes you are sat watching. But aside from relentless overworked segments in the third act, The Lego Movie runs rapidly with no need to slow down for one second. It's fun moving at the speed of light. Can't get any better than that can it?"

His instincts are not heroic, if anything he is actually quite yellow.

Embrace your imagination.\n\nThe animation is awesome, the filmmakers really put in work to make it look exactly as if it were made with stop-motion effects like a lot of homemade Lego movies tend to be. The cast is also stellar. Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson are all great.\n\nAn amazing movie, one of the best animated films of the 2010s."

Once he fails to do so, he prophesies that a person known as \"the Special\" will find a way to stop the Kragle. Now Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary LEGO figure who always followed the rules unwillingly becomes the Special, a being who is the key to saving his world. He later joins forces with a group of strangers who are on a mission to stop the now evil President Business and his plan to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly and hilariously unprepared for such a task, but he'll give it his all nonetheless.\n\nOn paper, a movie about LEGO character sounds like it wouldn't work but it surprisingly does. The story sounds like it came from a child's imagination but it fits within the world of the film. The animation, a combination of stop-film and CGI, used in this film can also hold its own with the imagination within the story. There is a great attention to detail throughout with all aspects of the world made from Legos. Kids will be entertained by such characters as a cat, a vintage astronaut, and Batman (I won't explain why), just to name a few. The story is not very original for a kid's film (hero versus villain) and I wan't expecting to laugh as much as I did thanks to the funny script. There are a lot of jokes and other things going on in this film so you have to pay attention or you may miss one. I thought the voice cast also did a great job making each character funny and likable with a few surprising performances from actors you would not expect. For a kid's film, it does contain many references that many adults will enjoy and remind them of their respective childhoods (as it did mine). The film's message is important, albeit not too surprising, is embracing and celebrating creativity as one day, we may stop being creative. It also goes on to say that whoever you are, you can still be special. Everyone can be special, can try and succeed if they want to. The film does make a slight turn, tone-wise, near the end that may turn off certain people. It does feel a little different when compared to the first two-thirds of the film and does get a little preachy but I did not mind it too much. Despite this, The Lego Movie is definitely one of my top 5 animated films of all time and the best animated film of 2014. (Disclaimer: I saw Big Hero 6 in January 2015). It should have won the Oscar for best animated feature last year (please consult earlier disclaimer). With the world they created and the imagination in which the filmmakers shown, I would most definitely enjoy coming back. Since this movie made a lot of money, this seems very likely. I wish other toy-based movies would learn from this. I'm talking to you Transformers 1-4, G.I. Joe 1-2, Battleship, Ouija, and Bratz.\n\nkeithlovesmovies.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a kid who grew up in the 90s playing with Lego, I was impressed that the very toy I played (almost on a daily basis) with in grade school and junior high converted into a full-length feature. Though initially skeptic, after witnessing Lego characters old and new - including a few familiar sets of the past - incorporated into one film just blew my mind away. When I arrived on opening day, it was certainly a packed crowd of people looking like they're in their twenties and thirties, along with younger kids of the current generation.\n\nThe plot, which involves an ordinary Lego construction figure called Emmet (voiced by 'Parks and Recreation' star Chris Pratt) - who lives his life by his own set of instructions - finds a new purpose when coming across the female rebel WyldStyle and a group of others fulfilling a prophecy of finding the new Master Builder to stop the evil Lord Business. Emmet must learn that not everything requires a set of instructions, but a little creativity and imagination can't hurt either, or can it?\n\nIt had its share of laughs (notably Liam Neeson's split-personality character Good Cop/Bad Cop and Morgan Freeman's Vitruvius tending to steal the humor spotlight), well-crafted settings and animation that seemingly defines the realistic, endless, ever-expanding Lego Universe, and an elaborate set of voice talent greats that have worked with versatile directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller once before. To avoid spoilers, there's a very surprising twist near the end I did not see coming and it definitely doesn't deviate it completely from the movie's main story, but actually supplements it further with an intriguing moral lesson that sounds essentially true in real-life. My only nitpick was that some scenes can turn too frantic that it might need to be observed carefully. Nevertheless, like 'Wreck-It Ralph' and 'Toy Story' before it, this is a movie that sent me on both a nostalgia trip and run of sympathy that it will intrigue many kids and adults young at heart. Even Lego characters have a story to tell, too, even when you least expect it."

The entire world is constructed out of LEGO bricks, and the attention to detail is simply astounding. From the bustling cityscapes to the fantastical realms, every scene is a visual feast for the eyes. The animators have managed to capture the essence of LEGO building, making it feel like we're watching a living, breathing LEGO universe.\n\nBut it's not just the visuals that make this movie exceptional. The story is unexpectedly deep and touching. It's not just about a bunch of LEGO characters going on an adventure; it's a story about imagination, friendship, and the importance of embracing your unique qualities. The film manages to blend humor, heart, and even a bit of social commentary in a way that's accessible to both kids and adults.\n\nThe voice cast is absolutely stellar. Chris Pratt's portrayal of Emmet is charismatic and relatable, while Elizabeth Banks brings a perfect balance of toughness and vulnerability to Wyldstyle. And who could forget Will Arnett as the hilariously brooding Batman? Each character is memorable and adds a layer of depth to the film's already rich tapestry.\n\nThe humor in \"The LEGO Movie\" is top-notch. It's packed with clever wordplay, pop culture references, and slapstick comedy that will have both kids and adults laughing out loud.

Kids will enjoy the action-packed sequences and vibrant characters, while adults will appreciate the witty humor and the film's deeper themes. It's a rare feat for an animated movie to be so universally appealing.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The LEGO Movie\" is an absolute triumph of storytelling, animation, and entertainment. It's a cinematic experience that reminds us of the boundless power of imagination and creativity.

        "review_detailed_main": "Brief Overview The film is set in a Lego world where the dominance of the obsessive character Mr. Business rules over his town. The hero and friends set out to end him from fulfilling his final plan.\n\nPositives -The excellent CGI gives a very good idea that you are really looking at Lego sets moving and talking. You can also recognize Lego pieces from actual kits if you remember them. -The classic Lego themes gave me a bit of a flashback to the actual sets from the past, however they also play well into the theme of the story and offer entertaining closed \"worlds\". -The voice acting is very well done and feels believable. The majority of the main characters having actors who play their characters trope regularly. -The film also has many pop culture and Lego jokes for some of the older audience while still at a basic level being funny without knowledge of them. -The range of emotions strongly delivered by the film gives a entering ride through the film with you feeling strongly the happy humor and the more serious family connections and real world values. -The jokes in the film are well spaced and funny without being too over the top.\n\nNegatives -I really don't have any."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie has been cult well among many fans, as a great visual experience, and the film can be seen as living to its expectations. It might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks, but this 3D animated comedy has some visual inspiration behind it, even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to carry a feature-length production. The story essentially follows the misadventures of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by President Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchmen led by a two-faced cop (Liam Neeson). So Emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) and a blind man (Morgan Freeman) who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day. Overall, a very well made film which has been in production for several years back."

All I have to say is that the movie is a MUST for everyone. I can't remember the last time I left the cinema with a big smile feeling sooo satisfied.\n\nLego is definitely classic already.

        "review_detailed_main": "!!!Massive Spiolers Ahead!!!\n\nI found the experience of this film to be very different and very entertaining.\n\nThe movie starts in an apparent Utopian Lego society where everyone follows rules and in which creativity is hindered (Similar to the hindered creativity of the adult as compared to the creative mind of a child - that is revealed in the end). That happiness is an illusion and true happiness comes from creating something (or alternately doing something creative)\n\nThen we meet our protagonist: your average, normal person who doesn't realize this. But upon the realization, strives to become the most interesting person in the world. This quest leads him to meet MasterBuilders (is this a word play? i am not sure). These MasterBuilders are highly creative yet eccentric people who are fighting against Lord Business (Another strong pun). And it is because of their eccentricity and maybe ego, that they are not able to succeed. They work individually but not as a team.\n\nUltimately, the protagonist uses his organizational skills to form a plan to ultimately defeat Lord Business. But as usual a lot of hurdles come in the way.\n\nBut in the end, something different happens. The villain is not defeated yet he is transformed from evil to good.\n\nThere are a lot of themes that are touched in this film. There are also a lot of word plays which are hilarious. The characters are awesome especially The Batman. There are also a lot of cultural reference here and there. Famous scenes, dialogues, scenarios are spoofed numerous times.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining film which has something for children as well as adults."

Not once in the movie do they say how great LEGO is! There isn't much product placement in it at all! People also say that nothing important happens because it was all in the mind of a child? Did you even watch the movie? Will Ferrel's character learns to imbrace his inner kid and creativeness! There is also a great deal of symbolism in the film that adds to it greatly. I can't wait for the second part! All in all go watch this movie, unless you're a stubborn, butt hurt man that hates the toy and movie industry."

The humor works, the characters are fun (especially Batman), and the story, while very simple, works well in conjunction with the previous two aspects. It's just a solid movie, and while not all the jokes land, it's still an enjoyable trip. This is essentially \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" but better in every conceivable way. It knows what it's selling, but that doesn't stop it from making a good movie. Not to mention the great animation, which cleverly uses the imperfections of the actual LEGO pieces and uses it as added detail. If you've played with Lego ever since you were a kid or have never watched it, there's a good chance you'll like this movie."

When the first few scenes opened up I thought to myself \"oh this looks very strange with all these cubes as characters with sharp corners and it's definitely going to be boring\". But guess what? I was shamefully very wrong. The Lego movie was amazing. I repeat it's AMAZING.\n\nIn the world of Lego land the evil president Lord Business is planning to destroy everyone. And a normal construction worker Emmet is selected to avoid it as per an ancient prophesy. But soon the Lego land realizes that this construction worker is not the chosen one. And he is challenged with proving that he is the right one for the job.\n\nThe Lego Movie is a fast phased and mesmerizingly colorful movie. In Lego land you will miss a lot if you blink. So for some it could be a bit tiresome to keeping up with the speed but once you get on board the speed train it's a super fun ride. And surprises wait at every turn. And beware every line is funny! This has some super characters including good cop mixed bad cop voiced by Liam Neeson, Vitruvious voiced by Morgan Freeman and Batman voiced by Will Arnet. And that's just a few of them. There is a bunch of superheroes, NBA players, Star Wars characters, Cowboys and so on which makes The Lego Movie an awesome mix of voice plays.\n\nComing to the eye candy animation the work done there is simply crazy. Though at the start it looks a bit weird the animators proves that animation potential is endless and anything is possible. The brilliant animation quality teamed with upbeat music tracks brings the true joy of the Lego land.\n\nBig studio animations are becoming larger and larger by the year. Yet we seldom come across something ground breaking and mind blowing. The Lego Movie is one of such fantastic animation that definitely blows away the minds of the viewer. It's insanely creative with super different animation quality and comes with a fantastic story and belly tickling humor. In my book this is the best animation of a different kind after Wreck it Ralph (2012)."

It was my style of comedy. I had a genuine laugh at the film whilst being enthralled by the impressive awesomeness of the action scenes. The voice actors done a great job, didn't really have any complaints in that field.\n\nAs a child, I loved Lego and this was a blast as I seen the imagination the creators had used. They obviously had a lot of fun whilst making it.\n\nThe main problem I had with the film is that some action scenes did drag on for too long. they tried to make some scenes too flashy and were obviously aiming to introduce merchandising ideas. Another problem was that some things in it were too goofy. I understand that it is a children's film but they tried too hard.\n\nSome themes may be discrete but they are a good touch and relevant from a child's perspective. This film was completely original in style, plot and humour.\n\nIt got me excited and I was left wanting more. it succeeded in making a fantastic family film."

For more than a century, kids and adults alike have been transforming these humble blocks into whatever they can imagine, from X-Wings to The Tower of Babel. And while these toys have been transmuted into art, literature, and video games, they had not yet been depicted in film (at least, not theatrically). Well, their time has come at last, and the result is a wildly imaginative and thoughtful film, with all-star voice talent and breathtaking animation. Making excellent use of the various Lego product lines (this is probably the only time you'll see Han Solo and Batman in the same movie), The Lego Move tells a charming tale of how to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, all the while providing slapstick gags and in-jokes to hilarious effect. This film's major flaws are those that are common among animated features: its silliness can get excessive at times, and some gags are used too many times to retain their comedic value. But overall, this is a wonderful movie, and one truly made for all ages."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit that The Lego Movie has been a wonderful movie for the many of the people (assuming they've been on a massive sugar rush, of course) like Frozen. But the movie shows no appeal to me whatsoever. And no, its not that I've never played with Lego toys before; it has no interest in me, as I've played action figures, toy cars, even video games. Even if I did played with Lego toys before, I'd get pretty bored quickly and move to elsewhere.\n\nTo put it simply, while The Lego Movie is indeed an excellent movie, its far from being perfect. And seeing it gain 96% on Rotten Tomatoes proves that its not only baffling, but also shows that the people has had one sugar-induced candy treats too many and their extreme levels of hyperactivity are showing. Its just too fast-paced and predictable, and the characters are... well, questionable in terms of humor (not explicit ones, bear this in mind). I only saw the trailer, but had no intention of watching it at all, and the same goes for the sequel.\n\nSo again, while the movie is great, its far from perfection and its far too predictable. Go ahead and say that I have no imagination, but sadly, that's just me who's more interested in other things than simply stacking up toys and just play around for 1-3 minutes before being bored and move on to other things. As for the sequel? I'm sure people will just become over-reactive as always, but me? Pass. I'll just wait for better movies that can rival this one and the upcoming sequel that doesn't include extreme cases of sugar-induced hyper-activeness."

It doesn't matter that I am a 28 year old guy but boy am I happy. This is not a kid's movie, like Lego set is not just for kids. Everything is really awesome. The feeling of nostalgia that I get with this movie is unbelievable. The voice overs are great, the screenplay is superb. I am not gonna give any spoilers away. But, if you are reading this review, find a theater near by you playing this amazing film and go watch it TODAY. God bless the people who made this epic master piece. I am running out of words here to explain this."

The animation style is the real trade mark of the film as it is shot to appear as if it were a stop motion film. This works perfectly in the film with its utilization of Lego blocks and allows the film to do certain things very effectively which the traditional animation features could not.The movie also composes of a stellar voice ensemble such as Nick Pratt, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks and numerous other comedic stars which perfectly fit their characters and add flair to the film. The film boasts many laughs and a general fun experience to all ages with its intriguing direction, relatable story and comedic voice cast. After watching The Lego Movie I am excited to see where LEGO goes from her.\n\n9/10"

At first, i was a bit unsure if the movie was really as great as they say it was. From the trailer, it just looked like talking blocks with some lame animations. That all changed after i saw the movie. I loved it! It contained so many funny moments as well as cross-overs from many heroes and villains (lego- fied, of course). The animations and special effects of this movie were amazing! I couldn't ask for anything better. It also contained parts where it will warm you heart and make you full of joy.I don't think you can ask for a better movie. I recommend this movie to people of all ages because I don't think there are going to be many movies that will beat the Lego Movie's funny and entertaining story line."

A movie about legos is a great idea, but much of the film is rather awkward and confusing. It's hard to keep track of what's what. For a little while I was actually having a hard time staying awake. What makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts transitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world. I can see why some people may like this, but I find it to be basically just a weird interruption. If the movie had started out in the real world before going into the main story, it would've made a little more sense."

I can imagine it was a simultaneous sigh, with everyone muttering the words \"really? A Lego Movie?\" But please, if you haven't watched it yet, you are seriously missing out.\n\nLike many people, I expected this to be full of child humour with no real storyline or substance, but I am 19 years old and I found myself chuckling throughout this film, along with my parents. The humour is aimed at all ages and it really does tickle you in places.\n\nThe main thing that impresses me about this film however, is the cleverness and creativity behind it. The idea of the characters building things out of Lego, and Lego pieces flying everywhere when there's an explosion or a car crash or something. It is really cleverly done and really entertaining.\n\nIt isn't a perfect movie, as some of the jokes are a bit silly, but in all honesty, it is 10x better than I ever thought it would be. A very, very good film."

But the reviews have offered near universal praise from critics and audiences, making a film that is fun and funny and more intelligence then it had any right to be. 21 Jump Street writers/directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller take the clich\u00e9d mistaken messiah storyline by making The Lego Movie more about conformity, individuality and creatively and takes a Plato's Allegory of the Cave approach as the main character lives a sheltered, limited experience and sees the world for what it really is. The Lego Movie is filled with jokes and visuals gags that both adults and children can enjoy as the directors are inventive with their set-pieces and designs. There is excellent voice from the likes of Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks. Will Arnett as Batman was comedy gold, playing on the popularity of the character."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie really can be summed up in its signature song, Everything is Awesome. It is a colourful, delightful romp that is equal parts quality viewing and mindlessly entertaining. It is a movie for all occasions and audiences. The animation is delightfully done, giving the impression of stop-motion animation to fully create what it would be like to act out this movie with real Lego.\n\nDirectors Lord and Miller have assembled a stellar voice cast, giving perfect characters to each of its actors - the seductive Elizabeth Banks, the cute Alison Brie, the wise Morgan Freeman, the enthusiastic Charlie Day and the tough Liam Neeson. Chris Pratt and Will Arnett (the latter being the most underrated comedic actor alive) are the film's highlights as protagonist Emmet and rival Batman.\n\nThe story is simply superb. Not only is it an interesting and engaging story, it captures everything we love about Lego. Anyone who has ever played with any Lego set knows the battle between imagination and instructions. Will Ferrell's President Business is the most perfect villain the film could have. The weapons and arguments used by each side are so perfect and no audience will have trouble identifying with one side or another.\n\nMaking a movie about Lego is something that I know tweaked a lot of noses, but it really created something incredible here. The ability to tap into almost anything - LOTR, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, the NBA and DC Comics (with voice acting from 21 Jump Street duo Tatum and Hill providing some huge laughs) - means that this movie had no boundaries, and indeed that is a huge reason why I loved it. It also provided vital jokes and story archs - see quotes like \"does anyone know what this piece is, and do you need it?\" for just one example.\n\nTowards the end of the movie there is a revelation that truly changes the entire scope of the film, and that makes the film even more special. In any sense, The Lego Movie is one of those movies you can watch again and again and again, never getting over the laughs or the colour or the fun. I cannot recommend this highly enough."

The strength isn't so much in the plot but in the multiple way the Legos can be used to show emotions and true \"humanity.\" There is some romance and some brinkmanship, but ultimately it gets down to true creativity. The universe is truly the Lego board and if you or your kids have ever played together, you know the overwhelming possibilities. There are some pretty good songs in here but, I must admit, they have become pretty tiresome."

The problem is that the self mockery is too heavy. That and a jumbled story line, visually incoherent action scenes, and shallow emotional content make for a mediocre movie.\n\nOur protagonist is a modern version of the construction worker character from Lego's first packages. He is as amusingly mundane as the movie tells us he is, but remains mundane in those few moments when he is supposed to amount to something more. He goes from being a spoof on the hapless hero to being just another version of one.\n\nThe most memorable piece of the movie is the ear worm song 'Everything is Awesome' which is as cheesy as it is addicting. Other highlights are Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop, and a happy go lucky unicorn with a demonic alter ego lurking just under the happy face. Lego Batman has enough moments to have made him easily worthy of his own movie (which he now has). We also have all the other DC and Marvel heroes who are there just so the makers can check their names off the list.\n\nThe ending takes us out of Legoland and into the three dimensional world. Here we get the punchline, the revelation of what exactly the 'Kragle' is. They has a cute idea, but it comes with notes of forced sentiment that fall rather flat.\n\nBy focusing to much on mocking the gimmick of the toy, as well all the franchise characters, the movie itself ends up feeling like a gimmick. There is no heart, soul or narrative shape, and the scattered laughs don't make it worth the time."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of my very favorite films of 2014.\n\nWhat I worried would be a feature length commercial is instead a very funny, and somewhat subversive film, overflowing with ideas, puns, perfect music, and wacky 'cameos' by everyone from Shaquile O'Neil, to a wonderfully warped and dark Batman (given terrific voice by Will Arnet).\n\n'Lego' doesn't look quite like any film I've seen before. It has a rough, almost bizarrely low- tech look to it's Lego people -- stop motion that looks like stop motion --oddly (but very effectively) combined with mind-blowingly huge and complicated shots of the Lego universe in action. Somehow in the unlikely mix of slickness and lo-fi something wonderful is created; animation that is wildly impressive, but also clearly human, creative and DIY at the same time.\n\nThe film is basically a spoof of every Hollywood vision-quest movie you've ever seen. You know the films. A young character (almost always male) is called on to save the world/neighborhood/kingdom. He's over-matched, and under prepared, but with a kindly older mentor of great power to guide him, you know he will find a way to prevail.\n\nExcept here the \"special\" character at the center really ISN'T very special. He's a young working guy like a million others, who's not very bright or especially brave, and who just wants to live his happy, blank, endlessly repetitive safe life. And the mentor? None other than the voice of Morgan Freeman, expertly spoofing his own image as the ultimate voice of wisdom. He plays a wizard who is far less consistently brilliant and all knowing than he claims or wants to be. He's very, very funny, which is not the first thing one thinks of with Morgan Freeman. The same could be said of Liam Neeson, who also does a great voice job as the good cop/bad cop, who's personality changes depending on what side of his head is facing front. Will Ferrell is also excellent as the villain of the piece, being just silly enough to be funny, but just real enough to give the story some real tension.\n\nNot everything works, and there were a few spots near the end where the energy flagged. But overall this is an exciting and creative (and wonderfully fun) piece of film-making, that manages to attack the near fascist mentality of a society obsessed with consuming, and determined not to question it's own lives (it's not for nothing that the villain's name is 'President Business')-- while still being very funny, and almost never feeling like its preaching.\n\nAnd without giving anything away, in the last 20 minutes it changes the rules again, and asks a few profound questions about the nature of existence, without seeming like it had suddenly jumped the track as a film for kids as well as adults.\n\nIn the end, I walked around with the hysterical, awful (in a great way), and when you think about it kinda dark anthem \"Everything is Awesome\" banging around in my head for days."

How do you make a movie about that?\" To my delight, the idea was executed wonderfully, and the finished product was a great movie.\n\nIt was made for fans, both kids, new to Legos, and adults, who grew up with the toys. There are characters, jokes, and references to Lego themes of the past, as well as recent years.\n\nThe voice acting was amazing, with the likes of Will Ferrell, Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, among others. The top of the line talent definitely made a huge difference in executing the script, and gave life to plastic.\n\nIt was self-aware, self-referential, and shattered the fourth wall in a way that wasn't trite or clich\u00e9d, and instead added much of the heart of the story.\n\nThe filmmakers created a world where almost anything can happen, as long as you can imagine it, and with clever, witty, writing, the result is an amazing animated film that's bursting with color, heart, and laughs. I can't wait to watch it on mushrooms!"

Lego made my childhood full of happiness and I still play with them, so I was waiting for this movie since it was announced.\n\nThe Lego movie doesn't look like any other feature-length animated movie. It is made in different style than Disney or Pixar movies. It has its own style of storytelling and it makes this movie so good.\n\nFrom the first scene of the movie you can understand that it would be hilarious masterpiece. And it is! I never laughed in cinema so much and so hard. Humor at the highest level and it is one of the biggest pros of the picture.\n\nThis movie is like a dream for every single person that was growing up with Lego sets. Atmosphere such as you return to your childhood and you play Lego with your friends and having a lot of fun.\n\nThe plot is very good and with a lot of meaning. Picture can inspire everyone to do what you always wanted to do. I think if you are depressed and think that you can't do anything \u2013 you should go to the Lego movie and it will make your mood much better.\n\nThis movie made my day. I will definitely watch it a lot of times and it is one of the best cartoons ever made. It is the best combination of adult wisdom and child happiness.\n\nThanks to developers for such a good movie, you made my dream come true \u2013 to watch a masterpiece movie about Lego!"

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE LEGO MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)\n\nBlockbuster film adaptation of the popular construction toys, which began in Denmark in 1949. Lego is the third-largest toy maker in the world and in recent years has grown immensely in popularity (closing in on Hasbro for the #2 global ranking). The company has expanded it's market into video games, books, theme parks, kids' clothes, cartoon shows and straight-to-DVD animated movies and now it's conquered the theatrical film business as well with this 3D computer animated comedy/adventure flick. The movie has been number one for three weeks in a row (at the US box office) making $185,829,929 in North America and $278,329,929 worldwide! I found it to be very entertaining and my two young nephews (I saw it with) loved it as well.\n\nThe story revolves around Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an average construction worker Lego minifigure who's mistakenly prophesied to be the 'chosen one'; who will save the Lego universe from an evil businessman called Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Emmet has always been an outsider and has never been accepted by his acquaintances or co-workers. He finally feels important for the first time in his Lego life and goes on a journey to save the Lego world. Emmet receives help from a rebel fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) and others. The voice cast also includes Liam Neeson, Will Forte, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie and many other popular stars.\n\nIt was directed and co-written (with Dan and Kevin Hageman) by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Lord and Miller also performed the same duties on the popular animated hit 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS' and directed the film adaptation of the popular 80's TV show '21 JUMP STREET' as well (and it's upcoming sequel). The Hagemans also co-wrote 36 episodes of the Cartoon Network's animated TV series 'LEGO NINJAGO: MASTERS OF SPINJITZU' (which is based on the Lego toys of the same name). The filmmakers chosen were obviously the right guys for the job and the cast couldn't be more perfectly fitting either. The result is an animated movie masterpiece; I absolutely loved it and I can't usually get into animated films that much! It's hilarious, visually amusing and surprisingly emotional as well (especially in the end; when I actually got a little teary eyed). There is a twist that really takes the film up a notch and makes it more meaningful (and special) for kids and adults as well. I realized, by the end, that it's a lot like another telling of 'TOY STORY' and I think it's just as well made and classic too. I'm sure 'THE LEGO MOVIE' will be beloved for many years to come, by many generations (just like the toys)!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never really had any interest in these kinds of movies mainly due to the fact that they are made more for children than they are for adults. However I recently watched the Lego Batman Movie (2017) and I actually somewhat enjoyed it. The reason for that is probably because I have been reading the Batman comics since I was ten years old so I'm more inclined to enjoy something I can relate to in some way. I thought maybe I should give some of the other Lego movies a try and since the Lego Movie features a wide range of characters from different universe's like LOTR and Batman I thought it would at least be worth a watch.\n\nI honestly didn't enjoy this movie nearly as much as I did Lego Batman but I kind of expected that would be the case since this movie is a lot more child/family friendly. The animation is amazing with beautiful vivid colours and stunning backgrounds. The problem however for me at least is the movie is just far too for lack of a better word \"Hyperactive\" and fast paced. This is now a common theme in most modern day children's movies. Instead of telling a unique story with likable and engaging characters that children can enjoy and learn from, the makers of the Lego movie just decided that all kids want to see is colourful characters jumping around for an hour and a half. Every ten minutes there's an action scene that seems to go a mile a minute like the movie itself has ADD and can't slow down in case children watching the movie get bored from a lack of movement.\n\nThe Lego Movie is a perfectly harmless kids movie that most children will find enjoyable and entertaining, the story is all about everyone being special and unique in their own way so the movies message is a positive one. There are a handful of genuinely funny moments that adults will chuckle at but for the most part it's just a harmless kids movie based on the Lego toys."

And The LEGO Movie has a loose but flexible plot that never gets too self-restrained: only when the script says so.\n\nThis film is a charming, colourful and memorable treat in animated cinema, and the computer-animation is used to emulate stop-motion and I liked how the animation didn't TRY to look like it was done on computers. While it is noticeable that it is CGI, it is done so with memorable style that hardly gets in the way of enjoying what you're watching.\n\nThe LEGO Movie is an advert for promoting not only toys, but imagination and thinking outside the 'instructions'.\n\nAlso, Batman is in this movie. So there's that."

In a way, it's a plastic colored-brick version of the society of spectacles, with a starting plot that feels a lot like the rhetorics of \"the end of history\" of our corporate capitalist new world order, and in this movie, the end of history actually means just that, in the form of superglue about to seal together everything that is, according the the plans provided with the pieces and nothing else. There you got the \"end of history\", \"the society of spectacles\" (with an actual backstage area for the outlaws, who when captured have their ideas recuperated and recycled into plans\"), and \"creative evolution\", presented as talking lego characters, fighting against the spectacular capitalism.

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the popular Lego line of construction toys, The LEGO movie is a fun, entertaining animated film, filled with numerous pop-culture references, together with an interesting, rather unexpected twist near the end of the film. The script was well-written, well-planned and well- executed.\n\nThe film's storyline is rather formulaic and been done many times before: It's a story about an ordinary nobody, who lives his own life by the book, go through the same old routine everyday, conforming to specific sets of instructions...believing that 'Everything is Awesome'. But soon, he realize that there's a big world out there, that you can become something special...if you believe you are, if you believe you can do it.\n\nHowever, what makes this film different from the rest is the funny and laughable well-known western pop culture humors, parody, gags and puns found throughout the entire film. You just couldn't resist laughing at all. That's actually quite a remarkable feat for an animated film. The film is action-packed, in an amusing way. The CGI effects were excellent, it feels convincing that the film mostly made of Lego plastic building bricks...the vehicles, buildings, environments...even the explosions, flames, clouds, water were seemingly created entirely from Lego pieces.\n\nIn addition, there were many well-known comic-book, cartoon character appearances in the film: Notable ones are DC comic superheroes (Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash), Lord Of The Rings Gandalf, Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore, Star Wars' Han Solo and C3PO, Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo, Lincoln, Shakespeare and many more. They are the 'master builder', the so-called creative, intellectual ones who shapes the LEGO universe.\n\nThe film also makes you think: Why must we live a life that's practically similar to others? Can you live a world where you're required to be creative and innovative most of the time? Should we follow instructions, live your life by the book or be creative, imaginative, innovative, different than others? Why should we choose one? Why can't it be both? Is there a balance in between?\n\nThe movie's theme song \"Everything is Awesome!!\" initially feels a bit awkward, but as the film progresses, the song somehow fits the movie and turns out to be quite catchy and cool.\n\nOverall, the LEGO movie will be a pleasant, satisfying watch for the kids and adults alike. Highly recommended.\n\nhttp://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-lego-movie.html"

So i left it to the shelf for some time but recently decided to watch it. And i am happy i did since it's a fun and enjoyable movie after all.\n\nYou got a protagonist that is ordinary in every way, like the most ordinary person you can find! So he is pretty relatable for most people. Everyone will probably like the fact that they would find some element they enjoy in the movie since it's a mashup of things and anyone could be a fan of most of them. You got heroes, nostalgic toys from your childhood and realistic everyday life in the form of a boy's struggle to play with his dads collectibles.\n\nThe movie includes some solid action, decent comedy and a variety of characters voiced by great actors that fit the part. It reminds me a lot of Toy Story but this time the toys live their life in a way of spiritual form instead of moving in the real world, with some small exceptions of course. It comes down to a kid's fantasy and his wish to play with his toys and maybe find a playing partner in his serious dad.\n\nThe representation of everyone involved and the plot unfolded nicely and i think the Legos are a very nice watch and delivers solid fun to its audience. 8/10"

It's quit unique as it says that anyone can be special regardless of their creativity or need to be different.\n\nThe characters Vitruvious, Lucy, Batman, and Lord Business are all great. Their voice actors do a great job and they deliver their jokes perfectly. Emmet is the main character and probably the best because he is so relatable and a very atypical hero. There isn't anything really special about him, but he's a great every man and Chris Pratt brings the right amount of humanity and charm to the role.\n\nThe animation is beautiful and incredibly creative.

Even the water looks like it is constructed from Legos.\n\nOr you can also enjoy the many pop culture references. Many of them are related to films. So \"The Lego Movie\" is easy to enjoy for anyone who enjoys movies. It also uses many film conventions (slo-mo action, romantic film scenarios, etc.). There are also references, visual and thematic, to such films/books as \"The Matrix\", \"Transformers\", and even \"Zaradoz\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\".\n\nBut from the first, this film shows itself to be so much more. It is not merely a satire of pop culture icons. It is a very pointed satire of political and social customs and conventions. Watching those little block-people in their block-world transcends the images themselves and in a graphic way the film presents glimpses into cultural truths that most of us can identify with. How much of my life is about following directions? How much of our culture is designed to make me feel good about the slot it wants to plug me into? How easily does the human brain allow its owner to fool himself, by distractions, into a false sense of individuality?\n\nYou can enjoy the film on any of these levels. It is extremely well done. Some of the character voices fit their characters so well they are nearly iconic.\n\nThis is animation, but it is not Disney. It has so much to say that children will not discern. And the action is nonstop so you may find yourself asking how 100 minutes could pass so quickly. Clever, clever, clever. If you liked \"Wreck-It Ralph\", you should like \"The Lego Movie\"."

My brother and I loved Legos growing up, but a stop-motion animated feature with Legos both intrigued me and made me worry. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's \"The Lego Movie\" is a smart, quick, witty, and self-reflexive animated film that lives up to all the fun anyone can have with Legos.\n\nThe story is about about Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego builder, who finds the 'Special' and is chased by Lord Business (Will Ferrel) throughout the Lego realms. Emmet gets help from the master builders, which include Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), and many more.\n\nWhat's great about \"The Lego Movie\" is that it knows what it is, accepts it, but has a lot of fun with it. Whether its Popsicle wielding Legos or the dreaded glue, \"The Lego Movie\" sets up a quirky universe that is smart and creative. It brings together superheroes, science-fiction characters, wizards, astronauts, presidents, and basketball players and let's them all have a fun say in the story.\n\nIt looks at the way we use Legos. There are the instruction crazed Lego builders and the builders who make up whatever they want. Personally, I was the rule following builder and my brother was the master builder. \"The Lego Movie\" captures the best of both and makes you remember the magic of building Legos. The film is an ode to creativity and building dreams.\n\nYou can also look at this film in philosophical ways. It's about identity and modern society. It may seem ridiculous to look at an animated film like that, but you can with this film. It balances these ideas with great fun and imagination.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" is a colorful, original, and hilarious film that opens your imagination. It's well- written, has a great cast, and beautiful animation. Kids can laugh at the slap-stick humor and adults can catch all the witty dialogue and film references. I think it's one of the best animated films of this year and one of my favorite films so far this year."

The integration of Lego shapes and pieces was wonderful. If I have any complaint, it's that it gets a little long in the final climactic battle. I however, it's not nearly as bad as tMan of Steel and the last Transformers movie. If you like a tongue-in-cheek movie with lots of subtle humor, you'll love this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Lego Movie\" plays like a loud Sunday morning cartoon, but which just so happens to have the odd reference to an old movie or life situation an adult might be able to cotton on to thrown in for good measure. It is, like so many of those cartoons, an exhausting assault of colour; noise; movement and energy - experiencing it is, indeed, very much like sitting and watching two (or more) frenetic kids playing with a vast array of Lego paraphernalia - something which, it turns out, isn't too far away from what is actually happening anyway...\n\nDespite this, there is buried within \"The Lego Movie\" somewhere the message that there is no substitute for creativity and imagination, which is admirable enough, yet rather ironically the film needed to be reigned in much more for it all to work. The story is also incredibly conventional, in its depiction of heroes; villains; mentors and love interests battling away in a place where a plot to end the world has been hatched.\n\nThis wasn't something you could say about something like \"Toy Story\", which decided to eschew some of these tropes; brought to life an alternate universe within our own and also depicted an impressive two-fold character study. Meanwhile, a better example of an animated post-modernist explosion which combined rapid pacing and cultural gentrification might be 2012's \"Wreck it Ralph\".\n\nAmerican actor Chris Pratt voices Emmett, a lowly construction worker living in a city made entirely out of Lego that is run by President Business (Will Ferrell). Business is a crypto-fascist who controls the population with cheesy pop songs and awful television shows. It is, as Neil Postman once wrote, \"...in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate.\" So slavish to this situation are the inhabitants of Emmett's world that everybody 'greets' the world each morning as one.\n\nEmmett is ripped out of his world of subconscious conformity when, one day after work, he spots an intruder on the construction site and, upon confronting them, accidentally winds up deep underground prior to experiencing an out-of-body experience which renders him unconscious. Before he knows anything, he is eye-deep in a plot to do with Business' private Gestapo and the foiling of a prophecy once made by Business' sworn enemy Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to do with how, one day, a hero will lead the people to victory over the world of orthodoxy and order.\n\nNarrative is perfunctory for most of the film; that is until, perhaps cleverly, it wraps its story into what is REALLY happening beyond the confines of the film's universe. \"The Lego Movie\", for the most part, is too preoccupied with dragging you head first through a bush - then through another bush into the Wild West; then through another into a realm of knights and dragons before settling on something else entirely, but not before it has taken you to Cloud Cuckoo Land (don't ask) as Emmett and a collection of allies strive to defeat the bad guy.\n\nHow one reacts to any of this will be dependent on one's tolerance threshold for sheer nonsense, but nonsense that is harmless fun and which does possess half a dozen genuine laughs (Vitruvius' secret knock, anyone?), while being helped along by the fact everything is made of Lego. Had it been something else other than Lego, such as 'regular' characters going about a 'regular' adventure, would anyone have really provided the film with much more than a passing grade?\n\nThe makers of the film, Christopher Miller & Phil Lord, cover so much ground and flit from one to so many other places that they allow themselves licence to do anything and reference anything from any walk of life or genre. It isn't often you get Shaquille O'Neal joking about how the enemy were \"...ready for that(!)\" within minutes of Professor Dumbledore arguing with someone over the pronunciation of his name. This is actually fairly lazy, and is best epitomised when they take their characters to the aforementioned Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is, put literally, merely a locale of complete gibberish wherein anything goes.\n\nRooted at the epicentre of the piece is a stiff, egalitarian message to do with how individualism and diversity must triumph over conformity and a refusal to accept amalgamation and hybridity, which is here depicted as pure evil. Again, how one reacts to the film will depend on your own outlooks in life - are pirates and soldiers best suited to battling one another on desert islands and across vast oceans? Or do they all need to come together with the astronauts; cowboys; spaceships; half the cast of \"Harry Potter\" and Robin Hood to have one giant adventure for any of it to be enjoyable.\n\nDespite this, the film occasionally branches off for more admirable messages to do with self-confidence and thinking for oneself - using your imagination and being creative, best demonstrated in Vitruvius' line to Emmett that he must \"embrace what is special about you.\" But more tantalising is the fact there are so many objects from OUR world in the villain's possession. And why do we hear a human boy remark \"it's your turn to be the hero...\" as Emmett has his early out-of-body experience?\n\nBy the time the film had ended the first time I saw it (I watched it twice), I had a headache. I was able to appreciate it a little more after the second viewing because I had a better idea of where the chaos was heading, but remain relatively dumb-founded as to why so much praise had been previously heaped on it. Many-a nice thing has been written and said about \"The Lego Movie\", but it struck me as generally a bit of a mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Lego Movie\" is an exuberant celebration of imagination and play that transcends its toy-based origins to deliver a genuinely entertaining experience for audiences of all ages. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film combines vibrant animation, clever humor, and a heartfelt story to create a cinematic delight.\n\nThe story follows Emmet Brickowski, an ordinary Lego construction worker voiced by Chris Pratt, who is mistakenly identified as the \"Special,\" a prophesied hero destined to save the Lego universe from the evil Lord Business, voiced by Will Ferrell. Pratt brings a charming everyman quality to Emmet, making his journey from zero to hero both relatable and endearing.\n\nVisually, \"The Lego Movie\" is a feast for the eyes. The animation style mimics stop-motion, giving the film a tactile, handcrafted feel that enhances its nostalgic appeal. The intricate details and the vibrant, colorful world of Lego bricks are brought to life with stunning creativity, making every scene a visual treat. The film's imaginative set pieces, from bustling cityscapes to fantastical realms, showcase the limitless possibilities of Lego building.\n\nThe voice cast is stellar, with standout performances from Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle, Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius, and Will Arnett as a hilariously deadpan Batman. Their interactions are filled with witty banter and comedic timing that keeps the film lively and engaging.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its humor, which operates on multiple levels. It delivers rapid-fire jokes and visual gags that will have children laughing out loud, while also incorporating satirical and meta-humor that adults will appreciate. The script is smart and self-aware, poking fun at itself and the conventions of blockbuster films without becoming overly cynical.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" also carries a meaningful message about creativity and individuality. It encourages viewers to think outside the box (or brick) and embrace their unique abilities, resonating with both kids and adults. The film's climax, which intertwines the animated world with live-action elements, adds an emotional depth that is both unexpected and touching.\n\nHowever, the film's fast pace and constant barrage of jokes and action can be a bit overwhelming at times, potentially making it difficult for some viewers to keep up. Additionally, while the story is heartfelt, it occasionally veers into predictability.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" earns a solid 8 out of 10. It's a wildly creative and entertaining film that combines humor, heart, and spectacular animation to deliver a memorable experience. Whether you're a Lego enthusiast or just looking for a fun, family-friendly movie, \"The Lego Movie\" is a delightful adventure that's well worth your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lego Movie is an innovative, fresh take on an animated feature. I would never guess that a movie with such a terrible premise and an excuse to sell more Legos would turn out to be such an entertaining, fun film. It has an infectious nature thanks to the rapid pace, involvement of some of our favorite characters, and the hit song, \"Everything Is Awesome.\" The animation is brilliant and I liked the characterizations. Not every joke worked, but the majority thankfully did.\n\nPhil Lord's and Christopher Miller's film is about an ordinary citizen named Emmett who is now charged with saving the universe from the destruction of Lord Business after he is seen as the most extraordinary person in the world.\n\nThe film has a great voice cast filled with likable actors. Nowadays, Chris Pratt is a major star and he has this movie to thank as it's the beginning for what is to come. Will Ferrell once again delivers a funny performance as the villainous Lord Business. We also get good voice acting from the likes of Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nOverall, The Lego Movie is a clever film that is way better than every right it had to be. The pace may be intense for some, but it's such a lively, entertaining movie. It'a a shame the Oscars snubbed the movie, because it at least deserves a nomination for Best Animated Feature. Instead of being a film designed for commercialization, it turned out to be top-tier entertainment. Everything is indeed awesome! I rate this film 9/10."

Also I'm a big time Lego Lover too! The characters are hilarious, the story is great, the animation is made out of legos I mean, c'mon, it kinda remind me of other Lego films I watch on YouTube! My favorite Lego Movie character is Batman, cause he is the goat, the facts person too! What I absolutely love The Lego Movie is being creative, because when I want to do films, I want to be creative and create characters that we never heard of before and that would be the best idea ever! I have a big time crush on Wydstyle/Lucy in this movie, Chris Pratt playing the voice of Emmett is perfection! It kinda remind me of Mario exploring thorough the Mushroom Kingdom to find Luigi from Bowser! I really recommend to watch The Lego Movie, very great movie! 10/10!!!"

The colors, the animation, the sheer effort is just incredible. I'm really happy the visuals were always interesting, because everything else was pretty boring for me.\n\nThe humor was seriously lacking. There was constant jokes being cracked but none really hit as hard as they could. Maybe because most of the jokes were fairly obvious and I felt could have been more subtle, but it's a children's movie so what can I say.\n\nThe voices were good, the music was fine.\n\nThis is a decent movie, nothing really offended me besides a few pandering jokes and references for the sake of references. I'd definitely go see it just to see the amazing shots and sets.\n\n6/10"

This movie will give you surprises at each corner. A great story, an EPIC and i mean EPIC cameo from a company that isn't supposed to be in the movie because its owned buy Disney now which at first i was like i wonder if this is going to be in here because they have Legos out of this massive movie universe franchise but i don't want to spoil it but you may get my hint if you put the pieces together (PUN intended). Speaking of PUN Batman makes a joke that is hilarious about Pun's to himself. Batman just kills it in this movie and a couple of other Justice League members are in there hopefully that will give me some type of hold over until 2016 and 2017 with Batman vs Superman and hopefully a secretive Justice League Movie. But this movie made me laugh the entire time because of the adult humor in it which it really is a kids movie respectfully but its like a movie for when kids grow up and they see it they understand it more. Just like movies in my childhood. But everything is Awesome with this unflawed movie and you'll understand why i say everything is Awesome in this movie once you see it. It has some great characters and a great positive message in it at the end of it that really hit close to the heart because this movie has heart and lost of it. I will say this \"LEGO MOVIE\" is the new coming Toy Story and i say that as a good thing and i love Toy Story with all my heart but this has the potential to be just a Epic as Toy Story. Loved it go out and see it with your kids because i was a big kid after seeing this movie i actually wanted to buy me some Legos after viewing it, that says a lot right there."

It's not a simple childish animation, although very bright and shiny which will be the snack for your eyes. However, there are clear mature messages in the movie; rather political and social. Of course it's a masterpiece made with legos and an incredible amount of hard work has been put into making it. I loved the new ideas they have maintained in the movie and the characters are just lovely. Don't make any mistakes. I'm not saying \"you could learn a lot from the characters' actions because they are so realistic and connecting\", but they have a lot to offer. Voiceover for his movie is just brilliant, the blind guy who is basically a prophet/god figure is Morgan Freeman; isn't he that character already? And, compliments to all the other voices; significantly, Mr. Will Arnet and Will Farrel! Amazing! Now, you have to understand this is still an animation, so if you're not into it, it might not be interesting. Also, how cool is that Lonely Island was nominated for an Oscar because of \"everything is awesome\" soundtrack?\n\nIf you still don't know lonely Island, do yourself a favor, put their names on google and let the amusement and surprise commence!\n\nAll in all, definitely recommend this."

What I would like to add is that there is another layer to this film that hardly gets mentioned. The Lego world is like ours, Mr. Business is the government, and we are getting distracted by crap that gets put on television. In the Lego world, the masses are getting subdued into normal life by making them all watch \"where is my pants?\" and making them listen to generic music like \"Everything is awesome\". Media is influencing people into continuing to live their normal and structured lives, and this is also evident in our world, especially with the Miley Cyrus garbage and reality TV shows, that softens the masses while wars and killings happen overseas, and poverty ravages third world countries. But just like the Lego world, we are influenced into just living our lives and turning a blind eye to what is really happening in our world."

Simply enough, this is a perfect encapsulation of the kind of imagination, enthusiasm, adaptation and sheer randomness that runs like lifeblood through the spirit of a happy childhood. It jabs in delightfully unexpected directions. It bends physics without an explanation (nor a need for one). It casually hops from one licensed fantasy to another, mashing Green Lantern with Gandalf, and doesn't even slow down to consider the repercussions. At the best of times, I felt like I was a kid again myself, lost in nostalgia and the infinite potential locked away within every new block. And while the last act overreaches in an effort to really hammer the morals home, otherwise this is pretty much a direct hit. Crafty, funny writing, a dazzling array of vocal talent and a playful, distinct visual style - this is the kind of family film I can always make room for."

        "review_title": "THE LEGO MOVIE is So Much Better Than it Should've Been",
        "review_detailed_main": "When THE LEGO MOVIE first busts out the mind-melting tune of \"Everything is Awesome\" in the beginning, it's not just a means of displaying how brainwashed the Lego culture is in the movie, it's a warning of what's to come over the next 100 minutes. Because THE LEGO MOVIE is, in fact, awesome. Knowing my daughter would inevitably drag me to this movie, I was dreading its release. A kids' movie; strike one. Based on a toy property with no inherent plot; strike two. Released in the month of February, the notorious dumping ground for subpar films that would bomb any other time of year; strike three. Then the reviews started trickling out and, to my surprise, they were positive. Not just positive, but a certified fresh 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. A movie\u0085based on basic colorful building bricks\u0085was getting better reviews than many, many others. The premise is simple (which one would expect with a movie revolving around, you know, Legos). Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is your average, run-of-the-mill construction worker in Bricksburg, living his life according to the proper instructions and enjoying all government-approved forms of entertainment. One night, he stumbles across the legendary \"piece of resistance\"\u0085a magical artifact prophesized to identify the \"Special\" chosen one and the only thing capable of saving the world. Now a fugitive from the law, he's drawn into a world of Master-Builders with Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) where he will lead a team against the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) before he can end the world with his secret weapon: the Kra'gle.\n\nMy first clue that THE LEGO MOVIE was going to be more than a corporate cash grab aimed at vulnerable children and their weak-willed minds was that it was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. These men brought us the funniest movie of 2012 with 21 JUMP STREET and have shown they can handle themselves in comedy with a wicked sense of humor. This is one of those movies that's got plenty of goofball humor to get the kids laughing with some more subtle stuff that adults (especially those who were raised with the toys) will find fun in. Still, even the kids stuff is amusing enough that most adults (with the exception of the coldest hearts) will laugh along. There's some smart stuff here but it never sacrifices the chance for some slapstick. And the best part is the obvious love and respect for the toy itself present in every scene. Lord and Miller either major Lego fans or they're real good at faking it. This isn't a movie bent on selling toys but it'll sure make you itch for a set once it's over. It wasn't long after this came out that my daughter and I made our first visit to Legoland and I bought a few sets (as much for me as it was for her). THE LEGO MOVIE isn't here to sell a product, it's here to remind you why you loved it in the first place. And it all culminates in what is probably the only chink in the movie's armor, the climactic sequence where Emmet comes face-to-face with the \"Man Upstairs\". The message is a little heavy-handed but it's not overkill and it gets the point across.\n\nEveryone's going to walk away with a favorite character from this one. Will Arnett is a treat as Batman. He's one of the central characters as Wyldstyle's angst-ridden, arrogant boyfriend and a part of Emmet's Master-Builder team. He's essentially an 80's high school movie jock and one-third of the movie's love triangle. Liam Neeson's one of the best with his Bad Cop/Good Cop, Lord Business's main enforcer with a split personality and a penchant for roughing up chairs when he gets agitated. His action film persona where he grumbles threats and opens generous cans of whoop\u0085erm, butt\u0085only make his high-pitched, super-friend cop that much funnier. Personally, I loved Benny the \"1980's-something spaceman\". He's voiced by Charlie Day and he's just as spastic as you'd expect, and all the poor guy wants is to build a spaceship. There are Lego cameos everywhere in THE LEGO MOVIE, bringing together characters from countless properties (both original Lego and licensed). Some of the funniest bits in the movie stem from random cameos and there's one about halfway into the movie that I refuse to spoil here but, just know, it's pretty cool. And the voice cast is almost as extensive. You could miss entire chunks of the movie just trying to pinpoint the voice actors, many of which only make the briefest of appearances. One I would've missed was Nick Offerman as Metal Beard; I never would've figured that one out until I paid closer attention to the end credits.\n\nWith so many easter eggs and blink-and-you-miss-them gags, I've found that THE LEGO MOVIE has some staying power. Every time I watch it, I'm finding something fun I'd missed before. As one of the few family movies that isn't downright painful for parents, this is an easy recommendation from me. With so much a movie like this had working against it from the start, THE LEGO MOVIE is definitely what I'd consider the surprise hit of 2014."

How can they base one movie, on an entire company everything they've done?\n\nThe writing is clever thinking. Thinking about the company as a whole. What do they do? What is its purpose? Are there any problems with it? What media has it been involved with in the past? The aim of The LEGO Group is to spawn some creativity and fun, with no rules needed. Make the movie like a 100-minute commercial with a plot. It just has everything it needs - a hero's journey, epic climaxes with plastic-defying action, even Biblical implements, everything!\n\nAs for the animation, this is such an innovation. Lego has tried before to be stop-motion and CGI, it's such a contrasting challenge to mash the two up in the right way. But they managed to, in a such a way! And in the Lego World, everything seems to be made of Lego! Something that would challenge the film if it were entirely stop-motion. It even references the earliest Brickfilms, so true to the history. You see the texture of CGI-replicated plastic surfaces in nearly every shot (they looked hard at Lego with a microscope during design and animation so they could replicate exactly).\n\nAs for the music, such a first for its kind. Unique electronic sounds in its score, and cinematic orchestra intertwining with it. As for its theme, \"Everything is Awesome\" will probably never get old. It's so catchy you can play it or sing it in pretty much any occasion.\n\nAmazing. You might it, a \"Master-Piece\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "3D animation is a new thing in the cinema world. Just the two decades old technology, which started with 'Toy Story'. So as it is young, filmmakers utilizing it very awesomely to create great stuffs. So far we had seen the many wonders of classical tales such as 'Tangled', 'Frozen' et cetera, as well based on the modern subjects like, 'Cars', 'Turbo' et cetera. Here it comes one more movie that specially made referring gaming object like the recent one 'Wreck-It-Ralp'.\n\nI loved 'Wreck-It-Ralp', but the fact is that I was not in favour of this movie. Expected it gonna bomb at the box office, then surprised me with the result and made very curious. I knew characters in the form of Lego bricks are easy to animate, we can say just like the stop-motion animation, but it won't give smooth pleasurable flow. That truly bothered me over this movie. Once I began to watch within a few minutes I got adjusted with it so comfortable and enjoyed completely.\n\nThe story of an ordinary construction worker, Emmet and his unexpected journey towards saving the world. He was accompanied by the great fighters and warriors and superheroes. He has to find the secret plan of villainous leader who controls the land of Lego and must defeat him. To know that you must watch the movie.\n\nIt is a nice movie, though the story is not fresh. Kind of spoof which imitates recent past movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', Chris Nolan's Batman movie and many others. Especially all the famous characters from various movies had the cameos. It was so fun having them together in one place. So it is not the story, but the way of story telling was so innovative and modern and that showed this movie to the gate of success.\n\nI remember I had the best time building something with these Lego bricks in my childhood. All those memories came alive after watching this just like I remembered during 'Wreck-It-Ralp'. It is such a cute movie with fun characters. A smart movie for all age group. I am very much sure it will be one the strongest contender for the next edition of the Oscar ceremony. At present I am not seeing any other equally good ones so who know it may win, but have to wait for another 6 months to know that."

Permanently.\"\n\nThat quote pretty much summarizes conservatism, doesn't it? I love the social/political messages slipped into this fun, clever film, with a character called President Business keeping the public dumb and happy through vapid entertainment and free tacos. He's all about maintaining his possessions, not serving the public. It's a land where workers mindlessly sing \"Everything is Awesome,\" believing in rosy optimism, and overlook the sinister things going on right in front of them.\n\nYou certainly don't have to see a critique of America to enjoy this film though, as it works on several levels. The jokes and references are fresh, and the pace is great. The visuals, making things like ocean waves out of Legos, are highly creative, and the way the story ties together in a real-life basement is fantastic. There are wonderfully positive messages relating to nonconformity, believing in oneself, and understanding that everyone has an ability to make a difference, and should be empowered. It cuts through many traditional film tropes, including those around superheroes and stories with a \"chosen one,\" even if the romance is a bit standard. All that and appearance from Lego Shaq too, I mean, what else could you ask for?"

He finds himself drafted into a fellowship of strangers who are on a mission to stop an evil tyrant's (Will Ferrell) plans to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly -- and hilariously -- unprepared for such a task, but he'll give it his all nonetheless."

He lives his life by the instructions, but one day he goes off the beaten path and finds himself deemed \"the special one\" by a rebel group hellbent on bringing an end to evil dominance in the land.\n\nI had heard of good things from the film, I just didn't expect to cry from laughter. The Lego Movie is my kind of humour, fast paced, sometimes stupid, completely random and chaotic. The Lego Movie is all this wrapped in a beautifully created lego world that will have you smiling at all the little pieces that make up the brilliance of the animation. A must see film that is consistently funny and entertaining from start to finish. Bring the whole family.\n\nThe story involves in the old tale of an ordinary guy mistaken for some kind of hero, then he learns to trust in himself and finds the courage to become the hero the people thought he originally was. Nothing really new in terms of storytelling, but the presentation, the uniqueness of the art and the witty humour make for one tremendous ride from start to finish. The film feels like it never stops from the get go. Constantly on hyper speed, the pace never drags and the kids will never be bored.\n\nFilled to the brim with voice acting, Chris Pratt leads the film with Elizabeth Banks playing the romantic interest. Supporting roles include Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Allison Brie, Nick Offerman, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and dozens of others in smaller cameo roles all fit the bill nicely.\n\nThe imaginative landscape is truly inspiring here. Thrust into different lego worlds we'll be in the Wild West at one point, then stuck on a Pirate Ship the next. Despite the film being entirely CGI, you'll swear to yourself that half the film must have been done with actual legos. The attention to detail is awe inspiring.\n\nThe Lego Movie is indeed hilarious and a must see. It's early in the new year, but I expect this to be the best animated film this year. Can't wait for the sequel."

He was using Lego from a different point of view for a different purpose - but of course that prohibited the child to make use of Lego his way. There is a morality about creativity and joy in the movie of course - but most and foremost there is the very basic joy to create.\n\nStyle and artistic creativity is well done, the mixture between CGI and stop motion is for the most part seamless.\n\nAn easy 8/10 - i had a lot of fun watching that movie."

What I didn't expect from the Lego Movie was the amount of imagination and the sheer fun that was in store. At first glance the film seems like a run of the mill adventure story of Emmet a likable everyday Lego figure who is mistaken for the special and is supposed to be a master builder of Lego bricks but is only a humble construction worker what follows is a madcap juvenile adventure with surprisingly a bit of social satire undercutting the story of our samey and conforming culture. The story becomes more and more original and creative as it speeds along with it's surreal humour.\n\nThe animation is simple yet groundbreaking in how CGI is used to replicate stop motion so much detail can be seen with the scratches and finger prints on some of the characters faces in close ups. The voice-work is also top notch I can't think of a character that didn't make me laugh they were all so wonderfully weird, and quirky.\n\nThe twist ending is also very thought provoking but was hinted at very early on so it was kind of a dead giveaway. I do admire the themes that were being addressed and has a great message for kids of all ages to never forget your sense of play."

The story about the \"special\" within us all, is told sensitively, although there are some mind-bending action bits here too. Its eventually a tale about finding the better in us, in a world, where the good is dying slowly, but surely. The message is important & its delivered with zeal.\n\nPhil Lord & Christopher Miller's Screenplay is delightfully entertaining. it borrows some of the most iconic characters of film history & pitch them in perfectly, without ever looking overdone. The Writing is super-strong at all times. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is dazzling. The Visual Effects are OUTSTANDING! A Special Mention for Mark Mothersbaugh's Score.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Chris Pratt leads the pack & enacts the unlikely protagonist, with full commitment. Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle, is charming. Will Arnett as Batman/Bruce Wayne & Liam Neeson as Bad Cop/Good Cop, are the show-stoppers though. Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius & Will Ferrell as the villainous Lord Business, also leave a solid mark.\n\nOn the whole, 'The Lego Movie' is truly a masterful tale. Two Thumbs Up!"

I mean the trailer makes it look like a series of flat jokes, but it's really a special story, and the fact that it didn't win the animated Oscar, let alone get nominated, has to be one of the biggest snubs this decade. The Lego movie is a really fun movie that anyone can enjoy, the ending is unexpected but extremely cleaver, and overall just really fun. 8.3 is the number for this one, and sincerely is one of my favorites, and one of the best, of 2014.

It has encapsulated so many ways we relate to each other, and yet the most fundamental is to be cared for, and worth caring for. It is amazing how much energy we waste in conforming, and not conforming,\n\nLord Business is the perfect present day business man who wants to contract choice and command the fewest changes possible while keeping costs down. He will command the masses to take the bromide that will take out all individual freedom forever.\n\nWhy would anyone want to do this? Because they have no love, they value power instead. But as soon as Emmett gives Lord Business his hand, he acquiesces and reverses the 'perfect' inactive world that, by nature would be destructive.\n\nAmazing funny film to show how utterly divorced our current business model is from being human. Thank money for that. Rather, the scarce money model we use, which is in total unlimited ability we can create and use this for the foundation of more innovation by our children.\n\nIronic that it is sponsored by a such an immense company, but then, Lego is ingenious at it is, as clunky as that may be."

He is just mean like that.\n\nIf you snored through other animated movies with their boring hollywoodish scripts (I'm talking to you, pixar), then this movie will fill your synapses with rainbow powderpuff glitz. There is so much internet in this movie. You gotta love it. Raging unicorn kitties. Robot pirates battling sharks with LAZERS. Lincoln on a rocket chair. You name it.\n\nLet me finish with a fair warning, though.

And the ending (Which I am not giving away) made the clich\u00e9s OK. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I've not seen a movie this full in a long time. There were a lot of people there. Even though it was CG, I was still really impressed with the \"stop motion\" animation. This was some of the most brilliant animation I've seen in a long time. Well anyways, I've gotta go and try making my stop motion movie with legos, until I find out how boring it is then decide to do something else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is \"which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?\"\n\nIndeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blas\u00e9, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.\n\nBut this is an adjective I wouldn't use for \"The Lego Movie\" as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.\n\nThere's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.\n\nLast time I had as much fun was with \"Rango\" and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn \"Everything is Awesome\", a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's.\n\nBut under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clich\u00e9s but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and \"The Lego Movie\" was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.\n\nNevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's \"Imagination Land\", and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.\n\nHonorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.\n\nEverything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels."

We went to see it again in theaters, all the way through this time, and once again we were blown away by how great it was.\n\nWhen it was available to own we bought it, I watched it quite a few times, and then I sat back and gave it a rest. That was five years ago. I just recently revisited this movie after seeing it playing on television the other day and I was reminded just how hilarious and brilliant this movie is.\n\nIt barrages you with jokes from start to finish while managing to tell a touching story urging us to realize the greatness in ourselves if we just BELIEVE. \"I know it sounds like a cat poster.\"\n\nIf you're not careful, this movie could even make you shed a couple of tears because that's definitely what happened to me. What a towering monument of film making."

Luckily, comic reliefs like Batman appear, making it easier for us to at least get involved through the jokes provoked by well-known characters. The experience is pleasant but not memorable; that is the drama of the movie then resolved with Batman Lego which is undoubtedly far superior."
