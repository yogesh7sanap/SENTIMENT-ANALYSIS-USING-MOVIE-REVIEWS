        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.\n\nThe first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.\n\nThis movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.\n\nI love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.\n\nThis movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?\n\nYes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.\n\nThe lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.\n\nAnd so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman \"Batunbuuurg\", refers to Robin as \"Buuurd Bouy\" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word \"ice\" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman \"Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola\" the urge to use the video's \"stop\" button is almost insurmountable.\n\nBane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?\n\nTiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her \"garden needs tending\" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - \"I'll help you grab your rocks\" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: \"I never leave the cave without it\"; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. \"It's the hockey team from Hell\"; \"So this is where you hang out\"; \"I'll cancel the pizza\"; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!\n\nThe film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. \"Not all heroes wear masks\"; \"to give life... that's true power\". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with \"failures\" like that?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't get me wrong, the old Adam West Batman TV show was certainly funny, and given the times, a more accurate representation of what Batman was trying to be wouldn't have succeeded nearly as well. But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.\n\nIn Batman & Robin, Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny, this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here, seeing as it's NOT funny, it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies, and, arguably, the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space, Gigli, and You Got Served.\n\nGeorge Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes, but this suave, dashing, and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.\n\nThere's Chris O'Donnell, the angst-ridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.\n\nAlicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say, \"Hmm, who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone!\" No offense to Alicia, but she's out in right field on this one. Her tough-girl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside, she actually does very little.\n\nNow, onto the villains. Uma Thurman, who we know CAN act, is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First, when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela, she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan, by the way, would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.\n\nArnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean, of all the Batman villains I could see him playing - Bane, for christ's sake - Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless, calculated, and cold (no pun intended) sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.\n\nAnd then, all that aside, they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says \"chill out.\" Of all the ways it sounds, menacing is not among them.\n\nSeriously, I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman, and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then, this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead, it borders on a travesty of good cinema. I only wish that 0 stars was a selectable option at the imdb, for this film ALONE."

But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about, but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity.\n\nBatman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help; his niece, Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientist/right activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien, named Bang, he \"kills\" her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them I guess.\n\nBatman & Robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman, the Dark Knight, it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this, I really wish I could get past this, I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please, don't watch this film if you love Batman, or you'll be sorry.\n\n2/10"

Stunningly awful, this was a disaster from the moment George Clooney traded in his scrubs for the black rubber boots. And it's not even awful in a cute, SHOWGIRLS kind of way. You won't laugh, but you might cry over the fact you've just flushed 125 precious minutes of your life down the crapper.\n\nWhile everyone involved brings shame to their families, from the uncomfortable Clooney as the lamely-interpreted hero to Governornator Arnold Schwarzenegger as the junior-high-dialog-spewing Mr. Freeze, director Joel Schumacher must be punched the hardest. Even those who thought he embarrassed the franchise with the light-hearted BATMAN FOREVER were taken aback. Schumacher treats the audience like a group of eight-year-old boys with ADD, constantly trying to impress us with unexciting action scenes like a hockey-themed opening battle reminiscent of the under-appreciated genius of MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.\n\nThe writers only make things worse with their \"witty\" hero chatter (\"This is why Superman works alone\"... har har, where do they come up with them??) and drawn-out \"human\" angles, such as butler Alfred's illness and a childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin and the sexy Poison Ivy. This isn't root-on-the-heroes entertainment. On the contrary, you'll find yourself wishing Poison Ivy would tongue kiss both masked men to put us all out of our misery.\n\nI love Batman and superhero flicks. I'm not a movie snob by any means, as I'm willing to forgive many a gaffe. But I absolutely loathe BATMAN & ROBIN. I loathe how it disgraces the characters it depicts. I loathe how the \"talent\" involved is still allowed within 100 feet of a film set or writer's room. It must be said again that BATMAN & ROBIN is the kind of experience that will make you lose all faith in Hollywood -- and humanity."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the most disappointing movie in the history of film for me.\n\nA 2 out of 10 is generous. I should give it a zero strictly based on the Bat Credit Card scene.\n\nEvery single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be \"Bat-Whipped\" for this piece of junk. This is your typical \"absolutely cannot fail\" franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not \"Scientist\". Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too \"drama queen\" which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader."

It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film.\n\nThe casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.\n\nThe blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes."

The Batmobile was beautiful, as were the sets. The movie was forceful and interesting. \"Batman Returns\" shared some of the traits of its predecessor while adding more lunacy to the mix. It did suffer from the lack of top of the line talent (Jack Nicholson).\n\nAnd then Mr. Schumacher ruined everything.\n\n\"Batman Forever\" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. Since its from the same series, there is no excuse for the director to run wild and away from the spirit of the originals, in which a sad soul has to fight crime in order to mantain sanity. In Schumacher movies, Batman has to have the coolest cars, to kiss the most beautiful girls and to have a lot of fun while doing this. The first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice which was painfully taken by Batman; in the last 2 it is as if violence was fun and part of Batman\u00b4s life.\n\nThere are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. But there are two things that are an insult to every film goer: the Batmobile is reduced to a clownmobile, and Batman\u00b4s suit has NIPPLES in it. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as \"so bad it is good\". This is merely \"so bad it is bad\"."

The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's one liners become almost iconic when viewed from the lense of \"what would be the dumbest, corniest, thing that could happen right now in this scene.\" Uma Thurman's over the top cringe worthy Poison Ivy is actually hilarious when you know what this actress is actually capable of when she's given a good role to work with. Bane looking something like a theme park mascot is impossible to take seriously when you've seen later, more serious versions of the character.\n\nIn short, for 1997 when this movie came out, and for a variety of marketing reasons, people didn't get that this movie was supposed to be a joke. People still had Tim Burton's Batman movies in their head they weren't expecting to go full Adam West.\n\nThat's a definite failure of the movie, to fail to make sure the audience understood what you were trying to do. But I think, 20 years later we can finally look back on this movie as being misunderstood in its time. It's suffered I think more than enough for the crime of being a joke that no one got. I think it's time people tried for a moment to rethink what this movie was.\n\nIf you still think this movie was the worst thing ever even after I've said my piece, I'm still not going to argue with you. I'm just going to smile as I agree with you."

        "review_detailed_main": "1. Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as a scientist and have him spout nothing but one-liners for the entire movie. I cannot stress how bad his performance is. Even by his standards the level of acting is shockingly poor. Also Mr. Freeze was an intelligent guy in the comics then it doesn't do to cast a guy who can't even speak American without a heavy accent. Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect (he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ) he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.\n\n2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I, a great fan of the comics, did not find this amusing at all.\n\n3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies (which made them successful) and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.\n\n4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal, which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor, poor, poor.\n\n5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.\n\n6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.\n\n7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl (Batgirl). She cannot pull it off.\n\n8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.\n\n9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.\n\nIn my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created. So with that I give my final score.\n\n1/10"

George Clooney is quite a charming actor, but he is not my idea of Batman. Batman I don't think is supposed to be charming, he's supposed to be dark and brooding, and Clooney lacked that. What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film. This is further disadvantaged by a truly pathetic script that nobody in the cast could do anything with.(these actors deserved so much better)The special effects were okay, but very confused in terms of execution. In conclusion, not the worst movie, I have ever seen, but it is one of those films, where everything needed to make it memorable falls flat. 3/10 for effort. Bethany Cox"

Now, not that Joel Schumacher is evil, but he is kinda. His idea to turn Batman into a big-starred parody somehow managed to go by with little scrutiny with Batman Forever. Probably because there was so much hype. And now Batman and Robin. No need for a good actor, George Clooney says he'll do it. The result is a relative disaster, making all believability and style Batman had go out the window.

The only reason it gets an 8 is because Schwarzenegger actually makes the movie funny, George Clooney's suit is kind of nostalgic for me in all honesty and some of the camera angles are pretty dope, ngl. This is also the movie that brought us the Nolan Batman trilogy which is 2000 times better than this piece of... *masterpiece* (of) cleverness and absolute genius! A serious R.I.P to the man, the myth, the legend, Joel Schumacher, who should not be remembered for this.. ahem, *masterpiece*, but for his other brilliant work like Batman Forever (yeah, to be honest I kinda love that movie), A Time To Kill, Falling Down, 8mm, Phone Booth, Phantom of the Opera and many more. The guy didn't only direct this, don't take the 8-rating seriously, it's just because it's nostalgic and brought us three other movies that were a f*** ton better than this one!"

I hate the way she comes in and steals Robin's bike and goes out after lying to her uncle Alfred that she's going to bed. She is NOT a role-model while bashing Poison Ivy for not being a good role-model. Batgirl please!! I also didn't like how she knew how to work all of the bat equipment without proper training. That is bull. 2) Batnipples and batbutts - come on that is so dumb!! 3) Colours to bright on the screen at times. 4) Too cartoony at times.\n\nWhat I like: 1) Fun story and film. 2) The retro feel at times - sometimes it's almost like watching Adam West and Burt Ward - I dig that. 3) It feels like watching a live action comic - love the comic book feel.\n\n7/10."

Batman Forever I liked, but it foreshadowing this movie, which turned the once cool, dark, Batman-worthy Burton version into a glow-in-the-dark, kiddy-show, campy version. I still say this movie is OK, but if something isn't done about Joel, I won't be saying this for much longer.\n\nHere we go...\n\nBatman: I am so surprised that everyone says that George Clooney is the best part of this movie. He is the worst Batman in my opinion.(I think Kilmer was the best) Clooney isn't that bad, but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!\n\nRobin: Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker, minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately, the part is a whiny, annoying, untrustworthy, gullible, stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin, he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever, but his character isn't improving.\n\nBatgirl: You know, we really didn't need another sidekick right away, did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6, for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great (though not in this movie) but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.\n\nMr. Freeze: Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold, and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah, his thing was ice, but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE (no exaggeration) had to be an ice pun!\n\nPoison Ivy: The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part, despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting, unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts, you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.\n\nBane: I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling, stupid, grunt-like idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.\n\nAlfred: Alfred is just as good as always in this movie, although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.\n\nCommishoner Gordan: You know, in Batman you had respect for this guy. Now his only scenes are when he drools over Poison Ivy. Sad.\n\nOverall, Uma Thurman's sexy role in this movie alone is enough for you to watch this movie. To die by getting kissed by Uma, what a great way to die! :)"

The rest of the film is overdone in every aspect, over produced, over acted, it's all just too much. Too many heroes and villains.\n\nAs for the casting, all I can think of here, was that they packed it out with names, simply to smash The Box Office, whether they were right for the part of not, in this case, most of them were miscast.\n\nThere is no denying the brilliance of George Clooney, but in this instance, he was just totally miscast as Batman, I'm not sure his agent had his career in mind with this one. As for Arnie.... I'd rather think of him in Terminator and T2, this performance, is better forgotten.\n\nThe special effects look so cheap and tacky, this thing really hasn't aged at all well.\n\nI think I deserve a Starbucks after sitting through it again, 2/10."

This would all be ok if there was some other positive aspect of the film, but alas we find none. This film attempts something no other film has ever done: to have 7 main characters all in their own separate plot lines, making for a pot pourri of confusion and silliness.\n\nAlong with such films as \"ID4\" and \"Armageddon\", this film shows why hype-factories don't make good movies, and independent companies do, with films such as \"Fargo\" and \"Slingblade\".\n\nIn conclusion, it wasn't the worst movie ever made, but I gave it 4 out of 10.

Interestingly, despite there being many horrible superhero movies (such as \"The Spirit\" and \"Catwoman\"), this and \"Superman IV\" are the only ones currently on the list....so it's quite a dubious achievement!\n\nDespite \"Batman & Robin\" being a terrible film, it is interesting to note that despite the film costing an ungodly $125,000,000 to make...it DID manage to earn about double the cost...making it Warner Brothers' biggest moneymaker of the year. It's bad press did, however, help destroy the franchise until it was revived and revamped several years later with Christian Bale and Chrisopher Nolan.\n\nWhen the film started, I could almost see instantly why the movie was a stinker. It was completely cartoonish compared to the previous Batman films of the 80s and 90s. Seeing Batman and Robin in a hockey game with Mr. Freeze and his minions simply made me cringe...as did the sound effects throughout the film. Several times, the punching and kicking sounds were pretty much straight from the campy old TV series....and fans must have been infuriated to see the series turned into a dumbed down cartoonish nightmare. Did the stupidity in this scene get any worse in this opening scene? Yup...when Freeze escapes in a rocket (???) and Batman and Robin chase the film leaps into ultra-stupid mode! It ended hellishly, with Batman and Robin both jumping from the rocket on sky surfboards and they miraculously survived--and during their descent Robin yells out 'Cowabunga'!! What follows rarely got much better...and again and again the film resorted to cartoonism instead of making a decent film that wouldn't infuriate audiences.\n\nAnother horrible scene was the homage to Marlene Dietrich in her dance scene from \"Blonde Venus\". The Dietrich dance was dumb....the version with Uma Thurman managed to make it even stupider. Seeing her in magenta gorilla costume was indeed stupid!\n\nTo make everything worse, Miss Thurman overacted terribly throughout the film and I'd say she was the weakest and most annoying actor in the cast....and I assume she was only doing what the director and writer instructed her to do. The same can be said about all the horrid puns uttered by Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze....he was just doing what he was told to do. And, ultimately the crap dialog between the three crime fighters is pretty much the same...the delivered the crap that they were given.\n\nIn order to have made a good film, \"Batman & Robin\" should have learned SOMETHING from \"Batman\" (1989). It should have been darker, had one GOOD villain instead of three lousy ones and not given way to cheap stunts and gimmickery. Instead of a dark, brooding story, this one looks almost like it was filmed inside a carnival fun house...complete with glow in the dark neon paint and one dimensional characters.\n\nOverall, a truly horrid pile of vomit. The film manages to earn a 2...but only because for $125,000,000 the film ultimately must look good...at least at times.\n\nSo was there anything I liked about the movie? Well, I did laugh at the scene where Mr. Freeze was watching the Snow Miser from \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\" TV special...and he tried to make his minions sing along with him. It was dumb...but it did make me laugh and was one of the few moments that I didn't hate myself for watching this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hears a movie you wish to not give a single star but, that just means you haven't reviewed it yet. This may be the worst superhero movie ever, even one of the worst movies ever. Let's start with the costumes. They have rubber nipples as part of their costumes, it shows a closeup of both their butts, the batman costume looks more dark blue than black, and robins suit is the new 52 nightwain with a cape. Why does the batmobile look like the inside has one of those electric orbs? This movie has batgirl, and her acting is the worst ever in any superhero movie, even worse than as many people point out how Brie Larson's acting is wooden in captain marvel this is 100 times worse. Now onto mister freeze, he's supposed to be one of batman's most sympathetic villains, but in this movie he makes ice related puns while smiling and freezing random civilians. So in this movie their are puns every 10 seconds, robin is an idiot, theirs a bat credit card witch batman flashes while him and robin are bidding over poison Ivy witch is basically prostitution. Lissen to this dialogue.\n\nMr. Freeze: you have 11 minutes to thaw the boy. (Robins completely ingulfed in ice how do you know he has that long, that's not even correct.) Batman: commissioner you have 11 minutes to thaw these people. (How is commissioner Gordon supposed to do that?) Theirs also poison Ivy who's acting is almost as god awful as batgirl's but still horrible. Her dialogue is bad, her costumes are rediculouse, and she's defeated by being kicked into her flower chair and having it closed on her. Theirs also a scene of batman showing Mr freeze a tiny bat screen that shows poison Ivy confessing to killing freezes wife even this their was nothing their to record it. Bane is also in this movie, he looks rediculous and in the comics he's supposed to be very intellectual and smart, and very strong and an expert to fighting even without his serum. In this movie he's the exact opposite of everything I just used to describe his comic counterpart, the closest thing he gets to a line is, \"monkey work\"."

It sure wasn't put out to break some new ground in movie making. All the characters are one-dimensional and phony. Was there any real dialogue in this movie or was it just a bunch of catchy one-liners. I can't think of a single performance in this movie that wasn't just down right weak. The first two Batman movies the ones made by Tim Burton are so much better than the recent installments by Joel Schumacher. It seems Schumacher is trying to make a live action cartoon or something. When everyone knows that the darker Batman in the Batman Dark Knight comics is the coolest version of Batman."

That dark stuff just doesn't cut it for me, I don't care how many people rated \"The Dark Knight\" 8.9 out of 10. \"B&R\" is entertaining if you don't take the movie (or maybe yourself) too seriously. And that's what I remember about reading DC comics in the sixties: it was fun. \"The Governor\" as Mr Freeze alone is worth the price of the DVD (probably now around five dollars), because he takes the term \"camp\" to levels nobody dared to think of, which is fine by me since he's just a comic book villain. No masterpiece, but certainly not as bad as most of the other reviewers have stated."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen Batman & Robin many times and that should show that it's not really all that bad.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film is that most people misunderstood it. After Tim Burton's very dark Batman films, no one would expect this. The style is completely different and instead of being dark, everything is very colorful. It's more like the 60s TV show. If this had been a movie by its self and not a sequel, maybe people wouldn't hate it so much.\n\nAnother flaw is the new character Batgirl. I will never understand why she was created. She serves no purpose and her costume looks cheap. Robin turning up in the last movie was bad enough.\n\nA good thing this movie has is Mr. Freeze. In my opinion he is the best of Batman's villains. He is cool (Haha), likable, funny, has character and doesn't just run around laughing like the previous villains. Poison Ivy however was nothing special.\n\nGeorge Clooney is not Batman. He can play Bruce Wayne, but when he's wearing the bat suit he just looks like George Clooney dressed up as Batman. It looks silly. Maybe it's just the new suit. Robin's suit also looks rather silly, but it looks better than the suit he wore in the 60s. When Batman and Robin are standing next to each other at parties or crime scenes and they are not fighting, they look ridiculous. I just thought I'd point that out.\n\nMy conclusion is that this film deserves at least 5 out of 10. That's not great, but better than what a lot of people say. It's an entertaining film that should not be a sequel. Nothing more, nothing less."

I've never actually met anyone who's picked George Clooney as their favorite, so if you watch this one, it'll most likely be for the supporting cast. The adorable Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the equally adorable Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a frosty yet comical villain, and Uma Thurman plays a wicked seductress. See what I mean? You'll probably forget George Clooney is even in it.\n\nUnfortunately, this installment wasn't even as successful as its predecessor Batman Forever, which wasn't very good. The consistently good feature shared by both films is the kid-friendly attitude. These are comic book movies, and should be able to be enjoyed by kids of all ages-aren't young folks the target audiences for comic books? The later volumes are far too dark and frightening. The darkest part of the movie is an uninteresting sideplot about Batman's butler Alfred's health-but it can still turn into a funny scene if you make fun of George Clooney's smirk and head tilt instead of paying attention to what he's saying. So, if you're looking for a good one to start your youngster on, this is it."

Uma has the most recognizable lips in the business imo, so watching her talk was as enjoyable as listening to her voice. Arnold always brings the weight, the heavy, to his part- Clooney brought the good looks- Alicia was feisty and an excellent complement to Chris O'Donnell and, the big one, Michael Gough, has been Alfred since 1989 when Michael Keaton was Batman. If all of you Batman snobs could see yourself, you look like your parents. Kids like Batman too, they always did. This movie was clearly made to capitalize on toy sales like other films were enjoying and it would have except for your crappy reviews.\n\nThis Batman is just as good as any previous Batman, enjoyed by those with younger minds, broader intellect and other than myopic character boundaries. One day perhaps those qualities will be yours and you can give this version another showing."

        "review_title": "A brazen dare, taken too far",
        "review_detailed_main": "Your frame of reference or past viewing experiences do not matter. There is nothing that can prepare you for the extreme onslaught that this film represents. 'Batman & Robin' actively, aggressively rejects the slightest measure of any and all subtlety, far exceeding any point of comparison. Possessing only the faintest awareness of this - without watching it, without reading anything about the production - one can discern that Joel Schumacher's second run at the Caped Crusader was a daring embrace of the cartoonish tomfoolery of the 1960s series starring Adam West. Yet this is an embrace that is enthusiastically amplified beyond all reason, cranking up the irreverent bombast to an outrageous 200% of any previous iteration. Just as much to the point, it's such a jolting break from those titles that more recently preceded this one - Tim Burton's Batman movies, or even 1995's 'Batman Forever' - that whether one first watched it in 1997 or at any time since, it's plainly stunning on a level that's hard to describe. 'Batman & Robin' is wild.\n\nI will say - it's honestly better than I expected. Sights unseen, for more than 20 years, I had a definite impression formed based on its reputation alone. That reputation isn't exactly undeserved, but I recognize what Schumacher wanted to do, and the direction this feature was taken. On the surface it's kind of a brilliant notion, upending all existing assumptions that had formed about the comic book character since West last donned the mask, and there's genuinely a lot about 'Batman & Robin' that's done well. Much has been made of the costume design, of course; I won't say it's perfect, but indelicacies aside, it's legitimately fantastic. So is, emphatically, the hair and makeup work. The set design and decoration is absolutely marvelous - frankly, considered at large, the production design and art direction are astounding. Every vision we're given of Gotham is fabulously imaginative, indulging the utmost whimsy, and the same fantastical approach is taken toward props, weapons, vehicles, smaller set pieces, and so on.\n\nStill other aspects ride a line between sincere and cheeky, including camerawork, shot composition, sound effects - and, of course, visual effects. Above all, the acting is an incredible, bewildering smorgasbord. Michael Gough carries himself like a man who is in an entirely different movie (that is to say, a considerably better one) as Arnold mostly chews all available scenery, only fleetingly showing any heart, and Robert Swenson is given the easiest part in the film because all he has to do is flex his muscles and yell as he repeats single words from other characters' lines. George Clooney's Bruce Wayne/Batman is marginally disinterested, while Chris O'Donnell turns in a display best described as \"overdoing it,\" and Alicia Silverstone's portrayal is a little too stilted at many points. John Glover rather channels John Lithgow in 'Buckaroo Banzai' with a wonderfully manic depiction of Dr. Woodrue - a sharp contrast to Pat Hingle's more reasoned indication that he's just here to have fun. And Uma Thurman... Well, it's funny, because when we first meet Dr. Pamela Isley, Thurman readily impresses as being the sole person on hand to demonstrate a speck of meaningful nuance and range - and this is then consciously thrown out as the transformation to Poison Ivy takes place, joining her co-stars in the frivolity.\n\nMind you, I don't mean to disparage the cast. We've all seen these actors many other times, elsewhere, and seen what greatness they're capable of. In 'Batman & Robin,' they put those same skills to use to wholly lean into the blustery nonsense of a live-action cartoon. Even at the most preposterous, these are not bad performances - they are what Schumacher, and Akiva Goldsman's screenplay, demand. And that screenplay is a marvel in its own way. Minute glimmers of earnestness are peppered throughout, mostly owing to Alfred's part in this tale. There are strong ideas in the narrative, and the story is complete, cohesive, and coherent - and really does feel like a solid plot concept for the Dark Knight. With that said: the characters, dialogue, and scene writing are dazzlingly silly, charging headlong into a kaleidoscopic funhouse of buffoonery. This movie is astonishingly direct and overcooked: launching headfirst into the plot from the very start; filling almost every line of dialogue with tired cliches, and cheesy one-liners and quips; and saturating every scene with a veritable cacophony of boisterous, ostentatious color, action, flair, and embellishment. Whatever manner of B-movie shenanigans one may recall, resembling the frills and pomp here - this puts them all to shame.\n\nMuch of this may run counter to the personal preferences of individual viewers, but none of it is an inherent mark against the film on paper. The issue here, more than anything else, is that it was all just taken too far. Excepting purists, I think it's probably safe to say that most anyone can get on board with comedy, or relish seeing comedy blended with action or adventure. Goofy as it was, there's a reason the 60s Batman series is so enduring on its own merits. 'Batman & Robin,' however, takes those kernels of tongue-in-cheek kitschy fun and warps them into the loudest, most electric, most flamboyant display of audiovisual fireworks that they could possibly be. The sheer zestful spirit of the endeavor is endearing to some extent, but even from the opening scene the volume is turned up absurdly high, and it's never truly dialed back - and in that, it's grating, and exhausting, especially as the movie treads on for a flummoxing two hours. It's a viewing experience that's legitimately taxing.\n\nI don't believe 'Batman & Robin' is quite as bad as its notoriety portends. I see what it tried to do, and it does work - only, it's still so very much to take in, that to watch even a portion of it feels like sensory overload. I can very well appreciate why it's held in so low regard, and I can't especially argue with those who hold it in greater contempt. Why, I'm not sure how I would ever come to recommend this to anyone - save perhaps for the most direly curious - because it's a feature that even for die-hard Adam West fans, and the most open-minded of cinephiles, is a trial to bear. All the same, I guess what it comes down to is that provided you're receptive to all the wild, weird possibilities that the medium has to offer, and you happen to come across 'Batman & Robin,' you could do worse."

If you don't believe me, read the great graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns.\" Also, George Clooney was the worst of the three actors to play Batman and Chris O'Donnell is way too big and old to be Robin.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I see reviews for the movie 'Batman and Robin', people always seem to say that it is an awful movie and one of the worst films ever made. I have seen it, and to be honest, I really like it. It is campy and a little stupid, but it really doesn't deserve to be given the same title given to other horrible movies like 'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie' or 'Jaws: The Revenge'.\n\nI'm not saying that people should stop hating on this movie (because I can see what people have against it) but I do think that people need to calm down about it. There are far worse superhero movies out there like 'Superman IV' and 'Catwoman'.\n\nOnto the film itself, like I said, I can see what people have against it: \"The acting is awful, the story is campy and the movie overall isn't well directed\".\n\nI don't think the acting is that bad. There are a few characters who are terrible (like Batgirl, who was meant to be British but it is obvious that the actress is American), but some characters do pretty good performances. George Clooney does a good job as Batman, Michael Gough does a great job as Alfred, Uma Thurman is a convincing Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pretty funny Mr Freeze (although I do agree that most of his ice puns are painful). The rest of the characters are pretty mediocre, but not terrible.\n\nThe story is no Oscar-winning masterpiece, but it is still a good story that flows well.\n\nThe (very) basic plot synopsis is that Batman and Robin are trying to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City and taking over the world. (Of course!)\n\nThat may sound like a boring and clich\u00e9d story, but it is actually quite good. The sub-plots fit into the story perfectly, especially one about Alfred dying of MacGregor's Syndrome.\n\nOverall, I feel that Batman and Robin is one of the most over-hated movies of all time and should really be given a chance. Like I said, it isn't perfect, but it really isn't as awful as everybody says. If you watch the movie with the knowledge that is a campy flick, you'll have a good time, just don't listen to the people who say that it is a horrible abomination to cinema, because it really isn't.\n\n7/10\n\nP.S. - If you want to know what I think of Bane, I think he is closer to the comics than Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' because the inclusion of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength."

One of my personal highlights was when they have ice skates ready in their shoes and when Robin falls into Nickelodeon slime.\n\nOverall silly film with no substance, too many things introduced at once, not even screen time for each character so their arcs progress slowly.

Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true, but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.\n\nSeeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see \"Batman & Robin.\" But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure, his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact, cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.\n\nGeorge Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately, he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable, he still said them with a straight face, as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but, even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea, the character should be played with some darkness.\n\nStill, there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough, who plays Alfred the butler, and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel, who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred, his friend and mentor, is dying, and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.\n\nThe plot is completely preposterous, but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive, the action scenes are well done, and the Batmobile, as always, is cool. The lead actresses, Elle MacPherson, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman, as the evil Poison Ivy, possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me, since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.\n\nIf I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies, I'd pick this one. Still, it's light entertainment, and worth a look."

But this has some \"so bad it's good\" qualities whereas Forever was just a total misfire. Schwarzenegger hams it up with glee. His entire dialogue seems to be a never ending series of cold puns. Uma Thurman takes her part a little more seriously, which is pathetic when you think about it. Chris O'Donnell is childlike and irritating. George Clooney is vacant and seems mentally checked-out of the role. This one pretty much killed the careers of Alicia Silverstone and Joel Schumacher, as well as badly wounding the Batman franchise. Like I said, it's crap. But, thanks in large part to Schwarzenegger's ridiculous portrayal of Mr. Freeze, it does have some comedic value for me."

Freeze wants to ice the city up and he gets some help along the way in the form of Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman). The acting was not terrible, but in some ways it could've been better. The score was not as strong as the first couple films. The script was alright, but the plot line was the best about the film. I also like the costumes that were used in the film. They were very unique. Die-hard fans of Batman will be disappointed at this movie. But, I liked it a little. I rate this movie a 7/10."

I'm not comparing this to Shawshank or A Clockwork Orange, but none the less this is an incredible piece of film.\n\nThis may be one of Schwarzenegger's most dynamic roles(excluding Kindergarten Cop). You can see some emotion in his character, instead of the normal robotic monster killing tank he always is, and the puns were incredible...INCREDIBLE. Schwarzenegger single handedly made this one of the best bad movies I have seen in ages.\n\nUma was great as Ivy, I often found myself wondering how Robin could resist her for so long. Her accent may have been a little over the top, but it matched the movie and made it even better. However I feel that they could have put a little more work into her sidekick Bane, who I feel was put in the movie just to use a beauty and the beast reference.\n\nThe writing was decent, I burst out laughing every time a character blurted out another ridiculous pun. Quotes such as \"Ice to meet you,\" \"Adam and Evil,\" and \"Let's kick some ice!\" made me laugh well after the credits rolled.\n\nWhen batman uses his grappling hook to climb the building I almost thought they gave him the ability to fly, and at that point in the movie I wouldn't have put it past Schumacher to do so. I think the only thing that could have made this movie any more absurd and entertaining would be to cast Robin Williams as Alfred and give him a ten minute monologue.\n\nThere were a few problems though. This was by no means Clooney's finest hour, and although she fit the movie perfectly, Uma Thurman has definitely acted better. As I said, this movie is NOT, I repeat NOT a thinker. If you are looking for a movie in which you can delve into the deepest recesses of your mind go watch Requiem for a Dream, but if you want a solid movie where you can sit back and relax, Batman and Robin is for you."

Uma Thurman overacted extremely as Poison Ivy. George Clooney was an equally bad Batman. People will complain that Bane is not simply supposed to be a mindless henchman, but I didn't think too much of it, despite the fact that I agree. I liked a couple things about the movie, though. Robin's costume was great, more closely resembling the modern Nightwing than Robin ever has. And the bit part for John Glover (Riddler from Batman TAS, Lionel Luthor from Smallville) was enjoyable."

I kinda liked Arnold as Freeze. However, the character isn't so much a sympathetic villain driven to his crimes, as just schizophrenic. Uma Thurmann comes closest to capturing the feel of her comic book equivalent, but Alicia Silverstone is just wasted (unless you like looking at her in a rubber, nipple-delineated suit).

I begged my father to take me to see the movie, and with him being a big Batman fan as well, almost instantly agreed.\n\nLets be honest; The acting in Batman & Robin is horrible. Arnold is horrible as Mr. Freeze and Clooney wouldn't even make my list for a possible Batman, let alone star in this one. I HATE Alicia Silverstone, I think she is ghastly, just dreadful. I do admit to liking Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and the whiny bitch that is Chris O'Donnell. He really is a decent Robin, I give him credit for that.\n\nThe writing is a joke in itself. All the ice puns, Bane as a complete and utter fool, \"rubber lips\", the fact that B&R have Ice Skates in there suits, everything is just horrible. The Alfred story would have been actually pretty decent if they weren't so damn campy through the whole movie.\n\nAnd even after I said all of this: I still love Batman & Robin. Yes, I just admitted to loving this awful creation, why? Because its fun to watch. Because I don't take it seriously. Because it brings happy thoughts from my childhood, Idk, I just love the movie. Its bad, awful maybe. But still, I like it.\n\nSo Batman & Robin I give a 4/10 because it gives me a sense of joy watching Arnold scream \"YOUR NOT SENDING ME TO THE COOLER\" ha-ha."

In fact, although it's not my favorite in the series (my vote goes to Batman Returns), I still found this refreshing in its cartoon-ish innocence. After all, it is based on a cartoon, so what is so unforgivable about making it light-hearted just once. Does everything have to be dark and brooding? I hope not. Well, unfortunately, people like the darkness more than the light. Just look at the reviews here, for an example of that.\n\nI just went along for the ride on this, enjoying the outlandish characters and corny-but-humorous lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Both were a lot of fun to watch. Batman, meanwhile, has been played by some many actors I don't care anymore who has the role.....its' nothing to get serious about, anyway.\n\nWhoever seems to play him does a decent job. This Batman version seems a lot more softer character, higher-principled and compassionate....sort of the real-life wacko (George Clooney) who views himself as such as a knight in shining armor for the typical Hollywood Left Wing crowd. But....we'll forgive him, for he not knows what he says.\n\nI appreciated the added humor in this film, the fact there almost no profanity, unlike the other versions; the wild special effects, ogling Uma Thurman, who looked fantastic; great color and surround sound; interesting sets and a nice message at the end.\n\nThe negatives were: a little too much action which can make you dizzy trying to follow; a somewhat-annoying Robin (Chris O'Donnell); Alicia Silverstone's role as Batgirl adding nothing to the film; and a little too many sexual innuendos to counteract the absence of profanity, I suppose.\n\nOverall, a fun movie not to be taken seriously: simply a cartoon come to life, which is what some people think it should have been in the first place."

In recent years, the film has been hammered by critics writing retrospectives and compiling lists of the worst movies ever made. I saw the film on its theatrical release and found it to be gaudy and meretricious. But going by a recent spate of superhero films with inconsistent quality of CGI yet well received by fawning critics, I find myself coming to the defence of 'Batman & Robin' because its stunts and staged set pieces were genuinely impressive and arresting. The main problem is the running time - it is about twenty minutes too long, especially for characters that don't have much depth. George Clooney, with his reputation for well-timed joke delivery, was in a role that didn't allow him to dominate the screen. Chris O'Donnell brought verve, and Uma Thurman stole the show with her voluptuous, sly menace. Arnold Schwarzenegger played a character seemingly written for his angular delivery with dialogue packed full of dry puns on the words ice and cold; he imposed himself satisfactorily. Stylistically, it is kitsch and fantastical, harking back to the mid-60s Batman TV series that was a frenzy of colour and bizarre stage sets. If one is prepared to enter the spirit of British stage pantomime bonhomie, perhaps this is not the worst couple of hours to spend."

Sure not a good movie but not quite bad. Nevertheless, this is a money-driven sequel that Hollywood is more than capable of giving us. The three Batman's combined would have made a solid trilogy but this Batman has sort of stained the Batman name.\n\nThe first time I saw this movie, I thought it was pretty good. My taste has matured and I can see whats wrong with it. It is simply an overdone movie. It overuses special effects to the point where they take over the story. The action sequences are not expertly done and it shows.\n\nBatman and Robin is an overproduced movie but its real problem lies in the script. This script gives us some really stupid dialogue. But it also tries to build a complex character out of the villain, Mr. Freeze. However, it doesnt work in the movie. This is because Arnold Schwarzenegger has limited range as an actor. He wouldn't be able to portray a complex character.\n\nThe rest of the cast is disappointing. George Clooney is easily the worst Batman. Chris O'Donnell is flat as Robin. Alicia Silverstone is irritating as Batgirl. There really is no need for Elle Machpherson here, except to admire her beauty. Uma Thurman is the only one to do a credible job. She is effective in an over the top performance as Poison Ivy.\n\nThe best thing I can say anout Batman and Robin is that its not really boring. If it was well made it might have been an entertaining action film. But its so screwed up that its no better than mediocre."

The opening sequence began promisingly, as Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) tries to steal a diamond, but Batman and Robin (Clooney and O'Donnell) interfere with his plans.\n\nHowever, the movie goes downhill as soon as the scene shifts to South America. The introduction of Poison Ivy (Thurman) and Bane (Swenson) was poorly executed to say the least. (In fact, Bane seems to have been raised by monkeys or something. His communication is limited almost entirely to grunts or growls.) Having said that, Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Mr. Freeze is sacrilegious. He is now a man armed with a big gun, constantly speaking a never-ending river of puns involving ice or cold. And Clooney's Batman is TERRIBLE! For example, he tells Robin that Alfred is dying. And when the camera cuts to him, he has a ridiculous grin on his face!\n\nHowever, there are two bright spots, as far as acting is concerned. The first is Michael Gough as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's ever faithful butler. As with every movie, he really makes the character his own. It was tragic to see him in such a disaster, but he tried his best. Second, I was quite surprised at Alicia Silverstone's acting. Sure, her character was completely ineffective and unnecessary, but she seemed to be the only one who CARED that the movie was a disaster. Ineffective as her character was, she still did a decent job. But not even their Heraclean efforts prevented the movie from being a disaster.\n\nAs to the plot itself, it is very poorly written. It has all the elements of a good superhero movie... NOT! The childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin, and Poison Ivy is so terribly executed, you begin to wish Ivy'd just kiss them both and finish the movie.\n\nIn short, if anything happens to prevent you from seeing the movie; if your television breaks right before you press \"Play\"; heck, if you're run over on your way to the video store, you have been saved by a miracle! The movie is awful, to only scratch the surface."

        "review_detailed_main": "If Batman Forever was like a bad parody, Batman & Robin is a parody from hell. It seems as if they intentionally threw all credibility into the wind and TRIED to drive down the franchise. The plot is the weakest so far, and the villains leave much to be desired. The main character castings are again a case of highly reputable names, but with performances that are subpar compared to their usual level - and Clooney simply isn't Batman material in my books, and especially not with this \"performance\". As the only positive note of sorts I have to say I feel kinda sorry for Michael Gough, as he is the only one putting in a respectable performance with nothing bad to say about it.\n\nWhat is also painstakingly evident is the horrid extras. The acting is just so bad and over the top that it rivals the worst B-class movies I've seen, and this apparently being an attempt at comedy/parody is simply no excuse for it. The guards, the crowd noises, the telescope event hostess... it's painful.\n\nHow Schumacher managed to go so low with his Batman interpretations is a real mystery to me. I'm glad I never had to pay to watch this (aside from TV permit). But even the time spent watching this (and spent making this comment) is more than this sad husk of a movie deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "With \"Batman Forever\" previously standing as the worst addition to the Batman saga in cinema history, its unlikely anyone would blame Tim Burton for completely dropping out of this production due to the massacre that his formerly praised contributions have endured. With Joel Schumacher in full control all hope of a long awaited respectable installment is lost in one swift, ridiculed and utterly appalling excuse for a Batman movie.\n\nDisappointment is present within every aspect of the films shameful creation, as the narrative surpasses the foolishness of the previous two productions, as it is evident that Schumacher had learned nothing from the disturbing lack of seriousness in \"Batman Forever\". In this installment Batman and Robin face a trio of adversaries, as with Mr Freeze hellbent on putting Gotham City on ice in attempt to cure his wife, Poison Ivy intervenes with her own agendas with the assistance of a reckless super solder otherwise known as Bane. The plot is severely flawed, as the idea of a temperature restricted super villain attempting to transform Gotham into a work of the arctic is simply ludicrous. What is even more frustrating is the lack of development or reasonable origins for the three villains, as they are all unsubstantial and quite frankly inexcusable. Furthermore the absurd style in which the plot is delivered for the matter results in viewers caring little for the damned city of Gotham regardless of how far Mr Freeze progresses with his villainous plans. Besides the main plot, aspects of the sub-plot bring forward several undeveloped issues to the viewer all of which lack consistency in terms of the focus upon them, as all of these disappointing factors result in a plot unworthy of any recognition due to its disregard for seriousness and inability to fully develop characters and minor aspects of the plot.\n\nVisuals remain a key issue from the previous installment, as Joel Schumacher's personal touch to various elements of the films visuals in particular only serve to worsen the production further. With the artificially luminous colour pallet still in use it tends to negatively coincide with the poorly designed and endless ice based props all courtesy of Mr Freeze's reign of ludicrous terror. The most stupid of all however is the inclusion of not only Bat bums, but nipples, skates, surfing and a bank card designed specifically for the Caped Crusader, as these pointless props add to the ridiculous style and the excessive number of goofs.\n\nStanding as the 3rd Batman in just 4 films the lack of consistency in the casting of Batman evidently leads to the shambles of a performance that George Clooney forces upon a now disappointed fan base. Clooney simple exceeds the disappointment of any past cast caped crusader, as he obtains no heroic qualities leading to an unauthentic performance due to his lack of belonging in the production. With Chris O'Donnell's unfortunate return as Robin, the reckless, young and inferior sidekick has become an even more unlikable character as his arrogance allows him to be utterly disliked and irritable throughout. Furthermore the on screen chemistry between the two is abysmal at best. The pair simply squabble or fill the air with ludicrous solutions and shameful one liners that are undesired to say the least. The epitome of casting however is evidently seen in the reckless decision to include Batgirl, as this ridiculed hero sums up everything that is wrong with Batman and Robin. Alicia Silverstone portrays an arrogant and spoilt teenage girl who's arrival as Batgirl is not only unwelcoming, but disturbingly spontaneous.\n\nUnsurprisingly many of the casting choices in terms of the villains are severely flawed, yet a successfully comical performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze stands as the only pleasing performance. His performance is surprisingly enjoyable thanks to his trademark and significantly strong Austrian accent dominating lines from the literally puns personified iceman. Where there's room for one pun Schwarzenegger gives you two and regardless of how inappropriate they may seem you can't help but laugh and at least enjoy one aspect of this painfully awful production. Unfortunately in terms of the casting and presentation of the remaining 2 villains nothing could be more insulting to the films comic book origins. With a ridiculous costume design, Uma Thurman's performance is simply diabolical. With a tendency to irritably and spontaneously narrate in a form of poetic verse, her actions in the film are simply repetitive and unbearable which evidently accounts for the film's equally poor narrative. Considering his origins are that of a super soldier high expectations were certainly set for Bane who originally stood as a diverse villain, however such a poor representation of such a superior character disgraces the honoured work of Bob Kane. Bane is reduced to a giant, grumbling, slow and motionless character, a representation completely opposite to his first appearance in a Batman comic in 1993. If Bane is unable to break the Bat he can certainly contribute in breaking this formerly admired franchise.\n\nIt is evidently clear that since Schumacher's hijack of the Batman franchise upon his arrival on the scene of Batman Forever has ensured its utter deterioration. Surpassing the disappointment of previous installments, this horrific and disgraceful production is undeserving of any major credibility and is unlikely to be forgotten in the painfully reminiscent years to come."

Everything is wrong, bad or worse.\n\nThe story, just kidding ya, there is no story. The plot, or bad excuse for one, is this: Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy teams up in order to shape Gotham after their vision. That doesn't make sense since Freeze want's to freeze down the city while Ivy want's it to be full of wild plants. Yes, the artic is well known for it's exotic plants. All acting is beyond horrible. Uma Thurmans Ivy is high on her own supply. Arnold is so wrong as Mr. Freeze. If you wan't to see a good Mr. Freeze go watch the Batman: The Animated Series episode Heart of Ice instead. The only reason he was cast was because Joel thought that Mr. Freeze should be like carved out from a glacier. That's the most corny thing I've ever heard. Batgirl and Robin are just pure crap and not done probably. This movie is a disgrace to Bob Kane, Frank Miller, Burton, The animated Series and everyone who ever loved Batman.

Meanwhile Dr. Jason Woodrue uses the powerful Venom concoction to transform a skinny psycho killer into muscle bounded Bane. Botanist Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) who is a radical plant protector objects to Venom's use. Woodrue tries to kill her but she turns into Poison Ivy instead. As Poison Ivy, her pheromones can affect men and kill with a kiss. Then Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough)'s niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) comes to town and eventually takes her place as Batgirl.\n\nJoel Schumacher took two tries, but he finally finishes off the original Batman franchise started by Tim Burton. He took the already silly 'Batman Forever' and increases the cartoon nature of his Batman movies. He set out to make a cartoon, and that what he got. The silly campy nature is fine for the first 30 minutes. It's stupidity has a crazy charm to it. Even Robin yelling \"COWABUNGA!\" was stupid enough to be funny. But it really wears out. The last half of the movie is pure torture.\n\nSchwarzenegger is playing the cartoon villain to its limits. I could never complain about his work. He does what he's told to do. Bane is completely voiceless and has about as much charisma. Poison Ivy seems to be an inferior villain. It's obvious that Batman and Robin just needs a face mask with breathing filters against her.

It's currently #68 in the Bottom 100, it has a score of 3,5 and for many this is the movie that killed comic book movies for a while (along with STEEL starring Shaquille O'Neal that came out in the same period). After I saw a while ago I could understand why everyone hates this movie and many of the rumours are right, but strangely enough, despite being a horrible movie it managed to earn about the cost... making it one of the highest grossing movies of the year. Unfortunately the Batman franchise was killed and it was only revived in 2005 with BATMAN BEGINS with Christian Bale.\n\nWhen the movie begins, it can be seen clearly why this movie bombed. It looks more cartoony and brightly colored compared to 1989's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS. It looked like the director only saw the old and campy 1960s TV show and put it in a modern contest. And I can only imagine audiences in theaters enraged with the sight of a beloved franchise dumbed down in a cartoonish version. And at times there are even the sound effects from the old TV show.\n\nThe acting is atrocious by everyone. George Clooney, despite being a good actor, is too good looking and charming for the role of the Dark Knight. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy overacted terribly through most of the movie, despite being also very seductive. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze comes off as the most laughable member of the cast, giving terrible ice-related puns every few seconds. But the worst performers in the cast are Chris O'Donnell as Robin and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. O'Donnell is whiny to the point of annoying and is so grating on the nerves, while Silverstone is very bland and emotionless throughout the movie (and it's no wonder that this movie killed both their careers).\n\nIf Joel Schumacher wanted to make a good movie he should have learned lots of things from 1989's BATMAN. It should have been darker, with only one good villain instead of three lousy ones and with more effective acting. Instead it looks like it was filmed in a carnival house, with lots of colourful sets and funfair-like objects (especially in Mr. Freeze's HQ).\n\nOverall, a truly wretched and dull movie. It manages to earn a 3, but only because of the sets and also because if given a better director and a better script, it could have been better."

He was no hack so he should had been good choice to take over the Batman films from Tim Burton.\n\nHowever, Batman Forever was disappointing, saddled with a weak script and the competing egos of various actors.\n\nBatman & Robin was poor from the word go. To call the script bad is actually an insult to bad screenwriters.\n\nSchumacher seems to have forgotten what a big franchise the Batman films were and what a big turnaround Warner Brothers did to get away from the campy 1960s TV series. He wanted to return to the days of the TV show.\n\nVal Kilmer departed the cape after just one film. He certainly dodged a bullet. George Clooney took over the cape, he probably was cheaper at the time and being in a cape meant that his double could do most of the work while he still filmed his TV series ER.\n\nNobody acquitted themselves well here because they are saddled with a poor script and bad direction. Chris O Donnell is just petulant. Uma Thurman who came into this film with an Oscar nomination from Pulp Fiction is campier than Liberace.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger who displayed a talent for light comedy in Twins is again out of place here as Mr Freeze. His jokes feel cold and predictable.\n\nThe film is a turkey of the highest proportions and is unwatchable."

The acting is absolutely hilarious and every bit as campy as the rest of the film.The magnificent actors all give hilarious over the top performances as very eccentric and flamboyant characters that are every bit as corny and fun as The Evil Dead.The action screams out it's homage to the random gadgets and MacGyver like use of surroundings in the 1970's TV series.The script is purposely terrible you can tell as Schumacher picked out every one liner possible and made a script out of them.I honestly can't believe people took this seriously and to heart i think it's better than both of Burton's films which were also cheesy and over the top but with a far too serious tone but because Tim Burton's name was there no one will consider it bad.Burton is extremely overrated because we all know it was Jack Nicholson who carried the 1989 film.\n\nOverall it's funny, it doesn't take itself seriously at all yet stubborn people without a sense of humour label it as an \"atrocity\" I've actually read that somewhere...sad.Giving this a bad review because it was cheesy is like giving a bad review to Evil Dead, Freddy vs Jason, or Mars Attacks!.Overall a perfect Batman parody and a good homage to the awesomely cheesy 70's show all that was missing was a little POW! SOCK! WHAP!"

The demise of Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze is beyond bad. First of all, they were terrible villains. Arnold's performance is over the top and it hurts. Uma Thurman's performance is quite good and she's very sexy. Our heroes are just okay. Chris O'Donnell looked very uncomfortable as Robin but did what he could. Mr. Clooney seemed to enjoy the character because that way he could exploit his sex symbol image.\n\nOn the positive aspect, Alicia Silversonte is absolutely gorgeous. She's a delight to watch.

I have since seen quite a few comic-book movies (X-Men 1+2, Spider-Man 1+2, V-Vendetta, Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Hulk, Sin City) and I guess I don't feel too ancient anymore because these all range from good to excellent films!\n\nSo what's the 11th worst movie ever made?"

It was replaced by Ernest Goes to Gotham City!!! The plot is moronic, the one-liners must have been written by a 5-year old, and the action makes The Three Stooges look like Barishnikov. The acting is also beneath contempt, who in their right minds can ever believe again that Alicia Silverstone can act??? (Ok, did anyone actually believe it in the first place?) Right from the outset, the director does not pull any punches. He firmly establishes that this movie will be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, that it will be the Mel Brooks of superhero movies. From the ridiculous stunts, poor camera work, terrible CGI, there is nothing good about this film! Even the Batmobile looked like a Tonka toy! It now has a disco ball for an engine!?!! And what got into Robin? He wants his own signal like the Bat signal??? HAHAHAHAHAHA! Who is ever going to say, \"Commissioner, the Robin signal!\" HAHAHAHA! Robin is such an incredible wimp, such a baby, I wish Mr. Freeze had frozen him permanently. And taken BatGirl with him! What a travesty. What was Clooney thinking? He must have known the movie was terrible... And the incredible groaners, one after the other, these lame puns throughout the movie, all of them were incredibly obvious with absolutely not a shred of wit. It was simply sad that a director could actually release a movie this poor. And what idiot green lighted 110 million for this tripe?????

And the entire scene racing down some giant statue's hand in the middle of the city, about 100 stories up??? What was all of that about? Or the whole surfing down from outer space? What the f....??? And did the Freezemobile not look like a big hair dryer? There was NOTHING at all good with this movie!!! NOTHING! It stunk! It's a dog! It's pure and unadulterated CRAP!

        "review_detailed_main": "Uggh, this film has never gotten any better since I've watched it.\n\nMatter of fact, it's gotten worse over time (re-edit, 2015): The major problem here is with tone - it's not simply that the movie is campy. The 1966 Batman movie, from the TV show (I forget if it was before or during the show) was a massive success, in that it kept its comedic tone fresh and sharp and light. Here, the film is campy and ridiculous, but it's still technically set in the universe set up by Tim Burton (he is not producer here, like on Forever, but there's still Michael Gough and Pat Hingle in key roles), and it just wobbles from place to place.\n\nAt times the film goes for the utterly inane and over-the-top, which could be fun with Schwarzenegger there (and hey, I can laugh my head at the ice puns - laugh AT, of course, not with). But aside from Uma Thurman, who seems to be in on the joke, or really 'get' how to do a campy villainess ala Julie Newmar, it's sad-mopey-serious one moment (Alfred's sick plot line) and then... there's Bane, who makes cartoon henchmen look bad. It's at times more cartoonish than the Batman animated series ever was - which had a more subdued take on Mr. Freeze, if you can believe that - and when it tries anything close to dramatic or dark, it falls flat on its face.\n\nIt is a disgrace for both Joel Schumacher and the cast. The story (which makes Ski Patrol look like Citizen Kane) has Batman and Robin now joined by Batgirl (how many do we need) to stop Poison Ivy nd her new co-hort, Mr. Freeze. Oh, and Coolio shows up at one point as part of a gang! Because... reasons.\n\nIf people tell you they liked this film, well, more power to you. And if you're looking to get wasted and not give a s*** when it comes to a movie, have at it. The script is so terrible one will find the Nolan over-exposition of the Dark Knight and Rises to be like Hamlet. BEWARE."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs\n\nGotham City is in the grip of a new enemy: Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). A former noble scientist thrown into despair when his wife starts dying, an accident in a science lab has turned him into a super-villain intent on turning the city into a massive block of ice. But he's about to find a new ally in the shape of the beautiful, sexy Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), also a former scientist killed after discovering a secret she wasn't supposed to. Her plan is simply to callously illiminate man-kind so her floral kindred can make the world theirs. Of course, the caped crusader and his side-kick must stop this, but as Robin struggles to mature to find the strength and restraint to be Batman's ally, can the two work together in time to make an effective partnership against evil...\n\nEasily the most critically mauled movie of the Batman franchise, the final part in the old series is again directed by hack director Joel Schumacher and continues with the awful Forever's lighter, more family-friendly turn. And it's dogged by the same problems the last film had: the story is lame, the dialogue clunky and poorly delivered and basically having the feel of a loud, garish, overly-colourful nightmare production. But, in my personal opinion, I would say it is just a step away from being the worst movie of the franchise.\n\nThere is at least an engaging sub-plot to this one concerning Alfred, his deterioration into illness and the arrival of his grand-daughter (Alicia Silverstone), unlike the last one which was just a non-stop assault of loud, colourful, vacuous nothingness.\n\nIt's also helped (very mildly!) by some fairly good performances. George Clooney has a genuine presence as Batman (I'd pick him over Kilmer, that's for sure!) and Thurman has a genuinely sexy presence to her as Poison Ivy (appearing in some figure hugging sexy suits and pouts that certainly raise the temperature a degree for a PG movie!) as well as giving a good turn as a nasty, well-spoken bitch with a genuine contempt for humanity. As for Schwarzenegger, he looks cool (forgive the pun!) in his Mr Freeze costume, but he's really at his bad-acting worst in terms of his performance here. Chris O'Donnell is as hopeless as ever and thankfully faded into oblivion shortly after this movie was made. The same fate, it would appear though, fell to Silverstone, who didn't deserve it as much, but her role as Bat-Girl here is pretty pointless and a rather tacky marketing gimmick aimed at keeping the franchise going longer (which failed.)\n\nOverall, I can kind of see where the detractors are coming from with all their criticisms of the movie. Like Schumacher's previous effort, it's a loud, colourful, pretty vacuous experience, just not as much so as the last one. You could at least see it on a 'so-bad-it's-good' value just to try and make your own mind up. **"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good: This film came at the wrong time chronologically among Batman's film and television appearances. Whether it was too late or too early is unclear, but there was obviously once a place for the camp and self-reflexivity of this film in the canon. Maybe there will be a time for it again, but for all its failings and criticisms, this film is a gem in Batman's big screen run between 1989 to 1997. The best film franchises establish longevity in embracing formula, and entrenching established conventions. This film was too heavy handed in these practices, and was too ambitious in its referrals back to earlier iterations of the franchise, leading to the criticisms of its over the top camp. But, camp and color are a part of Batman's history so the nod to the comics, the 1960's tv show and film earn a fitting place in Batman media after nearly six decades of crime-fighting adventures.\n\nThe Bad: This film was as close to cast for star power rather than for real acting chops as could be. George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, and Alicia Silverstone were all rising stars at casting and release. As it turned out, however, their combined star power wasn't enough to launch this film to an acceptable box office to produce another follow up film. The poor performances are the largest contributor to the film's failure to deliver on camp as an acceptable franchise convention moving forward. Worst of the casting choices for this film was replacing Val Kilmer with George Clooney as Batman. Keaton and Kilmer both played men conflicted about the nature of being both Bat and Bruce. Clooney only plays a man nostalgic about his youth as he's confronted with Alfred's mortality in between flashes of his rehashed character from E.R.\n\nThe Ugly: When the camp of the caped crusader was popular on the small screen, 20th Century Fox brought Batman to the big screen as a ready example for the franchise fit of Batman. Individual films can fail, but the staying power of a true franchise hero can shine through time as is the case with the Dark Knight as he's made appearances in print and on screen across eight decades. Batman: The Movie (Leslie H. Martinson, 1966) began the big screen obsession with Batman and his ongoing quest to right wrongs, and constant entanglements with the likes of The Joker, The Penguin, and Catwoman. Because Uma Thurman's performance in Batman & Robin is so obviously an homage to Merriweather, Newmar, and Kitt opposite Adam West's Batman, it cannot be understated that this early film established Batman as a box office juggernaut even if it underperformed at the box office, and the television series waned in popularity through the second and third season effectively shelving a sequel."

Don't get me started on the nipples on the chest. WHAT THE FREAKIN HECK IS THAT!!!

        "review_detailed_main": "While he was making this movie, director Joel Schumacher was quoted saying many things that struck fear into the hearts of bat-fans everywhere. Things like \"when I think of Batman, I think extreme sports,\" and \"wait till you see the costumes -- they're practically wearing nothing,\" and \"I want to return to the roots of the old Batman television series.\" Was Schumacher seriously planning to take Tim Burton's brilliantly dark vision and reduce it to leather-clad S&M freaks spouting campy one-liners while snowboarding? Sadly, he was.\n\nWhere to start? There's so much to dislike. George Clooney plays Batman as, well, George Clooney, the same character he's played in every appearance to date. His Batman smirks when he should scowl, his Bruce is insufferably arrogant. Chris O'Donnell (Robin) takes his cue from George and swaggers and preens, going from whiny brat (\"I want my OWN car!\") to juvenile-in-heat in every scene. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze physically resembles and has all the acting talent of a 1983 Buick, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl plays up her valley-girl schtick to a ridiculous end -- ending up seeming even more clueless than she did in Clueless. The only characters who retain any sort of dignity are Alfred, as always, and Uma Thurman's Mae West-ish Poison Ivy.\n\nThe script, for I assume there was one at least at some point, is composed of the worst indulgences of Uber-Hack Akiva Goldsman . Goldsman doesn't write dialog, he writes one-liners, as if his goal would be to have every line in the film appear on a bumper-sticker or a T-shirt. For example, in the comic books and animated series, Mr. Freeze is a tragic character prone to long monologues about his internal suffering (Patrick Stewart was considered at one point for the role, and would have been perfect). But Goldsman diminishes him to a role far more cartoony than the cartoon, spouting insufferable dialog like \"Everybahdy Freeze!\" and \"All right, be cool.\" Schwarzenneger, apparently, doesn't get the joke, because every single line is delivered straight, ignoring any pretense of comic delivery, bringing to mind a high-school play more than a major motion picture. The first two films, and the third to a limited degree, explored Batman's psyche and that of his villains, asked questions about why and how the characters are how they are. This script has all the depth and emotional subtext of an acne medication commercial.\n\nEven the props in the movie are all wrong. The Batmobile now has no canopy, leaving the driver's head exposed (given the speed of the thing is supposedly 100 mph, it's not terribly practical). It also looks in most scenes as if it's going about 20 mph, tops; I kept expecting a bicyclist to pass it and spoil the illusion. In the end of the film, Batman is dressed in a silver suit -- perfect camouflage for a nocturnal creature, eh? And, perhaps most unforgivably, Batgirl has no hood -- just an aesthetically pleasing domino mask which leaves her hair loose, all the better for the enterprising villain to grab and rip out.\n\nAll of which could have been at least mitigated by some decent directing -- but alas, that was not to be. Schumacher includes several shots from Batman Forever in this film, perhaps to tie the two together, perhaps because he's out of ideas: Batman and Robin running towards the camera, the chest emblem, vinyl-clad buttocks, and codpiece of each character as they suit up, and the entire opening sequence are all cribbed from Batman Forever. He also bravely defies gravity and logic, letting our heroes fall all the way from the upper atmosphere and freezing Robin in sub-zero temperatures -- all without suffering so much as a scratch.\n\nNone of it makes any sense, none of it is particularly watchable -- it's not even good for camp value. The only salvation of the franchise will be to put it back in the hands of a competent director and a scriptwriter who is capable of writing an actual script. Until then, Bat-fans are better off watching the animated series on the WB to see what can be done with the character, in the hands of talented artists."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman and Robin is a fascinating disaster. From certain perspectives, the movie is well made. It has an all-star cast, the production design is ambitious, the effects are multifaceted, and the main song is extravagant. However, despite (or perhaps due to) these investments, Batman and Robin is a catastrophic failure. First, the writing is completely foolish. The plot is idiotic, the characters are flat, and the dialogue is transparent. Next, the acting is dreadful. Arnold is Arnold, Clooney is disinterested, and Silverstone is out of her element. Thurmon overacts, but that's comparatively refreshing.\n\nTechnically, the sound effects are silly, the editing is sloppy, and the special effects are distractingly unconvincing. Meanwhile, although the production design is thorough in concept, it looks cheap in practice. The elaborate decor is woefully tacky. Similarly, the imagery is often ugly and incoherent despite its dramatic lighting and decent camerawork. Ultimately, this comes down to Joel Schumacher's direction because Batman and Robin is significantly worse than the sum of its parts. The tone is erratic, the style is half-baked, and the overall mission is misguided. In the end, Batman and Robin is only for those who enjoy car wrecks.\n\nWriting: 2/10 Direction: 1/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Acting: 2/10 Editing: 3/10 Sound: 3/10 Score/Soundtrack: 5/10 Production Design: 3/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 3/10\n\nOverall Score: 3.4/10."

Batman returns contains a lot of noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design. This time Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) try to keep their relationship together even as they must stop Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) who seek to freeze Gotham City and repopulate it with mutant plants. At the same time, Batman and Robin must find a way to cure their sick butler Alfred (Michael Gough) while they also get some help from new heroine Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). Meanwhile, Ivy has caused a rift between the partnership of the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder. Batman and Robin! Heroes. Villains. Triple Threat. Strength Now. Courage Always. Family, Above All.\n\nAn uneven follow-up to blockbuster fantasy epic that renewed Hollywood's faith in media blitzing. In this sequel, Batman goes into action, containing a lot of surprises, thrills, chills and dazzling settings. The third sequel to Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster makes its predecessors show up models of subtlety and coherence. In theory the movie marks a new lease of life for the caped crusader with new faces, new director, in practice everything feels some stale, artificial and self-conscious. George Clooney is a more sensual Bruce Wayne than Michael Keaton, but if anything his remodelled body-tight Batsuit proven even more of a straitjacket. Naturally, the villians still steal the show in the personas of maniacal Arnold Swarzenegger and the sartorially spendid Uma Thurman. Rounding out this charismatic cast is the amorous interest Elle Macpherson who's eager to find the man inside the Bat and get married.\n\nThis is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie, but it has nothing to do with the first two entries. Full of action , it's complemented by colorful images, thriller and so-so scenes with overwhelming fights and traditional FX along with a lot of computer generator special effects. The dark story is made unbelievable and the script has more color and visual effects to it than former Batman films. The picture relies on terrific flying sequences, struggles, black humor, swift pursuits, and the overacting from the two main baddies: Arnold Swarzenegger and Uma Thurman. More of the same from director Joel Schumacher with Batman more of a supporting role overshadowed by provocative villains.\n\nThe motion picture was unevenly directed by Joel Schumacher and failing at the boxoffice and bears remarkable resemblance in its style to previous \u00a8Batman Forever\u00a8. As Schumacher manages to submit his worst insticts, but it doesn't really help. Made in usual syle by Joel Schumacher whose credits include some of the most egregious Hollywood codswallop of the last thirty years, such as : \u00a8Dying young\u00a8, \u00a8A time to kill\u00a8 , \u00a8Flatners\u00a8, \u00a8Batman and Robin\u00a8, \u00a8Batman Forever\u00a8 and he also made a successful musical \u00a8Phantom of Opera\u00a8, the thriller \u00a8Veronica Guerin\u00a8 and Trespass (2011) was final film made by Joel Schumacher before his death in 2020.\n\nThe Batman saga created by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher is made up of : the first one: \u00a8Batman\u00a8 (1989) by Tim Burton with Michael Keaton , Michael Gough, Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Tracey Walter, Pat Ingle , Jack Palance. Followed by \u00a8Batman Returns\u00a8 (1992) by Tim Burton with Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, a grandiose sequel with three splendid roles: the Bat, the Cat and the Penguin. \u00a8Batman Forever\u00a8 (1995) by Joel Schumacher with George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Drew Barrymore , Deby Mazar , Don Dragon Wilson. Followed by \u00a8Batman and Robin\u00a8 (1997) by Joel Schumacher with Val Kilmer, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone , Michael Gough , Arnie, Pat Ingle , John Glover, among others ."

        "review_detailed_main": "The final film in the initial 1990s run of \"Batman\" Hollywood adaptations, \"Batman and Robin\" is just an awful movie by all accounts. I gave \"Batman Forever\" some slack because that movie honestly does have its moments. Val Kilmer is both a much better Batman and a much better Bruce Wayne than George Clooney, and Jim Carrey's Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face are much better villains than what we see here. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze just spouts too many puns, almost every word that comes out of his mouth is somehow connected to \"ice\" or \"cold\" or \"freezing.\" Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy isn't that bad, she's probably the best character in this movie. Bane (Robert Swenson) is just a straight-up butchering of the character from the comics and acts as more a beefy hulking sidekick for Poison Ivy to bark orders to. Chris O'Donnell's Robin has somehow lost all of his charisma and charm from the previous movie, acting like a spoiled brat, even when he's not under Poison Ivy's spell. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl is awful as well, she's bland and just delivers a terrible performance. Nothing good can be written about the story or the acting in this movie, save for a half-decent performance by Uma Thurman, as stated earlier.\n\nHonestly the only things that elevate this movie to get as high as 3 stars in my book are the production values and the costume and set design. And by that metric, you would just as well watch any other of the \"Batman\" movies. Heck, nearly any other action movie period. This movie sucks."

To further complicate matters another super villain comes upon the scene by the name of \"Poison Ivy\" (Uma Thurman) who not only has a powerful henchman named \"Bane\" (Jeep Swenson) to do her bidding but also has an insane plan to eliminate all diesel fuels which threaten the fauna of the world-at the expense of all human life on the planet. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie started off okay but as it progressed-and more subplots were introduced-it went downhill fast. For example, although I happen to like Alicia Silverstone, I honestly didn't care for the addition of her character (\"Batgirl\") at all. With everything else going on I thought it was simply too much. In short, while I don't consider this movie to be terribly bad necessarily, I must admit that it was rather disappointing overall and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average."

Because Poison Ivy's garden needs tending and Robin was about to hit the honey pot. Christ, just...Christ. What was this Schumacher? What. Was. This? Batman and Robin must save Gotham city from an \"endless winter\" as Mr Freeze teams up with Poison Ivy to destroy the city. That's it. It really is that simple. It's clear that Schumacher was attempting to replicate the campiness of 60's Batman. But aside from the splendid set pieces and \"what killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!\", everything failed. Ev-er-y-thing. Clooney, with his luscious \"batnips\", has all the personality of melting snow. I could feel his boredom, and that's with his \"batcard\" because you should \"never leave the cave without it\". O'Donnell ended his career by wearing rubber lips and joyfully stating \"chicks did the car!\". Silverstone also ended her career by just being shoe-horned in. Schwarzenegger somehow turned in one of the more tolerable performances. Thurman...well, I don't even know? One moment she's all \"we must save the plants!\" to \"my mutant plants are the deadliest\". The script was just diabolical. There's no other way to describe it. \"This is why Superman works alone.\", \"The Ice Man cometh!\", \"Great stems, though...\", \"Buds, too.\" and of course \"How about slippery when wet?\". Poison Ivy is hornier than a flipping rabbit. Mr Freeze can't say a sentence without mentioning ice. Robin just wants a car. Barbara apparently puts on a convincing disguise, \"It's me, Barbara! I found the batcave.\". This isn't even the tip of the iceberg. Oh no no no! Their boots conveniently turn into ice skates. Batgirl has \"batboobs\". The most basic of jumps are clearly wired stunts.

I saw it around the same time I saw 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,' which was truly beyond bad. I thought it was TERRIBLE.\n\nI just recently went back to this movie because it was on Starz. I must say, I was entirely entertained. I also respect the movie more than I did.\n\nI discovered new entertainment value when I recognized that the movie isn't even TRYING to be a good Batman film. It knows itself to be ridiculous, and it doesn't take itself seriously because of it. In fact, the movie doesn't take anything seriously. It's silly from beginning to end.\n\nIt achieves exactly what it is trying to be, and for that it deserves credit. It's camptacular, with over-the-top special effects, costumes, and one-liners. Many people derided it for being a special-effects driven film, but I disagree. I think the special effects exist to drive the stupidity. The wilder the effects, the more unrealistic it all is, and the funnier it gets. It is a stupidity driven film.\n\nThis is what the 60's TV show would have been with a massive budget. It understands that everything about Batman is silly, and it takes that to its logical end. The bad guys are even more out there than the first Batman movies, the dialogue wouldn't seem out of place at a beach party, and the Batmobile is just, well, you'll have to see.\n\nThe cinematography is great, the set design is beautifully over the top, and the colors could keep a person high on meth occupied. The script is terrible, and there really isn't any plot, but that doesn't matter. It's not even part of the equation.\n\nThey took everything campy about action movies and distilled it down to this. And for that, it deserves credit. Once I let go of what I expected from a Batman movie, and stopped judging it based on what I thought should be in the film, and just let me experience it as any other film I may come across, I really rather fell for it.\n\nI enjoyed this movie more than 'Batman Begins,' which is certainly a far better film by most measures, but is missing that je'ne se quas of a film that perfectly embodies what it's trying to be. 'Batman Begins' was patently absurd (a secret society of ninjas??), but it took itself gravely seriously. This movie is even more absurd, and it absolutely revels in it. I think that makes it the better film.\n\nBut that's just my opinion."

Otherwise, everything else was great. George Clooney played a different kind of Bruce Wayne/Batman..a more lighthearted, smiling guy. Honestly, I found he was good...then again George Clooney could just stand there and he'd make me swoon. Chris O'Donnell was also great in his reprise as Robin, and I enjoyed him a lot. I loved the brotherly dynamic between the two characters that was shown in this film.\n\nAlicia Sylverstone was also good as batgirl, although if she wasn't there, it wouldn't have made a difference. But she was, so basing my review off of that, she did her role well.\n\nThe two villains were very entertaining. I loved Uma Thurman's poison ivy, and I found her to be highly entertaining. Her powder became annoying after a little bit, though. Also, Arnold's Freeze was very good. Yes, he had some corny lines, and yes he was a little creepy looking, but overall he was very convincing as a villain and actually provided a challenge for the protagonists (unlike the other bad guys we've seen). His backstory, about trying to find the cure for his ailing wife, was very emotional as well.\n\nOverall, as I've said for the past movies, do NOT listen to the critiques and base your interest off of that. Rather, check it out for yourself and give your OWN opinion on it. You might be surprised and find yourself enjoying it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Man, y'all probably saw Flash Gordon and thought, \"Well, that was stupid.\" I can't even give Batman and Robin my usual good bad movie rating of 5 because it was actually trying to be campy. And it succeeds! The one-liners are ridiculous, the villains are cartoonish, and its all on a big budget. And sometimes, the silly tropes of comic books need to be laughed at.\n\nWhile Chris O'Donnell was annoying, most other complaints can be answered with \"Its not supposed to be taken seriously!\" Ice puns? Hockey fights? Bat credit cards? They all contribute to the light-hearted mood. If anything, it could have had more jokes.\n\nWhy do people complain about this over Batman Forever? Batman Forever was both too serious and too campy. Even if Batman and Robin went in a direction most fans didn't like, at least it was interesting and consistent. If anything ruined the franchise, it was Forever.\n\nI thought the movie was fun. As manufactured bad, you can riff on it with friends with little dead air. Lighten up a little, bros. We don't need dark and gritty every comic book flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think few movies are as disappointing as 'Batman & Robin' when it comes to making a sequel of a great franchise. The failures begin with the casting: George Clooney as Batman? Straight out of ER where he played a middle-aged grumpy doctor not anywhere near as prominent a character as most of the other actors there.\n\nArnold as a villain doesn't work either. The one time it did work was in 'T1' where his stiff acting with few lines did work out. He is too restrained and precise to make a believable villain that is supposedly mildly insane and plotting evil agendas. Uma Thurman is a bit redeeming as Poison Ivy, but that's about it. The Bane character is \"straight out of a made-for-kids comic stupid\" so to say. Overall the performances are quite forgettable.\n\nAnd the plot is... yeah what is it about? I think I spent most of the movie trying to figure that out. Yes, I was 13 at the time it premiered but it didn't make sense then and it doesn't today. The title gives some premise: Robin gets to take some place as protagonist, but in honesty his character was also prominient in 'Batman Forever'.\n\nSeeing Nolan's films makes a stark contrast to the 90's Batman movies, 'Batman & Robin' may be a reference but let us stop at that. 2/10."

Sure, it is cheesy and camp as hell, but it has a better storyline than \"...Forever\" and two better-looking villains in Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze.\n\nGeorge Clooney replaced Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin. O'Donnell toned down the attitude in this one, so I did not find him as irritating as he was in \"...Forever\". I'll say it, Clooney makes a decent Batman and Bruce Wayne here. Better than Kilmer's indifferent performance in \"...Forever.\" Michael Gough reprises his role as Alfred and there are a few emotional scenes that are surprisingly well-done. Uma Thurman and Arnie are very enjoyable to watch.\n\n\"Batman and Robin\" is not a terrible movie, and does not deserve its reputation. It is by no means a good movie either, but I would rank it above \"...Forever\" any day of the week."

        "review_title": "Spectacularly misguided, yet sort of quite entertaining at the same time",
        "review_detailed_main": "This third follow-up to Tim Burton's ground-breaking Batman (1989) is a film whose reputation certainly goes before it. It was so misguided and terribly received that it effectively put paid to that particular franchise before it was later reinvented by Christopher Nolan with a decidedly more chin-strokingly serious approach. It feels like the film-makers thought that by this instalment the audience must want more of everything. To this end there are three super-villains plus a new heroine to add to the two title characters. And on that note, the fact that this movie is called Batman & Robin would imply that either both title characters are at the top of their game as a super-effective crime fighting duo or perhaps have interesting psychological demons to wrestle with resulting in some intense drama. In practise, they spend the whole movie squabbling over which one of them is fancied more by Poison Ivy. In this regard, Robin is a particularly irritating and whining half-wit. The script is terrible and that contributes a lot to this character being so moronic but Chris O'Donnell plays him like he is an odious and tiresome teenager, so much so that I have to give George Clooney's Batman some credit in not resorting to giving his cohort a clip around the ear for persistently and endlessly rabbiting on about how Uma Thurman's character liked him better than Batman. In truth, the dialogue in general is very, very bad in this movie throughout and no one really comes out of it unscathed. For instance the entire dialogue spouted by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Mr Freeze appeared to consist solely of ice-based puns. By the end of the film I was on the edge of my seat, excited by the hope that Arnie could potentially get to the end of the film without uttering a single sensible line of dialogue at any point. Needless to say, he maintained the ice-based idiocy right up until the finale which was a pretty impressive achievement in some respects.\n\nTonally, Batman & Robin is a slight return to the comic approach of the 1966 original Batman: The Movie. Only, that 60's original is funny as hell and acted to perfection by its great cast, Batman & Robin, on the other hand, is a pretty witless movie on the whole. But it, nevertheless, does have a much more lightly comic approach, especially when compared to the dark Burton entries in the series. It has a reasonably good cast that are utilised quite poorly, none of whom totally escape the shrapnel of this exploding turd. Clooney's actually not too bad to be fair but he's in the wrong place at the wrong time, while Thurman's Poison Ivy is probably the best character in the film, although she too is made to look foolish at times with some of the lines she has to utter. Alicia Silverstone is pretty lifeless as Batgirl it has to be said although she's still better value than O'Donnell as the terminally annoying Robin. As I mentioned before, Schwarzenegger gets plus points from me for his relentless ice-based stupidity, which was entertainingly moronic and would no doubt make for the basis of a good drinking game. The look of Gotham City itself seems to have changed too from Burton's gloomy Gothic architecture, we now have streets and buildings made up of giant statues, I've no idea why but it does seem to be kind of a dumb idea. Despite, or perhaps because of all of the shortfalls in this one, I still found it kind of entertaining. There are so many characters and so much going on that it maintained its interest factor. It was essentially dumb fun for most of the time, and comic book in the stupidest sense. The main drawback, however, was that it clocked in at two hours which really was pushing its luck though; something this ridiculous should be ninety minutes and no more. All-in-all, I found this to be a pretty obviously bad movie that nevertheless entertained me for the most part. It's too interestingly poor to truly qualify as a terrible movie and because you know that there's always a good chance that Arnie could pitch up any second with yet another ice-based pun you realise that it can't be all bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman & Robin\" (1997) is the fourth part of the modern Batman series, directed again by popcorn movie director Joel Schumacher (\"Batman Forever\", 1995) and starring George Clooney as Batman after Val Kilmer has left the series after only one Batman movie. Like his predecessor, \"Batman & Robin\" is leaving the original roots of Tim Burton's darker two Batman movies and moves more towards mainstream action and a more family-friendly fantasy adventure.\n\nClooney's Bruce Wayne is much straighter and funnier than the psychologically disturbed and existentialist Batman performances by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. Although it reveals a bit more about Wayne's relationship to his butler and father-like friend Alfred, Clooney lacks the psychological depths of the first three movies.\n\nChris O'Donnell returns for a second time as his sidekick Robin, appearing more like a wild rock'n'roll youngster than like a despaired artist's orphan out for bloody revenge. like in \"Batman Forever\". Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl takes the same way, being only a female Robin version, adding more sex to the superhero's league.\n\nThis time, it's the villain's turn to show more psychological characters and sad background stories. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the real main actor of the movie, plays Mr. Freeze, a mentally and physically damaged scientist who became a super villain only to rescue the life of his beloved coma-state wife. He's no real bad guy, and it's his final turn to save the life of Gotham City.\n\nUma Thurman's Poison Ivy has not only the function of a men-killing black widow but also the motivation of protecting the ecological balance of nature on earth. Her appearances are sometimes really stunning, taking fashion, music and dances of the tiki, lounge and exotica movement of the fifties and adding a campy b-movie touch to this mainstream movie.\n\nYou see, compared to the first three Batman movies, the bad guys are rather good guys and have more interesting biographies like the good guys, this time with less personal problems and more shiny, muscle-dominated rubber suits on their hard-bodies. This could have been much more interesting, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movies.\n\nAnother low point is the rather uninteresting image of the city of Gotham City - being a perfect background in the first three movies with elements of hammer horror castles, dark nightmare cities, a German expressionist-like modern \"Metropolis\" and an adaption of the disturbing paintings of Hieronimus Bosch or Enrico de Chirico, Schumachers Gotham City is just a dead background painting without the breeding darkness of the Burton movies.\n\nThe sound track is well done, ripping of Danny Elfman's well-known leitmotif and adding some very fine alternative, pop and techno tunes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Underworld, R. Kelly and Moloko to the story.\n\nAll in all it's the most mainstream-like and the most disappointing part of the new Batman movie series, but still much fun to watch (especially the buddy movie-like conversations between Batman and Robin). I hope they will return to Burton's original style in the forthcoming fifth part."

I mean, they all pretty much stick to the formula established in the original - Batman is an angst ridden superhero who has to confront a series of bizarre super-villains and there's a (usually blonde) love interest, all of which takes place in the weirdest metropolis this side of Toontown, Gotham City. What made the first \"Batman\" notable was simply the sheer originality of it, that plus we got to see Jack Nicholson having the time of his life playing the cackling Joker. The next three, as far as I'm concerned, all rank about the same. Of course, not being a comic book aficionado, I never took the whole Batman concept seriously in the first place, so the fact that these movies tend to be goofy and a bit ridiculous isn't necessarily a bad thing. As for the acting, well, everyone seems to be beating up on the stars, most notably Clooney, however, I happen to agree with Ebert that it's really not that important who plays 'Batman', the main thing is simply to find someone to fill the suit. I guess the bottom line for me is that I just don't watch a movie like this expecting anything serious regarding the plot, the acting, the writing or the characters. I mean, this isn't 'Saving Private Ryan'; it's much more in the same category as 'Charlie's Angels'. As such, Batman 4 is basically OK entertainment and nothing more.\n\n5/10"

This one on the other hand, is lot's of fun and visually entertaining. Uma's great and gorgeous as usual. I personally like Joel Shumacher's work on this and many other movies including Phantom!

        "review_detailed_main": "So this is Batman. No. This is NOT Batman. This is some horribly twisted, disgusting display that CALLS itself Batman. I don't even know where to begin, I'm so overwhelmed by its degree of suckitude. But I have to try.\n\nOK, let's start with the man himself, Batman. Played by George Clooney. Clooney smirks his way through this movie without ever once appearing even slightly dark, menacing, tortured or cool. He seems to be simply playing the Bruce Wayne front that the REAL Batman puts up for the public. Only all the time. At Wayne Manor. In the Batcave. While fighting criminals. All the time. Clooney can't help but deliver a suave, smug rich guy who thinks he's better than everyone. Instead of the brooding, guilt-ridden defender of Gotham, we get a pretty-boy in a cape, spouting ridiculous dialog at every turn. If this whole movie wasn't such a dismal mess, other characters would simply laugh their asses off at Batman, as he's about as dangerous and edgy as a door to door salesman. However, this movie's one success is that it's consistently bad at every possible level. So Clooney's laughable Batman fits right in.\n\nSuch a depiction of Batman would be totally incompatible with the Gotham City that fans of the comics would be familiar with. Batman's world is supposed to be dark, gritty and disturbing. It's a decayed city where many of the villains are mentally twisted and even heroes like Batman are tinged with darkness. It's a style that's much like a '30s film noir, where a noble hero must struggle against an environment that is wholly oppressive. This style is completely abandoned by Schumacher who decided to replace it with glitz, glam and extreme air boarding. This first began in Batman Forever where Dick Grayson fights a gang covered in neon paint and use glow sticks for weapons. In Batman and Robin, this is taken to the next level where the entire city is painted in a homo-rainbow of disco colors. Despite their gaudy outfits, when villains like Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy show up, they fit right in with their surroundings. Batman cartoonishly taking out a \"Batman credit card\" and pheromone dust visibly flowing into his nose go along with Schumacher's \"Sunset Strip\" version of Gotham City. In this lack of seriousness, and its constant underestimation of the audience, it's like the '60s Batman show, only with a budget.\n\nWhen it comes to the character of Mr. Freeze, any fan of the comic book or the animated series would know that he is a calculating, emotionless villain whose technology makes up for his lack of physical power. Brains over brawn, right? Well, who better to play this character than muscle-bound action star Arnold Schwarzenegger? That makes as much sense as casting Stallone as The Scarecrow. So Mr. Freeze stomps around in his mechasuit of doom and spewing the most painful ice-related puns, his villainy culminating to the grand \"let's freeze the city\" plan, we realize the movie has obviously been balanced with a second villain. Well, what would thrive in this winter wonderland? Plants? Of course. So Poison Ivy jumps on board this Bob Kane wreck-fest. While Uma Thurman is obviously a pretty woman, she doesn't have the correct full bodied voluptuous look that the seductress Poison Ivy should. Instead we get a lanky broad in a rejected Green Giant outfit throwing around her lust dust and getting Batman and Robin in ridiculous Springer-esquire feuds. But while Poison Ivy and her two-ton ice tank of a partner get everything about their characters wrong, it's hardly as blasphemous as a certain henchman...\n\nWhich brings us to Bane. A minor character in Batman and Robin. Which, I suppose, is a good thing. I shudder to think what they would have done with him were he to be the main villain. With that said, reducing a character such as Bane to the position which he filled in this movie is more than just stupid; it's downright insulting to those of us who know what Bane is really like - a malevolent, calculating and cunning villain who's downright scary for reasons beyond his physical stature and strength. Remember, Bane beat Batman. Granted, he held many advantages over his foe, running him ragged before finally taking him down in an exhausted state. But lots of villains have held advantages over Batman only to get their butts royally kicked. Bane could have killed Batman, but chose instead to \"break\" him - making one hell of a statement and in the process opening the door for Jean-Paul Valley to take over the mantle of the Bat for awhile. Until Batman had to take him down as well.\n\nAnyway, in this train wreck of a movie, Bane is simply a stomping, drooling drone that serves as an interior decorator for Poison Ivy. The only words he says are monosyllabic repetitions of what other characters have said in his presence. He starts out as a pathetic, skinny and sniveling worm who is completely transformed by Venom. Which is not how Venom is supposed to work at all. The point is that Bane is formidable and dangerous to begin with; the Venom only made him more so. Batman and Robin never take him seriously because they don't have to. Like everyone else in Batman and Robin. Bane sucks. Hard.\n\nRobin isn't nearly as flawed as Batman in this movie. But considering the script, there's really no way anything in this \"film\" can be good.\n\nBatgirl? Pointless and barely used anyway. Alicia Silverstone? Makes about as much sense as everything else, I guess. She's Alfred's niece? Whatever.\n\nIn order to really fathom just how awful this movie really is, all you have to do is ask yourself this question: Is there any way that it could have been any worse?\n\nOnce you realize that you can't come up with a single thing, you will understand."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am at a loss to explain \"Batman & Robin.\"\n\nAkiva Goldsman, the script writer, wrote the absolutely breath-taking script to \"A Beautiful Mind,\" yet this script seems like it was written by homosexual drunk monkeys.\n\nJoel Schumacher directed such gems as \"Phantom of the Opera,\" \"A Time to Kill,\" and my personal favorite \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" Why, oh why, could he not achieve the same level of artistic perfection with a Batman movie?\n\nGeorge Clooney was splendid in \"ER\" and \"From Dusk to Dawn.\"\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is an action movie icon.\n\nUma Thurman is a superb actress (i.e. \"Kill Bill\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\")\n\nAlicia Silverstone is... well, OK, she's nice to look at and mildly entertaining in \"Clueless.\"\n\nMy point is this: When you bring all these sparkling talents together in one room, how in the world could they come up with such a turd as this movie????? It's wretched! It's abominable! Kids don't even like this movie! I lined up for this movie when it came out. I was excited. I was a poor kid in college who barely had two nickels to rub together. I hadn't had the money or means to see the first three Batman flicks in the cinema, but this time somehow I'd scrounged up the change to go see it. Meanwhile, I sat there, in the darkness of the theater, watching the debacle on the screen in front of me, thinking \"this is what I waited for?\"\n\nI mentioned \"St. Elmo's Fire\" before. Joel Schumacher did such a wonderful job with that movie. Ultimately, he created a movie that has aged very well and remains a classic. It had great characters that you actually liked, and it stuck to themes that are real. It never got corny or hackneyed. THIS is how Batman should've been treated...not set in Georgetown, necessarily, but at least given SOME sort of credit.\n\nDon't watch \"Batman & Robin.\" Life is too short to waste it on this. If you are a true die-hard fan of Batman, I caution you especially not to watch this. There are some instances of bad films that only true fans will love, but this is not the case. If you love Batman, you may be moved to violence by this travesty.\n\nI wish I could give this film a 0, but IMDb won't let me. I think I will go out and buy a VHS copy of the movie and let a horse take a big old dump on it, just to make up for this inequity."

Arnold Schwarzenegger is in beautiful makeup, but his character could have been better characterized in addition to the Mr. Freeze look. There are a lot of ridiculous and unnecessary accents. The problem Schumacher wanted to make a dark movie but Warner didn't want it to be, and wanted exactly to sell toys. Some moments were extremely clich\u00e9 and jokes, to the point of ridiculing the production itself.\n\nFilm viewed on the 1st to the 2nd of August 2021."

Yeah we'll release a film that will probably destroy a decent franchise.\n\nI was worried after 'Batman Forever' though, mainly because I could see 'campy' within it, and the way they introduced Robin was lame! What saved that film to a passable mark was Jim Carrey! Nobody saved this film- actually the whole cast was extremely bad (with the exception of Michael Gough)! But whose fault is that? George Clooney should never have been cast, Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were just annoying and Arnie just didn't have the same villain power as Jack Nicholson!\n\nJoel Schumacher is a good director as we've seen with The Lost Boys, Falling Down, A Time to Kill and 8MM. He's very capable of directing quality, so why did he choose not to take his two 'Batman' outings seriously? Probably because he's never read the comic-or he liked the 60s television series too much! Burton had the right idea, but the big guys in Hollywood said it was too 'dark'! Then along comes Schumacher, who goes totally nuts in his second outing and the fourth installment!\n\nThe sets were bad and over-the-top, the script was full of cheesy, campy dialogue that works for five year-olds, the action scenes were totally ridiculous and patronising! Seriously, when is Hollywood going to realise that just because your making a film about a comic book, that it doesn't entitle them to target an audience below the age of five. If Schumacher had taken 'Batman and Robin' more seriously, instead of being patronising and cheesy, then this film may have been worth the millions they spent. I don't get it, lets give these directors a huge budget so they can make a film with no merit and that is dumbed-down for the audience so that it's nice all round! Gimme a break- at least Spawn had cool effects. Batman and Robin had nothing except 'camp'!\n\nI really loathe this film, it's an insult to give a director a huge budget and produce and distribute this pile of garbage! The casting, the script, sets and especially the direction was shocking! Schwarzenegger is nothing like Mr Freeze from the comics, and with lines like \"Ice to meet you!\" makes me wonder how people originally complained about the first Batman! In fact, Batman and Robin is so badly overdone and stupid that it may have destroyed the franchise Burton established! This pitiful film gets a 1/2 out of *****!"

For those who don't follow the comic, Bane is the only character ever to end Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, though it was temporary. Bane was smart enough to know how to weaken the Dark Knight; strong enough to break him in half. Clooney could be an excellent Batman (he's definately better than Kilmer), but he gets lost in the muddled script. Bane deserves better treatment, and he should not have been included in this flick. The Batgirl character isn't really necessary, as well as the back story of Alfred's illness. The campiness, which was almost perfectly used in \"Batman Forever\", was way over the top. Even Jim Carrey would have a tough time being as cheesy as these guys. I think the two things that killed this movie were the script and the acting. While \"Forever\" was cartoonish, the actors who did the hamming (Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones) were good enough to know where to draw the line. Thurman, while a great actress in my eyes, just goes over the top while Arnold...well, Arnold never could act, and he puts any arguements against that case to rest with his performance here. I still even have reservations about Chris O'Donnell, but he's at least servicable as Robin, were Alicia Silverstone's turn as Batgirl has all of the noteworthy theatrics as \"Clueless\". I guess that's about how you can sum up this saga of Gotham's Greatest: clueless. There is one completely redeeming quality, though, one that makes it worth it even as bad as the movie is. It's still a Batman move."

Slowly.\n\n#1 wost movie ever Made in 1997 and had a full superstar cast and a well established director. But what happened? Well I think Joel Schumacher was probably tripping on shrooms and decided to totally rape the theme and feel of the saga. And the actors we're acting as if they knew that Schumacher had probably just ended all of their careers. But it was too late, they had signed contracts so you gotta do your job to the end or be sued to the stone age. Thankfully this didn't end any careers, but if one had to go it should have been Schumachers.\n\nBut if that is not enough. This piece of sh*t actually had a \"prequel\" in -95 \"Batman Forever\" which also had the same director, a huge budget and superstar actors.\n\nAnd from that, they made what can only be called a \"warning shot\". Batman was fast on his way to the wrong direction. And still they let Joel Schumacher go on his merry way to perform a Coup de gras to Batmans temple, and make another one.\n\nThis is one for the history books my friends.

        "review_detailed_main": "Staunch fundamentalist fanboys have declared 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" to be a blasphemous blemish in the superhero's chronicling, but it's easily the most entertaining of the four Batman films that came out between 1989-97.\n\nLet's face it, all four of these flicks have the same cartoony tone. They were a couple rungs above the 60's TV series in campiness, but with better costumes and a super budget. And \"Batman & Robin\" was the most entertaining of the four. I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of the goofy/surreal style of these movies; I prefer Christopher's Nolan's raw realistic approach in the Dark Knight trilogy (\"realistic\" to a point, that is). It's just that \"Batman & Robin\" is the most entertaining of the earlier series. Which is why I never got the whole \"Tim Burton's Batman is a masterpiece\" mindset. Really? Not to me. It LOOKED great, but the story was tedious.\n\nAgain, all four of these films have the same general cartoony tone and there's simply no validity to the position that Burton's \"Batman\" or \"Batman Returns\" are more serious/realistic in approach compared to Joel Schumacher's \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin.\" I've seen 'em all back-to-back and they each have the same colorful we're-not-taking-this-too-serious style.\n\nFor anyone to enjoy these films you have to be willing to accept the comic booky world the filmmaker's have created. If you're willing to do that, these can be fun, half-serious Batman movies. You can't watch them expecting the tone of \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" or you'll be severely let down.\n\nWith this understanding, \"Batman & Robin\" is my favorite of the four. Here's why:\n\nIt has the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in George Clooney. Although Val Kilmer has the better Bruce Wayne demeanor (i.e. grimmer), Clooney just LOOKS like Wayne. In addition, he's charismatic and entertaining in the role from beginning to end.\n\nIt has the best sense of family between the inhabitants of Wayne Manor. The warmth and camaraderie of Bruce, Dick/Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Alfred and Barbara/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is a pleasure to behold.\n\nIt has Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Nuff said.\n\nIt has Uma Thurman shining in the role of Poison Ivy. I usually don't find tall, thin women appealing (I'm more attracted to females akin to Silverstone), but I have to admit that Uma completely owns the over-the-top role of Poison Ivy and is thoroughly alluring.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is great as Mr. Freeze. Yes, every time he merely opens his mouth you know it's Schwarzenegger, but he's amusing and he has a great look and costume.\n\nThe film has heart. Although Poison Ivy is truly ee-vil and gets her comeuppance, you can't help but sympathize with Freeze's love for his wife and desire to resurrect her. Batman is able to see under his icy veneer and see a warm heart that's willing to accept redemption and make restitution. Furthermore, as noted above, you really feel the love of Bruce and Alfred and the others at Wayne Manor.\n\nLastly, the film is full of vibrant colors and goofy over-the-top thrills. It's just a fun movie, if you're in the mood for a half-serious/half-campfest superhero flick.\n\nI also like that Smashing Pumpkins song that plays over the end credits.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B+"

It doesn't take itself seriously, and the actors seems to have a lot of fun while doing their overacting. It's pretty fun, and has great effects (for its time). The moronic use of a great character (Bain - just read Knightfall to see what I mean), and the decision to include Silverstone, are two sore points though. Anyway, if you don't care about continuity, and if you are willing to see the movie for what it is - a modern take of the 50:s-60:s version of Batman, then it's not that bad.\n\nI haven't seen Batman Begins yet, but I'm looking forward to it. After a series of over the top Batman movies, it's time to get down to earth. a grittier, more serious batman. I believe it's going to be great, probably the best of the Batman movies. But this movie isn't that horrible, just different.\n\nA nice rental. Best served with lots of beer and some popcorn."

Every time I hear a quote from this movie, I just feel like it's from an Alan Smithee film. The last weak part of this is when they get hit and do flips, you can tell they are on wires. Oh yeah, the Batmobile has never looked worse. The technical works in this were really good. That's the upside of this movie. Other than that this movie does ok. It's the campy feeling that makes this something to pass up. I am just so disappointed that it wasn't better.

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone knows this movie is terrible. The only consolation we can have watching this movie is making fun of it. It's so inane and silly that you must ask yourself \"what were they thinking?\"\n\nThat's what I did for my third viewing. It saves the pain of seeing Batman and Robin in public at a charity ball. Many fans must have hated that scene for it's a complete throwback to the 60's. Something no longer appropriate after being exposed to stories by Frank Miller or Tim Burton's darker version of Batman. Another annoyance is the architecture of Gotham. It doesn't make sense. We get tall buildings, extremely tall statues, bridges that lead nowhere. Watching it, somehow the movie loses all sorts of perspective. Imagine the chase scene where the Freezemobile, Batmobile, and Redbird were travelling on the arm of a really big statue. The Redbird is only about the size of the statue's fingertip. That would have to be one really big statue. The bridges' height also drives me crazy. This is not quite the same Gotham of Batman Forever (let alone Batman 1989).\n\nI don't ever remember Mr. Freeze requiring diamonds to power his suit or his freeze gun. Therefore, the writer only used diamonds simply because they look like ice. Elle McPherson's role as Julie Madison is wasted as she adds nothing to the story, just an obligatory love interest. There's one scene where after Batman being blown with pheromones by Poison Ivy, he says Ivy's name while on a romantic night with Elle. It goes like this:\n\nJulie: \"Ivy? Who's Ivy?\"\n\nBruce: \"I wish I knew.\"\n\nOoh. Try having that conversation with your girlfriend or wife!\n\nFinally, the network of satellites to be used for the Gotham observatory. You could actually just do with 1 or 2 and just electronically transmit images from space. And then share the view via a big TV. That would be less expensive. Half of this film's budget must have been spent acquiring the actors' services alone.\n\nOn the plus side, I liked the Batgirl/Poison Ivy fight scene. The only thing wrong with it is that Poison Ivy isn't much of a martial artist. Arnold was the only other good thing in the movie. He played Mr. Freeze well, just that his performance is marred by a horrible script.\n\nThe verdict: 2 of 5 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "After Batman Forever was a financial success it seemed only logical for Joel Schumacher to direct a sequel. Yeah why not? Sure Forever had a campy attitude and the visuals had more personality than some of the characters but it wasn't terrible. So we probably can't expect much going into this but it's got Mr. Freeze and he's a good villain. So are Poison Ivy and Bane they're all pretty good. Yeah this movie might actually be... oh dear Lord.\n\nAll right enough beating around the bush, Batman and Robin is a pitiful excuse of a superhero movie, even a movie in general. The characters are campy cardboard cut outs of their comic counterparts, the visuals are even more forced than the last movie to the point where they become ridiculous and the dialogue is about as cheesy as a Saturday morning cartoon PSA.\n\nWell the main plot is that Mr. Freeze('brilliantly' cast as Arnold Schwarzenegger) is trying to make a giant ice laser to hold Gotham ransom so he can get enough money to find the cure for his wife Nora whom he has kept in a cryogenic container. While this is going on, a scientist named Pamela Isley has discovered her associate has been using plants to experiment on a new drug called Venom which he uses to create Bane. The scientist kills her but the chemicals fuse into her body and she becomes Poison Ivy. She and Bane go to Gotham and eventually help Mr. Freeze with his plans to secretly work on her own schemes.\n\nOn top of that, Alfred's niece Barbara has come to Gotham and Alfred is sick with the same disease Freeze's wife has. Robin is feeling put down by Batman and wants to be more independent and Barbara soon dons the cape and cowl of Batgirl to help them take down Freeze and them.\n\nAnd this is the first problem the movie has. There's too much plot. How are we supposed to keep track and care about everything if there's too much going on in one movie? That's really the problem when more than two villains are in the mix. Batman Returns and Batman Forever had a similar problem but this one is much worse. Even the Alfred subplot which should be really emotional gets lost in the mix of all this mess they call the main story.\n\nOn top of that the characters in this movie are just wrong. Batman has little to no personality in the film, Robin acts like a brat, and Barbara does little to nothing to add any emotional value to the whole \"Alfred's dying\" thing. I have to give credit to Michael Gough and Pat Hingle as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon respectively. They've been doing this for four movies and at least know how their characters should work in the franchise.\n\nAnd the villains. What a joke. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is about as good a match as water to electricity. All he does is spout one- liners and puns relating to ice. In the comics and the animated series the interpretation of the character draws from, he's a sympathetic villain who wasn't above making a pun but didn't do it every five minutes he was on camera. Uma Thurman isn't terrible or bad looking but she wasn't a good fit for Poison Ivy. When I imagine Ivy I imagine a bombshell stereotypical model who uses her looks to get what she wants but is also competent and a deadly threat. Here she isn't that attractive to me and all her evil plan consists of in the long run is to kill everyone with a kiss. And don't even get me started on Bane. This is the guy who organized a mass breakout and broke the Batman's back? All he does in this movie is make guttural sounds and repeat whatever word was just said to him. He's pathetic and it makes you wonder why they even included him if they were gonna stray so far from what made his character so great in the comics.\n\nThe visuals are somewhat appealing but the bright neon blue, green and red are even more gaudy than the last movie and almost made me want to hurl.\n\nOverall this movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. But I'm giving it two stars out of ten because I watch it whenever it's on TV and always get some laughs out of it. I guess that could classify it as a guilty pleasure but honestly, as a Batman film it's horrible, as a film in general... what were they thinking?"

However, the latter proves to be worthy of an average score in this viewer's opinion. In this day and age, it is difficult to find critics who have room in their hearts for goofy movie fun, that is if the film has some form of redeeming factor.\n\nThere is no denying that Batman and Robin is technically one of the worst movies ever made. From it's ice/plant puns, innuendos, bat suit nipples and buttocks, constant grappling hook saves and George Clooney playing George Clooney dressed as Batman, it is something that feels like an attempted advertisement to sell action figures. The bright and colorful aspect of the film gives it that appearance. Though if people look at it through a more positive perspective, they'll find the film accomplished setting out what it wanted to be from the start. Now that is not to be confused as giving Joel Schumacher credit for putting together this film, turning it from Batman to Power Rangers.\n\nThe cast really can't be blamed entirely for the film's failing results. They were directed to acting the way they did after all and some of the performances were acceptable while others, one cannot say the same thing. Michael Keaton played the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the original 1989 film and Batman Returns decently until he was replaced by Val Kilmer for 1995's Batman Forever. Kilmer wasn't the most amazing Batman by any means, but he made an effort to as best he could since that film was about as campy as this one. As already mentioned, George Clooney was playing George Clooney through the whole film. Never once could an audience viewer who is a Batman fan could look at him and say \"This is the Batman of my imagination!\" Clooney goes around without showing even the slightest bit of emotion, the kind that the character of Bruce Wayne is supposed to be feeling constantly, especially when he is Batman. He spends most of the time looking after Robin making sure he doesn't get into trouble and while that's good, even then he does not demonstrate fear for his friend/brother.\n\nTo add on to that, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is the king of camp and ice jokes in the film. Mr. Freeze was never the Joker. He's not very complicated as a character to figure out. He was always a dark, vengeful and hateful man who wants nothing more than to revive his wife from her terminal disease at any cost. Not only does Arnold succeed at being himself as usual, but it's as if he intended to play a Joker/Two-Face knock off of Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones' performances. Additionally, Batgirl's presence in the film wasn't great either. Her character felt out of place from the start being introduced as the niece of Alfred, Wayne's butler. Her transformation into Batgilrl didn't feel legitimate as it did random and unconvincing.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris O'Donnell's performance was possibly the only performance in the film that felt legit. All throughout, Robin's motivations for doing the things that he does rebelling against Batman are believable. He clearly outshines Clooney's Batman whenever the duo are on screen together. In addition to Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, as campy as she was, did surprisingly well with her role. She was a perfect choice to portray the villain Poison Ivy in this viewer's opinion, even looking great for the part. It is unfortunate that her performance was hindered as a result of being casted for the wrong film. Had she starred in a Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan, she could have excelled. The actor who played Alfred (may he rest in peace) provided the film some heart to heart moments with George Clooney's Bruce Wayne, which were some of the film's best.\n\nIn conclusion, that is the cast. If we all can just take the film for what it is, as basically a cartoon in live-action, we can find it isn't as bad as the critics say it is. Check out the following youtube address for more insight on what makes the film great https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXHskZCqhiI.\n\nIt is clear that the film was not meant to be Christopher Nolan's the Dark Knight trilogy. Had Tim Burton, who directed the first two Batman films with Michael Keaton, directed this film, it may have turned out differently. For what it is, it is entertaining. It's one of those cases where it is so bad it's good or so good it's bad. The point being that the film doesn't fail at being the action comedy it is. While it may be a matter of persona opinion, the film contains great humor. Mr. Freeze provides humor related to ice. The character of Bane, while butchered as a villain character, gives a few laughs as Poison Ivy's oafish muscle incapable of speech. The action in the film serves as continuation for the film's camp factor, at the same time quite well done. Beneath the film's campiness is a good message about family and trusting one another, something not many would appreciate but deserves to be recognized.\n\nFinally, just because the critics say it's atrocious doesn't make it true. For Batman and Robin, this viewer does not agree that it is the worst thing to ever happen in film. Maybe for Batman but people tend to take movies way out of hand forgetting it's all fiction and not reality. Batman Forever felt like more of a fail than this film for the way it handled it's two villains who turned out obnoxious. The villains felt amusing for this film but people can always agree to disagree on anything. Credit where credit's due for the film creating inspiration to take the superhero movie genre to a whole better level that has continued to progress today."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tim Burton did an amazing job at turning the high-camp 60's TV series into a dark and more seriously tined film with \"Batman\". Here, after Tim's huge step forward, Joel decides to take one huge monumental leap backward into the high-camp and often hilarious 60's years. The result is a film that is amazingly bad, but so bad that it's absolutely hilarious and thus very entertaining. Don't watch \"Batman & Robin\" expecting something with substance. Thank the lord that Christopher Nolan has revolutionised the franchise again more recently! What makes this film so funny is the all-star cast. We've got George Clooney who is totally mis-cast as Batman, Uma Thurman playing an absolutely ridiculous role as a woman who kills people by snogging them and best of all... Arnold Schwarzenegger. Playing the camp Mr.Freeze with a performance even more frozen than that big freeze gun he's got. I don't know how these big names looked at that appalling script and said \"yep, that looks like something I'd do\" because the script is awful.\n\nWe've got a Mr.Freeze randomly appearing in a freeze suit and big freeze gun, but very little explanation is given to why he's so hot on the cold. He also spurts out an endless amount of cold puns \"chill out!\" and the likes, which are hilarious, especially the way Arnie delivers them in that monotone voice of his. Poisen Ivy is also randomly created by falling into some plant chemicals, as well as a completely useless villain called Bane (I hope Bane's not this much of a moron in The Dark Knight Rises which I've yet to see). Poisen Ivy's powers result to blowing some pink fog at men and being instantly seduced. Leading to an absolutely hilarious rivalry between Batman and Robin.\n\nRobin is such an idiot. Batman even points this out to him by saying \"she's trying to kill you Dick!\" But Robin is ashamed of being in Batman's shadow. Robin wants his own show, and thinks that Batman's jealous because Poisen Ivy fancies him and not Batman. Robin is also presented as a complete pervert. Constantly googling Batgirl and the other women in the film. The film is actually largely sexist, there's even a moment where rich old men are bidding for some young women. As well as a long take on Batgirl's arse (and on Batman's and Robin's) and her suit even has Madonna-sized boobs! Although that's nothing compared to the batsuit's nipples.\n\nThe directing is just as awful as everything else. Not only is there a villain overload, but there's a hero overload to. There's far too many close-ups and long-shots on the action that are cut so quickly it's impossible to know what's going on! All the sets look incredibly fake too, it looks more like a stage-production than a film with its vibrant colours and smoke-effects. Small children would be enthralled (I know I was). There's also a head ache inducing bombastic score being constantly played throughout the film. It's insane! When no music was playing it was some-what deafening! I remember loving \"Batman & Robin\" when I was about seven years old. So my sister and I decided to revisit it for laughs and we certainly got those. The highlight for me was probably Arnie being carried into Arkham Aslyum in a fridge by two guards who take him to a cell that has a \"cold beam\" right above his bed. It's made purely for laughs and isn't supposed to serious (I hope). Although it's over-long and sexist with far too many innuendo's I think small children would find its vibrant colours and sounds enchanting. Whereas the parents can just laugh at it. This is too camp for words."

        "review_detailed_main": "Thank you Michael J Nelson. While possibly an exaggeration, Batman and Robin was, by far, the worst big budget movie ever. Nothing can come close. Even Pauly Shore's worst movie couldn't top this turd of a film. There are many things we can blame for the supreme badness of Batman and Robin: Clooney, O'Donnell, Clooney, the script, Clooney, God, Clooney. But, in reality, Clooney wasn't that bad, (except for the head bob, nod, nod, head bob thing). And while the script was beyond abysmal, you can't really blame it. No, the man behind the mayhem is the big guy himself... Ahnold. I'm not gonna type his last name, cause I couldn't spell it if I tried. Arnold was bad. Worse than bad, worse than horrible. Think of the worst thing you can think of, then think of something 100 times worse. Arnold was worse than that. Now, it's true, it was the script that had all the horrible \"cold\" puns, but my pet lemur could deliver them better. Besides delivering bad puns, all Arnold really did was chew scenery. And, in the end, that's all he's really good at. For the rest of the movie, it was just a bunch of crotches. Crotches and laughably bad action scenes. And a horrible \"feel good\" ending. In all honesty, the only redeeming quality about this piece of filth was seeing Uma as a redhead in spandex. Mmm Mmm Good. But even she acted horribly. I saw this movie with a couple of friends. Not coincidentally, I'm not in touch with any of them anymore. This movie was so scarring, that seeing each other brought back the memories, and we couldn't take it. This is a warning to everyone, please please please, don't see this movie. Don't even think about it, it'll scan your brain and make your head explode. Instead, go play near some train tracks or watch a Coleman Francis movie; anything to save your soul from \"Batman and Robin\""

I could barely stand his \"Batman Forever\" and this film was even worse. The dialogue was tired, the action was completely unbelievable, the sets were more like a circus than Gotham interiors/exteriors, and Clooney couldn't play the tortured duality of Batman to save his life. As if that weren't bad enough, Bruce's flashbacks were merely trivial--a poor attempt to keep continuity within the series of movies. Someone's going to have to tell me how this one ended, because during the scene when both Batman and Robin are in Ivy's hideout and Robin is struggling to get out of the water, I had to turn it off. Why Schumacher decided it was a good idea to reverse the film in this shot is beyond me. Joel, don't insult my intelligence....."

The only things about this movie I liked was the Smashing Pumpkin's theme song and Mr.Freeze's costume.\n\nBatman was dull. Robin was an idiot. Everything about Batgirl was handled wrong (the 3 \"C's\": casting, costume, characterization). Why does Barbara Gordon (whoops, I forgot she's not Commisioner Gordon's daughter anymore...they couldn't even get THAT right) even BECOME Batgirl?!?!?! NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE MAKES SENSE!!!!! Mr.Freeze was corny. Poison Ivy was too ridicules. The only descent character in this film, Alfred, is misused as the \"I'm dying, please cure me\" character.\n\nThis very well might be the worst movie ever made.

Like the tv-series featuring Adam West, what makes it so fun is the fact that you never truly get if it is intentional comedy or not while you watch it. I mean, like I said you do get it if you have a functioning brain, but it's the kind of comedy that works because they don't throw a bunch of lame jokes at you (*coff-coff suicide squad coff coff*) but they keep it really subtle and you actually have to use your brain a little bit to really get all the absurd and nonsensical stuff that happens and laugh. I also loved the settings, the colour palette, the over-the-top villains and the pacing of the movie.\n\nSo if you don't have a sense of humour and like to watch hearthless, soul-less movies that feature a bunch of people talking in colourless settings and 3 minutes of actual superheroes doing stuff, go watch suicide squad, the amazing spiderman or batman v superman. If not, enjoy this masterpiece."

She makes this movie as enjoyable as it is, because the woman can vamp like no one since Mae West. She is tremendous fun to watch every second she's on the screen, and she captivates you even as you cringe at the horrid dialogue.\n\nThe story itself is padded and cliche-ridden--the motorcycle race sequence could be dispensed with without losing much, and the you-don't-trust-your-own-partner and dear-friend-is-dying-of-an-incurable-disease bits have been done before, and much better.

You can simply distinguish the awful to the miscast to the not awful but mediocre. In the awful there is Alicia Silverstone, in miscast there is George Clooney and Uma Thurman. Arnold Schwarzenegger manages to be both miscast and awful, though his dialogue is mostly to blame. Then Chris O'Donnell, Robin, is the only one who you could argue didn't suck. And his performance is undermined by bat nipples that make you laugh at nearly everything he does.\n\nThe dialogue attempts to be witty but it's simply cheesy.

Robin: \"So this is where you've been hanging out.\" As he and Siverstone hang off a bridge. Mr. Freeze: \"You're not sending me to the cooler.\" Mr. Freeze: \"What killed the dinosaurs?

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is historically dissed for being the worst in the Batman franchise, but I just so happen to remember it a different way! From the bight colors and complicated but visually appealing set designs, the flashy costumes and over-the-top characters and one liners galore; it's obvious what this movie was trying to be, A movie about a Superhero from a Comic Book. The writing was a little lack luster and I do feel Bane was misused, I enjoyed it for what it was. It still held a dark feeling from the previous Tim Burton Batman films but with a flashy neon overcoat that felt hyper, new and appealing. I would give this movie a 10/10 if they had driven it all of the way and cast Coolio as one of Mr. Freeze's henchmen instead of the Bike Racing Gambler that he is instead. Missed opportunities."

The plot was more captivating, characters were better developed, and the director was much more original.\n\nNow for the cast:\n\nGeorge Clooney: Worst Batman, they should have cast Arnold as Batman in this one, he would have pulled it off better, being a Kennedy has taught him something about being an aristocrat.\n\nChris O'Donnell: You know, I've always hated Robin, it could be played by a cool actor like Samuel L. Jackson, and I'd still hate him. They should kill him off in the next movie, worked in the comic books. BTW: Chris O'Donnell is horrible in the role.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger: I can see why Patrick Stewart turned down the role. Horribly written, annoying, and not a great villian. I like Arnold, but he sucked in this movie.\n\nUma Thurman: I sat through this movie watching her and pitying her. You could see her struggling with such poor direction and script. The only bright point in the movie.\n\nAlicia Silverstone: I've never liked her. She's like the supermodel actress. She looks good and crazy, but when she starts talking, she loses credibility. She should stick to Aerosmith videos.\n\nSo if you want your friends to hate you, your wife/husband to leave you, or to kill your neighbor's bushes, just play this movie for them. Trust me. I wish I could have given it a negative rating!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman & Robin, world famous franchise killer and the best example of why studios should not interfere with the movie making process.\n\nBatman Forever was a roaring success at the box office but this success was largely due to the reputation of the first two Burton films and zero to do with the actual quality of the movie.\n\nBatman & Robin was released to an audience now wise to what was going on and now the studios saw what the world thought of their family pandering and dumbed down plot.\n\nBatman & Robin was universally panned by just about everyone, including Director Joel Schumacher who walked out of the premier in embarrassment, but really....was it all that bad?\n\nThe answer is both yes and no but the negative vastly outweighs any positives the film has to offer.\n\nThe films script, if you can call it that is nothing more than a collection of one liners. In fact almost all of Arnie's dialogue as Mr Freeze is one liners and the jokey too and fro of Batman & Robin is cringeworthy. It's not even so bad it's good funny it's just bad, like a low budget under 5's kids TV program except this film cost a lot of money to make.\n\nThe inaccuracies to the source material really ticked off the comic book community. It's true that Burton didn't stick entirely to the source either but he captured a lot of what the comic was about. Schumacher doesn't have a clue and seems content with quick flashes of Batman's arse to carry the film and zero sense of character depth anywhere to be seen.\n\nAmazingly enough the film DOES in fact have some good points. The best of the bunch being the wonderful Michael Gough having probably the most screen time of all the Batman films. The sub-story of his illness and the scenes that tell this are actually very moving and it's great to see Michael have a chance to do something a bit more in depth. It must be said also that George Cloony is an almost perfect fit for the role of Bruce Wayne with his suave look and manner and his scenes with Gough really have a lot of warmth but he is severely let down with the film he is in.\n\nOther good points include some very nice sets, props and some great designs for the look of Gotham City, though these too are marred by garish lighting and wobbly fake looking ice.\n\nUma Thurman clearly is performing tongue in cheek and as such get's a way with it but even she cannot save the terrible surroundings she is in.\n\nSomewhere deep in Batman & Robin there was a good film that was wanting to get out and it could very well have been pulled off with the cast, but campy humour and cheap laughs which weren't even funny completely rob the film of anything it was trying to achieve in any of the more serious scenes and unfortunately that's all people remember.\n\nLet this film be remembered as a lesson to studios, don't interfere with the creative process of film making. Batman could have gone on for many films but you killed it stone dead with this one and it should never be repeated again."

We also have a pretty good cast, and most of the costumes are really well done (except for batnipples) and even the more wacky costume choices (Poison Ivy's wardrobe) were rather well done, since it reminded me of the comic book version. To sum it up, it's sort of like the Friday the 13th franchise, not much makes sense, some scenes are stupid, but it's fun to watch, and the effects are great."

Guys, let's face it: Batman is a guy who dresses in bat clothes and walks around with a high- tech car through the alleys to fighting crime. Now imagine a guy doing it in real life. It would certainly be as funny and ridiculous as George Cloney or Adam West walking the streets. Schumacher's Batman & Robin is a movie that embraces this cartoonism with fervor and without shame. That's why this movie deserves a glorious ten stars. The universe and superhero concept, including our beloved Batman, is often ridiculous and eccentric - things that we, comic book lovers, pretend not to see, because after all we love and will always love all this s.h.i.t like eternal children. The fact that so many hate this movie is that it just rubs these inconvenient facts in our face. Then people turn to films that mask and hide these shameful aspects, like the films of Burton and Nolan. Each one with their preferences, but I definitely continue with the Burton movies, which were dark without losing the sense of humor and without wanting to sound like a pieces of Shakespeare. Meanwhile, Batman & Robin lights up my days making me laugh and The Dark Knight leaves me with depression."

Guilty as charged for being pleasured by this concoction. Because I really don't need, that a film about a grown man who crossdresses as a bat, has to take itself way too seriously. Moreover, unlike the previous film, this script has head and tail. The characters have their places in the story and clear motivations, and no one is extra. I prefer the film's femme fatale to be a charismatic villain rather than just another useless Wayne's pendant. And everyone obviously noticed that Uma is sexy, but she also acts great and both she and Arnold are visibly enjoying the roles, Clooney and O'Donnell also managed the overcautious & wealthy soloist and uncontrollably self-destructive beau respectively without difficulty and are naturally put in their proper places by Silverstone... Goldenthal once again made a great musical accompaniment, which is just a hair weaker than the last time, but unfortunately, it was never officially released."

While I prefer the \"brooding Batman\" side of the Caped Crusader, I have no compunctions against the light-hearted approach, and Batman and Robin is over-the-top enough to be funny. The film's got some nice displays of acting from Michael Gough and Arnold Schwarzenegger - his talents as an actor are vastly underrated, and, while too clownish as Mr. Freeze, Schwarz puts on a convincing and compassionate display of Dr. Fries' affection for his wife. The rest of the cast are somewhat wooden (Clooney, Silverstone) or irritating (O'Donnel, Thurman - she can really do better than play a sexually frustrated plant-woman), but their flaws don't warrant mud-slinging. The effects are astounding if repetitive and ostentatious, and don't fail to impress even by today's standards. In a nutshell, this movie could have been so much better, but still can be taken at face value. In no way a masterpiece like Batman Begins or Batman Returns, Batman and Robin is a decent superhero flick down on its luck."

I actually did not have a problem with Arnold(he didn't write the punchless script)and Jim Carey was almost a natural for the Riddler but these characters did not have the well played origins that the Joker and the Penguin did. How about Uma?? Wasn't she awful? Again she didn't write the script but compare her character with the Catwoman character of Michelle Pfeiffer. It may be too late for this franchise but I would really like to see Burton bought back for the next one."

From its incomprehensible \"action\" sequences (I dunno, usually when a character throws a punch, you see it connect with someone [or something], but not here), with bodies flying through the air as if made of paper, to its dopey \"extreme sports\" nonsense (which add nothing but extreme tedium), this is a total waste of time.\n\nI saw it free and felt cheated; it's two hours of my life I can't get back. I could have been watching paint dry, or my hair grow and would have been more satisfied. I brought my six-year-old, a HUGE Batman fan, and he was looking up at the projection booth, at other audience members, ANYTHING but the incomprehensible mess on the screen.\n\nWith any luck at all, there will NEVER be another Batman movie directed by Joel Schumacher.

After a few dark adventure movies for the Batman, this outing moves more towards the kitschy '60's TV series, which never took itself seriously. However, shoddy direction fails to balance the comedic and darker-toned scenes with logical transitions. The result is a sloppy concoction which will leave you with a bad after-taste.\n\nNobody in this marquee cast demonstrates any comedic savvy. Expect tons of mugging, awkward timing, lame scripting, amateurish line delivery, and general indifference by the cast. Many of them strut around in an air of self-satisfied arrogance, proudly displaying their abject contempt for the audience the whole time. Uma Thurman looks even weirder than usual. Governor Ahhhnooollld looks like he was just asphyxiated with laughing gas. Vivica Fox barely phones it in (and apparently her cell phone dropped the call). That guy who played Robin (whatever his name is) looks like he belongs on a kindergarten playground, scooping sand with a toy shovel. Alicia Silverstone acts like a Charlie's Angels reject.\n\nClooney is worst of all. He wouldn't know a Batcave from a hole in the floor. He obviously knows (and/or cares) little about the character. He didn't even try to play Batman; more like Clark Gable in \"It Happened One Night,\" only with a mask.\n\nThe whole running time of this film is an exercise in acting and directorial ineptitude."

Gotham City looked cheesy and fake, the dialogue was filled with the worst one-liners imaginable. Worst of all the villians which carried the first three films were absolutely terrible. George Clooney was unconvincing as Batman and Batgirl was shall I say a disgrace to feminism to say the least. Alfred's death angle was lame and did not engage the audience at all.

When I say \"The Master Piece \", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw Batman & Robin. A friend of mine came to my house a few years back. He burst through the door and slammed the DVD onto my bed. I had heard of the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty awful. So, having the expectations to want to kill myself after it, I reluctantly watched it. When the final credits rolled and the sun glazed upon my bed sheets, both of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Louie and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so in movie history! How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the puns in this movie are flawless as well, and the loyalty to the early years of batman make it a \"must buy\" for any comic book fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theatre, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"Batman & Robin\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should Kill all the employees there because there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in your bag so you never leave the cave without it. :o So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a however much money is on the Bat-Credit card!!!!!!"

He did OK, but Michael Keaton was great as Batman, something I never would have believed before seeing it. O'Donnell was also OK. Then there is Ahh-nold. A pretty cool (ha-ha) part for him. Uma Thurman played her Poison Ivy role too far over the top, with more than a few nods to Mae West. I thought Alicia Silverstone did very well, although no one else seems to think so. Maybe she is just too adorable for me see past. All in all, the script could have been better, too many zingers and one-liners. The Gotham City setting was a bit much. The direction seemed OK, meaning I never thought of the director at any time while viewing the show.\n\nLooking over this, it seems full of criticism, and doesn't convey why I enjoyed the movie.

I have the utmost sympathy for those who sat through this film without such mental shielding.\n\nAt this date, it is obvious that this film killed a previously profitable franchise. It managed to have the cheesiness of the Adam West TV series, but yet lacked any of the humor which made the TV show watchable. What wa s left was a poor mish-mash: were Uma Thurman and Ah-nold supposed to be humorous villains? Genuinely evil villains? Misguided anti-heroes? Can anyone tell, or does anyone care after 45 minutes? This was the first movie to show that putting Uma Thurman in kinky outfits cannot salvage a mess of a film (yet, it was tried again- see \"The Avengers\"). Give me Julie Newmar anyday, instead...\n\nAs a dark film, this film fails. As special effects brain-candy, this film fails. As camp, this film fails. As an attempt to develop any characters, this film fails. This may very well be the least cost-effective film ever, in terms of the amount spent to make a useless pile of ____. A few suggestions as to how this \"film\"'s budget would have been better spent:\n\n1. Endow a film school. Enroll Joel Schumaker.\n\n2. A retirement annuity for Michael Gough. Really, he has been a great actor, and should not have to spend his older years appearing in this sort of embarrassment.\n\n3. Give the money to Peter Jackson and tell him to do something, anything, with it. Definitely bound to get a better film, or more likely, two or three better films.\n\n4. Give the money to any random person on the street and tell them to make a film with it. Highly probable to get a better film, or more likely, two or three better films.\n\n5. Endow an MBA program. Enroll whoever green-lighted this.\n\n6. Therapy for the people who thought this film was a good idea."

(the people who own DC comics, publishers of Batman) should know better. They really messed up with the characters. First of all, Barbara is Commissioner Gordon's daughter and not Alfred's niece. Second, Bane is totally screwed up. This is a character that in the comics broke Batman's back but can not strangle Robin and Batgirl. The only really good actor in this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Everyone else either delivers below average performances or just really sucks. Basically, Warner Bros. did not take the time to work on this movie and they paid for it. Feel free to avoid this chapter in the Batman legacy, you didn't miss much."

Joel Schumacher unfortunately assumes otherwise.\n\nYou see, this is supposed to be the fourth instalment in the blockbuster Batman series. So it needs to follow the trend of Batman, Batman Returns and for some part, Batman Forever. The dark, Gothic caped crusader must be there. The storyline must be based centred on Batman fighting crime to avenge the death of his parents and protect the innocent. And most importantly, you must have some kind of plot that follows the dark knight style trend and is at least to some extent believable. Sadly Joel Schumacher has mixed barely even a quarter of this, together with a huge dollop Adam Wests camp fest of the sixties. And the result truly is a complete mess.\n\nTwatman & Bobbins would probably be the best title for this over-hyped big budget disgrace. Joel Schumacher and George Clooney have completely ruined what Tim Burton & Michael Keaton had begun. What Keaton and Burton achieved was magnificent, this is quite frankly a shameful joke.\n\nSo where to begin. Well we might as well start with the plot and storyline. Anyone who thought Superman IV had the worst plot of any action movie ought to check this out. Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to steal diamonds to save his cryogenically frozen wife, while the beautifully evil Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), yet again another product of a nasty lab accident, who wants to rid the world of humans so the plants can take back their own. The ridiculous nonsense is complete when Ivy decides Mr. Freeze is the man for her. This folks simply isn't what I would by any means call a dark Gothic Batman plot. All I can see is a whole giant bat-pile of suck.\n\nBut oh dear it gets far worse! And then there's Robin (Chris O'Donnell), who wants his own Batsignal, which causes our bat buddies to bicker while Alicia Silverstone steps up to the plate as Batgirl with little more effort than a butt jiggle. There's also a lot of bat babble about the importance of family. It is here that I feel I should make the point that Chris O' Donnel is the single most annoying person I have ever seen play any role WHATSOEVER in an action film. EVER.\n\nBatman and Robin continues to expand on the flaw that has plagued the Batman series since Batman Returns: too many characters, and not enough time to develop them. Whereas the original Batman had three main characters, Batman Returns had four, and Batman Forever had five, now Batman and Robin has six main characters, four of whom have never been seen before (not counting George Clooney's take on the caped crusader). The film is half over before all the introductions are complete. What I find most insulting about this is that the sixth character Bane has been turned from psycho crime boss, into a useless dreck of a mutant. One of the worst misrepresentations of character I ever saw.\n\nThe film I have to admit is wonderful to look at and the effects are pretty top notch, but it is all totally destroyed by the bad casting, poor direction and of course the ultimate reason why this movie blows hard chunks, the woeful script. Ouch:\n\nBatman: And you are...? Batgirl: Batgirl. Batman: That's not very PC. What about Batwoman, or Batperson? Batgirl: I found the Batcave. Robin: I guess we'll just have to kill her.\n\nSorry you're telling me THAT passes as a DC comic script, adapted into a movie? You must be on quite a lot of mind upending substances because I can see just about every true Bat-fan lining up waiting to ram a bayonet through Clooney's neck. Mind you, wouldn't that make for a good ER storyline!\n\nBut personally what shocks (sickens) me the most is that this made $300m at the box office. I don't know whether this was just people watching for morbid curiosity. Or whether it was the younger more easily satisfied Bat-fan who doesn't know any better. Or maybe even the hardcore Batman fan hoping and praying that this would turn out decent? Either way, it's corporate movie making at its worst. How any true Batman fan can watch the other instalments of the WB Batman series and be satisfied with such a shoddy effort.\n\nBatman and Robin is the single worst case of ruining a good franchise I ever saw.\n\nDon't watch this film."

I review Batman & Robin in the context of earlier Batman movies and latter Dark Knight series. Here goes..\n\nI believe that Batman & Robin is a fast-paced entertainer, with groovy action, crisp, double-meaning dialog, bright comic costumes, sly innuendos and a 'feel-good' feeling at the end. Arnie excels as Mr Freeze, and so does Uma as Poison Ivy. The antics of these two, throughout the film, amply compensate for the film's weaknesses: Clooney is a boring Batman, and Alicia as Batgirl, is thoroughly annoying. Chris, as Robin, has the usual problems of teenagers, viz. rebellion to any form of authority, awakening sexuality and lack of experience in worldly matters. No big deal. However, compared to the dull and depressing Batman films of Keaton or Kilmer, or the literally 'dark' Batman films of Bale, this one is racy.. it does not take itself too seriously.. it does not explore hidden meanings, psychological problems or world domination. It is surfeit with bright, wacky, comic characters from the DC Universe, and its sole aim is to entertain. And entertain it does."

Batman and Robin would have been better if Chris O'Donnell wasn't in it and if Alicia Silverstones character was written out completely, and O'h yes if George Clooney wasn't Batman they must have given him a huge paycheck for this one.

So why the 5? This movie is hilarious. Between the bad acting and obscure references to totally unrelated subjects, it's just so terrible you cannot help but enjoy it. I personally feel that the writers intentionally ignored all of the batman lore to make a point: this isn't a batman movie.\n\nIf you like laughing at intentionally awful movies then this is something for you.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Batman Forever\" was bad. This, unfortunately, is much worse. It is hard, when attempting a serious critique of a film of such low-calibre, to know where to start when picking out its faults. Certainly the script is terrible. Over these last two movies in the series, the scriptwriting has undergone a dramatic decline from the quality of the first two, largely (if not entirely) due to the influence of Akiva Goldsman. Here the one-liners come thick and fast and not one of them is worth repeating. The narrative is extremely poorly formed and there are many loose ends jumps in logic as to the devolving relationship between the title characters. Particularly, the character of Poison Ivy makes absolutely no sense, at least that I can fathom. Robin comes across as a spoiled brat and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze merely defies description as possibly THE worst Batman villain on the screen. George Clooney is new to the cape and seems to be lost in trying to find his own way of translating the character. Not to worry, if this is the standard of quality, there hopefully won't be a fifth film. Chris O'Donnell plays a marvellously annoying Robin, but it is quite arguable as to whether this was intended of indeed, whether O'Donnell is acting at all. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy at least tries hard in the role, but not even Thurman can pull off the snake-headed flowers and emerge unscathed. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, I suspect, would have maintained a better handle on the role if only it were better developed and her second side not introduced so late in the film. Indeed, this lack of character development is any many ways the major problem with the script. We know, from Batman mythology, that the characters of Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze and Two-Face (from \"Batman Forever\") are all intricate character with their own storylines and sympathetic sides. This is totally ignored in this film in deference to the implausible and uninteresting stunts. Schumacher has tried to play the action card upon us once again and has failed miserably, where in \"Batman Forever\" it was probably the saving grace. Schumacher's revamped Gotham is truly hideous and impractical to say the least and the observatory itself is quite quite exquisitely awful. I would recommend this film only to budding film-makers not only as a dystopic view on how films should NOT be made but also as a lesson in how much advertising and hype can shield the public from actual quality"

It's not a perfect movie, by any means, but it has some really wonderful moments that I'll get to in a minute. I think that those who disliked this movie so intensely went into it expecting something else. For what it was, it was fine enough ..\n\nSurprises in this movie:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger can act.\n\nElle Macpherson can act.\n\nAlicia Silverstone can really act\n\nMichael Gough can really, really act.\n\nHis Alfred Pennyworth steals this movie out from under the bigger-named stars and super-heroic derring-do.\n\nVendela Kirsebom Thomessen looks good, even pickled in brine. Two Sports Illustrated swimsuit models in one movie not about Sports Illustrated or swimsuits has to be a first ..\n\nThe movie's best moment is the introduction of Poison Ivy ..as an instrumental version of the Coasters' hit played in the background! Now, *that's entertainment*! Ivy was the only character that didn't work for me. I loved her as the femme fatale who charmed her admirers with the pheromone dust, but she was a bit too psychotic. Nice stems, though. And buds.\n\nSchwarzenegger was fine as Freeze: too small, maybe, but he caught the sense of the character as I saw him just fine. When I looked, I saw Mr. Freeze, not Ah-nuld playing at being Mr. Freeze.\n\nThis movie reminded me of Superman I in a lot of ways. The super-heroic derring-do and the super-villainous nefarious schemes were played to the hilt as cartoon-ish as possible. Outlandish, bizarre, too warped to be believed: freezing an entire city with an overgrown ray-gun .. Come on!\n\nBut, where this movie redeems itself is in its moments at Wayne manor. Those were touching, warm, funny and very moving. I bought into the relationships of Bruce to Alfred, Bruce to Dick, and Barbara to Alfred. They seemed like real people.. a strange thing to say about a Batman movie to be sure .. that I cared about. Bruce calling Julie \"Ivy\" at one point was a nice touch.\n\nDirector Schumacher has been caught up in the fan angst over this movie, because I've heard elsewhere that he has badmouthed his own movie. I don't share his feeling, or that of the rest of the IMDb. I've been reading comic books for five decades, and seen all the iterations of Batman. This one wasn't bad. I have the DVD, and I'll watch it again."

Why am I telling you this?? Because that is the point in time everybody said the 90s franchise went sour. Next time you watch this movie listen to the dialog that Jim Carrey shares with Tommy Lee. It's actually funny and witty at the same time. The idea of Jim being in tights just adds to the effect of how crazy the Riddler is. To me he's just the opposite of the character of the Joker. Different kind of humor and everything. Out of the four films, this one has some of the best lines that I like to quote.\n\nBatman and Robin on the other hand to me only has one draw back - Cloony. Can these actors act together and pull it off?? Yes! I think the reason for the stupidity of the movie is Poision Ivy. The actress has to be sadistic, beautiful, cunning and crude.\n\nSo, why the big deal????"

The storyline follows Batman & Robin still trying to learn how to work together as two super villains emerge. The first super villain is a scientist who lost his wife and turned himself into Mr. Freeze so he could take revenge on the Earth for his pain. Meanwhile, a plant enthusiast who obtains the power of persuasion emerges and joins forces with Freeze to wage war on Gotham. Can Batman & Robin get their act together long enough to save the city?\n\nThis movie was directed by Joel Schumacher (Falling Down) and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (True Lies), George Clooney (Ocean's Eleven), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill), Alicia Silverstone (Clueless), Chris O'Donnell (Scent of a Woman), Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day) and Elle Macpherson (Sirens).\n\nThe writing, script, dialogue and acting in this is absolutely awful. I will say Clooney was slightly better than Val Kilmer as Batman, but neither approached the level of Keaton in the first two movies. I did like the Coolio cameo and Bane was well created and depicted but under utilized. The storyline was awful and painful to follow and the insertion of Silverstone was too much with what was already going on.\n\nOverall this is a very bad movie. Joel Schumacher failed to keep the pace of the Batman universe that Burton established, unfortunately. I would score this movie a 2/10 and strongly recommend skipping it."

I can tell you 3 reasons why this movie is really bad:\n\n1: The acting is terrible. The Terminator and Uma Thurman as Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Seriously? 2: The visuals and action scenes were terrible. The visuals make this movie look like a kids film and the action scenes aren't that action packed. There mostly lame. and 3. The Costumes. Whatever happened to the original costumes? The one's in this movie are super lame. Literally.\n\nSo in the end, \"Batman and Robin\", is just a horrible movie and it is best for you to stay away from this film.\n\nI gave this movie a one because IMDb dosen't let you give a movie a zero."

I don't consider myself to be a die-hard Batman fan, but like millions of other people around the world I have some general knowledge of the character and an interest in the comics that spawned him. BATMAN & ROBIN absolutely BUTCHERS everything that Batman was before, and leaves virtually nothing to take its place. I mean if the horrible acting, dialogue, and absolutely no plot weren't bad enough, they go and throw in BANE who is from a completely different era of comics, and change his character from a fearsome and powerful ex-con (who cripples Batman in the comics) into the missing stooge, or maybe the bizarro world version of arnold? (just a guess). And they put NIPPLES on the Batsuit, make a reference to the 60's series (which was campy as hell but still way better than this mess), and give Mr. Freeze great one-liners like, \"everybody chill!\".

Director Joel Schumacher couldn't believe his luck with the success of Batman Forever, so much so he kept the campy formula and upped the ante big time, the result was - until Christopher Nolan's reinvention in 2005 - the death of the franchise, going out in a whimper and a hail of stinging verbals.\n\nIt starts off quite promising, our heroes in a slam bang corking action sequence fighting the monstrous Mr Freeze, and then we are tantalised by the sexy transformation of Uma Thurman into Poison Ivy who is accompanied by the beast that is Bane, but then...\n\nCompoast!\n\nWell it goes down hill fast, stupid puns and gimmicks at every opportunity instead of character building, with Batman producing a Batman Credit Card on the 45 minute mark sounding the death knell. Crashes and wallops at every possible turn make the head spin in a bad way, and then we have Alicia Silverstone as Barbara Wilson, Alfred's niece and of course the afore mentioned fledgling Batgirl. She forgets the character is meant to be English (probably Schumacher forgot it as well?), she can't fight for toffee, and, well, she looks uncomfortable saying the basic moronic dialogue. It comes to something when you are making a blockbuster comic book adaptation and Arnold Schwarzenegger is badly miscast, and he is, a simply awful for the money performance from the usually reliable action meat head.\n\nI will however give George Clooney a tiny bit of support, perhaps a bit too underplayed as Bruce Wayne, he still looks good in the Bat suit and at the very least convinces as a charming caped crusader, and he is part of the best Bruce/Alfred scene in the whole franchise. But ultimately he is wrong for the part, something which he himself would agree with later on down the road. Overall it's a big misfire that is rightly reviled in most quarters, the best I can say for it is that my then 4 year old nephew thought the crash bang wallops were fun, and there my friends you have the target audience.

When I was a small child, I had nightmares about monsters under my bed, kidnappers, alien, etc. To tell you the truth, I wet my bed frequently until the age of six. After seeing Batman and Robin, the nightmares returned. So did the bed wetting.\n\n2. The acting: What acting? In fact, it's worse than bad. The english language can't describe how bad it is. No language can. George Clooney turns the dark and brooding Batman into a happy crime fighter with spunk! I don't ever want to see a man in that much rubber smiling at me again.\n\n3. The plot: It's bad. Every hollywood cliche is thrown in. To make you feel sympathy, they threaten Alfred's death. \"Oh no...the only likable character is dying...\" HE WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE MOVIE! Save yourself Alfred. Kill yourself, and you'll go warp speed to eternal happiness. I'm sure God will forgive you for being in this \"film\".\n\n4. The special effects: They're really bad. Gotham is now lit with neon pink and blue lights. EVERYTHING is in neon. Batman and Robin show a blatant disrespect for the laws of physics. I'm not talking about standard movie stunts i.e; riding a shockwave, jumping off a 100 foot cliff, living through huge explosions, etc., etc....They surf through the air, falling thousands of feet through the air, sometimes moving STRAIGHT UP. Batman falls, then moves upward, completely defying gravity.\n\n5. The flaws: they're everywhere. At one point, Robin is being pulled underwater. The shot goes like this: Robin is floating in the water-the villain pulls him under the water briefly-he resurfaces. Simple, right? Well instead of ACTUALY SHOOTING THE SCENE, they simply reverse the film halfway through the shot, so it looks like he's coming out of the water, when in fact you're seeing him go UNDERWATER backwards. ALSO, Alfred (just off his deathbed) whips up a batsuit for Alicia Silverstone in a matter of minutes.\n\n6. The rubber: Alicia Silverstone doesn't have nipples on her batsuit, but Batman and Robin DO. THere are butt-shots and crotch-shots GALORE! What is wrong with Joel Schumacher? I think we all know...\n\n7. In one scene, Mr. Freeze wants to freeze Gotham, so he goes to the city observatory, and plants little plastic icicles all over the telescope. Then he goes to the top, and it's magically transformed to some kind of freeze-ray. Does this make sense to you? THis sounds like it was written by a tow year old. It makes about as much sense as the scene in \"Kindergarten Cop: where the little boy puts his \"lazers\" (actually balls of tinfoil) all over a power line near his house.\n\n8. There are too many characters. There's Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane. That's six characters with twelve personalities. This film gives new meaning to the word \"filth\".\n\n9. It's a testament to the stupidity of the american viewing audience that movies like this rake in millioms of dollars, while great movies like \"The Spanish Prisoner\" and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" wallow in relative obscurity.\n\n10. There is no plot, character development, intelligence, or thoughtfulness behind this movie. No story, no uniqueness, no artistic touches. There aren't any clever camera techniques or special effects. Just a bunch of ever-larger explosions.\n\n11. This movie has nothing good in it, so they try to fill the gaping hole with loud special effects, more characters, and more one-liners.\n\n12. This film insults your intelligence.\n\n13. It's too stupid for adults, and too empty for kids.\n\n14. The horrible truth is, there are some people who like this movie. These are the kind of people who watch WWF wrestling. These are the kind of people who will never experience the joy of reading a good book (Fahrenheit 451 for instance), or spend more than two seconds in deep thought. I feel sorry for these people.\n\n15. The music: They didn't even bother to score new music for this movie, they just reused the music from the last Batman movie. The music is apallingly bad. Good movies have music that fits the scene, that enhances the movie, but doesn't overshadow it. It completes the movie. Films like \"Schindlers List\", \"The Truman Show\" and \"The Hunt For Red October\" all have music that perfectly fits the movie. This has recycled junk thrown in.\n\n16. Joel Schumacher, this is a message for YOU: We (the viewing public) don't want to pay seven dollars to see garbage. WE want to see movies that make us think. When you leave a good movie, you can't stop thinking about it. When you leave this movie (this could happen as quickly as two minutes after the opening credits), all I think is \"I want my money back\". When I left this movie, my ears hurt. My brain hurt. When I left this movie, I left a part of my soul in the theater. It was stolen by the mind-blowingly bad crapfest that is \"Batman and Robin\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once again Joel Screwmacher was allowed to handle another Batman movie and under his direction plunged a promising series into cinema hell. Batman Forever was proof that something foul was afoot for the Batman series. For the record I never heard anything about how bad this movie was until I brought the DVD(like a fool) and experienced for myself. Afterward I searched online and found tons of reviews on Amazon as well as other websites slamming this movie. Before I start: to the little ADD afflicted kid who thinks this movie is better than Batman Returns, STAY OFF THE GLUE!!!\n\nPlot: Mr Freeze(played by Ahnuld) wants to turn Gotham as well as the world into an icebox. Poison Ivy wants to help him destroy the world while populating the planet with her freakish plants. Batman(played by George Looney) and Robin(played by Chris O'Donell)with the aid of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone) are out to stop them.\n\nOpinion: This is the worst superhero movie of all time. Having George Clooney play Batman is like having Pauly Shore or Brandon Fraser play James Bond. Chris O'Donell's character Robin is such an annoying bratty punk. Uma Thurman does her worst Mae West impression as Poison Ivy and I'm convinced that Quentin Tarentino's peculiar attraction to her saved her career from extinction because crappy movies like Batman& Robin, Even Cowgirls Get The Blues and The Avengers could have easily sunk her career into obscurity. Arnold gives the worst performance of his acting career as well as Alicia Silverstone(and thats saying a lot for Alicia). The biggest offense is turning Bane a.k.a. \"The Batbreaker\" into a bumbling idiot who mumbles everything being said to him. You know a movie is in trouble when the only character you care for is the butler Alfred(played by Alfred Gough), who might be dying. The fluorescent atmosphere of this movie is an eyesore, hell, the whole movie is an eyesore itself. The Joel Blublocker Batman movies are a reason for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight's existence. Don't even buy this to complete your Batman collection and everybody who suffered through this whole movie needs to file a class action suit against everybody involved. Its THAT bad."

The fourth of the Batman series, it forces Batman and Robin to overcome their animosity towards each other and defeat the duo Mr.Freeze/Poison Ivy. Oh cripes! Where the heck should I begin? First off, George Clooney is NOT an action hero. He did a bad enough job with From Dusk till Dawn and the Peacemaker, and no thanks to the really lame script, it makes him look even more pitiful. I could understand when rumors surfaced that Clooney would not like to do another Batman flick. Second, out of all of the major characters, Chris O'Donnell did a really poor job acting the already pitiful script. \"Naaah!!! You're just mad because she wants to kiss me and not you!\" Gimme a break. Third, did Joel Schumacher ever consider taking this movie seriously? What did he do? Toss in a whole bunch of different characters and tell'em to go figure out how to act them out themselves? This movie is really bad, and I would not suggest it to anyone unless you are completely bored out of your mind. I'm hoping the next Batman movie fairs better (They have to, I don't think they are satisfied with the complete disappointment of this movie). A message to the director, Mr. Schumacher, forget what you think is appealing to the family. You are not directing a Disney family film. Consider the U.S. as your audience and go from there."

Uma Thurman is so-so. Over-the-top portrayals of villains don't have to be so awful. Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, Julie Newmar, etc. pull the task with much more skill in the old TV series. O'Donnell's Robin and Silverstone's Batgirl are shallow and selfish - who would want to root for them? George Clooney is actually halfway decent as Bruce Wayne, but there's not much for him to work with. I doubt that many fans of Batman comics or cartoons would like this movie."

You could see that subtle change in all the previous titles, the change from dark, beautiful, freaky even to the neon-lights, pop and completely mainstream. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing to be pop, but sometimes some things are meant to be dark. The very essence of Batman character and his world is dark, so making so hip and colorful was not a good idea. But that's debatable, feel free to disagree. And while Batman Forever still had some flair to the poppy feel, this part doesn't.\n\nThe truly terrible thing is the cast. Clooney is possibly the worst Batman ever; Silverstone hasn't still recovered from Clueless and she's convinced, I'm sure, that she's still playing that part (and she's doing it cluelessly); Thurman is good, but she and her skills don't fit here. Schwarzenegger is the one that's making the movie truly dreadful, though. Calling him an actor would be an overstatement. It takes a certain skill to be playing a villain; Schwarzenegger is lacking that skill, and many others. He makes the movie unwatchable. Paying him 25 millions dollars for that role is the sole definition of 'wasted money'.\n\nAnd then there's the terrible script that really makes no sense at all. It's forgettable. There are too many things that happen and truly nothing really happens at all. After having watched all the parts many times, this part is the one I'm having the most difficulties remembering what it's about.\n\nAnd that's not a good thing for a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Gotham City, former scientist Dr. Victor Fries (Arnold Schwarzenegger) following an accident that left him unable to live outside of freezing temperatures is going on a crime spree through Gotham as Mr. Freeze to steal both Diamonds to power his freezing suit and capitol to fund his research to save his terminally ill wife. Meanwhile in South America, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thruman) conducts plant-animal hybridization experiments but following her discovery that her boss Dr Woodrue (John Glover) is creating genetically engineered super-soliders is seemingly killed by Woodrue only for Woodrue himself to end up dead after Dr. Isley's exposure to the chemicals leads her to adopt plant like traits with a drive to use her botanical skills to exact Mother Nature's vengeance against mankind, and heads to Gotham with Wodrue's super soldier Bane (Robert Swenson) in tow. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne (George Clooney) and Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) continue their roles as Gotham's protectors as Batman and Robin respectively with Dick becoming resentful of Bruce's apparent lack of trust. Matters are further complicated with the arrival of Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) the niece of Bruce and Dick's loyal butler and friend Alfred (Michael Gough). Alfred is suffering from a less advanced case of the same terminal illness affecting Freeze's wife. When Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze team up Batman & Robin must work through their animosity to save Gotham and the world.\n\nFollowing the success of Batman Forever and its commercial marketing tie-ins, Warner Bros. Fast tracked development of a sequel with Batman & Robin coming out a mere 2 years after Forever in comparison to the 3 year gap between the films that had been the standard. Joel Schumacher returned once again as director, and due to scheduling conflicts with the adaptation of The Saint, Val Kilmer was unable to return as Bruce Wayne/Batman leading to the casting of George Clooney who was starring in the hit medical drama ER and achieved cult recognition with the Robert Rodriguez directed and Quentin Tarantino penned From Dusk till Dawn. With Tim Burton no longer associated with the series in a producing capacity, executives put even more pressure on the production to go even further into camp and put even greater emphasis on \"toyetic\" appeal to further mine those coveted merchandising ancillaries. When the movie was released to theaters the movie made back $230 million worldwide, but with a budget of $160 million was seen as a commercial disappointment and lead Warner Bros. To cancel the proposed third Schumacher film Batman: Unchained which would've featured Johnathan Crane aka The Scarecrow as played by Coolio. Batman & Robin has since had its place cemented in history as the butt of jokes regarding big budget butchering of Comic Book/Superhero material and its legacy lives on as mockery in shows like Clerks: The Animated Series and even Psych calling attention to embarrassing aspects of production like the rubber bat nipples. Batman & Robin is routinely ranked among many \"Worst of\" lists but while it is bad I can't bring myself to call it terrible.\n\nGeorge Clooney is unfortunately pretty weak as Batman and unlike Keaton or even Kilmer (who wasn't that good to begin with) Clooney doesn't even attempt to play Batman's voice and delivery at a different register from Bruce. I don't think Clooney is to blame for this as Schumacher specifically aimed for both the Adam West TV show and the Silver Age art of Dick Sprang for inspiration on how Batman & Robin would play to the audience, so on that level you can maybe say it gets what they were going for, but the TV show and Silver Age comics never tried to go for Pathos and there are MANY scenes in Batman & Robin that want you to water your eyes at them. Scenes like Bruce remembering Alfred raising him and being a father to him or Mr. Freeze looking over his wedding video or visiting his comatose wife are played up for tearjerking and they don't fit into this neon pink, glow-in-the-dark painted, laser projectors world that bears more resemblance to a set used by Cirque du Soleil rather than Gotham City. Arnold Schwarzenegger is....not great for the part of Mr. Freeze. Once again Schwarzenegger is doing what he can with the material, but his grating usage of non-stop ice puns and scenery chewing is not only not funny, but if this was the route they wanted to go with the character than Nora Fries really shouldn't have even been in the movie. Chris O'Donnell remains miscast as Batman's sidekick Robin and with dialogue that might be acceptable coming from a teenager, but out of a man nearing his 30s just feels whiny and immature. Uma Thruman probably gives the best performance with her take on Posion Ivy as a scenery chewing Femme Fatale playing well despite spouting the often cringe inducing dialogue filled with double entendre and innuendos of a sexual slant, but despite how bad the dialogue is Uma Thruman does strike that balance of sexy camp to make it kind of endearing. And then we have Alicia Silverstone as Alfred's nice Barbara Wilson who becomes Batgirl. There's a number of things I don't think work about the character, her lack of a British accent, her age disparity between Michael Gough leaving you scratching your head thinking \"how is he your Uncle?\", and her lack of authority when it comes to playing Batgirl. Alicia Silverstone was apparently the only person considered for the role and it feels like it because as much as I like Alicia Silverstone as an actress she does not fit this role at all. I will say that Michael Gough remains strong as Alfred having been this franchise's equivalent of Desmond Llewelyn's Q from the Bond films (albeit with a slightly more sentimental bent) and the scenes where he warmly reminisces with Bruce on the happy memories of being a father to Bruce do attain a good level of emotional resonance and give Gough some of the richest material he's been allowed in this series.\n\nPer usual of a Schumacher production Batman & Robin is a very large movie that is grandiose in its visions. At $160 million you can see the money on screen with large scale action sequences, large bombastic action sequences, and a vision of Gotham city that looks expensive. While you can see the money on screen, it's a very garish movie with a lot of \"visual noise\" that doesn't build a convincing world and only serves to call attention to itself. While Batman Forever retained some of the dark shadows of the Burton films and put in some neon lights, Batman & Robin is washed in exaggerated Reds, Blues, and Greens with set dressing that feels like someone couldn't decide what color swatches they wanted so they just threw them at random and stuck with where they landed. Batman & Robin feels like what would happen if someone had never seen Power Rangers but was given an absurd amount of money to try and ape Power Rangers, but Power Rangers could get away with this kind of absurdity because A) it was a cheaply produced kids' show and B) the lack of budget mixed with the corny delivery added to the charm. That isn't to say high budget camp can't work, just look at 1980's Flash Gordon or W. D. Richter's Big Trouble in Little China or Buckaroo Banzai for successful examples, but Batman & Robin doesn't have the tradecraft, delivery, or heart behind those projects and is instead only focused on looking like the biggest brightest commercial it can be and while there's nothing wrong with being a commercial you should at least be a GOOD commercial so people feel inclined to buy the mass produced plastic you're hawking.\n\nBatman & Robin has some levels of pathos or charm, but they're drowned out by the bloated, noisy excess of executive notes whose self-assuredness they're the \"smartest guys in the room\" has come off with a marketing campaign that feels like Steve Buscemi saying \"How do ya do fellow kids!?\". Batman & Robin is only a fraction of a movie with the remaining percentage being everything else. It's a line of action figures, it's a breakfast cereal, it's a video game, it's a soundtrack album, and a line of ultra-flammable children's sleepware. There's nothing wrong with blanket commercial tie-ins to movies (it's been the norm since Kenner and Star Wars in the 70s) but at least pretend the commercial tie-ins are an afterthought rather than the primary existence of your film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Batman cinematic history: after the Adam West serial (campy, goofy, silly fun), Tim Burton darkened things up with 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' (much more similar to the image the comic books were trying to create) and finally the series came into the hands of Joel Schumacher, who decided to reinforce the 'gay symbol' image Batman was 'associated' with and return the campyness of Adam West's era.\n\n'Batman Forever' was an excellent job at what Schumacher set off to do. Yet, it is with 'Batman & Robin' that he fully achieved his objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, take ANY dialogue from the film. Doesn't matter if you have the context or not, it is terrible. No, wait, 'terrible' would be a compliment. It is cheesy, completely lacking in the wit or cleverness it apparently believes itself to have; the terrible out-of-place jokes and the delivery makes it even harder to stand.\n\n\n\nAlicia Silverstone... How was she supposed to be a Batgirl like that? She is good looking and not necessarily a bad choice, but looks and talks as if she was still in 'Clueless'. Michael Gough is a lot better here and, despite the contrived subplot he is in, the only one to do a good job; he is outstanding, even, by this film's standards.\n\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a joke as Mr Freeze. His success as an actor sterns from his physique that makes him a perfect choice for action roles; however, Freeze is supposed to be a serious scientist with a highly dramatic and emotionally sympathetic life-story; however, he acts nothing like that and becomes just a 'Terminator'-esque, pun-cracking goofy villain. Seriously, there are many super-strength using Batman villains; couldn't he have played Bane instead, for example?\n\nWait, who is that henchmen of Ivy? IS THAT FREAKING BANE?!?!\n\nOverall, Schumacher destroyed the franchise here and put his name on history as the director of, arguably, the worst film of all time."

        "review_title": "They killed Batman",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are certain film franchises which are basically licenses for their studios to print money. It takes a truly wretched movie to kill off one of those franchises. Joel Schumacher did it. He killed Batman. Schumacher's first Batman film, Batman Forever, was an abomination. But Warner Bros. let him make another one. Mistake. Big, huge, giant, franchise-killing mistake. If you thought Schumacher camped it up in the last one wait until you get a load of this. The hideously unfunny puns, the absurdly out of place innuendos, Gotham lit up like a neon amusement park. And nipples. Yes, the Bat-nipples are back. Codpieces too. Schumacher turned Batman into a joke.\n\nVal Kilmer was smart enough to steer clear of this mess so we get another new Batman. It's George Clooney this time and he doesn't make much of an impression at all. Sadly that's the nicest thing you can say about any of the film's stars. While Clooney is neither notably good nor notably bad, just kind of there, his costars all fail miserably. First there is the woefully miscast Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Mr. Freeze. Schwarzenegger spends the whole movie spouting some of the worst one-liners ever put to film. There are only so many jokes about ice and cold which can fall flat before you want to start throwing things at the screen. Meanwhile, surrendering every last bit of indie film cred she had accrued, there is Uma Thurman playing Poison Ivy. The character is a total dud and Thurman hams it up to an absurd extent. You want some menace from your villains in a superhero movie? Sorry, you've come to the wrong place. Mr. Freeze is a joke. Poison Ivy is a joke. Everything in this movie is a joke. Which brings us to Chris O'Donnell. Yes, whiny Robin's back but you probably guessed that from the film's title. But for this film one whiny, spoiled brat would-be superhero wasn't nearly enough so Batgirl gets tossed into the mix. Alicia Silverstone mopes her way through the film in that role. If you think her acting is terrible, and it is, just wait until you see her fight. Worst. Fight. Ever. Is there anything nice to say about anyone at all? Well, Michael Gough, playing trusted butler Alfred, is a fine actor and deserves so much better than to be surrounded by so much garbage.\n\nIn big-budget extravaganzas like this even if the story stinks and the acting stinks and the directing stinks you can usually say, well, at least the effects look great. But alas, in this movie even the effects are terrible. Strictly amateur hour. Apparently the film's entire budget went to Schwarzenegger's and Clooney's salaries. The lame, cheesy effects fit right in with everything else about this debacle of a movie. The script is an atrocity. The action scenes are absurd, often incoherent, and largely just wastes of time. The hockey scene? Ugh. The motorcycle race? Double ugh. Robin yelling \"Cowabunga!\" as he surfs to Earth on the remnants of an exploded rocket? Oh dear God. The only thing which could make this movie worse is if Batman whipped out a Bat-credit card. Oh, he did. Where does the credit card company send the bill I wonder? Does Batman have a P.O. Box? Well now I've really digressed but that's much better than actually continuing to talk about this movie. What's left to say? It's awful, terrible, hideous. Don't ever watch it. There is one legitimately funny thing in the movie though. Unfortunately it's a laugh at the movie, not laugh with the movie type of thing. It comes at the end when the movie tries to set up the next sequel. But we know there would be no next sequel. Because this movie was so bad it did the impossible, it killed Batman. Of course no comic book hero can ever truly die. So let's just go watch the Christopher Nolan movies and pretend this never happened."

Why? It's looks so stupid and so camp. So much so that it makes the original series look Butch.\n\nGeorge Clooney is terrible. Chris O'Donnell is even worse. Alicia Silverstone is there for no reason other than to make guys see it. Arnie is bad, bad, bad. Uma Thurman is some sort of plant\u0085I dunno. The jokes are brazenly awful. And Bruce Wayne is\u0085normal. Batman is not the weirdo he once was. Why doesn't he just become Barman instead? In BATMAN RETURNS he completely ignored Selina Kyle the first time he met her, despite the fact that she was smitten by him. But in this movie he's like 'Hi I'm Batman, I have unlimited credit on my Credit Batcard.\n\nNever, ever, ever, ever, ever watch this ugly, ugly and twisted pile of trash."

This movie is an insult to humanity. Its is so bad that it is horrible, completely shattering the saying 'So bad, its good'.\n\nI have never seen such horrible acting in my life from such highly regarded actors, who gave their worst performances ever. The beginning of the movie was cheesy with Robin complaining over the fact that his name was not Bat. Arnold gave such a terrible performance with his unbearable one-liners such as 'Is the party over?' etc (They're probably in millions).\n\nUma Thurman was extremely lovable in Kill Bill but in this movie, I felt to strangulate her. Her overacting and her unbearable dialogue delivery, which according to her, was her way to charm men, couldn't just do anything. I do not blame Freeze when he told that he would make life hell for her.\n\nGeorge Clooney or rather Clowny too was horrible. He was smiling, smiling and smiling. He even smiled in emotional scenes and in scenes where he had to appear angry. I was surprised that he lost the award for Worst Actor in Razzie Awards.\n\nRobin, as I have mentioned before, was pathetic. His jealousy was laughable and all his frustration got me frustrated to ponder upon the fact that why, for the sake of God, am I watching this crap of a movie!\n\nThe actress who won for Worst supporting actress deserved the award for being so annoying and having an odd shaped mouth whenever she talked.\n\nThere are so many bad puns and dialogues which can irk almost anyone. The action too doesn't help and rather sabotages the film. The humor is unfunny. Alfred too was very annoying in this movie. A 2 out of ten for his piece of crap. And oh yes, the mad scientist was probably the worst mad scientist out of the list of mad scientists."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is deservedly one of the most despised films ever. It's pure mechanical delivery and product placement with barely an ounce of storyline to hold it together.\n\n(Spoiler Warning)\n\nI remember reading the critical reviews saying how bad the movie was, and going; \"Yeah right. Critics say that about all summer blockbuster action movies!\" (Well, they did at the time - constantly!) Then I watched the movie, and about five minutes in there's a scene where Mr Freeze zaps Robin with his ice-gun and turns him into an icicle. Then Batman runs up, and Mr Freeze says to him: \"Now you've got a choice, either rescue the boy or chase me.\" (or something like that). Anyway, I remember thinking right there; \"I actually don't care if he walks away and forgets the whole thing! @#%$& it, the critics are right!\"\n\nThis may be an armchair director talking; but if I had done this movie, I would have at least wanted a pre-title sequence which set up the two main antagonists. Imagine Bruce Wayne at a cocktail party being his suave self; including a bit where a guest slips up and Bruce is asked to help. He replies \"Well, I'm not a doctor.\" - an inside joke for George Clooney in reference to his 'ER' persona. Intercut this with extreme closeups of Mr Freeze tuning up his suit and barking orders at his henchmen to get ready, and then setting out for the heist. Then you run the titles, and THEN you get into the story. That way the audience is already perked up with anticipation in the characters and gives a hoot about what's going on. (It's basically the way the Bond movies work - even if you go to see the latest movie and it's your first time; you get a quick rundown on who this guy is, what he does and the fact that he's damn good at it)."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK let's break this down to why Batman and Robin failed so miserably.\n\n10. Batman: Clooney isn't that bad, but it would have helped if he played the character as more brooding and darker.\n\n9. Robin: Chris Odonnel is too old and too tall for this part. Dick Grayson was never this immature in the comics.\n\n8. Batgirl: The character had no reason for being in this movie, it was as if they finished writing it (writing?) and someone said let's put batgirl in this, just...add her in tagging along after the heroes. And she's not Alfred's neice, she's Commisioner Gordon's daughter. (Hey Joel, try reading a comic before you make a movie based on that comic)\n\n7. Mr. Freeze: Arnold wasn't that bad, but let's face it, hundreds of one-liner-cold-puns will kill anyone's career.\n\n6. Poison Ivy: Uma I thought could act, but this role was so ridiculous, and so were her outfits, they looked like they came right out of the 60's. And when she rose (or grew) from the ground and immediatley knew what forign chemicals were running thru her system was laughable.\n\n5. Bane: Let's see, in the comic he is a veritable Dr. Moriarty to Batman's Sherlock Holmes, in the movie he was some dumb shmuck, (like the people who paid to see this) Jeep Swenson (R.I.P.) looks too bulky for the part, Arnold would have been much better in this role.\n\n4. The soundtrack: what soundtrack, they spent all their money on stars and special effects so they just used Goldenthal's soundtrack from Batman Forever.\n\n3. Alfred: Was he dying from sickness, or just trying to die. Since when would he know how to program his brain algorithms into the batcomputer, how would he know her exact measurements, and if he knew Batgirl was going to discover the secret, why not just tell her.\n\n2. The production: THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF IT. All the stunts looked fake, especially at the start when robin burst thru the window on his motorcycle and it just...floats to the ground. By the way how many times are we going to see a superhero drop in thru a skylight.\n\n1. Joel Shumacher: he said Batman should be over his grief of the death of his parents and therefore a little more light hearted ... of course if BATMAN ever was over that, he would stop being BATMAN, that's the only reason he does what he does is because of his grief.\n\nGotham City has become such a colorful and happy place to live now. I swear I was expecting Aunt Harriett Cooper to pop out someplace in the mansion and offer them milk and cookies. Every few minutes, I found myself looking away and saying \"I...I can't belive it's this bad.\" When BATMAN came out, it was great, when RETURNS came out,I had mixed feelings about it, when FOREVER came out I thought it made RETURNS look so good by comparison, now AND ROBIN comes out and it actually makes FOREVER look good. Let's just hope that WB learns their lesson...But I doubt it."

Chris O'Donnell is terrible as usual as Robin. He tries to come off as a cool guy, but seems like a typical nerdy sidekick with cheesy lines. Alicia Silverstone is wasted as Batgirl, and does very little but try to look really good. These are the heroes, but the villains are even worse.\n\nUma Thurman gives one of the worst performances in history as Poison ivy. She seems drunk the whole time and is very bizarre and unattractive. Arnold Schwarzeneggar is almost as bad as Mr. Freeze. He has more cheesy lines than a thirty-year-old Drivers-Ed video. The plot itself is repetitive and ridiculous, and it is filled with corny jokes and false urgency.

My one regret is how badly Alicia Silverstone was treated on set and by the press, and that so much of her story was cut. I like Keaton's batman, and Kilmer's batman, Bale and Pattison too.
