        "review_detailed_main": "THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE / (1999) **\n\nJohnny Depp plays a NASA astronaut named Spencer Armacost who, while on a space mission, losses contact with Earth for two minutes. He and his colleague, Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes), return home to their spouses, Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) and Natalie Streck (Donna Murphy). Bizarre episodes begin to occur with Alex, leaving Jillian suspicious of her husband's condition. As her husband's strange behavior increases, Jillian begins to question what really happened in those 120 seconds.\n\n\"The Astronaut's Wife,\" written and directed by Rand Ravich, poorly executes good ideas. We have imaginative and potentially suspenseful ideas with this film's concepts behind such happenings in two minutes as Spencer and Alex are in galactic boundaries. The gradual increase in Spencer's unusual behavior depicts effective suspense-but thorough introduction of the characters does not take place, nor do we witness the key events in which the rest of the move hinges upon. Consequently, \"The Astronaut's Wife\" does not work.\n\nThe film's first act is full of incidences, characters, and subplots. Clearly too many things happen too early in the story. Within the first thirty minutes the production attempts to develop two separate relationships, shows us the atmosphere of a teacher's workplace, something bizarre transpires out of earth's orbit, a decision is made to resign and move to New York, a suicide takes place, a character mysteriously dies, and probably more. I just couldn't follow the plot.\n\nI liked the eerie, supernatural overtones located throughout the production. The film is smart to reveal the right amounts of information at the precise time. There is also a certain style to \"The Astronaut's Wife,\" containing an elusive mood, a weirdly intriguing design, and some tense and unusual camera angles. The movie becomes more interesting as we reach the closing.\n\nCharlize Theron has been in a lot of movies lately, but \"The Astronaut's Wife\" is her first leading role. She seems to have come out of left field in 1997 with the comedy \"Trail and Error.\" Afterwards, she contributed larger performances in \"The Devil's Advocate,\" \"Celebrity,\" \"Mighty Joe Young,\" and most recently \"The Cider House Rules,\" and \"Reindeer Games.\" Her role in \"The Astronaut's Wife\" is a little more complex than her past credits, excluding her enticing and believable acting job in \"The Devil's Advocate.\" She presents the traumatized Jillian Armacost with the perfect blend of zest and tragic confusion.\n\nDepp and Theron conjure a chemistry-rich couple. The movie very clearly takes Jillian's point of view instead of allowing us to know mysteries with Spencer. This stays consistent and focused, but sometimes leaves us pondering about unexplained events.\n\n\"The Astronaut's Wife\" builds for an awe-inducing conclusion through revealing and intriguing dialogue and an omnipresent undertone. The film suggests a form of extraterrestrial is behind the deaths of several characters as well as the strange behavior of Spencer, but we learn the truth only in the end. Call \"The Astronaut's Wife\" an unusual \"The X Files\" episode featuring a cliffhanger conclusion and a supernatural climax. The movie must have appeared really exciting on script. If only more capable filmmakers would have claimed this production we may have had a real winner. Instead audiences feel disappointment and failure, potential is wasted and originality is underscored"

        "review_detailed_main": "It deals with a space shuttle in orbit and two astronauts leave their spacecraft to carry out a routine mission : to repair a damaged satellite when there's an explosion , later on they forced to go back Earth after NASA loses contact for two mysterious minutes . Astronauts Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) and Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) were outside the spacecraft when the surprising incident happened. But they aren't the same guys after they go back from a nearly fatal accident . Armacost seems to be unaffected ; however , his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron) , a Florida school teacher , feels weird activities and subtle changes in him . Over time , Armacost's unsettling mistress Jillian to be afraid of his strange behaviour . As his obsession knows no bounds and he becomes increasingly violent , putting Jillian's life in danger . As he begins to threaten her with possesive and violent acts . Egged on by a previous NASA employee (Joe Morton) , the fiercely strongwilled woman starts to believe that her husband is something else . Jillian also learns that she is pregnant , as time progresses she begins to feel like the lives inside of her are not of this world . Look at this \"man\" and Beware! There is nothing human about him except his desires! See The Thing Without A Face . How well do you know the one you love? Imagine the face of terror is the one you love . Witness the birth of pure evil.\n\nLong in atmosphere but short on momentum and plot , the meandering script is fleshed out by nuanced performances . Ravich's decent filmmaking fills the antiseptic interiors of the marriage's Manhattan designer apartment with a terrifying menace , but regrettably the slow-burn intrigue is extinguished when too much is revealed at just the wrong moment . The picture blends Sci-fi/horror themes , taking parts here and there of extraterrestrial invasion as \u00a8Species\u00a8 adding terrifying moments , as Charlize Teron is also very much like her beleagured wife in \u00a8The devil's advocate\u00a8since everyone seems to think Jillian's nuts , as well as things get very \u00a8Rosemary's Baby\u00a8 style . Charlize Theron gives a passable acting as a disturbing woman who becomes pregnant with twins from a strange astronaut , holding doubts if carrying extraterrestrial parasites , she is by turns , sympathetically unhinged and vulnerable . While Johnny Depp is really creepy and disturbing as an astronaut with dark purports. As Johnny Depp is more credible in quirky characters in quirky films .Remaining support cast is pretty good , such as Nick Cassavetes , Donna Murphy , Clea Duvall , Samantha Eggar , Tom Noonan , Gary Grubbs , Blair Brown , among others .\n\nIt contains a moving and nail-biting musical score by George S. Clinton with plenty of thrilling and suspenseful moments . As well as colorful and adequate cinematography by recently deceased Allen Daviau . The motion picture was professionally made by Rand Ravich , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps . This is his only film but he has written/produced TV series as Crisis , Second chance , Time tunnel and Life . Rating : 5.5/10 . Passable and acceptable Science-Fiction/Horror movie"

They are put in a quiet space, so you have time to think about what happened (or did not happen) and you call it dull. Do you think that they would intentionally make a bad movie?\n\nInterestingly enough the actors, including Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, for better or worse have made some memorable movies.

Leads Depp and Theron are very convincing in their roles and they are backed by a very competent supporting cast led by the always reliable Joe Morton (T2, Speed, Bounce, Paycheck, Smallville). The special effects and cinematography are well done and the pacing and building of suspense entice the viewer to unravel the mystery along with the protagonist. Unfortunately the revelation doesn't quite live up to the buildup leaving the viewer more than a little dissatisfied. Despite the letdown I still recommend this movie on the strength of the performances and on the fact that is a rare hybrid of the science fiction and thriller genres. 7/10."

        "review_title": "An insult",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is scene in this movie in which a stroke is medically referred to as \"a severe insult to the brain\". A line which describes this entire film far better than any reviewer possibly could.\n\nObviously influenced by The X-Files, the first thing that strikes the viewer is the invasive use of tense mood music. If the Astronaut's Wife is opening a fridge there is a string quartet behind anxiously heralding a danger which subsequently doesn't exist. In a TV show like The X-Files it's a trick used to great affect because it's stylistic and the shows exhibit a degree of wit and imagination that relieve us from the pointless tension. Neither of those saving graces feature in this film.\n\nThe characters are poorly drawn, we're constantly told Spencer (The Astronaut) has changed since his last mission into space. We need to be told this so often because we're deprived of witnessing very much of his prior personality. And throughout the story Jillian (The Wife) never functions as anything more than a paranoid wreck, even before she suspects that something is really wrong.\n\nFans of Depp and Theron will be as disappointed as the rest of us. Johnny's flyboy astronaut is utterly out of place since we all know true spacemen are stiff and boring scientists, yet this guy is exhuberant like the barnstorming 1950's test pilots that never really existed. God only knows what hewas thinking with this part. And Charlize, throughout she never lifts above the catatonic. Literally, and I mean this folks, there is nothing more to her performance than the bags under her eyes and hers is the lead character, our heroine for crying out loud! That's beyond appalling.\n\nAs a thriller there is never a comfort break in this pretentious sci-fi flick that asks us to care for a character it's impossible engage with. It's non-stop, we're expected to be in the edge of our seat with every single scene, and if the plot doesn't supply the drama a 'bus' (that's the Hollywood term for a false shock) will. They are countless, and soon annoying. The same can be said for the way The Wife is mysteriously at the front of every crowd during key moments of action, which is one of the other cheap dramatic tricks overused by a really really bad director.\n\nUntil recently writer/director Rand Ravich hadn't been in charge of a film since this 1999 failure, you'll know why.\n\nFifteen years ago this was the kind of film that made a frustrated Quentin Tarantino decide he really needed to begin making his own.\n\nIt's diabolical."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to say, I always enjoy Johnny Depp's work. He is a chameleon; an actor who can take literally any role, who can step outside the boundaries of typecasting. And, his performance in this film is in no way weaker than any other character; it is merely a role that not many are likely to recall when asked about him. The film builds decently enough. Depp and Theron play a married couple, and a significant element of stress begins to grow on Theron following Depp's events during an orbital assignment given to his character.\n\nI also like Charlize Theron; my one nitpick is how she seems to always find her way into these 'tormented woman' roles, like in the Devil's Advocate. Her skills are not necessarily hindered by this repetitiveness; I just find it a redundancy she needs to work beyond. Those of you watching this film for a horror-themed thriller are going to be mostly put off. This film really does not rely to such an extent the horror mechanisms; rather it builds the tension through a number of strictly dialogue scenes, using the plot to intrigue rather than scare tactics.\n\nThe ending - quite literally, the last twenty minutes, is the only place you're likely to see what may be called horror. I will not give away what happens here; you have to watch it and see. All I will say is that the ending left me anticipating more. That said, my overall opinion is this movie is satisfactory at best, not a true stand out in the annals of cinema history, but certainly not one of the poorest examples of the profession."

Makes you tense like any thriller should, makes you wait what turns out. Some compare it to Rosemary's baby but from the space, although I think I know where this comparison comes from, I strongly disagree. And I need to add that Astronaut's Wife in my opinion is a far more entertaining movie to watch than Rosemary's baby. Overall pleasant way to spend your time..

Charlize Theron gave a better performance than her Devil's advocate role although they had the same criteria, the disturbed wife. But her genuine agonizing performance distinguished her in this movie.\n\nI noticed the music was a major pillar in this movie, it was like another main character in this movie, the editing was great also especially the scene in the subway. The story was an original also, it had good turn ups and twists.\n\nThe movie had all the right elements in general and it certainly doesn't deserve a 4.7 on the imdb. I think the voters were greatly disappointed after seeing all those good elements destroyed by the cheesy and typical ending that only producers could have had a part with, in order to make another sequel.\n\nThe ending by all means was bad, it destroyed the originality of the story and the tension build up. I give it an 7.5 for all the good elements, it would reached a 9.0 if the ending was different."

Very predicable, a weak plot supported by poor scripting, performance done way below the capabilities of the actors, and I'm not sure whether or not there was a director on the set.

Its not so much the acting in this film that make it good, its more the cinematography and the feel and flavour the director gave to the film. There are some parts which after the film has ended still seem to be unexplained, or clearly don't make sense. Unfortunately they have paved the way for a sequel- although I think that would be a very bad idea.

Depp never utters one line of sincere dialogue in the entire movie. Instead he wanders around like a zombie stopping every once in a while to say something oh so romantic to his wife.\n\nTheron fares even worse. One moment she is playing the whimpering wife; the next she is barking out orders. (\"Then take me to someone who can!\" is one of the worst lines of dialogue I have ever heard.) It would be nice to blame all of Theron's ineptness in this movie to bad writing and directing, but I fear there is another reason. Behind that incredible beauty is a woman who simply doesn't know how to act.\n\nI could go on blasting this movie, but why bother? Just remember this fair warning: Next time you're in the video store and you see this movie on the shelf, don't be fooled. You may really like science fiction, you may love Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, but leave this turkey on the shelf. Let it slowly decompose and go back to wherever it came from."

I can look back at my thoughts of many \"sci-fi\" flicks, and I know I tend to enjoy the more atmospheric, narrative pictures better than the in-your-face special effects blockbusters.\n\nI disagree with many of the other people here who left comments, because I feel this movie is definitely worth viewing. However, if you are looking for a lot of explosions and fancy alien makeup and special effects, look somewhere else.\n\nThe only thing I can really say I wanted more from was the ending. Not only did it leave a terrible taste in my mouth, it also left me confused and a bit unsatisfied. The plans of these other-worldly creatures were never explained to us. Sequel, perhaps?"

I've seen it several times and just can't understand the panning by critics, who turn a pretty malignant turn of phrase without referring to the cinematic qualities of the film.\n\nIt's super glamorous Depp and Theron, therefore it can't be any good, right?\n\nBloody wrong! They both act rings around the critics, which goes to show that many of them come to watching flicks with preconceptions, which get in the way of actually seeing what's going on on the screen.\n\nAnd yep, Depp and Theron are super lookers here, still in their relative youth, but the subtle under acting does both huge credit. How many actors of the Streep and Hanks school of histrionics could survive the endless close ups and acquit themselves as brilliantly as these two smouldering actors do here? I think the critics are just jealous ugly people, who won't give a good looking star with mega acting chops the time of day.\n\nThe story is not ludicrous, as a Sci-fi premise the plotline of astronauts \"being changed\" by what they \"experience\" in space is perfectly sound, and has much potential for different types of change. Alien possession premises have been handled much less skillfully than they are here. The ending is a perfectly cohesive \"resolution\" narratively and dramatically.\n\nNor is the pace too slow. It takes its time to build the climax, the viewer being \"in the picture\" much earlier than Theron's character, which is a perfectly acceptable, indeed a time-honoured dramatic device since Greek drama in the whole of western theatrical tradition.\n\nCritics rubbishing the movie cos Nick Cassavetes is in it and Theron has a haircut like Mia Farrow's in Rosemary's Baby just shows how desperate some people are to score a clever sound byte. There may very well be an intertextual relationship thematically between that movie and this one, but FHS engage with its elements and build a respectable critical argument instead of just doing smart alec throwaways.\n\nThe film is also a visual treat in every way, classy settings, wardrobe, camera angles etc. The music is appropriately and suggestively sinister.\n\nA great flick to revisit on a slow Friday night at home. Forget the critical poison and enjoy it without shame.\n\nWatching it and relishing it again soon."

Largely this was based on the fact that every nationally published reviewer I read stated that THEY expected not to like the film because it was not screened for the press.\n\nOnce again I learn not to listen to the press.\n\nIs \"The Astronaut's Wife\" a shoe-in for an Oscar? No. Is it a groundbreaking new film? No. What it is is a very visually stunning glimpse into two characters masterfully portrayed by Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron.\n\nJohnny Depp has recently been acknowledged as what he is: arguably the best character actor of his generation. Charlize Theron again shines as the wife who slowly allows herself to realize that something is terribly, terribly wrong with what is going on (see \"The Devil's Advocate\"). Both actors feed of the others talent and energy to give us, the viewers, a singularly unique look into the lives of two people turned upside-down.\n\nHowever the real star here is the director, Rand Ravich. This first-time director has been accused by some of creating a film that is 95% setup and 5% payoff. I disagree. I will agree that the film is a slow-burn, but allow yourself to be lost in the images and the careful way that Ravich frames every scene. Without ruining any of the plot, pay particular attention to the love scene where the camera takes the audience literally from side to side of the couple. From a purely visual standpoint, \"The Astronaut's Wife\" is a winner."

        "review_detailed_main": "*During the scene where the rocket launches in \"The Astronaut's Wife\" it cuts from stock footage of a space launch to a very artificial shot of the Earth accompanied by a several children's voices shouting the word \"pineapples\". It turns out to be a transition to a classroom full of schoolchildren naming fruit from around the country to tie in with Johnny Depp calling Charlize Theron a peach. This is the most unintentionally funny and memorable part of the entire film.\n\nThis movie was made in 1999 when Charlize Theron's acting career was starting to takeoff and Jonny Depp's was still coming out of a deep freeze. Together they are the Armacosts, he is a southern sounding pilot turned astronaut and she is the mild mannered school teacher and of course \"The Astronaut's Wife\". They have the exact same haircut. Jillian Armacost likes to watch \"Penny Serenade\" with her husband to get in the mood. Oh, and she has a sister. Now you know everything about the lead characters that a person who watched the movie would know.\n\nAs anyone who watched the preview that played constantly on TV in the summer of 1999 will remember, the plot concerns Johnny Depp coming back from a space shuttle mission infected with an alien parasite and nobody believes in and impregnates Charlize Theron with alien twins who watches a video tape of Joe Morton saying he may have been killed by Depp. In the trailer it took about a minute to tell, but in the movie some of these things are supposed to be a surprise. The result is a very boring drawn out \"suspense\" during which we are supposed to keep \"guessing\" whether Depp is or isn't infected with an alien parasite. Just like with \"Double Jeopardy\" (also 1999) the trailer blew all the plot twists so there's no reason to watch the movie.\n\nI only watched because I'm terminally curious and as usually I got what I paid for. The story is (as was it was popular to point out at the time) as rip-off of \"Rosemary's Baby\" (minus the funny satanic cult) as was Theron's much better 1997 thriller \"The Devil's Advocate\" (with funny satanists). The idea of impending motherhood never really seems concrete just like the \"change\" in Depp's character doesn't either. The trailer hyped up the idea that Jillian is the only one who notices a change in her husband upon his return but in the actual film there isn't a change to notice. Depp's character is underwritten, hardly 2 dimensional. He's the same until Theron suddenly accuses him of being different. The idea that Depp is an astronaut is equally abstract as the only space footage is a dream sequence and as far as I remember they didn't even spend the money to show him in a space suit.\n\nRand Ravich is a weak writer at best and his directing in this film thoroughly justifies it being his only feature length movie. Ravich posed one interesting visual idea with Theron standing in front of a screen showing a video from Depp's landing shuttle after the space accident. It would have been worthy of Nicolas Roeg if it hadn't been ruined by clumsy cutting. In keeping with this all the photography is slapdash and the color is universally hideous. I think the only reason anyone called it \"stylish\" is because the apartment where the Armacosts live is a sterile glass lined set that few of us could actually afford to live in and that none of us are obsessive enough to keep clean.\n\nYou can skip this one without feeling at all bad about it. The only reason there are two stars instead of one is because I laughed when the kids said pineapples."

I remember cringing at some of the dialogue a talented actor like Depp was saying!! I still didn't love it this time around, but I did think it was slightly better than I remembered.\n\nI can't fault Depp wanting to try something different each time he made a movie. In fact he should have been applauded for it. But here he is saying some of the most cliched and predictable dialogue, when his career thus far was anything but predictable. Likewise Charline Theron, she is given some awful lines to say. There is a scene where she is contemplating something, and she is talking to herself, and it's awful.\n\nThere is some dodgy cgi and pacing issues too, but it wasn't all bad!! I did like the ending for one thing. I'm surprised I didn't remember it. Overall it is not all bad, but it misses the mark.\n\nThe Astronauts Wife grossed $10 million dollars at the domestic box office failing to land a place on highest 100 grossing movie of the year list."

Anyway a year has passed. What did I think of the film. I actually enjoyed it. I knew all the critics panned it, but I decided to go see it. Now then, if you expect this film to be some kind of SFX extravaganza, you're wrong. There are hardly any special effects in the film(except towards the end....but I don't want to give away the ending.......). This is a film that strives more on story than effects. Anyway, I thought the film grew kinda slow towards the middle, but soon it picked up, as pieces to the puzzle of what happened to Johnny Depp's character started to fall into place. Allen Daviau's work on the film was great. I loved the subway sequence in the film. I thought that was beautifuly photographed. Anyway, once the film gets toward its ending, that's when I got excited. I wouldn't mind seeing this film again on video in the near future. It did have its flaws, but in the end, it delivered its story and I walked out of the theatre happy, knowing I got my money's worth."

If there was, it was missed. I could not seem to take this movie seriously at all. I was fortunate to see it in a special sneak preview, and only one person out of my group of 15 liked it. Now, I have disagreed with people on movies before, but I was not that one person. I could not stand this movie. Half way through the movie, I wanted to leave. This is not the fault of the actors. Hell, Johnny Depp is an awesome actor, but even he could not bring life to a tasteless, bland charecter like the one that he was given. I found the ending to be typical and cliche, and the story itself was nothing new. Do yourself a favor, and see something else. But this is only my opinion."

As long as this event is left unexplained, the audience is kept in the dark as to how the story will evolve. This is a blissful state of ignorance. It's the same kind of Sci-Fi as \"2001, A Space Odyssey\". Not in terms of the plot, but how the space is used solely to grasp the mystery and the incomprehensible and bring it to the screen. When it's revealed what actually happened to the astronaut, the movie becomes weaker, but doesn't fall apart completely."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you've seen ROSEMARY'S BABY, don't watch this film. If you haven't seen ROSEMARY'S BABY, still don't watch this film. For THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE is one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a good while, a silly, extraordinarily clich\u00e9d and terribly over-obvious exercise in supposed paranoia, mystery and ultimately, horror. It's one of those films where the director only has this one film on his C.V., and from the very beginning it's clear he's totally out of his depth.\n\nCharlize Theron is cast in the Mia Farrow role \u2013 and made up to look just like her \u2013 but proves to be nowhere near as talented. It doesn't help that her character is bland and dull, but Theron herself must take a lot of the blame for creating such an unsympathetic heroine. Her acting is terrible, and it's near impossible to reconcile this boring, wooden actress with the lady who won an Oscar for playing a serial killer in MONSTER.\n\nThe oh-so-slow story involves Johnny Depp going 'missing' in space for a couple of minutes \u2013 and returning to Earth a changed man. Of course, it takes his supposedly loving wife a full hour and a half for her to realise this, at which point the ending arrives. It's fair to say that anybody familiar at all with this type of film will be easily able to guess what's going to happen at the end \u2013 and sure enough, I was right.\n\nDepp himself appears to be sleepwalking through his part. You can see why he was drawn to the role \u2013 it's another chance for him to be weird and clinical \u2013 but there's absolutely nothing of interest from him throughout the movie and as a supposedly scary character he's a total failure. The only decent turn comes from the underrated Joe Morton, who bags the few interesting segments in the entire film (and they don't even bother giving him a send-off). Samantha Eggar and Tom Noonan get bit parts while the intensely irritating Clea DuVall bags a meatier role. Avoid."

Unfortunately for The Astronaut's Wife, the potential makings of a great horror/sci-fi/mystery/thriller became more of a long, drawn out I don't really know what kind of movie this is. As the DVD case label says, this is a thriller. But as advertised and as the trailer suggests, all of the action is already captured on the previews before one even sees the movie. This thriller with a sci-fi element tossed in is more of a slow moving horror movie or psychological thriller with Johnny Depp doing a decent job of acting here. The edge and tension is maintained in the far or deep background, but the pacing and the various genre elements don't gel in this movie. The movie might have been better served if the whole sci fi scenario had been a red-herring. Six out of Ten Stars."

Different side to Johnnys usual portrayed characters which was great to see a different side to him. All in all I'd give the movie a 7/10.

I'm doing it because I think Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp make a sexy couple, and if it hadn't been for them, you could have seen this as a USA channel made for TV movie. This film not only BOMBED at the box office, but even with video rentals, it still hasn't made back what it cost to make the film.\n\nDepp plays an astronaut named Spencer who, along with his partner, are lost in space for two minutes when they are out of contact with the ground. Depp's partner dies a violent death once back on earth, and his wife commits suicide. I can't believe a huge Broadway star like Donna Murphy put whatever that thing was, a radio (I think) between her legs - did she think no one would see this? Anyway, there's Charlize with this Mia hairdo - then Spencer makes love to her and he's so rough, it hurts ... Well, you can take it from there. You don't even have to watch the rest of the film.\n\nDepp apparently uses the images of certain people sometimes to help him with a role - I think his image here is the King himself. Clean shaven, a little more filled out than we're used to, and with those smoldering eyes and that twang in his voice, Depp is to die for. But he really doesn't do much. The acting burden is on Charlize, who looks exquisite (lots of closeups of her lips) and acts her role very well, creating a sympathetic character. But one who, alas, you already know too much about if you've ever seen \"Rosemary's Baby.\" Nine years later, these actors have gone on to bigger and better things. Remember the next time you see one of them in a movie - they paid their dues."

The movie is clearly a thriller but the movie does never gets tense and lacks in good thriller moments.\n\nThe movie has a good and tense mysterious atmosphere at first but the movie does nothing further to exploit this after its opening. For too long nothing really happens in the movie, also because the husband in fact really isn't acting that weird and suspicious as before the accident in space. Certainly not enough to become afraid of him and not even the ending of the movie can really change this.\n\nThe reason that this movie also doesn't work is because the motivations aren't clear. It makes the entire story and movie feel rather pointless and makes it unclear. Also when the wife learns that her husband is possibly an alien, she doesn't investigate but she is in constant denial. Is it tense and interesting to watch a character who is in constant denial? Of course it's not. Not even for a paranoid kind of atmosphere also because we as the viewer already know that something happened and went wrong with the husband. It all makes the movie quite ridicules to watch, though it's definitely a professionally made movie with some good acting in it.\n\nWe get to see Johnny Depp in a role and movie we normally wouldn't see him play. It seemed like Johnny wanted to play a villain for a change. He does this will and his acting deserved a better script to go with it. Charlize Theron also shows her skills, in a movie before her real years of fame and awards. There also are some good supporting actors in some much smaller roles, such as Clea DuVall, Gary Grubbs, Joe Morton and actor turned director Nick Cassavetes.\n\nThe movie is a typical genre movie and I was happy and satisfied enough to give this movie an 6 out of 10 rating but then came the ending. What an horrible and totally weak ending it was! It downgraded the movie and even made it more ridicules than it already was.\n\nNo wonder Rand Ravich never directed or wrote a theatrical movie ever since.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

One needs only to have a very vivid imagination and the ability to enjoy the multifaceted ability of Johnny Depp, which some comment on him being 'wooden' or 'his worst acting yet' or 'not a bad boy', is a good movie.\n\nI was able to relate, to a degree, to Johnny's character, for I dated a guy who was very much like Commander Spencer Armacost. Additionally, it was very easy then to understand Charlize Theron's character, Jillian Armacost. That is why I liked this movie....I could relate to the two major characters.\n\nA few things left me (and perhaps others) in the dark:\n\n1) The outer space shots did not make much sense. Just a little more information might have helped us understand the alien. It not clear why it (or they) is trying to take over earth. Is it for taking over the earth or the space program or both.\n\n2) Captain Alex Streck, Nick Cassavetes, is also taken over by an alien in space. Though it is not quite understood why he went through such physical trauma and Spencer did not.\n\n3) Joe Morton, who plays Sherman Reese, the NASA Representative, does an okay job playing his character. Again, this movie does not explain, to any degree of satisfaction, what Mr. Reese knows.\n\n4) The character of Nan, Jillian's sister, seems to have no reason for being in the movie. Except a useless filler used in detergents?\n\n5) I found it interesting that an old radio, in the Armacost's apartment was used as the main 'stereo' system.....I could go on abit about the details....but no need to be that picky.\n\nBravo on the cinematography, to an extent! The best edited scene, in my opinion, is when Spencer kisses Jillian at the company party in New York. They are against a wall..the camera tilts, until we see the characters lying prone and we see them on their bed, at home of course. Very well done. It made me dizzy in the theater.\n\nIf you can get into the main characters and put yourself in the right mindset for this movie, it will be an interesting view. But, if you are looking for a BIG SCARE this is not the film. The fear is very subtle."

There is an explosion and a two minute radio blackout where contact is lost with NASA. The two astronauts return home to their wives but they seem different. One of them dies and his wife later commits suicide.\n\nJillian (Charlize Theron) a teacher slowly realises that something is not quite right with her husband Spencer (Johnny Depp.) I think it is the way he suddenly materialises out of nowhere. Jillian falls pregnant with twins and an ex NASA employee warns her that something happened to the two astronauts in space. He also tells her that the other astronaut's wife was also pregnant with twins.\n\nRand Ravich does an abysmal job as writer and director. The film is too derivative. Theron is too bland, Depp is just too sinister like John Cassavetes was in Rosemary's Baby."

The directing is really good. The quick shots the slow motion, it's just really well used. The acting was not the greatest, but it came really close. Charlize Theron is just so beautiful and charismatic you can't help it but you feel so sorry for her, for what she's going through. Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor. He's so convincing as the wonderful husband and later as the evil and cruel...um..alien if you may call it.He just owns the screen and keeps you glued to it for the whole movie. The movie itself is all about subtlety, all about the little thing you have to pay attention to fully understand the movie."

There is the usual gratuitous sex scene and the whole thing plods on to its conclusion without making any impression other than disappointment. If Hollywood wants to do a remake of this tale, then lets have Professor Quatermass, the hapless Victor Caroon and the rest of the original characters back, together with a good screenwriter, a good director, an editor with a sense of pace and full credit to the originator of the story - Nigel Kneale!"

Every single scene is in some architecturally interesting room so that Ravich can shoot from different angles. The main characters even live in one of those impossibly expensive New York City apartments that we've come to expect from over-produced films.\n\nTheron is adequate in the lead role, but Johnny Depp is stiff as a board and seems to wish he was anywhere else than filming this movie.

It was worth watching, gave some food for thought, yet failed to thrill at any point.

In several places this feels more like a \" Woman who doesn`t want a baby by her husband \" type of plot that you see in many TVMs , so be warned that if you`re expecting a science fiction horror film like I was you`re going to be very disappointed .\n\nOn a technical front THE ASTRONAUT`S WIFE isn`t a total failure because the editing and cinematography are very much above average , though the acting is very wooden and Johnny Depp is not bad guy material , and as I said there`s very little that will appeal to someone expecting a few frights"

It's very suspenseful in parts (too few though) but severely lacking in dialogue and good acting in others. It's hard to judge this film because for long periods at a time you are either being bored by it or being thrilled by it. This is mainly due to the screenplay which seemed to have been written without much thought and due to the acting which centers around Charlize Theron. She is new to big roles such as this and it seemed to take a while for her to get into as it appeared that she was rather uncomfortable in some scenes. However, for the last hour or so she was quite good as she allowed the audience to sympathize with her and hold hope for her character. Overall, I thought this was too long for the quite limited storyline but the story was interesting enough to watch through and not be bored by the end."

He is good and interesting only in movies that had good directors (and even there his partners steal the show). And in badly directed and badly scripted movies he can't do anything at all.\n\nThe director is so bad that he doesn't even know how to work with actors, instead he just lets them do \"their things\" expecting them to pull the script out. As a result, the black NASA guy overacts and improvises a lot, Charlize Theron does too much in her role of scared whiny wife, and Johnny Depp does nothing at all, except twisting his jaw and twirling his eyebrows once in a while. But you can't really blame them as they probably had no idea what their characters were about and where the director wanted movie to go to.\n\nAnd there was really nothing to work with as the story is shallow, the dialogs are childish and the characters are unappealing (or the actors made them so). Other aspects of director work are bad too: camera movement is often illogical, changing pace all the time. Some scenes are too slow, other are too fast and overedited. Introducing alien CGI at the end of the movie is damaging to the mood of the film.\n\nIt could have been such a nice horror movie with every possible intelligent underline there is. A sci-fi story about mankind trying to deal with something beyond comprehension, a metaphor on alienation and abuse among married couples, even a psycho drama about a mentally ill character (the wife) who doesn't know where her illusions end and the reality begins. The movie opened all those themes but deals effectively with none. It's not even intriguing enough to provoke the viewer to draw his own conclusions.\n\nThe only conclusion I drew from the movie is (bad joke ahead): don't play with electricity near water."

Rand Ravich's direction is inventive (notice the \"sex scene\") and unconventional; he has a knack for finding the little detail that matters in almost every scene and then drawing your attention to it (though he does succumb to some regrettable \"false scares\"). Johnny Depp is disappointingly bland and unmenacing as \"the astronaut\", but Charlize Theron is utterly captivating as his wife; of course with such breathtaking beauty it's easy for her to capture the camera's attention, but she's also expressive enough to hold it.

Then again, I had also seen the trailer quite a few times and that made the film look very interesting. So, I ended up renting it despite all the reviews (and hey, as a true film fan I really don't care what other people say, I like to form my own opinions about films).\n\nThe trailer definitely promised too much, and the negative reviews were too negative. I actually thought that the film was quite interesting, although it could have been more suspenseful. The acting was okay, but the production design (ultra modern, it seems) created a distance between me as a viewer and the characters. With such cold production design, how am I able to see the warmth in Charlize Theron's character? If the makers of the film tried to set her warmth off against the cold design it didn't work. While the p.d. worked for Depp's character it certainly let Theron's down.\n\nHowever, in the end I quite liked the film, even though it is very far from a masterpiece and the ending certainly wasn't great.

Charlize Theron is almost the whole show as Jillian Armacost, a second grade teacher and the wife to astronaut Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp). One of his space missions appears to go very bad; although he and his comrade (Nick Cassavetes) return and seem to be fine, the indications that all is NOT alright soon start occurring. Then Jillian becomes increasingly unhinged by her husbands' out-of-character behavior.\n\nRavichs' script does have some decent ideas in it, but he probably should have handed it off to a more seasoned filmmaker. As it is, this is largely a very serious film that DOES have its moments, but it's a long, drawn-out narrative that puts a LOT of set-up into an underwhelming finale. This viewer can see how others find this film disappointing. It's a waste of an effectively somber mood and a good score by George S. Clinton.\n\nTheron is the main reason to watch. As she had previously proved in \"The Devils' Advocate\", she has substance to go with her sex appeal and can easily add gravitas to her material. Depp is fine, starting out subtly and making it more and more clear that he's not who he appears to be. They're surrounded by capable & familiar supporting players, with Joe Morton a standout as an exposition provider who's come somewhat unglued. Clea DuVall, Donna Murphy, Samantha Eggar, Gary Grubbs, Blair Brown, Tom Noonan, and Tom O'Brien also appear.\n\nThis one could be chalked up as a \"nice try, but no cigar\" type of story. It had some potential - and is technically well-made - but it leaves the viewer less than completely satisfied.\n\nFive out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a film that I vaguely remember coming out, but I didn't see it until years later. I would have been 12 years old in 1999. I would be unable to drive so unless it caught my attention to rent, it went unnoticed. This was watched since it was in the Horror Show Guide encyclopedia that I'm working through. My rewatch was done with my wife, Jaime, for our podcast, Depp Dive: A Depper Look at Johnny's Feature Filmography.\n\nSynopsis: after an explosion in space and after a two-minute radio-out period, two astronauts return home to their wives. They're not quite the same as they were though.\n\nWe start this by getting to know our main couple. One of the astronauts from the synopsis is Commander Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp, and he's married to an elementary school teacher, Jillian (Charlize Theron). He is about to go on a mission into space. Jillian is proud and terrified but being strong to help steal his nerves. Spencer is going up with Capt. Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes).\n\nThings are going smoothly until a night that Jillian is cooking dinner for her and her sister, Nan (Clea DuVall). A news report catches her eye. NASA lost radio contact with the crew. They then send Sherman Reese (Joe Morton). Jillian wants more information, but they're limited to what they can share. She is taken to a room to wait with Alex's wife, Natalie (Donna Murphy). What we learn is that for 2 minutes, they lost contact and there was an explosion.\n\nThey return safe to Earth and go back to living their lives. Dr. Patraba (Samantha Eggar) and her team oversee confirming that they are healthy. All the tests are coming back healthy. As the synopsis states though, there is something off about both. The other couple seem to bicker constantly. Spencer decides he no longer wants to be a pilot, which was his dream from the beginning. He now wants to move to New York City to be an executive for an aeronautics company. We learn that this city was one he used to hate and this position is something he knows nothing about.\n\nJillian cannot prove what her fears are though. She thinks there is something off about her husband. She becomes pregnant and learns that she is having twins. She also has a history of mental illness so she is distrustful of her thoughts. It doesn't help that Natalie does something during a party that rocks everyone to the core. She has to figure out the truth and if Spencer is still truly the man she married, or did something happen during the brief time in space.\n\nThat is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that I'm glad that I gave this movie a rewatch. I knew that it has solid premises. It isn't one that is new. I've seen other films where we have an unreliable narrator, having someone who is pregnant and distrustful of things around her. This feels like it is a combination of Rosemary's Baby with Village of the Damned.\n\nWith that all set up, where I want to delve first would be in our lead character of Jillian. We learn through things with her sister and her talking to a doctor that she had a dark stretch. She was suicidal and Spencer was there for her. I do like setting that up. Nan loves him and thinks that her sister is so lucky for having met him. That helps with the tension here since it confirms that we might not be able to trust her. There is also pregnancy brain, which Jaime has acknowledged me. That also is contributing to what she thinks.\n\nWhere I then want to go is bringing back up the connection with Village of the Damned. Before getting into that more, I love that this movie confirms what is happening here. What works even better for what I've already discussed with Jillian, it takes a long stretch before its reveal. That is good to build that tension and make us consider that our lead is insane. What we're getting here is like the older movie that I've been referencing. They are in the womb, but we see that they might have powers or at least, a hive mind. That works for me.\n\nLet me then shift away from the story to discuss the acting. I thought that Theron was solid here. It is interesting that this is like her role in The Devil's Advocate. The only difference is that instead of making her a secondary character, we are following her instead. She's good at showing what is needed for the role. Depp is in a more subdued role for him. He is more brooding and shows up at different times which makes it creepy. Morton is solid as the one who needs to convince Jillian before it is too late. DuVall works in her role along with Murphy, Cassavetes, Eggar, Gary Grubbs and Tom Noonan. No one is great here, but they work for what is needed.\n\nAll that is left then is filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography was good. They do good things when Jillian gets disoriented. It make us feel that way as well. How they frame things work as well. How this is shot works. We don't get much in the way of effects. It also isn't that type of movie. I will say, there is something at the end that didn't look great and doesn't hold up now. That would be the only gripe. Other than that, the soundtrack fit what was needed.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is better than I remember it being. I don't think that it is great though still. The story is fine. An issue there is that this is a story that has been done before, just better. I still like combining elements for different things here. The acting is solid. Theron leading the way with a solid cast around her. This is made well enough. The cinematography and framing leading the way there. There are decent things with the effects, but there is CGI that doesn't hold up. This is a forgettable movie that is still solid if you like these types.\n\nMy Rating: 6.5 out of 10."

Seems like they had an idea of a space and alien thriller which they made into a movie before it took any concrete shape. What started on a promising note becomes completely lost and shallow. Johnny Depp is a complete miscast as an astronaut. His expressions are too casual for an astronaut and he seems like he has no business being in a sci-fi movie. Even the actor cast as his fellow astronaut looks more like a mercenary. Depp did manage to look a bit creepy when the mystery is out. Theron fares better and is more convincing as a 2nd grade teacher and the chemistry between herself and Depp is pretty good. The plot is wanting in substance and lacks the impact of a haunting and creepy thriller about alien invasion. It fails to make the point of how chilling an alien invasion could be or how easily progress of science could be the doom of mankind. Hell, it even fails to cut a mark about how suddenly a young happily married couple's life is devastated. It was nothing more than a waste of time watching this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Second grade teacher Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) is the dedicated wife of astronaut Commander Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) on a shuttle mission to repair a damaged satellite, Spencer and fellow astronaut and friend Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) experience a complication during the mission where contact was lost between them and mission control for two minutes. However despite the turmoil, Spencer and Alex manage to return to Earth safely. While Spencer initially seems fine, he decides much to Jillian's surprise the time has come for him to leave NASA and take a job at an aerospace company in New York, however Alex Streck suffers a fatal stroke while his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide soon thereafter. As Jillian struggles to adjust to life in New York, she soon finds herself pregnant with Spencer's twin children but over time finds herself wondering if the Spencer who returned is the one she married.\n\nThe Astronaut's Wife is a 1999 science fiction thriller written and directed by Rand Ravich. The film was a high priority for New Line Cinema who'd acquired the script, described as a modern update on Rosemary's Baby, after several other studios expressed interest in it. The film was fast tracked into production with both Depp and Theron secured for the leads within a few months of the script's acquisition. Made for $75 million, the film proved to be a box office bomb opening in ninth place behind several holdovers as The Sixth Sense continued to dominate the top spot with the film only making $19 million worldwide. Critical reception was equally dismal with many critics making unfavorable comparisons to Rosemary's Baby and criticizing the slow pace. The Astronaut's Wife on paper seems to have a solid high concept hook for a thriller, but in practice it's a turgid experience with few surprises that sleepily lumbers to a foregone conclusion.\n\nIf you boil down The Astronaut's Wife down to its most basic components, the film features a female protagonist stuck in an abusive relationship with an added sci-fi element of her husband \"no longer being who he says he is\" and there are individual moments where that does come through such as the sex scene that instigates the plot, the controlling nature of Spencer as a character, or Jillian feeling no sense of clam or peace and very much isolated from friends or family. Despite the richness of such a premise in playing for thrills, the movie makes a fatal mistake from the get go as the hour long leadup features very little of anything really happening while the film plays at a consistently dreary and dull manner. A major factor that undermines the effectiveness of this film's plot is we were never really given the opportunity to see Spencer and Jillian as a couple before he went into space (outside of a very brief and not that sexy sex scene) and when Spencer does come back from his mission there should be a sense that something is maybe a little off from how we knew him originally, but because we didn't know him originally it just doesn't hit where it should. The movie briefly comes to life with Joe Morton's Sherman Reese entering the story as a NASA scientist who tries to warn Jillian, but he's really the only part of the movie where any actual thrills come through and once he's gone so too are the thrills. At two hours the movie really feels its length because the characters are so flat and there's some excess bloat to this movie such as with Spencer developing a new jet that feels unnecessary because it has nothing to do with Jillian's pregnancy and just feels like a distraction from what we should be focusing on.\n\nThe Astronaut's Wife feels like a first draft that was rushed into production without proper thought as to how to make it actually work on screen. If you gave some additional re-writes to this material you could see a good movie coming from this premise but as is: it's a threadbare exercise that might have enough plot for a one off episode of The X-Files or Outer Limits."

I understand this was partially the point, but even so it does nothing to highlight the talents of Mr. Depp.\n\nAlthough I cannot say what the film reminds me of, it seems like something I have seen before. The plot is so obvious, it just feels derivative and stale. Has this been done before? Is this a remake and we just don't know? And why is not all that good if the plot is interesting?"

Once again playing the fragile and loyal wife, this time against the deadpan Johnny Depp in one his spookiest roles to date, Theron delivers dramatic twists and turns that will leave viewers feeling they just got off an adults only roller coaster.\n\nFor his part Depp is dead on, performing his role as a provider yet becoming increasingly distant as if he were still stuck outside his orbiter in outer space. What happened out there? Nobody, even NASA, seems to know--or at least wants to tell.\n\nDirector Rand Ravich of Candyman fame uses taut editing, mind blowing sound effects, and extreme close up camera angles to keep the suspense taut to the very end. And then the unexpected ending will leave you guessing even more. This is a great date flick when you want to grab on to your honey!\n\nWhile both Theron and Depp were to go on to even bigger roles, this one was overlooked as a near classic in the science fiction category.

While she looks absolutely fabulous through most of the movie, and her acting, I thought, was one of the best things in the film, overall it was slow and not very involving.\n\nIn the later stages of the film after she becomes pregnant Charlize Theron's face becomes very puffy and not too attractive. Reminded me of her role in the The Devil's Advocate. I wonder how they did that to her face? Then there is one scene where she and Johnny Depp are making love and there is a closeup of his hand caressing her face. I couldn't believe that he had dirty, ragged fingernails. C'mon Johnny....you can afford a manicure.\n\nAs others have mentioned there was zero chemistry between Theron and Depp. In fact, he is pretty wooden throughout the whole film. Despite other comments to the contrary, I thought Theron was not only well cast in this role, but did a terrific acting job.\n\nBut for me, the entire mood of the film from start to finish is very unsettling. I never felt comfortable watching it. But the menace that is an underlying factor throughout the film is very subtle....probably too subtle. For me the film would have had a lot more zip if it had been a little more in my face.\n\nThe cinematography is outstanding with some very creative camera-work. The cinematographer loved close ups up Charlize Theron's lips. Not a bad subject in my view. The apartment the couple live in after they move to New York is incredible. I would say the rent on something like that would be about ten or fifteen grand a month.\n\nFrankly, for me, other than the opportunity to view Ms. Theron, who I feel is the most appealing actress working today, the film was largely a waste of time and the ending was a let down."

Being sent into orbit on the space shuttle astronauts Spencer Armacost and Alex Streck, Jhonny Depp & Nick Cassavetes, are almost killed as their repairing the shuttle while in space. Being cut off for over two minutes, from the main NASA monitoring station in Huston, it was at first assumed that the two were killed in an explosion outside the shuttle. Later it was confirmed that both Spencer and Alex were all right and the shuttle mission was aborted with the two astronauts brought back to earth. Something happened up there to the two spacemen that was to come very very close to home, their wives, when they returned.\n\nBoth of the astronauts wives Jillian & Natalie, Charlize Theron & Donna Murphy, at first don't notice any change in their husbands, Spencer & Alex, appearances or conduct only that their horny as hell. At the first possible chance the returning astronauts had had they, at least in the scene between Spencer and Jillian,pounced upon their wives like wild animals in heat and brutally make love to them as if they haven't seen or touched their wives , or any other woman, in years!\n\nIt's later at an out-door party that Alex, after having a fight with Natalie, goes berserk and collapses and dies from a massive heart-attack. Later Natalie despondent over her husbands sudden death commits suicide by electrocuting herself in the bathtub while both Spencer and Jillian are there at her home visiting and trying to comfort her over her tragic loss.\n\nMoving to New York City Spencer gets a job working for Jackson McLaren's, Tom Noonan, aerospace company and things just couldn't be better for the happy young couple. It's when Jillian gets pregnant and is later told that she's to give birth to twins by her physician Dr. Patraba,Samantha Eggar, that strange things start to happen to her. This all leads Jillian to believe that the person that she's married to, Spencer Armacost, isn't the man that she thinks he is in fact he isn't a man at all!\n\nThe movie quickly moves to from where Jillian has absolutely no suspicion of her husbands sinister plans for her and her future children to where she's terrified at just the very sight of him. Being contacted by former NASA insider Sherman Reese,Tom Morton,Jillian is told that her husband is not human and that his body and mind were taken over by some unknown and unseen alien force while he and Alex were in outer space! A force that's anything but friendly towards her or any one else on earth.\n\nJillian thinking at first that Reese is some kind of nut still can't dismiss the shocking and personal information that Reese knows about her being pregnant with twins. Reese also knew that Natalie was also pregnant at the time of her suicide, that was kept from the public, and she also was to give birth to twins; how on earth could Reese have known all this unless he was telling the truth?\n\nReese trying to get all the secret and shocking information about Specer to Jillian, before he feels that he'd be silenced forever, information that proves that Spencer's not who she thinks he is from top-secret NASA documents ,that Reese smuggled out before he was fired from his job. All of Reese's efforts come to a crashing end when he's intercepted by Spencer at a local New York City subway station where the drop, or pick up, by Jillian was supposed to take place and is never seen and heard from again with Spencer, instead of the out of sight and hidden Jillian, taking off with his briefcase.\n\nGetting a key from Reese in the mail it leads Jillian to a storage building where he kept as a back up, something he learned from working at NASA, information about the truth of Spencer's origins. Jillian now more then ever is convinced that her husband is not only not of this earth but later when Jillian finds out that her sister Nan, Clea Duvall, who was last seen at her and Spencer's apartment was missing she suspected that her once \"sweet kind and loving\" husband is a murderer as well.\n\nThe movie looked like it was going to be a better then average thriller but fizzled at the end with a very convoluted final that destroyed all the tension that was building up in the film. Your left wondering what exactly the ending was all about with a complete turn around, as well as new hairdo, in what Jillian was actually trying to achieve in stopping her husband and his offspring's the evil space twins from gaining a foothold, so that they can later take control, of the US NASA space program."

        "review_detailed_main": "With Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron heading up the cast I was ready for a pretty good ride with this. I like both Depp and Theron. She, especially, is one of my favourites. In this both were cast a little bit against character, which made things even more interesting in some ways. Depp wasn't his usual quirky character that we've come to associate with him through his many collaborations with director Tim Burton. Working here with a director other than Burton, Depp's character is more serious and has more depth (and Depp actually reminded me a little bit of Matthew McConaughey in this); Spencer Armacost is mysterious rather than quirky. As Spencer's wife Jillian, Theron breaks away from her usual \"strong\" woman persona and plays a much more vulnerable character who gradually realizes that she's caught up in something out of her control. Both Depp and Theron were quite good, although perhaps the best (if limited) performance in the movie was from Joe Morton as Sherman Reese, a NASA official who figures out the mystery that's going on here, but who no one takes seriously. His limited performance in his later encounters with Jillian as he tries to explain to her what's happening was actually riveting.\n\nThe story has Spencer as an astronaut who survives some type of accident in space but was completely out of touch with NASA for two minutes. He returns to earth and everything seems normal. The question is - what happened during those two minutes? Neither Spencer nor his partner Alex (Nick Cassavetes) will talk about it. The story and the mystery unfold slowly (frankly, too slowly for my liking.) There's really very little to hold your attention through most of the first hour or so of this. Just vague hints of something being not quite right - but maybe Spencer just has a bad case of PTSD from his experience. There are surprises. Alex's unexpected death and his wife's totally unexpected suicide afterward add to the growing feeling that something's not right. Reese's re-introduction as the ex-NASA employee trying to warn Jillian probably represents the high point of the movie. The mystery (although we kind of suspected all along) is revealed and then it's a matter of seeing how it turns out. There's a spurt of energy and drama after that one hour mark as the movie picks up steam. Somehow, though, that dissipated rather quickly. The ending was - to me at least - unsatisfying; the last scene left too much up in the air.\n\nBasically, the performances are good, and there's a fair bit of potential in the story, and I appreciated seeing Depp and Theron in what were - for them - unconventional roles. The story was lacking though. It needed more meat, and it needed more tying up at the end."

Johnny Depp does manage to unnerve you superbly in this role, yet his accent did nothing but annoy me throughout.\n\nThe story didn't seem to make enough of the accessories to the plot, for instance the missing two minutes in space, the noises on the radio. These sidelines could have done so much to make the story creepier, yet they were brushed aside. Even the new job, although seeming highly relevant, is made nothing of.\n\nThe ending. Well, it seemed like a rushed one, and a bit of an anti-climax. I'll say no more.\n\nNot too bad for some easy entertainment, there's a couple of bits that are quite good, but don't expect too much."

In fact, Mr. Depp is an alien, and his wife is carrying his alien child. Big surprise. There is a moderately good sex scene in this movie, but it isn't worth renting in my book."

Acting ranged from terrible (Depp) to pretty engaging (Theron). Storyline hold very few surprises and uses familiar tropes but is definitely worth a watch and not nearly as dull as reviews make it seem. Minimal CG hasn't aged terribly but the fashion sure has. Nice-paced suspense and Theron's acting lifts this one to a 6."

I'm not denying he's a good actor, but people generally talk about him like if he's in something, it's brilliant. This is a good example.\n\nI rated this 26 on first view, that usually means I'm even more critical on second viewing, but I doubt there'll be a second time for this.\n\nIt's everything I hate about the human subconscious really. This desire to be scared in a safe manor in the comfort of a cinema seat with a box of toffee popcorn and a car waiting in the car park to get one safely home. This nurturing of the Thanatos Complex.\n\nI missed the first half hour but this might have been a good thing. The female actor who's name I've no wish to know was perfect for a film of this calibre / genre. Perfect as in appalling, like the genre. I can imagine it was marketed as a thriller but it's trying to be a horror so I'd label it a horror and leave it on those shelves. A sci-fi horror. (If I'd have seen that I wouldn't have bothered watching it) It was off to a head start within the first five minutes and had me thinking \"see this is good, straight away it's got me thinking, what happened in space\" of course you never get to see really. But gradually the optimism faded.\n\nI can't help but see the parallels between what happens In this film and anti-natal depression and wonder if that's what this films really all about. I've experienced post-natal depression and the similarities portrayed in the film were harrowing, albeit with some 'far-out' story-lines to keep the film deceptive.\n\nI wouldn't have reviewed this, but wanted to see if anyone else had spotted this sub-plot. Maybe I'm imagining it.\n\nIt could have been superb I think."

I'll try to never be in such a hurry again.\n\nThis reminded me of a modern version of Rosemary's Baby, and just as dense. Charlize Theron, however, did a far better job of acting then did Mia Farrow, whom I never considered to be an actress of any significance. Her acting was the only plus to this movie. Johnny certainly couldn't pull it off. With the less then educated script, and stupid remarks of him \"living there\" and pointing to his wife's gut, truly left much to be desired.

I am actually getting upset just writing this review. The other reason the producers of this turkey owe me 2 hours of my life back plus an apology is that on the box it is dubbed a \"psychological thriller\". Sounds good, right? No, it is not, as I don't consider a psychological thriller a movie where you simply wait around for something to happen and nothing ever does until the last 2 minutes of the film. If that is the case then sitting at my desk in my office all day is a \"psycological thriller\"-mind numbingly dull and maddening.

I found the movie quite dull and slow. It doesn't give us a clue how Commender Spencer Armacost is like before his journey to space. Automatically, the audience thinks that he is a loving husband, devoted to his wife and job. Fair enough, we don't need to go through deep character analysis. What we see is a disconnection from the earth for only twelve seconds!! It sounds interesting but doesn't give a push to the film. It takes a new step when one of the astronauts die a few months after the incident. Now Com. Spencer is the only witness what has happened back in there. His wife Jillian starts to get worried as he starts acting in a weird way. But soon after everything is normal again as she gets pregnant for twins. But is Commender Armacost really want this babies to start family with his wife or to start breeding of new species.? Jillian has to find out what has happened to her husband in that twelve seconds. More she is curious, more people are killed. At the end of the film, we have a classic ending, good against bad which stands somewhere between sci-fi and horror. Of course, good wins as usual and film credits start by not saying but implying that we all have spent two hours for nothing. Such a shame that the director has everything to make this work. Budget, stars, could-have-been a decent storyline. Unfortunately, he ant make it work. At least not for me. * out of *****"

The director does well to combine special effects, unique angles with the cameras used and a phsycologically chilling plot that will leave every astronaut's spouse with doubts of their partner's next mission.\n\nJohnny Depp creates a beautiful villain and is subtle with the Actions of Spencer Armacost so as to slowly release information for the audience but not to give away the whole story. Charlize Theron took the leading role with depth and flare and provides the audience with a spectacular character to empathise with and at the same time has their own doubts about.\n\nI felt the ending was, to say the least, unusual and could have perhaps been better.

I was longing for the end after about 30 mins. My vote 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "First let me say, if users had not spoiled the suspense for me by giving away what happens in this film, I would have been thoroughly taken in by the thriller. So thanks a lot everyone for that. But regardless of missing out on the anticipation of the reveal of what is really going on, I still loved this film.\n\nWhat can I say? After reading all of the negative reviews listed here, I am at a loss. I guess I should have known, as most of the films I have rented due to rave reviews have sorely disappointed me. But don't get me started there. I guess my heart beats to a different drum.\n\nFirst of all this is \"the Director's Film\". What a visual, emotional feast. They say a picture is worth a thousand words and Ravich's film is an outstanding example of this. For example: the close up of the beautiful slender fingers of Charleze Theron's fingers gently touching the rattling glass of the window as her husband's spacecraft blasts from the launch pad. This film was artistic shots end to end. Rich colors, beauty, unusual angles and camera movements, and always intense emotion seeping from the picture you are viewing.\n\nI have no problem with either of the stars acting, I thought Theron was excellent and stunning throughout. Depp was fine, a little off and cold, but his character was off and cold. The two of them made a beautiful team of leading lady and man.\n\nThe script was well written. Intelligent and realistic. And for those that complained that it was just a rehash of other sci-fi hits, I beg to differ. There is a concept that is explained (for those who were still paying attention) that was the basis for all that was happening. That concept was new and original in my experience of science fiction movie viewing. There was definite similarities to other films, but the foundation was a frightening new thought.\n\nThe complaints about unanswered questions - I found enough answers to questions for the film to be satisfying in that area. I had no trouble following right down the line. And a sequel (in my book) is a fantastic idea and very possible the way things were left.\n\nAs for the ending. I found the very last scene to this film to be anti-climactic to the scene just prior which was outstanding and the real punch to the end of the film. It was unexpected, frightening and excellently done. The very last scene was just a \"wrap up scene\" which I personally would have done slightly differently, but I certainly wouldn't \"dis\" it the way others have.\n\nMy only real complaint was the scene that shows the 2 missing minutes in space. It was washed out colors and unimaginitively done as though some amature put it together in a last minute rush to help out the real artists that put together the rest of the film.\n\nAs an artistic, suspense - not action - genre science fiction film I would recommend this one very highly."

While I could recognize his craftsmanship as Spencer Armacost, I did not always \"get\" him, rarely liked him, experienced him as tentative, and felt he was overshadowed by the actress in the title role. I found Charlize Theron stunning, a rare beauty, and a solid actress, though I did not always \"get\" her, either. Since the plot was faulty, I found that giving my attention to the characters was a far better strategy than being frustrated with the inadequacies of the script. Some of the camera work was a bit strange and strained -- while it didn't quite make me dizzy, I was overly distracted by it. Come to think of it, perhaps that is simply a technique to distract the audience so that we will not notice that it is not a very good flick. The only two people in the audience who were scared by this would-be thriller sat behind my companion and me. It made me laugh (quietly, of course, as I feel each of us is entitled to have our own unique experience) that they could shriek at such inane actions. I haven't decided if the movie was fast or slow for me, but of one thing I am certain, it is NOT a \"thriller\" and it could have been. Ah yes, that's it, this movie \"could have been\" very good"

When contact is lost on a routine space mission, something happens that changes Armacost and endangers our planet.\n\n\"The Astronaut's Wife\" as the title suggests is really about Spencer's wife, Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron). Her character is reminiscent of her role as Mary Ann Lomax in \"The Devil's Advocate\". She is supportive of her husband but begins (ironically) to suffer all sorts of afflictions as a result of his job. It takes a bit to get used to Depp with a southern accent and to see Theron in one of her early more subdued roles (especially after you've seen \"The Italian Job\").\n\nThe film brings a simple alien abduction/possession plot in, which sadly seems to drag out until the end. I think the director was still trying to keep the audience second guessing, but this works to no avail as the film's direction is pretty basic and easy to figure out. I won't spoil anything other than to say the ending isn't a happy one and is rather hokey to boot. Clea Du Vall makes a few brief appearances as Jillian's sister, Nan. 3/10"

He's basically just a stoic guy with a southern accent in this, who starts to act aggressively toward his wife.

        "review_detailed_main": "I had read some of the poor reviews for this film prior to watching it so I knew what to expect. This film has a really good (though far from original) plot involving two astronauts whose bodies are taken over while on a space mission. The aliens (occupying the bodies of the astronauts) return to earth and proceed to impregnate their wives with alien sperm. The women both become pregnant with twins, who are expected to become pilots for an alien designed spacecraft (This was all only vaguely explained in the movie). The wives, of course, do not know this initially. The movie is really quite similar in many ways to Rosemary's baby in that the alien occupied astronauts are protective of their host wives who were chosen to have their offspring. It also takes place in New York to add to the similarities. The real problem with this movie is that the the sense of menace is not sufficiently built up in the three quarters of the movie. When Johnny Depp returns from space, he does not seem any different then when he left. Towards the end of the film, he finally starts showing his colors, but there should have been some signs early on. It is almost as if the Director forgot to tell Mr. Depp that he was supposed to be an alien, and then noticed the problem after it was too late. In summary, I could not recommend this film, even as a video rental. It lacks an adequate build up in suspense, and the rational behind the aliens motives was not fully explained in the film."

If you like psychological movie with some Sci-Fi in it, then you wont be disappointed.

My overall rating is 8 out of 10 and recommend it to all who like to see Jonny Depp in action in a fine movie."

The story begins when Rocket Boy Depp is about to go up on a NASA mission and is leaving his very sexy wife Theron behind. Quicker than you can say \"Houston, we have a problem\" Depp and his partner are lost in space for a total of two minutes. They are retrieved and brought back to Earth. What happened during that two minutes is the mystery that this film is about. All appears to be well, but because of the eerie music, the brooding, moody lighting and weird camera angles we know better. The mystery that takes ninety minutes to unwind but I feel certain that all of you will have it figured out much sooner than that. Although this film has a few thrills a lovely performance from Theron, who by the way is quite easy on the eyes, an interesting turn by Joe Morton in a supporting role, it left me as cold as EYES WIDE SHUT did earlier this summer. A's W has a similar feel as EWS in its strange look, so if you liked that one, you may enjoy the ASTRONAUT'S WIFE. All in all I wish I had passed the shuttle and taken the bus."

I think this movie intended to be just a tribute to those famous ones in the past but it did a bad job regardless. Just making a good movie would have more than sufficed in its place, to say the least. Some parts were so unbelievable that it lost effectiveness while it wasn't even halfway through.

In that brief 2 minutes something changes the lives of the 2 astronauts and their wives. Suspicions arise about the mysterious 2 minutes as well as the obvious change that Charlize Theron (character wife of Johnny Depp) sees in her husband. `The Astronauts Wife' was an odd movie, not to the point of extreme oddity that makes the movie so weird it is intriguing. This movie was odd to the point of losing interest in the flick up until the 2nd half of the show. At that point you want to know if the movie ends the way you think it will. It was interesting to see Johnny Depp on the darker side of the spectrum."

        "review_detailed_main": "If not much else, The Astronaut's Wife allows for Johnny Depp to ramp up the creep factor nicely, playing severely disturbed NASA Commander Spencer Armacost, who has returned from a mission a little... different than when he set out. Upon a repair excursion on the space station, he came in contact with some strange phenomena which we never really see, apart from his reactions. He returns safely, and behaves normally enough for while, then starts to act very strangely indeed. His wife (Charlize Theron) notices first and slowly begins to feel terror towards him as he gets stranger and almost violent towards her. It's a silly premise that's given the head on treatment by writer/director Rand Ravich. There really isn't anywhere to go with such a setup but into generic thriller motions, which the film does, albeit in style. It's stunning visual work, to be sure, wit a silk smooth palette and aubern dominated color scheme that almost calls to mind Giger in places, which may have been their intention upon entering this genre. The story itself, however, is vague and muddled, while needlessly unleasent in others. Depp is fun to watch, clearly having fun going berserk inch by inch, Theron reliably solid yet without much to do except be scared and mistreated. Clea Duvall has a nice bit as her sister and one half of the woman's intuition that tries to smoke out whatever is hiding behind those perfect brown Depp eyes. Filling out the NASA roster is a nice assortment including Joe Morton, Nick Cassavetes and the great Tom Noonan. It's pleasing to the eye, if failing somewhat to satisfy elsewhere, and serves as a good enough thriller, that may have been great with a better script."

        "review_detailed_main": "I rented this film without much in the way of expectations. I am not a big sci-fi fan and even less of a horror fan, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. In fact, I was extremely impressed, not with the story, but with the filmmaking, particularly the direction by Rand Ravich.\n\nThe story was a patchwork of a lot of different worn out sci-fi themes. There was the \"alien takes over the human\" theme, the \"alien dwells among us\" theme and of course, \"the evil baby gestating in the good and pure mother\" theme. Suffice it to say that this wasn't fresh material. But let's be honest; how many stories are really fresh material? Why are we suckers for the same old romantic comedy storylines again and again and yet we expect that sci-fi must be completely novel to be good?\n\nWhat is outstanding about this film is the suspense. I haven't seen a film that was so effective as a suspense film in quite some time. It was effective because of daring use of the camera by Ravich that visually left me begging for relief in scene after scene. Actually, if there is any criticism of this film it is the fact that the suspense was too well done. It wears the viewer out without sufficient mental rest stops.\n\nRavich's use of extreme close ups, wide angle shots, rapid camera movements, odd perspectives, and tight sets produces a sense of relentless suspense that made me want jump into the screen and yell at the characters. For some, this was probably overwhelming and tedious. It seems that viewers today want pace, novelty and surprises. Yes, we knew Spencer (Johnny Depp) was now an alien. Yes, we knew that Jillian (Charlize Theron) had alien babies growing inside her. What we didn't know was what she was going to do about it and what he was going to do about her. So I thought the story was ultimately effective in achieving its goal...thrilling suspense.\n\nWhat this film lacked was a hideous monster and a lot of blood and gore. This is why it wasn't popular in my opinion because these are staples of today's mass market viewer. This is the very reason I thought it was excellent because it produced fear and anticipation, not by what was seen, but by what was unseen.\n\nFrom an acting perspective, this was a shining moment for Charlize Theron. This was a very demanding film for a female lead and she handled it like a pro. Her part demanded a full range of emotions from sweet adoring wife to the terror of a caged animal and she delivered the most complete performance I've seen from her to date. As a matter of fact, Theron so controlled the screen that Johnny Depp didn't really have much to do except give the occasional menacing look.\n\nI'm going to buck the tide with this one and give it an 8/10. This film was about style. It failed to deliver the obvious and this elusiveness made it unique among all the weird science fiction rip-them-to-shreds hack movies that jam the video store shelves. And that's what I liked most about it."

If you're after a bit of intelligent thinking of outer-space happenings, go back to Kubrick's \"2001\", or something like that."

The pace of this would-be sci-fi thriller is so s-l-o-w. And finally, what about all those strange sets, particularly the huge and dark apartment where the astronaut and his wife live. astronaut A Manhattan apartment that large costs a lot, more than this ex-astronaut could afford. And then there were all those long corridors looking more significant than they were. Just like the movie itself!"

The Worst: The non existence of other movies like this one.\n\nSpencer and Jillian Armacost are a beloved couple, he is the astronaut of the title and she is an elementary school teacher. Spencer goes on a routine mission to repair a satellite. On this mission NASA looses contact with the astronauts for two minutes when no one knows what happened. Spencer comes back and communicates to his wife that he resigned from NASA and a better offer was made, as a jet designer in a New York enterprise. They move to NYC, Jillian becomes pregnant of twins, but Spencer keeps acting weird ever since the day he came from the mysterious mission. Jillian becomes worried and tries to figure out what is going on with his husband and why the twins she carries inside are so important to him.\n\nWriter/Director Rand Ravich develops and directs his own material in a very peculiar way, described by some as slow and boring, and by others as strong and chilling. I have to say that I totally agree with the second one. To be honest, I have never heard of Mr. Ravich before and I've also heard some mixed reviews about this movie, and finding the premise and the actors very good, I decided to buy this movie. After almost two hours I could say that I was completely overwhelmed. The movie may not be completely original but in his genre is the greatest one alongside The Devil's Advocate, also starring Charlize Theron (it seems that Ms. Theron really knows what works to choose). There were some really lame attempts in these past few years to approach this issue but as I said they were just lame, but here, everything was done and choose carefully. The plot is well elaborated the directing is also very competent and the atmosphere was very well achieved and we also felt that creepy feeling sometimes that I'm sure Mr. Ravich was hoping for also thanks to the technical part, the stunning cinematography, and no less stunning production design, the `on-time' editing and so on, and on. If you look carefully after seeing it the movie fulfills every rule that a good thriller or horror film should, a good atmosphere, a threatening environment and a nice twist at the end, and that's precisely the end that makes the movie so great, the twist is awesome although you may have been thinking of it sometime before, but the very last scene is completely unpredictable, reminding all those great horror movies that end the same way. I believe that I can't recommend this film any more than I already did, so moviegoers, relax because this is one of those well crafted movies you don't see very much anymore. 9 out of 10"

Too pity I didn't look for this title earlier in IMDb. So my expectations were in full bloom.\n\nWhat did I get? Over 2 hours of boring incomprehensible gibberish so complex I had to try hard to concentrate on the conversations in the end. The plot was good, no doubt, with a bit of Omen and a tinge of Rosemary's Baby packaged within concepts of evil Aliens. The scenario was intended to be suspenseful, but there's no suspense. In the middle I often told myself \"Ah here comes the thrill.\" But my bad, where was I after all?\n\nIt's not that the actors were bad. Theron was in particular very good as the title lead. Depp does his usual magic. A little bland, but that's how the character is. The major flaw was perhaps in directing or the screenwriters thought they're writing an art film. Filmmakers of sci-fi should probably research more on the mentality of the target audience. Or what makes Spielberg different?"

Depp has the body language down, the nuanced inflections in his language and actions, the regional terminology and unique expressions, and he uses them all with effortless perfection.\n\nJohnny Depp has an ear for accents and dialects, but those pertaining to the Southern United States are notoriously difficult to replicate, much less pull off without sounding ridiculous. Notably, Depp absolutely masters this feat, not only for a southern accent but one that is highly specific to a particular region and subgroup of people from North/Central Florida. As a Florida native, it was astounding, slightly eerie, and highly impressive to hear an actor FLAWLESSLY replicate the dialect, vocal tones, inflections, and particular expressions of my family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nActors trying - and failing - at southern accents detract or even ruin productions so frequently that I fail to understand why directors don't insist on a southern accent ban. In contrast, Johnny Depp's flawless accent and layered portrayal of Florida astronaut Spencer Armacost gives this film an authenticity, credibility, and verve that it would not have without him."
