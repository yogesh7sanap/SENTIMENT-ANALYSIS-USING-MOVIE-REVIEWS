So unreal, so unwanted. Sonam Kapoor I thought could act when I saw Ranjhana, guess it was just a fluke. I am so disappointed because I have always loved Sooraj Barjatya's movies. Now next time I have to be really careful before watching his movies\n\nSad and disappointed"

        "review_title": "Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is a big letdown with poor direction, wafer-thin plot and messy drama. If you are a die-hard fan of Salman, watch it otherwise skip it",
        "review_detailed_main": "Sooraj Barjatya have been known for making quality cinema that spawned some successful films like Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun.. , Hum Saath Saath Hain and Vivah boasting off the tradition and culture of Indian family with tuneful music and grandeur sets. Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, his fourth collaboration with Salman Khan and after gap of 16 years, has created hype and soared sky-high expectations. Unfortunately, the family drama disappoints and will leave you dissatisfied at the end.\n\nPrem Ratan Dhan Payo tells story of royal family of Pritampur where a plot has been hatched to assassinate the young prince (Salman Khan) by his brother (Neil Nitin Mukesh) before the coronation takes place in the royal palace. A look-a-like of the prince, Prem, steps in to save the day. However, he falls in the love with bride-to-be of the prince(Sonam Kapoor).\n\nNow Sooraj Barjatya has adapted the story from Anthony Hope's novel 'The Prisoner Of Zenda' (1894) and infused his family drama with typical song-drama routine. Master of presenting the values of Indian culture and custom on silver screen innumerable times, Sooraj Barjatya gives you a fine first half with grand opening scene of Salman Khan and introduction of each character coupled with bit humor. Till this point, the film is tolerable however the second half tumbles down the rabbit hole and refuses to pick up. The screenplay is messy with too much of things happening in quick succession and without any sensible reason. The problem is Barjatya follows the same path of his previous films ( he even borrows the sports scene from Hum Aapke Hain Koun\u0085 this time replaced by football in this one) which actually become a mockery in the end. Another issue is too many songs which is misplaced and is included in every ten minutes between the scene. The climax which should have been the highlight of the film is diluted with weak action choreography and melodrama.\n\nSooraj Barjatya ( also credited with story and screenplay) is not in form this and clearly misses the mark. Coming from the director who made some outstanding cinema previously, I was disheartened. The editing(Sanjay Sankla) is half-baked with weak dialogues that will spoil your mood leaving you unsatisfied. Cinematography (Manikandan) is spell-binding capturing the essence of Rajasthan and Gujrat. Art direction is eye-catching. Kudos to Nitin Chandrikant Desai for always innovating with unique style. Background score is jarring to ears. Music by Sanjoy Chowdhury and Himesh Reshammiya is tuneful but certainly not chart-bursting. Coming to the performances, there is only one reason to watch the film \u2013 SALMAN KHAN. The superstar is getting better with his expressions and emotes well throughout the film. He is adequately supported with fantastic performances by Anupam Kher and Deepak Dobriyal. The third and the final problem with the film is wrong casting (Vicky Sidana). Sonam Kapoor certainly does not fit to carry her part earnestly. It is high time for her to seriously take her acting lessons properly ( She is part of the industry for 8 years). I feel bad for a talent like Neil Nitin Mukesh getting wasted in half-baked character. Armaan Kohli is a letdown.\n\nOverall, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is a big letdown with poor direction, wafer-thin plot and messy drama. If you are a die-hard fan of Salman, watch otherwise skip it. Below average 2/5\n\n\u2013 Ketan Gupta"

Sonam Kapoor (Princess Flavia), Nitin Mukesh (Black Michael) and his associate Rupert of Hentzau. Really the movie could have become owe some but something is missing or missed out. 5.6 rating is too high, I rate the title 3 for copying the novel so poorly. REGARDS"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half of PRDP flows very slow and the story moves along boringly whilst establishing the characters. The biggest problem with the movie is that the conflict doesn't seem to be too big for it to matter later on when the conflict gets solved.Prem Dilwale's too much overacting makes the film irritate you like hell. The football match sequence and the sequence where Prem mends the relationship of Vijay with his step-sisters are completely over the top ones. There are a lot of illogicalness like the placement of a palace on the edge of a waterfall. At the end of the 160 minute duration, PRDP manages to make everyone sleep and the emotions do not work at all which should in turn make the film not work even amongst the family audiences. PRDP looks completely outdated and clearly no money has been spent on the sets and the costumes. The production design is of very low standards. The VFX work is the worst you have seen in Hindi films and the editing could have been much more tighter but as we all know, Sooraj Barjatya believes in boring cinema. Himesh Reshammiya delivers a pathetic soundtrack. None of the songs stay with the viewer. And the worst one is the title track which seems to be nowhere. Each and every actor completely overacts and the one who does the most throughout the movie is Salman himself. Prem Ratan Dhan Payo can't even be thought of to be compared with classics like 'Maine Pyaar Kiya' and 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun'. The film thoroughly bores you with dull moments all over. Sure there are a lot of silly and illogical moments. And Salman Khan puts in a terrible performance as Prem Dilwala. In the first half of the film, he irritates you over time and again. Diwali is the time when families come together and PRDP will be disliked even by families as it is the most boring movie which irritates you with overacting. This festive season, avoid it for sure. It's a 0/10 rating movie to be honest, but have to give 1/10 as 0/10 is not allowed on IMDb. Sooraj Barjatya films come once in 6-7 years and there is no director in the industry who can fill a film with as much overacting as much as the he can. Advice for the youth, don't even watch it on your on TV."

The abundantly used & reused script, the all good pauper, the double role, the unnecessary songs, the out of sync pathetic & outdated soundtrack, the forced upon villains of the film & Salman's usual overacting were too much for me to handle. This whole movie is way too outdated and seems like a movie from the late 80's. The screenplay and the coincidental scenes of blossoming love between Salman (50 year Old) & Sonam (20 Years Younger) were irritatingly naive and dated. I beg to the film makers to grow up and stop testing our I.Q. already. Please have mercy on us. But then again, why would they ever stop! It's hard to believe but true that this movie has already done Box office collections nearing 200 Cr. as of yet (i.e. today : 17th Nov). 'Bhai's' Fan following from the masses in India surely encourages them to keep making these overrated pieces of junk repeatedly. I usually check the rating and make an educated guess after reading some reviews from IMDb website. But then again, the fans of these glorified actors have infiltrated deep within IMDb too and misleading gullible movie watchers to go ahead and watch these kind of movies. The wish that the censor board rate movies on I.Q. levels too. I guess I'll stick to my thought of staying away from Bollywood movies, cause while watching such crap, I tend to get frustrated and uneasy. Rest, this is my thinking on this, you take your own call. Caution : Proceed to theaters at your own risk!!!"

Everything was overdramatized, and I'm surprised I didn't internally combust while watching this expensively made crap put on a screen. Apart from Bhajrangi Bhaijaan, all Salman Khan movies have been the same for the past 10 years, and most of them have been pretty bad. Props to Salman for doing something different than the stereotypical mindless action movies he does, but this was probably his worst movie in the past 10 years (yes even worse than his typical mindless action movies). Salman may get to a point where he can act and make good movies one day, but this will be one of the biggest stains on his record."

But, she messes up as usual. She is a total misfit for the role. Actually the director seems to have little confidence in her acting abilities. ( This Review may contain spoilers ) It is quite evident in the last scene when prem bids goodbye to sonam. The director has shot the scene using the silhouette of sonam, instead of showing her expressionless face. Obviously she could not have pulled off this scene. About Neil Nithin Mukesh & Armaan kohli, The less said, the better. Music score is very mediocre and does not suit at all. Only respite is in the form of Anupam kher, Swara Bhaskar & to some extent Deepak Dobriyal, who stand out in this messy affair.

        "review_detailed_main": "Sooraj Barjatya's 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' has finally arrived & is the BIG Diwali release of the year. But is it worth all the hype? The answer is, partly yes, partly no!\n\nReason? While Barjatya's story is undeniably sweet, the narrative's structure appears outdated & the excessive running-time (169-minutes), spoils the fun. However, Salman charms as Prem & enacts dual-roles, endearingly.\n\n'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' Synopsis: After a King (Salman) is nearly killed by his jealous step-brother (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a Lookalike (Salman, Again) fills his shoes. While there, the Lookalike, now posing as the King, falls for the princess & the King's bride to be (Sonam Kapoor).\n\n'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is great to look at & the message of the film, that being, love should always win over hate, is heartening. But, the storytelling comes along with an Erratic Screenplay & too many songs, that, sadly, don't add much to the film. Barjatya's Screenplay is sweet & some sequences (Especially in the first-hour), hold your attention completely. The second-hour loses grip & the songs keep popping up a bit too soon & stretch the film, without adding any weight to the drama.\n\nAlso, Barjatya's Screenplay has multiple sub-plots & not all engage. The one that appeals is the one involving Salman's estranged step-sister (played by a wonderful Swara Bhaskar). The sub-plot of the villains (Neil Nitin Mukesh & Armaan Kohli), doesn't really work. In short, Barjatya's Writing appeals in bits & pieces, not entirely.\n\nBarjatya's Direction is simplistic, but has a dated vibe to it. However, He's handled a number of sequences, especially the dramatic ones, with command. V. Manikandan's Cinematography is grand. The Lensman has captured the huge canvas, wonderfully. Sanjay Sankla's Editing needed to be crisper. The film is a bit too long & could've easily been trimmed down by at least 25-minutes. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. Himesh Reshammiya's Music is good. Action-Sequences are finely choreographed.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Its Salman all the way, The Superstar is at his most endearing as Prem, the clean-hearted soul, who spreads love everywhere. Even as the King, he's done quite well. Its a delight to watch him, from start to end. Sonam Kapoor is nice & looks beautiful throughout. Anupam Kher is fantastic. His camaraderie with Salman, is fun to watch. Deepak Dobriyal is another topper. He brings in a lot of laughs, through his goofy portrayal as Prem's best friend. Swara Bhaskar is graceful, as always. Neil Nitin Mukesh & Armaan Kohli are strictly okay as the villains. Others lend adequate support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' isn't a wholesome entertainer, but a decent watch nonetheless."

Maybe we were expecting too much. They are saying that they are bringing the 90's back but sorry our 90's wasn't this lame. This is just a bad and almost 3 hours long boring movie. The songs are forced. The emotional scenes fail since you are too bored watching some illogical scenes. I think even Salman Khan fans will sleep watching this movie. The cinematography is good.

I wish I could forward half of the movie or some one had warned me so I could have saved my 3 hours of my life.\n\nI cannot believe that the movie already made 200 crores.\n\nMy advise to families to save money and don't watch this movie in theaters.\n\nSave that money and have a nice meat at a nice restaurant with your family or do something else with your family.\n\nHope this helps...."

Sonam Kapoor was bad and rest of the cast had no role. Music, acting, story, direction everything failed in this movie. Family movie doesn't have to be illogical, long and boring. This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Villain of this movie looks joker and they hardly have any role. Choreographer have come up with such pathetic dance step that no student should ever watch it. Music is unbearable and old. This movie is late by 100 century. Completely avoid this movie and save your money."

Plus see how 1/10 is up voted where as 10/10 reviews has 0 vote. These Bollywood movies now a days invest bigger money, large portion of budget in this kind of advertisement, buys spots in media, make reviewer write good comments and claim their movie earned lots of movie arousing enthusiasm in other and make lots of money. This movie is one of them. Pathetic movie but with big brand and lots of money and all marketing rather than story. So many illogical flaws, story is child fairy tales, overacting, poor acting. It thinks people are fool and watch what ever is given paying money. I am not alone just see the other comments from real viewers who has watched the movie you will know it. I liked earlier Salman's movie but this one is definitely thumbs down. 0.5/10 10/10 are paid reviews(to increase overall rating) don't believe it Don't believe watch movie yourself and write a review here..."

        "review_detailed_main": "PRDP doesn't make you laugh, cry, think ... it will just make you wait for the remaining time to get over, esp the second half.\n\nThe movie starts with the usual Rajshri way of making a song and dance about a noble person, Salman-1 (Prem Dilwale, what a name!), who is the owner of a drama company in Ayodhya. He admires Sonam Kapoor (Rajkumari Maithili) who travels in a chopper to do charity for flood affected areas. He goes to meet her in a fabled place, Pritampura, only to find that the person she is about to get engaged to, soon to be coroneted Rajkumar Ajay(Salmon-2), has gone though a regicide attempt and has been saved by some of the loyal supporters of the late king. these supporters want him to play king for sometime to fool the people, the rajkumar's enemy and \"maitili's\" family. There starts Salman's attempt to voo the entire kingdom, starting with the bethroted princess to the king's sibling's to the people.\n\nMeanwhile the actually king recovers and is then kidnapped by the enemy. Finally family peace regains and the princess chooses her husband.\n\nThe movie boasts of illogical sibling relationships, extremely clich\u00e9d and unintelligent conversation , bad visuals used to create places like a crystal palace which floats besides a huge waterfall and has mirror mazes and all, surreal places like a garden where flowers continuously keep falling, unmemorable and non-catchy music and a very irritating and amateurish performance by Sonam kapoor (what else could we have expected.) Salman Khan although irritating and illogical at some place is at least pleasant to look at.\n\nThe movie is so predictable that in some of the early scenes you'd guess what the fight sequence would be in the end.\n\nI might not have related to all Rajshri fairy tale family dramas, but have at least been absorbed while watching them. This one is an exception through and through."

        "review_detailed_main": "I almost didn't watch this movie due to the repetitive negative reviews here on IMDb. Usually I find reviews here fairly spot-on. But in this case I am convinced we are living in a generation of viewers who have been raised on so much schlock, sex, violence, blood and foul language that they wouldn't recognize a prime movie if it whacked them with a hammer. Either that or we have a set of the most bogus witch-hunt reviews ever.\n\nI could count the number of films I would give 10 stars and still have some toes left. This film has everything-- terrific cinematography, good acting (yes, a little hokey in places: intentionally so), a script that if one has a heart at all should bring tears to the eyes repeatedly, humorous moments, fun moments, bad decisions, sacrifice, redemption, hundreds of supporting actors, the most incredibly huge set I have ever seen in any film (they built an entire palace!) -- as well as the full gamut of drama mixed with comedy, music and dance.\n\nMany others have discussed the merits of the movie itself; they have done well enough that I don't have to re-hash. What I will focus on is the incredible number of negative reviews present here. We notice a large number of the reviews are similar or identical in writing style. That stands out very clearly-- which is highly suspect. Secondly, a large number of those reviews claim to be written from differing cities in India, yet are all in perfect, pristine English. \"Most boring movie I've ever seen.\" We see this phrase repeatedly, in almost identical words.\n\nThere are too many people giving this 7+ stars and even 10 stars (unusual to see on IMDb) to believe the legitimacy of the number of 1-star \"worst movie ever\" reviews. Such paradox is simply difficult to accept as valid.\n\nAll I know is I'm in the U.S., I and my sister watched the movie together, and we both loved it. I can be very critical of films and for sure I have seen some real stinkers in my day-- but this movie definitely is not one of them. This has song, dance, a delightful story... and touches the heart more than once. Have your hanky ready.\n\nPlease, feel free to consider the negative reviews as suspect (at the very least)-- and give this film a try. The best and most valid review is your own."

For me this movie has proved to be a great entertainer, one can watch with his/her family without any moment of awkwardness! Sooraj Barjatya gets the 90s effect back in this decade! Family values, love everything is back on screen after about 15-20 years! And we have Salman Khan back as Prem once again! Yes makes you laugh, makes you wanting to be as responsible as him! The Prem effect gets back on the screen after so long!Sonam Kapoor looks could, and she could have looked better if she could have acted a bit better! But yes, she delivers aptly what she could have! Swara Bhaskar, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Anupam Kher all of them have delivered a good performance!\n\nNow talking about the negative part of the movie, the movie is 2 hours and 56 mins long! Few scenes are dragged and quite a few of them weren't even required in the film! The action scenes in the end were a bit too much! But yes they were required.\n\nMusic of the film is quite average. 2 or 3 songs are good. On the whole, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is a good (not great) family entertainer! Go watch it with your family!"

I would recommend the future seekers of the movie to save their precious time. Salman with Sonam seems like Lion Cat couple, and Sonam Kapoor really didn't play well with this one. The story line was complete mixed up as the things has no logic. Even the director would be confused as what way he should give the climax of the film. A village boy started acting as a Royal Mate in matter of hours was really not a greet to watch. Sonam Kapoor wearing sunglasses all the time was much more irritating then anything. The only part movie played good is making you sleep for lovely 2 hours ( after 1 hour of watch ). Thanks"

Master of presenting the values of Indian culture and custom on silver screen innumerable times, Sooraj Barjatya gives you a fine first half with grand opening scene of Salman Khan and introduction of each character coupled with bit humor. Till this point, the film is tolerable however the second half tumbles down the rabbit hole and refuses to pick up. The screenplay is messy with too much of things happening in quick succession and without any sensible reason. The problem is Barjatya follows the same path of his previous films ( he even borrows the sports scene from Hum Aapke Hain Koun\u0085 this time replaced by football in this one) which actually become a mockery in the end. Another issue is too many songs which is misplaced and is included in every ten minutes between the scene. The climax which should have been the highlight of the film is diluted with weak action choreography and melodrama.The movie created a lot of hype and unsurprisingly grossed 40 crores on first day but the film story failed to match its expectations.Screenplay is very poor and it is Sooraj Barjatya worst film till date. Only watch it if you are die-hard Salman fan but even Salman fans will be disappointed with this boring movie."

If your taste is natural beauty then this movie is for you.\n\nLet me put this way as well, this entire movie has less CGI compared to the trailer of Dilwale just released.\n\nIt's all natural, back to 90s were technology was not so advanced and making grand and glorious sets was only fort of Badjatya. He is indeed in that in 2015 too. Welcome to dances which has 100 dancers wearing same dress and running around in perfect rhythm with each beat. These is all pleasing to eyes. There is a freshness in air, there are less mobiles or selfies or laptops. There is a simplicity, there is an acting. there is a family.\n\nSalman Khan is the khan we have as of now. No other hero comes near him. His charisma is such strong that you will carry him with you when you leave theater. Sonam Kapoor obviously looks younger than Khan but I guess her make-up and clothes give her some age so as a pair they look very cute. And yes she is taller than him and it's evident in quite a few scenes.\n\nAnumap Kher does best, only he could have done justice to this role. However as a royal loyal guard I also felt Mr Bachhan also could have added another layer to this film.\n\nNeil Nitin Mukesh, is treated like a side-liner in this movie, it is sad to see talent like him is given such treatment. Loved him in Johny Gaddar & New York. Arman Kohli bags a good role but in entire movie he constantly gives same facial expression.\n\nRest of the characters does well to keep movie running.\n\nFew Negatives :\n\n1) Story - outdated is the only word. 2) Climax - big let down 3) Loopholes - too many and quite visible\n\nEnjoy with your family because such movies do not come every year, this should be treat to Rajshree production fans, Salman fans and also India families will love this movie.\n\nYes this movie has potential to spoil Ranbeer's next movie Tamasha which comes two weeks later, this has such a power to eat that movie's probable business.\n\nPromotion of Dilwale is also on in this movie, suddenly from the middle of the movie Prem turned into Prem Dilwale and from that point he is addressed only as Dilwale :)"

The movie is bit longer than the normal scripts of 2 hours which make it boring many a times.\n\nThe movie is good in the beginning but goes a little faded during the middle of the movie, the end of the movie is up to expectation and very interesting.\n\nAfter a long time, Salman can be seen in the double role where his duplicate copy is a simple and a common man and the original was a king who loves his people and charitable in nature. Despite having everything with him, the king wants to lead a normal life and the contrary is, his elder brother also wants to steal out all the wealth from him. The names of Salman's Cast are Prem and Vijay respectively.\n\nThe movie was shoot on a larger scale in an obviously bigger than ever sets.

OK towards the end but is a torture most of the time. Reminds me of Hindi daily soaps.\n\nBut I will not complain this as all this could be easily seen coming in the promos. Liked it as an opportunity of family outing during festive times.\n\nDirection, i would say is expectedly usual. The movie doesn't demand much of acting from anyone, no actor is brilliant either. Salman Khan back as a demonstrator of relationship values and does well. Sets and costumes are grand, giving the feel of just-a-star movie under a big banner; highly marketed and hyped to become another top grosser."

Why people live in these or why child put there parents in these homes. You can checkout and find the truth behind this and make a story and movie that will spread at least a message to everyone and a chance to change the mentality of peoples."

Salman is not made for this type of roles. And Football match scene was dumbest scene in this movie. Good to see Armaan Kohli back in action but the acting could have been better. Director could have presented Salman's role in better way. Surprised to see Sonam's and Neil Nitin Mukesh's poor acting. Overall, Don't spend money on this movie."

This film is a case of a 'doppelg\u00e4nger' - any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person. You've guessed it 2 for the price of one! A tale with a twist - The Prince and the Pauper . One is a suave and sophisticated prince and the other is a simple, generous man. Without giving too much away I have to say I really enjoyed PRDP it was light hearted, funny, colorful, sensitive, a family film that would not offend anybody.\n\nThis film was a Royal treat not just with all the Laddoo's and Jalebi's on display due to Diwali but because of the message that was clear and to the point -Family is important , any differences should be put aside for the sake of humanity,I came out feeling all hopeful and loved up!\n\nMs Safirah Irani Twitter@Safirah63"

First of all, the movie starts with usual Salman's dramatic entrance. The movie had content, a little bit story but not so good acting. The movie is no doubt a family movie but would have been more better if was supported by good acting. The songs were good enough to fit in the conditions for the movie. I still don't know why Sonam was selected as the lead for the movie but however she managed to act her part anyway. The same old Salman useless dialogues, poor dance of him makes the movie a bit shabby. Overall the movie was a decent watch as It is a family entertainer. I would go with 3/5 for this new Salman starrer."

Worse still, emotions, which are high points of barjatyas is severely missing through out.\n\nthen the all existent flaws.. the depiction of royal families, royal guests, royal security, its all flawed and poorly displayed... even the Royal grandeur which could have been easily shown was very shady!\n\nand who could even bear so much bad songs with all except one actually making sense (jalte diye).. all songs were placed in the movie for just placement.. no connect to story.. this is the first time i started disliking songs of a movie after watching the movie! otherwise songs were just fine!\n\nover all.. its a pathetic movie..!

The expectations were high following \"Maine Pyar Kiya,\" \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun,\" \"Vivaah,\" and \"Hum Saath Saath Hain.\" But this time the expectations haven't been met, and the film just backfires and leaves you cheated. A weak adaptation of \"The Prince and the Pauper\", the story is too dramatic which feels silly at times and way the things are resolved just highlights the weakness in story telling. The film fails to create the time period of the plot. Besides, the performances are also mediocre. Salman's role is not different than that in \"Bajrangi Bhaijan,\" with the similar diction and dialogues which becomes adequate. Actually, his characterization looks a bit tailor made and has glibness. Neil Nitin Mukesh and Sonam Kapoor are both mediocre in terms of roles and performances. Anupam Kher looks surprisingly good in his role. If there is anything to adore in the film, it's the beautiful sets and few good songs, which doesn't make the film a total let down.\n\nRating: 1 star out of 4"

The writing of 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is the real winner, which at some instances gets brisk while meanders at a point or two. Overall, it is infectious and will suck you into a traditional Barjatya realm.\n\nSalman Khan gives another performance tantamount to his brilliance in 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. However, Sonam Kapoor comes as the real revelation in the role of Maithili. She has less dialogues to offer but her presence is contagious. She is the walking miracle in Prem Ratan who links the family together. Stupendous!\n\nSwara Bhaskar is good as usual. Neil Nitin Mukesh is adequate in a half-baked role. Armaan Kohli seems out of place. Deepak Dobriyal is brilliant. It is Anupam Kher who stands out in the supporting cast as the well-wisher of the royal family. The veteran remains the strongest link of the movie - performance wise.\n\nMusic is pleasing to the ears. 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo', 'Jalte Diye', 'Aaj Unse Milna Hai' and 'Jab Tum Chaho' are the best numbers that will make the audience swoon with the proceedings.\n\nOverall, Barjatya has done a fine job that is pleasing to the sensibilities of mature audiences. It is a family extravaganza that holds 'respect for elders' as its most venerable strength. Kudos!\n\nI am going with three and a half stars for this family fair that is bound to bring a smile on your face this Diwali.\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nFull review here: http://uk.blastingnews.com/entertainment/2015/11/prem-ratan-dhan- payo-review-salman-khan-and-sonam-kapoor-s-triumph-00649631.html"

This film is like a old wine served in new bottle. Those who like 90s style of films will definitely like it.\n\nSooraj Barjatya has stayed true to his roots. Simple story told beautifully but is a bit predictable. The scale is very huge & is visually stunning.\n\nAmong all actors, Salman was best & he carried the film almost single- handedly on his shoulder. Rest were mediocre. The length & number of songs could have been shortened. The action in climax was too old- fashioned. The film is filled with a lot of loopholes, which are needed to be ignored.\n\nWill give it 3/5. Its an one time watch movie.\n\nNOTE :- Watch the film with your family and not your friends, as PRDP is best enjoyed with your entire family.\n\n(PS - \u202aDilwale\u202c trailer looked so good in big screens.

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Sooraj R. Barjatya's claim that he wrote the story of this movie is a complete hoax. He simply copied it ( very Very BADLY copied ) from a Bengali Movie - Jhinder Bandi made in 1961 (directed by Tapan Sinha ). Readers interested can look at Jhinder Bandi's storyline published in IMDb itself through the link below or can read the synopsis below.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073122/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\n\nThe story of Jhinder Bandi is as narrated ( as available in IMDb ) - \"A person comes to meet with Gauri Shankar Roy (Uttam Kumar) living in Kolkata. He introduces himself as a 'fauji Sardar' of Jhind, Jhind being a small kingdom in Madhya Pradesh. He says that the to- be king of Jhind, Shankar Singh, is found missing from the kingdom right before his 'abhishek'(oath taking of a king) and this is apparently a conspiracy by his own brother Udit Singh, who wants the kingdom for himself. Earlier too there were two occasions when abhishek was arranged but both the times the king was found missing. Udit is a cruel hearted man, unfit to be a good king. Shankar Singh has his vices too but is a kind hearted person who would care for his citizens and is thus worthy to be the king. Now, coincidentally, Gauri has exactly the same appearance as Shankar Singh(also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, Sardar requests him to enact the role of the King for the abhishek until he finds the real king. Gauri agrees.The two set off for Jhind. Things aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The abhishek however takes place successfully in the occasion of which the king is also engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi). While the atmosphere gets more and more tensed, the life of king is at stake, there is also a blooming romance between Kasturi Bai and Gauri. A secret agent unfolds that the king is hidden in the fortress owned by Udit who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then- Dewan of Jhind,Kali Shankar Roy. The then-king being issue less, adopted Shankar and Udit as sons. Planning a secret entry to the fortress where king was held prisoner, Gauri fights a battle with Mayurvahan, finally killing him as well as surprising and killing Udit. As he approaches his look-alike Shankar Singh, he has a momentary desire to kill the king, gaining the kingdom himself, he being as deserving by his blood as was Shankar Singh, but his humanity wins over and he approaches the king addressing him as \"Your Highness\". He then bids a last goodbye to Kasturi Bai and rides a horse, heading back to Kolkata...................\"\n\nEven Jhinder Bandi was a copy / adaptation of Anthony Hope Hawkins' novel The Prisoner of Zenda. The novel - The Prisoner of Zenda is made in to movies or TV serials for at least 10 times in English, and in to once in Bengali in 1961 ( \"Jhinder Bandi\" ).\n\nMore :\n\n1. The copy of the storyline (PRDP) was not only very weak and boring but fraught with predictability.\n\n2. Too many unmemorable songs.\n\n3. Plot Blooper - When the injured prince Vijay was kept at the secret chamber of the fort how the sophisticated life saving machines were working? Where was the electricity? Because if the power was available then why the room was illuminated through traditional flambeaus.\n\nMoral of the critique - Don't take the audience for a ride and make false claims."

Somewhere it may seem nonsense or you may even laugh at it. Sooraj Barjatya does sprinkle his well tried and appreciated masala in this film which works many a times.\n\nOverall,it will be a bearable experience for a family if you are used to films like Vivah,Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon,Hum Aapke Hain Koun, etc.\n\nAt the end I'll say you may leave this movie because \"The flaws counts\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been a fan of Rajshri Films long before Salman Khan and Sooraj Barjatya made their debut in 1989 blockbuster Maine Pyar Kiya.I have witnessed the growth of Sooraj Barjatya and unfortunately after Hum Apke Hain Kaun he seems to be loosing his Midas touch.Most of his films after HAHK have been struck in a time wrap as the stories and treatment have not been done according to the present times.Vivaah was more bearable as it had some good music but PRDP lacks vision,story,treatment and memorable songs Rajshri's have been famous for.The story and screenplay was so ordinary that at times it seemed as if we were watching a film from the 60s.Sooraj Barjatya and Salman Khan have a cult following which may bail out this expensive movie from Rajshri but it is not a patch on their previous works.The chemistry between Sonam Kapoor and Salman Khan was totally missing and I really fail to understand the reason of casting her.I hope Sooraj Barjatya works on his stories more carefully and makes a film in a couple of years before the audience totally rejects and forgets his kind of cinema."

Salman's innocence in prem dil wala was too unnatural. Sonam Kapoors acting is getting mature, even in front of a big star like Salman Khan she was acting between the lines.\n\nCinematography was amazing, but then again so many unwanted scenes, instead of which there could be some added drama.\n\nIn summary whatever the downs of this movie are, Saloo bhai is always entertaining and I always loved watching his movies. I like the end after so much efforts finally the prem got the mahrani. Sometimes it feels good to be lost in fantasies. This is one such movie."

Choreographer have come up with such pathetic dance step that no student should ever watch it. Music is unbearable and old. This movie is late by 100 century. Completely avoid this movie and save your money .

        "review_detailed_main": "Salman Khan's Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (PRDP) is a COPY. A very bad COPY.\n\nDirector Sooraj R. Barjatya's claim that he wrote the story is a complete hoax. He simply copied it from a Bengali Movie - Jhinder Bandi made in 1961 (directed by Tapan Sinha ). Readers interested can look at Jhinder Bandi's storyline published in IMDb itself through the link below or can read the synopsis below.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073122/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\n\nThe story of Jhinder Bandi is as below ( as available in IMDb ) - \"A person comes to meet with Gauri Shankar Roy (Uttam Kumar) living in Kolkata. He introduces himself as a 'fauji Sardar' of Jhind, Jhind being a small kingdom in Madhya Pradesh. He says that the to- be king of Jhind, Shankar Singh, is found missing from the kingdom right before his 'abhishek'(oath taking of a king) and this is apparently a conspiracy by his own brother Udit Singh, who wants the kingdom for himself. Earlier too there were two occasions when abhishek was arranged but both the times the king was found missing. Udit is a cruel hearted man, unfit to be a good king. Shankar Singh has his vices too but is a kind hearted person who would care for his citizens and is thus worthy to be the king. Now, coincidentally, Gauri has exactly the same appearance as Shankar Singh(also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, Sardar requests him to enact the role of the King for the abhishek until he finds the real king. Gauri agrees.The two set off for Jhind. Things aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The abhishek however takes place successfully in the occasion of which the king is also engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi). While the atmosphere gets more and more tensed, the life of king is at stake, there is also a blooming romance between Kasturi Bai and Gauri. A secret agent unfolds that the king is hidden in the fortress owned by Udit who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then- Dewan of Jhind,Kali Shankar Roy. The then-king being issue less, adopted Shankar and Udit as sons. Planning a secret entry to the fortress where king was held prisoner, Gauri fights a battle with Mayurvahan, finally killing him as well as surprising and killing Udit. As he approaches his look-alike Shankar Singh, he has a momentary desire to kill the king, gaining the kingdom himself, he being as deserving by his blood as was Shankar Singh, but his humanity wins over and he approaches the king addressing him as \"Your Highness\". He then bids a last goodbye to Kasturi Bai and rides a horse, heading back to Kolkata...................\"\n\nEven Jhinder Bandi was a copy / adaptation of Anthony Hope Hawkins' novel The Prisoner of Zenda. The novel - The Prisoner of Zenda is made in to movies or TV serials for at least 10 times in English, and in to a Bengali movie by celebrated director Tapan Sinha in Bangali in 1961 ( \"Jhinder Bandi\" ).\n\nMore :\n\n1. The copy of the storyline (PRDP) was not only very weak and boring but fraught with predictability.\n\n2. Too many unmemorable songs.\n\n3. Plot Blooper - When the injured prince Vijay was kept at the secret chamber of the fort how the sophisticated life saving machines were working? Where was the electricity? Because if the power was available then why the room was illuminated through traditional flam-beaus.\n\nMoral of the critique - Don't take the audience for a ride and make false claims."

The film has a bit of twist which is really good but I m not spoiling your experience. So overall you get good romantic drama filled with some action. If your family is getting bored, then buy tickets of PRDP. A complete family film. The ending of the film is on happy note. If the film length was a bit less then it would have been more enjoying. Never mind its a good flick."

Overall it was fun ride with some beautiful emotional moments at the end which will move you for sure. The massage you get from the movie we should not forget in life.

This is a lame copy of The Prisoner of Zenda. This is another 3rd class movie by so called Salman. We need to replace people from south India for Bollywood movies. I'm saying as I'm from east not from south. I like Bahuballi like movies.

These people who are at the top of these industries know nothing about what movie goers want.\n\nWe want realistic love with no ulterior motives. Salman looked like the creepy uncle who returned for a child bride in my opinion (and of many other's). The movie is so overrated. Sonam herself doesn't even have any talent nor can she make expressions. It is hard to watch properly.\n\nFor once I though Bollywood was going to give people what they wanted by returning to better stories, music and putting people of the same age together. The music is lovely and I will continue to listen to it. But I would NOT recommend this movie because it is stale. It seems like Salman is acting with someone younger every year (oops I forgot the creepy school girl relationship he had in lucky no time for love) while the actresses fade out.\n\nBollywood really needs to change how they work. Hollywood too."

This time, it bigger, sweeter, and a new low even by 'bhai' standards, plainly boring, to the point of being irritating.\n\nI have personally loved Rajshri's brand of cinema, especially the 90's decade, which more or less established Salman as the noble, humble, heartthrob 'Prem'- on the shoulders of Sooraj Barjatya. They single handedly set marriage trends \u2013 whether it be musical chairs, long lavish melodious premarriage celebrations in Hum Apke Hain Kaun, or be it ladies 'sangeet' introducing family members in bollywood style in Huma Saath Saath Hain, while being inclusive and politically correct. But they were always enriched with beautiful songs, brilliant supporting cast, a believable story and decent A- stars.\n\nSooraj and his Salman-Prem should have worked again. Prem should have been back. Legally and critically. At nearly 3 hours of lecturing about various topics \u2013 brother-sister relationship, property settlement, a football match between men in kurtas and women in sarees \u2013 with not a single whistle-podu moment or digestible one-liner, this was unbearable. The only appreciable thing I can find is the set and art-direction.\n\nWhile Sooraj Barjatya stayed ahead of his times, assimilating the will of the youth and traditions of the established during his outing in the last 2 decades, his recent films don't have that charm that invites you to watch them again. I can watch Maine Pyaar Kiya again and again; Hum Apke Hain Kaun is still a staple on Diwali every year on TV. But the rigidity on traditions, and political correctness make it plainly unbearable (along with the irritating lyrics \u2013 aayo, paayo, laayo b#$).\n\nNevertheless, Bhai, just like his characters on-screen, is never wrong."

        "review_detailed_main": "Salman Khan and Sooraj Barjatya coming together after over two decades should have definitely been a momentous occasion for all fans but unfortunately it is not. The film is not bad but there is something missing as compared to the earlier Barjatya movies like Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.\n\nStory: Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (PRDP) has a simple plot and tells the story of a royal family, family feuds, power struggle among siblings, illegitimate children fathered by kings etc.\n\nThe film has Salman Khan in a double role, which should certainly enhance its box office collections since you get 2 Salman's for the price of one (we could have done with a third one too if the plot had permitted !!!! )\n\nIn one of his two roles, Salman is a Ramleela actor who, along with a friend (Deepak Dobriyal), finds himself in the middle of a plot to eliminate a righteous prince (also played by Salman) who is days away from his coronation. The would-be king has enemies in the palace. So a trusted minister (Anupam Kher) hatches a plot to save him by installing a lookalike in his place.\n\nThe efforts put in by the lookalike in order to bring together the real prince's estranged family comprising of brother Neil Nitin Mukesh, 2 step sisters and his beautiful fianc\u00e9e , Sonam Kapoor forms the crux of the plot.\n\nCast: Salman plays both the roles earnestly namely: 1)Ramleela actor, Prem Dilwale who provides the much required comic relief in the film with his witty one-liners. 2)The righteous Prince Vijay who suffers a vicious attack on his life just days before his coronation.\n\nSonam Kapoor: Looks great as she always does. Decent job done.\n\nNeil Nitin Mukesh: Looks great as the prince's estranged brother, but there are very few scenes where he can actually show his acting prowess. His role has either suffered at the editing table or it hasn't been properly etched out.\n\nArman Kohli: Looks great for a change as the antagonist, but again like Neil Nitin Mukesh, does not have a role which can create an impact.\n\nRest of the cast namely Anupam Kher, Swara Bhaskar, Deepak Dobriyal and others do a decent job. Sanskari Babuji (Alok Nath is sorely missed in the film!!)\n\nSongs: Too many of them in the film, apart from the lead number, all others are passable.\n\nDirection: Barjatya does a good job but has to remain in tune with the times as plot is stale and seems dated especially with scenes like the Price traveling on a horse carriage and the princess traveling in an ordinary train. VFX is used to create a magnificent Sheesh-Mahal at the edge of a menacing waterfall.\n\nYou have to give him credit though for the tasteful recreation of Rajasthan's royalty which is enhanced by the great locales.\n\nSee this movie if :\n\n1) you are a die hard Salman Khan fan\n\n2) a true Sooraj Barjatya fan\n\n3) Dimaag baju main rakhkar picture dekhne ki aadat hai. A normal trait seen among Salman fans .\n\nMy Verdict :\n\n3 Stars ( 2 and a half for the movie and an additional half star for Prem Dilwale's earnestness)"

I must have watched the songs and seen the trailer 10-15 times as well as all the promotional videos by the actors before walking into the theater. Having said all that, I did not have a very high expectation of this film as I did for Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain (which both lived up to them). The film is watchable for sure and having it release on Diwali really helps as you are in family mode and craving a nice family film which it is. The songs are nice, cinematography is wonderful, acting is overdone, sets are elaborate, and the storyline is missing. Sooraj Barjatya still pulls it off because he has Salman Khan.. any other actor could not pull 3 hours of poor acting off like Salman. Overall I liked it and I have seen every SB film with Salman and think this is one that you get your monies worth if you go when it is half price."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some movies are so bad they are funny and thus in a weird way entertaining. Birdemic is one of these films.\n\nOthers are so bad they want to make you cry and vomit at the same time. Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is one of these films.\n\nA motto of Bollywood is \"Wholesome Family Entertainment\". This film tries so so so hard to be that, but fails so spectacularly, with every clich\u00e9, bad joke, ultra-soppy ending, ridiculous music, sweaty camera angles, the 'whoOPS!' sound effect whenever someone slips up, a Heroic Hero and a Damsel In Distress, evil villains and the prevailing theme of Love. The hero of the film is literally named Prem (Love in Hindi). CRINGE.\n\nIt's pretty much a 2 and a half our long soap opera with plots and settings which don't even make sense (\"There's a Prince in 21st century India\", \"Salman Khan plays two separate roles\" \"People break into song and dance for no reason at this point\"). Khan is a bad actor as it is: we don't need to magnify that by giving him two roles to play. And Sonam Kapoor is just a more S**t Priyanka Chopra with half the acting talent (if you can imagine such a thing). Her sole purpose is to stand there and let the airbrushing department do their work.\n\nI can see very clearly why for some people this will be the last Hindi film they will ever see. Personally, I hope that they make a Redux version with an extra 15 minutes in which all the characters kill themselves, because by the end of this movie I was waiting for sweet sweet death to come and take me away."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sooraj Barjatya and Ekta Kapoor are two sides of one coin. Where Barjatya's movies have all lovable and caring characters barring one bad guy, Ekta Kapoor is exactly opposite. One good character and the rest scheming. There is no grey in their world.\n\nSo PRDP is one too sweet and too long film. Barjatya creates one fictional world which is not reality. Thats fine but he tends to over do it. And this time, he gets Salman with him with whom he gave monstrous hits a few decades back.\n\nThe movie is remake of a English book called 'The Prisoner of Zenda' and could have been a decent film had Barjatya not sugar coated it and let the editor did his job. The film is at least half hour too long. To make matters worse, baring one or two songs, none are melodious and that slows down the film. HAHK worked because of its melodious songs but here it falls flat.\n\nSalman is in fine form and is comfortable playing the double role of a Prince and a commoner. And he under plays it well and rarely goes over the top. However his fans must be disappointed because of the staple of comedy action films he has feed us up with. I would also blame Barjatya here for not using Salman's comic timing to use. He and Deepak Dobriyal would have lit the screen on fire with their comic timing something similar to Salman and Nawazuddin in Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\n\nSonam is again disappointing. She lacks the innocence of Bhagyashree and Amrita Rao, the maturity of Tabu and Sonali Bendre and the playfulness of Karishma Kapoor. And I don't want her to compare with Madhuri because I'll be committing a crime by doing so. And worse, she cannot create her own brand of a Barjatya heroine.\n\nAnupam Kher, Doobriyal, Niel Mukesh and Swara Bhaskar do well in their roles though Neil starts to ham a bit. And Arman Kohli is good as the villain.\n\nFinally, Salman saves the day but Mr. Barjatya, please change the style before its too late."

And just when we were relieved we shall never have to see his atrocious movies again, he struck back with this. THIS! And no, he didn't even maintain that level. He stooped it even lower.\n\nEverything about this movie is bad. Just straight up bad. Salman Khan looks ugly, the dialogues are atrocious, the story is poor, the acting is terrible, the music brings tears to my eyes (because I can't stand the torture), the visuals are unoriginal. I have no idea how on earth does this movie have a higher budget than Baahubali.\n\nAnd of course there are the fillers. Because it's a Sooraj Barjatya movie. How can we not have Salman Khan playing football with all the guests who are divided in the teams of men and women? And there's literally a song in which Salman Khan is singing whether he should take spinach for the princess or carrots. I literally rolled my eyes when that song played.\n\nThe only good thing about this movie is Neil Nitin Mukesh. And you know how bad your film has to be when he's the best thing about it. If this film wasn't free on Hotstar I'd have never watched it. After Bajrangi Bhaijaan this was a huge letdown. I'd say skip it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watch PRDP, The movie was good to an extent but if you watch the movie as an overall, it was kind of disappointing and it was a terrible movie. It was Bakwaas (nonsense) and illogical movie. The direction wasn't so great. Especially the story, I was expecting something else, I wasn't expected a full at drama movie. Normally when you watch the movie, you get more appealing and more attractive and interested to watch the rest of the movie. You know like you get attracted, OK we get excited to watch the movie. But I wasn't feeling that at all in this one. The plus point and the good parts of the film is the cinematography, I was very well shot and they spend a lot of time for the money and the locations. Another good part is Salman Khan, so Salman Khan did a great job. As you could see that he's playing a dual role, one is a prince and the other is an lover and romantic person. He was excellent in this film. And the Sonam Kapoor is good, she was superb, her acting was good, she playing almost like a princess and lover in this film. The character was well design, There are some portions, they was showing her side that it was not believable which means like you felt like OK she is not actually a princess. She's like a shy and innocent person. So they could have done a bit better characterization for Sonam Kapoor. The negative parts and the mindless point is the story, the story is a big big letdown, it spoiled with too much drama, there is too much drama in this movie. Especially the first half was boring, towards the second half could have been better, again there is too much emotional in this film. It makes you boring and sleep all the time. You don't get captivating to watch this movie. The emotional sequence doesn't work at all, it was not well made and it did not fulfilled in this film. Towards the climax, where they was an action sequence, that's totally unnecessary, they need to cut that scene, its just dragging the movie even more. The only thing which I like is the football sequence and the music. The football scene where they was an song was funny and hilarious. It was very well done. And the music by Himesh Reshammiya was also good, there are some songs was very good and some songs was OK. With the family audiences, i think they felt like boring and tired to watch this movie. For me, when I watch the movie, I was so bored at theaters, I was like let's finished the movie very quick. Because it was just draggy. So the story could have been a lot better to get interesting to watch the movie. I heard that it has a big budget movie as well because of the VFX was terrible and so poor. It has a poor execution. I don't know there is something wrong or it's because of the post production and we don't able to see the vision of Sooraj Barjatya. This is turned out to be the mistake of Sooraj Barjatya did. He hasn't recreate the magic of classic films like Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain. Even i was expecting a much more fascinating and much more captivating story line. But it was not there in this film, it was missing. the film could have been the biggest romantic film ever but overall, PRDP is basic movie. There is nothing special in this movie. You guys can watch this film with your family without expectations. But in my opinion, its one time watch movie that's gonna come out probably 1 or 2 or 3 years. Its very hard to writing the story and executed the film. We should appreciated their effort at least this movie but even through the story was not appealing to me and the family audiences. We should encourage them to make such a movie with different story. Even through Sooraj Barjatya spend a lot of time to write the story and post production, just trying your best to make a big movie and better story line."

Well, SLB made Guzaarish - which was a pretty lame adaptation of The Prestige and didn't cast Salman in it.\n\nSo angered was Salman by this insult that he publicly announced that 'Koi Kutta bhi Guzaarish dekhne nahin gaya'.\n\nAt the same time Salman kept his hopes alive. Though with Dhoom 3, Aaamir khan also stole some bits from The Prestige. With PRDP, Salman hit the jackpot. Although, not a copy of The Prestige, Salman stole the double role bit.\n\nSonam Kapoor is another actress who hasn't had a lot of luck with SLB after her debut with him in Saanwariya. For both Salman and Sonam, it was their last movie with SLB.\n\nAnother thing to be noted about Dhoom 3 and PRDP is that in both the movies, audience came to know about the secret about the double role pretty soon. Quite unlike The Prestige where the audience had to wait almost till the end.\n\nLast observation is that it's the second time Salman Khan has turned Rajput Savior in a movie, first one being Veer. On the other hand, Aamir Khan loves to play a Rajput."

        "review_title": "Wasn't expecting such a weak and badly written film from the reputed makers.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Strangely, what Sooraj delivers in his much talked about and awaited PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO after a gap of nine years, turns out to be nothing even comparable to his cult films, straight away reminding you of the two mistakes made in the past as HUM SAATH SAATH HAIN and MAIN PREM KI DIWANI HOON, clearly indicating towards no lessons learned from their big failures at all in a highly ignorant and casual manner.\n\nGiving you the clear picture, nothing works in this latest venture of Rajshri-Sooraj-Salman, nothing whatsoever\u0085\u0085except the man\u0085 Salman Khan, taking two steps backward from his last mega-hit BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN. The film neither has some great characterizations in its shockingly routine screenplay, nor any memorable well written sequences or simplistic dialogues continuing the tradition started by MAINE PYAR KIYA. Above all in PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO, the team comes up with such pathetically overused, clich\u00e9d storyline that makes you wonder that how confidently they keep on making films on the same stories again & again assuming the people to be dumb enough to keep on accepting them year after year with closed eyes without any complains as such. Yes, at times even the same stories become hugely entertaining due to the writer/director's exceptional novel treatment & presentation. But sadly that is not visible anywhere in this film that unexpectedly even starts boring the viewers in its second half.\n\nRecalling the experience of watching it in the theater, I was really surprised to see simply nothing executed on screen with the backing of some solid writing (post the decent opening Ramlila sequence) and the film progressing so casually without incorporating any kind of much needed suspense or enjoyable tension involving the double role. In fact, a few catchy songs and comic scenes remain the only relief moments in its first half, with the second turning out to be so painfully long that you keep looking at your mobile/watch repeatedly as if it's already gone beyond 3 hours shattering all kinds of expectations raised.\n\nThe cast ensemble including a couple of forgotten names, seem to be only interested in carelessly completing their given jobs establishing no emotional connect with their ultimate viewers, contributing 'nothing'. And the names include veterans like Anupam Kher followed by Swara Bhaskar, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh and the snake-man Arman Kohli. To be fair, there is only one person who randomly makes you laugh in his few scenes and he is Deepak Dobriyal who sadly remains under-utilized in the entire film displaying a shocking lack of vision.\n\nRephrasing the above, in PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO we have two lovers but no loving chemistry between them despite the hit tracks, brothers and sisters with no depth in their vaguely written characters placed just to get united again, villains with no emphasis given on their evil intentions or villainy and many deliberately inserted sequences like the unexciting football match post interval lacking the much- desired universal appeal and joy. Moreover except a couple of catchy compositions, both the lyricist and composer desperately keep trying to get into the Ravindra Jain/Ram Laxman mood making a conscious effort.\n\nRuining it further, it was hard to understand the director's obsession with the highly outdated mirror sequences towards the end that had no charm at all reminding you of the famous climax sequence of Bruce Lee's ENTER THE DRAGON. Besides the never-ending final hour of the film becomes so tough to bear, exactly like watching the last few overs of a one day cricket match that has already been lost in its 40th over.\n\nTo be honest, in the entire film I kept wondering that,\n\nA. Was this the story Sooraj R Barjatya kept searching for since 2006 which is clearly a take-off from famous novels such as \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (with the shades of BAWARCHI), already adapted several times in the West as well as in numerous Hindi films changing the theme from Kings to Dons since the mid of last century? Ironically even Rajshri had earlier made a film on the same subject as RAKTA BANDHAN in the 80s.\n\nB. Was this the film Salman approved of - full of old time obsolete feel, based on a ridiculously stereotyped theme, having only a few engaging moments, at your face brand promotion, lackluster background score, unimpressive 'big-empire' grandeur (that only worked in the promos) and loads of full length songs thrown in just like that, assuming that the viewers are still living somewhere in the 90s?\n\nC. Or Was this a mess, wherein Sooraj was not allowed to do what he was willing to, with the major suggestions/interventions coming from the now much bigger STAR with no intentions of breaking through his own comfort zone?\n\nIn all, a big unexpected let-down, PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO actually has nothing Rajshri, Sooraj and Salman together are known for, not even the emotional warmth they used to offer in their earlier films."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is Indian box office goes down The first half of PRDP flows very slow and the story moves along boringly whilst establishing the characters. The biggest problem with the movie is that the conflict doesn't seem to be too big for it to matter later on when the conflict gets solved.Prem Dilwale's too much overacting makes the film irritate you like hell. The football match sequence and the sequence where Prem mends the relationship of Vijay with his step- sisters are completely over the top ones. There are a lot of illogicalness like the placement of a palace on the edge of a waterfall. At the end of the 160 minute duration, PRDP manages to make everyone sleep and the emotions do not work at all which should in turn make the film not work even amongst the family audiences. PRDP looks completely outdated and clearly no money has been spent on the sets and the costumes. The production design is of very low standards. The VFX work is the worst you have seen in Hindi films and the editing could have been much more tighter but as we all know, Sooraj Barjatya believes in boring cinema. Himesh Reshammiya delivers a pathetic soundtrack. None of the songs stay with the viewer. And the worst one is the title track which seems to be nowhere. Each and every actor completely overacts and the one who does the most throughout the movie is Salman himself. Prem Ratan Dhan Payo can't even be thought of to be compared with classics like 'Maine Pyaar Kiya' and 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun'. The film thoroughly bores you with dull moments all over. Sure there are a lot of silly and illogical moments. And Salman Khan puts in a terrible performance as Prem Dilwala. In the first half of the film, he irritates you over time and again. Diwali is the time when families come together and PRDP will be disliked even by families as it is the most boring movie which irritates you with overacting. This festive season, avoid it for sure. It's a 0/10 rating movie to be honest, but have to give 1/10 as 0/10 is not allowed on IMDb. Sooraj Barjatya films come once in 6-7 years and there is no director in the industry who can fill a film with as much overacting as much as the he can. Advice for the youth, don't even watch it on your on TV."

The result is far from that, I guess some moments work, like when Sonam convinces the sisters to give Vijay a chance, but already the characters don't catch your interest, it's Salman and Sonam so you don't stop the movie right now, but they don't develop as they should as characters that hold your breath until the end of the movie. The story (once the swap with the prince is done) gets boring fast, and the action scenes are not remarkable. Potential spoiled as I'm sure Salman/Sonam can bring good moments together."

There are some lessons to learn out of this movie actually. And if there was 1 complaint that i could make, it would be that the movie is a bit too long...apart from that, give it a go and watch it..because to some it may not be good but for the majority would say that its a pretty good movie!!"

Moreover the screenplay is gives a beautiful environment to the screen. I bet that you love the screen selection. Mainly this is a cinema which is based on raja & maharaja. So many beautiful palaces are there in the cinema. Every song is pictured in different style. Yes there is a double role of Salman Khan. But this is the best point of the film. Better you watch on theater to get the full entertainment.\n\nOverall a Out standing Movie with put standing acting."

He has a knack of making the viewer enjoy the most slapstick and the most ridiculous of themes. Well done Salman!\n\nSonam Kapoor was charming, essaying the role of a sweet young princess rather well. She gets a lot of flak for her acting and obsession with fashion but I feel she is good in roles like this, in Bhag Milkha Bhag, Dolly ki Doli, Ranjhana and similar. Sonam gives the impression of being sweet natured in real life too. At this age if one is not fashion conscious especially being a film actress, then when should one be? Nothing wrong in that at all.\n\nAnupam Kher is a class actor and expectedly portrayed his role as the late Maharaja's trusted Dewan saheb very well indeed.\n\nPrem Ratan Dhan Payo does not pretend to be an art movie. It is out and out fairly tale entertainment with lavish sets, beautiful costumes and plenty of song and dance sequences. If anything, I found the songs too many but as I was watching on DVD I had the luxury of the fast forward button :)\n\nThe them song Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is catchy and superb. I've been humming it for quite some time and yesterday while watching the movie I cranked up the volume real high when the song played.\n\nAll in all worth a watch, though not necessarily the effort of going to the theatre. Its showing on TV on Feb 14th Valentine's Day. How apt."

Hat's off for him for showing such a courage in 21'st century where we all are loosing our family bonding's and rituals. The film is not for those audiences who wants to find the logic behind every scene or wants to use brains in every 5 min's; the film is all about love and heart; no space for your brain to judge too much.

        "review_detailed_main": "Having watched this film I found it full of emotion, funny, witty, colourful and a good story line to match. What were the people who gave it negative reviews watching? Were they asleep from over working? Were the critics so full of themselves that they cant see past there noses anymore? It was a lighthearted story, not overly complicated, simple to follow with good songs with catchy lyrics and music. The story is about princely step brothers and sisters, two boys, two girls but one father the King. Their is a love interest through Sonam Kapoor. The story revolves around an attempted assassination on Salman Khan the oldest. The princess who is due in the palace a few days later cannot be told the truth. A double role of Salman Khan steps in and takes over the story from there. I do not wish to give to much away. For those who have not watched it please do. You will enjoy it. Just loosen up a little and dont be too serious, enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "PREM RATAN DHAN PAYO has opulence in every single frame and one presumes, it's Rajshri/Sooraj's most expensive film to date. What remains consistent, however, is the intent of providing unadulterated entertainment, seamlessly merging romance, conflict, action and dollops of emotions. The supremely talented storyteller, who knows the pulse of Indian moviegoers, promises to offer a complete package in this almost 3-hour magnum opus too.\n\nIt's sacrilegious to envision any other actor enacting the part of Prem in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. When the reels unfold, you don't see Salman, you see Prem and that is one of the biggest strengths of the film. This time around, Salman is cast in a dual role -- while he takes to Prem, the simpleton, like a fish takes to water, he's equally competent as Vijay, the prince. What's interesting is, the two characters are as diverse as chalk and cheese, but it is Prem that's winsome and endearing and Salman makes sure he interprets it brilliantly. This is a Salman show from Scene A to Z.\n\nSonam Kapoor is earnest. She looks stunning, but more importantly, she carries her part effortlessly. Initially, her pairing opposite Salman did raise eyebrows, but when you watch the goings-on, you realize that Salman and Sonam do make a lovely on-screen couple.\n\nAwesome review by taran adarsh. Must Watch.!!\n\nPREM RATAN DHAN PAYO Amazing Movie & Must watch, if you like traditional culture and family values in this era."

She makes Maithili a very real person, and through her we can empathize with Prem's situation, as she enables and allows the audience to experience what she is feeling right along with her. Sonam, through her character, makes that emotional involvement possible, and it's one of the strengths of the film. And like Salman with Prem, Sonam makes Maithili a character you're going to remember.'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' is a film that offers a multitude of rewards if you are simply willing to reach out and open yourself up to it. All you have to do is to let it in. Do it, and you'll be glad you did, guaranteed. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Post their last outing \u2013 'Samrat & Co.' \u2013 an experiment which failed miserably, Rajshri are back to their principles ! To give the much needed impetus, Barjatiyas have banked on Salman \u2013 the \"Prem\" and the magic works !!! PRDP is a clean family entertainer with a good mix of everything one can think of \u2013 family drama & relationships, family emotions (extremes of enmity and love), romance, heartbreaks, a pinch of comedy and action, and good traditional feel music to back them all. The story is descent and borrows principles and feel of the epic - Ramayana, though it is predictable at times reminding of something similar which we may have seen in the past. One may find few loopholes and over-stretched scenes in the script, but they are tolerable when you compare with the overall impact created. Cinematography & graphics \u2013 the sets are lavish and visually appealing; moments are well captured & worth appreciating. Screenplay, editing & direction \u2013 sensibly thought and executed, could have been more crispier considering that it is a 3 hour long flick, nonetheless it is engaging and the length doesn't bother you too much. Dialogues \u2013 it is one of the highlights (a teaser \u2013 \"har family me problem hai, par wo khushnaseeb hai jiski family hoti hai\"). Music \u2013 HR's traditional compositions are a big plus; all songs are aptly placed and the lyrics plus music carries the mood and story forward. Performances \u2013 With Bhajrangi Bhaijaan behind and now this one, Salman's message is loud and clear \u2013 don't come to theaters for my brand, I will give you substance. Really, it is Salman as \"Prem dilwale\" all the way with his amazing screen presence, comedy and emotions. In fact, there are many goose-bump moments created by him. Sonam is pretty and has done fair justice. All side characters are excellent with special reference to the oldie \u2013 Anupam. To sum up, amidst overdose of commercial movies in recent times, this one stands out and touches you, though giving a 80's-90's feel.\n\nBottomline: \"A perfect Diwali gift for traditional cine goers\" Rating: 3.75/5"

First Bajrangi Bhaijaan and now Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, Salman Khan is turning the heat on with his acting guys. Go watch the movie , its a sure shot BLOCKBUSTER.\n\nI give it 10/10."

The man enters a dilemma when he receives love from the queen for the love he showed, but he doesn't deserve it. Can he make everything right?. Will the King come back in his full health?. He decides, he shouldn't do anything for which he will regret in future. He plays the role of the king even better than him. He brings together the families which were apart. He builds Happiness and strengthen family values. And when king is back, he returns to his humble village. But the King surprises him with a gift, the queen. After all,it is him she wanted.\n\n(This story line is similar to Singh Is King where the King don is bed ridden, the villager takes his seat and brings back peace and harmony. And loves the girl who belonged to someone else. He gives her away but she choses to be with him.)\n\nThe dresses, choreography and songs are awesome. There are plenty of songs. There is no single unwanted pixel in this movie.\n\nThis movie is the best I watched in 2015. I have seen most users complaining story is not being realistic. This is a fantasy story. If someone wants an intelligent storyline, there is 'Ex Machina'. Those who look for 'New wine' in love stories, there is 'Premam' This movie is not rediscovering any intellectual content. It portrays love, morale and beauty in its own unique way. I am sure the director has achieved everything he intended. This year in Bollywood, cheap story lines like Happy New Year succeeded and good love story like Dawat E Ishq flopped. So I wouldn't wonder if this couldn't become massive hit of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "You might want to keep off those Diwali sweets if you intend to watch Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. Indulging in both could lead to the kind of sugar overload that your doctor would most certainly disapprove of. Hum Aapke Hain Koun director Sooraj Barjatya's latest is a familiar tale that involves setting right the wrong, reuniting estranged families, and conquering hearts with basic human goodness. These are formulas he's employed to great success in previous films, but the tropes have gotten rusty, the emotions seldom feel genuine, and the writing is strictly surface level. Good thing then that the film's got Salman Khan as leading man, his abundant charisma glossing over many of its flaws.In Pritampur, an estate in North India that didn't get the memo on the abolishment of the monarchy and royal practices, Yuvraj Vijay Singh (Salman Khan) is injured in an attack by disgruntled family just days before his coronation and the arrival of his fianc\u00e9e, Princess Maithili (Sonam Kapoor). While the prince recuperates in a secret chamber within the royal fort, his lookalike Prem, a small-time entertainer from a nearby town, is discreetly recruited to take his place so the formalities can go off without a hitch.It's a testament to the star power of Salman Khan that Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is never unwatchable despite its old- fashioned story, its frankly laughable scenarios (the climax takes place in a palace of mirrors built on top of a waterfall), and its failure to flesh out characters adequately. The film revisits many of Barjatya's favorite themes \u2013 the importance of family, the enduring bond of brotherhood, and the power of forgiveness \u2013 but it has nothing particularly new to say that might justify making this film in 2015.Pre-intermission the film coasts along breezily, buoyed by the humor in the interactions between Prem and the loyal palace diwan (Anupam Kher), who's trying desperately to rein this man-child in. But melodrama reaches fever pitch in the film's shrill second half, in which an angry half-sister (Swara Bhaskar) and a conniving half- brother (Neil Nitin Mukesh) must be won over, and a trouble- making relative (Armaan Kohli) must be defeated. Meanwhile, the romantic track between Maithili and Prem packs some nice moments, including a running joke about not getting 'cozy' until they're married.Alas, the predictable plotting and the lazy characterization never really allow you to be invested in any of the film's characters or to even care for them. Make no mistake, Salman Khan is the sole draw of this film, and he works hard for his top billing. The actor is in good form \u2013 terrific in the comic scenes, and earnest in the emotional ones \u2013 turning on the charm to help you survive, and even enjoy, this nearly 3 hour film that's crammed with songs, and over-styled to a fault.I'm going with two-and-a-half stars plus an additional half star for Salman Khan, which makes it three out of five for Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. Get ready for a sugar rush."

I can't give 10 out of 10 because the second half seemed boring at certain point of time....music is sweet and melodious but as you know excess eating of sweets taste bitter. The songs took the pace off the movie and let me yawn. But as time goes the sword fight scene put some energies into it.

Sooraj Barjatya, hence proved that he cannot go wrong whenever he plans to direct Salman Khan. The acting performances were excellent especially \"Prem\" the role played by Salman Khan is a delight to watch.He was in full form and spread happiness throughout the film. He was also good in the character of \"Vijay\" but it has smaller screen time. Anupam Kher, Swara Bhaskar and Neil Nitin Mukesh did the superb job. And guys I was surprised to watch the role of \"Maithili\" astonishingly well played by Sonam Kapoor. Believe me its her best performance till date. Plus she was also a visual delight.

Salman khan highlight of movie and controls the screen ... Niel nitin mukesh even did a nice job ...\n\nStory line and movie is nice More than just watchable movie ...not a boring one rather an entertainer..."

Salman hits the right chord and the support cast steps up. Its not your typical action and cheap comedy from Bollywood. Its about the values and family that we all were raised around and came to respect. The trolls these days have lost all respect to the Indian values and ADHT does not let them watch any sensible movie. So cut to the chase and go get yourselves some Indian family entertainer that you will remember.. I saw this FDFS and was surprised to see such a clean and entertaining movie from Bollywood."

        "review_detailed_main": "Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is a soulful movie, I enjoyed every moment of it, I truly respect the sincere intention behind the movie, Salman Khan is at his best and is extremely adorable as Prem! He touched my heart yet again! The visuals are spectacular, it looks so beautiful, Sheesh Mahal and palaces are absolutely gorgeous! Everyone should watch this movie with their families in theaters , My sister and I loved it, and we are so glad that we both understand and feel the movie the same way. I've requested my elders to watch it too, they really should, because I believe this movie can change people and their way of looking at issues and solving them! It's not at all preachy, it's a very simple, subtle, meaningful and fun movie! The family problems are very real in today's world, and love & fun is the only solution to fix these problems and move past them, Love is bigger than anything else and that's all the movie is about. Prem's way of dealing with them is outstanding, If all of us are like Prem then we would have happy families and relations! Hats off to Sooraj B to attempt something like this in today's time, and he did it because he wants people to love each other, That's very noble! He has put his heart and soul into it. People who are saying that they don't like it, I can't really understand why, the only problem that makes sense is people have lost touch with their emotions, everyone needs to watch this movie with their heart, if it doesn't touch people's heart then trust me there is something wrong with those people not the movie. Movie is perfect and very much needed in today's time! And it takes guts to make a movie like this in today's time when people have diluted love so much. Today people are so out of touch with these emotions, it's all the more reason to watch this with movie with family. Please do yourself a favor and watch it with your heart! It's hearts job to see the love and purity, mind often reduces the value and sanctity of pure soulful things! I'm going to watch it again and again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Am not surprised by all the negative reviews put around this movie, which has kind of become a norm for all the Salman starred movies. But let me tell you this, most of these negative reviews are pre- conceived and based on many other assumptions.\n\nLet me ask you when was the last time you went to see a Bollywood movie with your family? At least this movie is an attempt to be an occasion to be enjoyed and savored with entire family. Agreed, that not all of us enjoy family drama in the same taste like we do other masala Bollywood flicks and there could have been better attempt at editing for some of the parts.\n\nThis movie talks about family togetherness, brother sister bonding and reminds us about many other small aspects of family values that contribute to a strong family, which is something being forgotten slowly in the busy walks of our lives. In fact such movies need to be seen by every young generation at least once as a refresher of our strong culture and traditions.\n\nWe all still mesmerize our times when we remember going to \"Hum Aapke Hai Kaun\" and \"Hum Saath Saath Hain\" with our families. I wish every parents offer this legacy to their upcoming generation.\n\nGive it a watch at least once."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm writing this because there are so many ridiculously low (1-star) ratings for this film dragging it down for no reason other than pettiness. 1 star, to me, is an unfathomably bad, extremely low-budget production, where the film crew is amateur and the writing is excruciatingly bad. That is not what this film is. From what I can tell, the extremely low ratings are just people complaining because they're used to a different style of movie from this director, but just because it's not his normal style doesn't make it BAD.\n\nI truly did enjoy this movie. Someone mentioned it being a version of The Prince and the Pauper, which is not far off, but it would be more accurate to say this is a retelling of The Prisoner of Zenda, a delightful story (in my opinion) in which a look-alike fills in for a prince and must deal with the prince's love interest while thwarting the bad guys.\n\nWhile I know nothing about the director, I thoroughly enjoyed Salman Khan's performance in this role (or, I should say, dual-role, although the look-alike is the main character). From what I can remember, the music was enjoyable, the changes to the plot interesting and cute. It's faults are it's length and a rather confusing, lengthy flashback in which the character's backstories are explained in a very strange and impossible-to-believe setting.\n\nIs it high drama? No. Is the premise believable? No. But it's cute and fun, and just about as good as Dave (another Prisoner of Zenda retelling that I love)."
