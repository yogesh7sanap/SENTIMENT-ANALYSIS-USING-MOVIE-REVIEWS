        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the \"mental illness\" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\n\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.\n\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their \"therapy\" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be \"dealt with.\"\n\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched \"isn't that bad\" or that \"she was only trying to do her job\", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\n\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in \"Mommie Dearest,\" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\n\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\n\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that \"appearances\" are not about inward reality and, worse, \"the letter kills.\"\n\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).\n\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of \"Chief\" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.\n\nBased on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.\n\nJack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.\n\nWhat can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.\n\n-10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a movie, what an excellent movie!!! That is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece. I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.\n\nThis movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...\n\nWhen the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the amazing novel by Ken Kesey, Randall Patrick McMurphy is an antisocial and dangerous man no different than a petty criminal, placed in a mental ward to have his behavior studied. He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.\n\nThe movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the \"mentally unstable\" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go \"...wow.\"\n\nMy only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches. Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters. \"Randle McMurphy\" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as \"McMurphy\", is something of a paradox. Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be? That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.\n\nMilos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later. It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds. Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax. Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me. You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward. The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.\n\nNicholson has his greatest moments in this picture. One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV. It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity. \"McMurphy\" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the \"normal routine\". He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a \"date\".\n\nLouise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as \"Nurse Mildred Ratched\". She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win. Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional. That's perfect because that is exactly who she is. Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited \"McMurphy\" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.\n\nONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated. Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together. Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused. He seems to love his compadres in the hospital. He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.\n\nThere is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST. The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the \"Chief\" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on. The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning.\n\nNOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version. Comparing a book to a movie is impossible. They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling."

The central character in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.\n\nThe movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.\n\nYes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.\n\nReally one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman, centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old, among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).\n\nOK, first of all, it has to be said, I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents, is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). However, I was left extremely disappointed with this film.\n\nWhile the first 20 minutes seem promising, showcasing Nicholsons immense talent, the film drags for the next hour, trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet, unsuccessfully, I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that \"\u0085Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history\". Based upon that assessment, I expected numerous unnecessary, unethical punishments, and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that, no instead we got a firm, cold, woman that takes charge of her ward, filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people, with an iron fist, being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said, I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked, evil, heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.\n\nWhich leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy, is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant, self-centered 'rebel', who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no, we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries, in other words, 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology, spoiling much of it.\n\nThere are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over\u0085' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed, the acting by the two leads, regardless of my objection of the use of their characters, is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work, as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.\n\nOverall however, the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such, I was left underwhelmed."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.\n\nNow I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for \"hidden\" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see \u2013 Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife \u2013 are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.\n\nBut of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that \"something\" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.\n\nIn spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the \"chronics\" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene \u2013 for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.\n\nSpeaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.\n\nOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent \u2013 a fact that should not be overlooked \u2013 but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "I cannot overrate this movie. I watched it last night so I'm writing this review with it still fresh in mind. I had high expectations knowing all the rewards that rained down on it, but the film and Jack Nicholson's performance in particular still managed to surprise me.\n\nR.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation after given a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape charges. He tries to make the most of his suspected short stay in the hospital and challenges the head nurse (Louise Fletcher) at every chance he gets.\n\nAnthony Hopkins has done a great intelligent psychopath, but no one does crazy better than Nicholson. I loved his performance in \"The Shining\" and am ashamed to say I have yet to see \"As Good as it Gets\" (one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for). He delivered an average performance in \"The Departed\" and isn't getting any younger, but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest. Watching his interaction with the other patients made me believe on some occasions I was seeing a comedy, but the movie quickly reminds us it can be just as depressing as it is funny.\n\nIt's hard to find fault with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay, good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.\n\nI've seen some hate about the ending, but in my opinion it couldn't have been better. McMurthy could have jump out of the window when he had the chance and I think most of us were rooting for him to do so, but what he does next shows the strong bond formed with his odd friends inside the hospital.\n\nThe movie left me emotionally blank for a while and then I just felt sad. I'm not going to drop any major spoilers on this site as I know some of you still haven't seen it, but it's one of the few movies that have truly left me staring at the end credits in awe.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt ranks as one of the best in my book alongside \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"Pulp Fiction\". See this movie with the highest expectations and chances are it will surpass them!\n\n250moviereviews.wordpress.com"

In charge of his ward is Nurse Ratched, who has a right control on proceedings, McMurphy challenges the order of things.\n\nLet's be honest, this film is phenomenal, and should be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nI read the description here, and I'm not a hundred percent sure I fully agree with it, for me it's more of a power struggle between Murphy and Nurse Ratched. Murphy challengers Ratched for sure, but it feels as though her battle is to get him to conform, he fights against it, and wants to give some life back to the patients.\n\nFor such a serious and bleak setting, there's actually a lot of humour, it drops to some real lows, but the laughs and lighter moments are so uplifting.\n\nJack Nicholson, what can you say, is this one of the greatest performances of all time? I'd say you could make a strong case for it. The supporting cast are awesome, nobody puts a single foot wrong, acting perfection, Louise Fletcher, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito etc, sublime.\n\nThe direction is phenomenal, this is a startling looking movie, and one thing this film has is originality, sheer originality, there is nothing quite like it.\n\nAt least I now understand the Netflix Ratched series, and the link that has to this movie.\n\nYou could watch this film 1000 times, and it would still be as good.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.\n\nJack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.\n\nLousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.\n\nRandall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\n\nI think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.\n\nThe supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.\n\nThe second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved all of them.\n\nRated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity."

The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality. The daily routines in the mental institute would even drive a normal person completely bonkers. I saw this movie so many times without getting bored once. This is truly one of the best movies in that genre."

Nice try by Nicholson, but he just wasn't the right...something (physical build? Attitude?\n\nI don't know). Only two novels have, imho, made the transition from book to screen faithfully - 'Gone With The Wind' and 'The Godfather' (1&2). 'Cuckoo's Nest' isn't a bad movie on its own, just a bad adaptation."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the \"Booby Hatch\" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show \"Taxi\" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" were in the T.V. Show \"Taxi\" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was \"Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay\"... In the \"normal\" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as \"sad\" and platitudes such as \"we will do all we can\" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!\n\n\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say, he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication, and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate, and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson, they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him, however, if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four, the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make, just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance, rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of \"Well!!\" \"What do you expect!!\" \"This guy is mentally ill\"\n\nI have never seen a film like this one!! \"Woman Under The Influence\" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" however, is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director, Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched, her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless, her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned, Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy, the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film, maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.\n\nThat may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.\n\nSo Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.\n\nThe state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.\n\nIt's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.\n\nThough the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them.\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.\n\nLouise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now."

Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster."

But really, it kind of turned out to be an \"Of Mice and Men\" kind of story where two guys dream of going far away and living good lives. This did not really fit in with the movie. However, another part of the conclusion was good where the main idea of the movie was strongly portrayed. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give any thing away, but it involves someone other than the main character dying. So, I would say that the movie is good, but not great. It does not measure up to Milos Forman's other films like Amadeus, Man on the Moon, and Hair."

Firstly, movie is very hypocritical in its treatment of the patients by wanting us to feel compassion (fair enough) while making fun of their afflictions. There is the lead actor. Nicholson's performance is fine, if he's playing Jack Nicholson but what's all this anti-hero talk. McMurphy comes across as a completely selfish and self-eserving figure, without much humanity or compassion for others. Louis Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched in a somnambulistic state, dreary monotone and is about as threatening as Audrey Hepburn. Milos Forman's direction is uneven and reflects the hypocrisy of the entire project. This man must surely be one of the most over-rated directors of the era as well.\n\n'Cuckoo's Nest' (the title alone proves the hypocrisy point)is'nt one-tenth the movie Nashville is and mainly won all its awards strictly because audiences of the time (and still apparently now)seem to fall for its phony pandering, false emotions and blatent audience manipulation. If these comments help bring the picture down a bit from its lofty position on the top 250 list, then I have done my duty."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the things that makes this a contender for best film ever is that you couldn't possibly make it any better than Milos Forman did in 1975. Modern filming, editing, sound recording and set design techniques couldn't improve what is, essentially, a perfect film.\n\nJack Nicholson's performance is often cited as one of the greatest by any actor, but everyone in this film executes their roles perfectly. Sydney Lassick is outstanding as Cheswick, character-actor Brad Dourif gives a career best, Lousie Fletcher was rightfully honoured with an oscar; even the minor actors like Christopher Lloyd and William Redfield and hit the mark perfectly.\n\nThe script is sharp and incisvie. The music is used reservedly to poignant effect. There's laughter; there's tears; there are complex character and hidden depth to everyone except 'the chronics'. The patients are a perfectly assembled spectrum of mental illness; every one hiding some degree of emotional damage or abuse. The way they react to McMurphy's introduction is amusing at times and heart-wrenching at others.\n\nJust watch Jack Nicholson's reactions during the first group-therapy session as he realises the passive-aggressive perfection of Nurse Ratched's control over those men. Never has there been a more unlikely build-up of protagonist to villain. McMurphy waltzes onto the ward looking for an easy escape and ends up becoming the unlikeliest of heroes to some chronically neglected people. It's almost like a Western: the antihero arrives in town looking for his own personal gain and ends up taking on the cruel sherrif who runs the place. Except, in this western, the sherrif has a clipboard and a haircut that may or may not have been deliberately sculpted into horns.\n\nThe ending is perfect too, albeit devastating.\n\nIf you've never seen this film, this is one classic you won't regret seeing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.\n\nA funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.\n\nFor the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on \"Billy.\"\n\nJack Nicholson's character, \"Randle Patrick McMurphy,\" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.\n\nWho could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?\n\nYes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.\n\nThis is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated."

        "review_detailed_main": "Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5\" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's \"therapy\" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, \"you idiot.\" When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a \"background movie.\" Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just rewatched this movie on Netflix after last seeing it for the first time some 35 years ago. Still a masterpiece. The strength of this movie is in acting by the whole cast. Not just main characters. To the effect that I would have given Oscar for the best support actor to that hydrocephal dude who never had even a line in the movie.\n\nAt the core of the movie is the theme of individual freedom vs conformal adjustment to the rules of the society, brainwashing and questioning of how the so called democracy really works. The asylum is a microcosm of the society outside at large. It is opressing but at the same time a safe and predictable environment for some of the misfits (who could leave anytime they wanted, but they never do). An illustration to \"If you give up freedom in the name of security you end up with neither\". Well, may be with \"maximum security\".... So the movie is just brilliant. Everybody shines, even the younger nurse, her wide boggly eyes. It is her who utters the famous \"It is medicine. It is good for you.\"\n\nOne thing that set the movie apart is that hero/villain combo breaks the usual stereotype of good/evil. McMurphy, who is our hero here, is nothing but. He is a cunning criminal thug who is truly dangerous. And Nurse Ratched? She is just doing her job. And from the looks of it, she has been doing it well according to existing standards. That is before McMurphy showed up. Here arrives a cantankerous, uhinged but charismatic fella who starts questioning the rules that she so carefully designed and implemented. She takes it as a challenge. Which was a mistake, because this is how she set her carefully built system on the path of unravelling. She should have sent him back to jail, instead she took it personally and decided to \"break the bastard\". I could almost sympathize with her."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were? That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is: a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.\n\nI'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film: R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of \"authority\".\n\nThat authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure: icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate: a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as \"serious\". Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.\n\nThis is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.\n\nThe hospital itself if juxtaposing: the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying: Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.\n\nDespite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4/10"

As it is she's little better than an extremely well-performed Disney villain, malevolent and rigid to the end. I can check out The Little Mermaid if I want that.\n\nIf you want to feel oppressed by inherently corrupt authority figures, here's your movie. If you expected something that presents you with a moral dilemma, you'll come away disappointed. In particular, anyone who's read the book will have the sensation that it's been stomped flat in the process of being adapted for the screen."

This film is about people, whether they're mentally ill or not.\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is about a convict who fakes being mentally ill in order to get himself out of prison labour. He tries to make the best out of his time in a mental health hospital/asylum as he deals with an obnoxious nurse.\n\nThis movie is about individuality, making the best out of what you have, escapism, explores the mind and it's way of working and thinking, the movie explores numerous themes as for it's mental exploration throughout characters and actions.\n\nMilos Forman did a brilliant job on this film, his camerawork to create diversity between each character, his presentation of characters struggles, tragedies, etc. It is all very delicately but messily done. Keep in mind, when I say messily, I mean it as a good thing, no perfect film is actually perfect as the perfect film has flaws which it uses to only make it more unique, diverse, and better. Forman's directing is really special in this film, the way he can work with such a diverse bunch of characters/casting is so incredible and needs to be seen to be believed. The way Forman reveals or presents parts of the script is great too.\n\nThe screenplay is only incredible, it's way of characters and adaptation from the book is some amazing craftsmanship. To create the character development through each character from its experiences and more. It's reveals, it's tragedies, it's actions, all are so very unique, the entire situation from the start has its own share of spectacularity to it.\n\nIt's so easy to say such things about any aspects of any film, calling it spectacular, unique, and whatnot. Film reviews such as this one will only work if we're able to call out or name what makes these films what they are. I call Formans work on this film great, but what about it is great? The camerawork, for example? Sure, so what is it about the camerawork that makes it such a great factor to be listed in the review. This is where most reviewers stop, now sure you can say you don't want to spoil it but I think that's a terrible excuse. To further expand, Forman's camerawork on the film is great but it tells the mental state of each character, whether they're scared, sad, mentally ill, or sane. In most of the therapy session scenes, these methods are used for close ups or medium close ups for each character which I noticed and thought was very well done. To continue my rant, I will begin actually analyzing parts of these films that I review for my own good, if I do this, maybe I'll pick up on these methods or whatever you want to call them and use them when making a film or script myself.\n\nThe cinematography of the film is nothing out of this world, as someone who enjoys cinematography as an aspect of any film, when I don't see something outstanding or super meaningful in a films cinematography, I don't really see it as much which is my problem. OFOTCN cinematography might be outstanding but I wouldn't know as for my lack of knowledge on the subject. Maybe a further focus on the lighting of a film or whatever will do me better as for the analyzation of its cinematography.\n\nThose this film is about people, characters, finding themselves in a way, it helps you find yourself, it has helped me find a new direction in these reviews or film overall.\n\nOFOTCN definitely, one million percent, deserves a watch, and I'll be rewatching again someday too, and again. Because for what I know, this film helps me as much as McMurphy helped his 'inmates' find a part of themselves once again."

        "review_detailed_main": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.\n\nMany films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.\n\nThe movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.\n\nIn conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film."

I suppose it was alright, but with all the praise it has received (including being so high on IMDB's list), I expected more than I got.\n\nThe main problem I had with the movie was that I didn't care for the characters at all. Sure, there were some scenes that were interesting and provided a nice glimpse into one character or the other, but, for the most part, I couldn't find a way to sympathize with any of them. Jack Nicholson did alright in this film, but, at times, I actually disliked his character and what he was doing. As for the other people in the ward, they did a good job, but, again, I just didn't sympathize with them. Louise Fletcher, however, did a superb job as Nurse Ratchet; her icy demeanor was perfect. Again, though, I just didn't, well... dislike her.\n\nI didn't find the plot, flow, or atmosphere to be strong enough to make up for the apathy I felt towards the characters (and one would guess that, in a movie such as this, it's critical to one's enjoyment that they care about the characters). While there were some great scenes in the movie, those scenes just weren't enough for me to really like the movie. I thought the movie was overall, bland and uninteresting, and certainly not deserving of all the praise it received."

Jack Nicholson is stellar as always but in this role in particular, he just knocks it out of the park.You can recognize some early faces of major celebrities such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito. I've heard that the movie differs from the book but knowing the changes I think it still works. I don't really care about the Oscars but thank god this one got recognized back then, it would have been a crime to not prize this movie. Another thing I can say about this movie is it's subtlety. The main character isn't exactly an hero and the \"antagonist\" can't quite be categorized as a villain. It's up to your interpretation. I thought that was a nice to this masterpiece."

He plays a believable Jack-the-Lad, the kind you knew at some point in your life: annoying to some, endearing to others. However you viewed the Jack in your life, he always had time for you, perhaps even changed you in some way.\n\nBut this isn't just his story, that's the beauty of his character: he has time for everyone and thus you feel the stories of the other characters in that Nest, you might relate with some too, or at least recognise someone.\n\nAnd Nurse Ratched? If you don't know anything about her character best to stop reading about this film and just watch it.\n\nUndoubtedly the best mental-asylum film ever, without trope...just bags of humanity (all shades of it)."

        "review_detailed_main": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 drama film by Milos Forman about the inmates in a mental institution and their struggles against the nurse in charge.\n\nThe film portrays the impact of the arrival of a new patient at the ward of a mental institution run with an iron fist by authoritarian Nurse Ratchet. Ratchet maintains control over all aspects of the patient's lives by whatever means necessary, intimidation, humiliation, and rigged competitions being common techniques. A rebel attempting to escape the labour of a short prison sentence, RP McMurphy finds the patients being oppressed by the authorities in the institution. Being an anti-establishment type, he continuously butts heads with Nurse Ratchet, and the struggle for the autonomy of the patients escalates.\n\nThe film is shot in a clear, straightforward, and compelling manner, eschewing complicated cinematography for clarity and simplicity. This manner of filming allows the characters to be the focus of the scenes, and the actors take full advantage of this. Nicholson and Fletcher are perfect in their roles, and their scenes together make for some of the best drama in film.\n\nAn excellent story whose style accentuates the strengths of the film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not to be missed."

The predictability and dumbing down is rising to levels that makes the food inside me almost rise too.\n\nCase in point: the Chief. Will Sampson played deaf and dumb convincingly, until Murphy found out that he wasn't deaf and dumb at all. From that point on the Chief had metamorphosed into somebody who could hear, and the movie viewers were implicitly invited to pretend like the nursing staff hadn't noticed. Every time something was said, you could see the Chief react. But only for the viewers' sakes, of course. Wouldn't want them to not understand what had happened. Bad case of disbelief kicking in.\n\nStill, and entertaining movie, just not a very good one."

One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is definitely one of those movies that would not be made the same if made today, and as far as I can tell, it is actually pretty accurate for the way mental hospitals worked at the time. The story of a sane man playing crazy and then trying to make the other patients sane while making the nurses crazy, it just has to be seen to be believed. The story is interesting and kinda heartbreaking in the end, (note to self, never fall asleep during an escape attempt, bad things will happen) and it has a great young cast that has gone on to do some great things with Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif all turning in terrific performances. And yeah, Nurse Ratched is just plain evil.

I was talked awesomely about this film, and I wanted to see how good it really was.\n\nWhen I started, I could't move away from my TV's screen, 'cause what I was watching, was a real \"Good Film\". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Randy McMurphy was fantastical, also Louis Fletcher and Brad Dourif, who surprised me very much.\n\nUntil the end, I was enjoying this \"must-see masterpiece\" without caring about the fact I knew how it would conclude, so, when the time came, I started to feel like talking to McMurphy, literally, to make him aware of what would happen to him. I was caring about Jack Nicholson's character, something Milos Forman nailed.\n\nI won't say what happens, because that's something you need to find out, but what I can say, is that I almost cried. The soundtrack, the acting, the cinematography, everything just before the credits is perfect.\n\nI really recommend this film, if you haven't watched it yet.\n\nThank you Milos Forman, for one of the best films I've seen."

Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.\n\nAnyway, I certainly do not always concur with the choices of the Academy Awards committee, but it was the right decision that \"One Flew...\" triumphed in the five main categories, and this in spite of the tough competition that year (\"Dog Day Afternoon\", \"Jaws\", \"Barry Lyndon\", ...). When your film is considered the best in those five areas, including best script and best film altogether, you can safely conclude it's pretty close to perfection. The story is definitely one of the most absorbing ones ever told, with courageous themes and utmost fascinating characters, and strengthened by the flawless performances of the ensemble cast. The authenticity of the asylum setting, Jack Nitzsche's music, the cinematography and about half a dozen other things all contribute to its pure genius."

Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book."

        "review_detailed_main": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most beloved classics of all-time and features Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man who's been ordered by a court to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a mental hospital. McMurphy doesn't show signs of mental illness, but he does have a strong anti-authoritarian impulse, and he establishes himself as a leader among the inmates shortly after his arrival. He's an obvious wild card in an otherwise stable population of patients who are tightly controlled by Nurse Ratched, played to chilling perfection by Louise Fletcher. Ratched employs a host of manipulative suppression techniques to keep the patients under her thumb, and McMurphy becomes her nemesis, attempting to subvert her authority wherever possible. The film, which swept the Academy Awards, on a surface level is about the personal struggle between the ideologies of the two major characters, but it can also be viewed as a metaphor for the culture wars of the 60s and 70s. The film also powerfully illuminates the oppression of the mentally ill under a system incapable of treating them with dignity, as they are stripped of their humanity and kept out of sight from society."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first thing to say about this movie, perhaps, is \"beware of the other reviews!\" (lol) Actually, as is common with reviews on this website, many of the otherwise well-written reviews of this movie found here contain factual errors that are not necessarily insignificant to understanding both the plot and theme. (In that regard, this comment pertains only to the movie, not the book.)\n\nThat said, this is yet another film like COOL HAND Luke or MISTER ROBERTS that deals with the theme of a small group of men under the thumb of a petty but truly malevolent tyrant, in this case the now-notorious Nurse Ratched. Jack Nicholson is the agent provocateur classic to this genre who challenges not only the authority but the actual control the tyrant has been able to exercise up to the point of his entry into the setting, and of course that cannot be tolerated. Given that in this vehicle this kind of action is taking place in a mental hospital rather than a prison or naval vessel, it also raises the question as to what ought to be considered sanity for confinement purposes, at least in a very abstract or philosophical sense. For this is one of those movies that is not at all realistic, really, but a morality play. Thus, in spite of the look of the thing and the inclusion of electroshock \"therapy\" and the lobotomy, real mental illness is not realistically depicted, nor is there any reason to. That's really not the point.\n\nProbably the best reason to see this, then, is to see Jack Nicholson as one of the ultimate movie wise-guy personas of all time. One can't help but wonder what what James Cagney or even Humphrey Bogart would have had to say about this performance; I don't feel that either of those greats (or so many more, even including Paul Newman or Sean Connery) ever did anything so compelling. As the anti-authoritarian foil to the villain's oppression, he is about beyond compare. Add to that Louise Fletcher's cold-blooded, pathologically manipulative control freak (the one who really needs to be institutionalized to stop her from hurting people) and a top-notch supporting cast who later became quite famous in other vehicles including Danny DeVito (with HAIR!), Christopher Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers and this picture walks off with the Triple Crown of the Academy Awards. Worth every bit of the praise its generally given, it is must-see cinema for the true movie connoisseur."

Truly great acting by all cast members. Nicholson is at his very best. The ending was perfect. Not sure that if they were to make the film now it would end but I think that makes the film more real. Danny De Vito is great. Josep Elic is memorable. the card game is absolute class. Sydney Lassick is masterful. Christopher Lloyd albeir ina slightly cameo role is at his very best (perhaps matched by his role in taxi). William duell is excellent as Sefelt and is reminiscent of Stan Laurel. However, other than Jack Nicholson, it really is Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit who steals the show. I would class his as one one of the most memorable characters from any film I have watched over the past forty years. Cannot praise it enough"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is about the triumph of the human spirit, but it's depressing as hell.\n\nJack Nicholson gave the last of his great performances before he started playing parodies of himself, and Louise Fletcher plays one of the screen's greatest villains, the only role this forgotten actress was really ever known for. Their battle of wills in a mental institution symbolizes the battle of humanity against oppressive authoritarianism, and if Nicholson's character happens to lose this particular battle, the movie implies, humanity is determined to win the war.\n\nLooked at now in historical context, this film was one of the last gasps of anti-establishment film making. Vietnam was ending, American political corruption was starting to fade into memory, and the boom years of the 1980s were not far away. \"Cuckoo's Nest\" stands as one of the supreme examples of what made 1970s film making great.\n\nGrade: A+"

        "review_detailed_main": "Jack Nicholson is a great actor. Not a great actor, an spectacular actor. This is one of the great films of his career as well as for the rookies, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments ... who could forget the icy glare of the demonic Louise Fletcher, The dialogs of Jack Nicholson and Will Sampson, his impressive performance often without saying a word.\n\nThe film shows the terrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions at the time, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to leave, to change things for himself and the others. I grabbed the movie, from the first second. I never took my eyes off the screen, and surely i will reflect on the film for a while, I thought it was great the way the movie shows the hospital portrayed as something more like a prison than a hospital.\n\nMilos Forman did a great job of making this very powerful contrast to the viewer. The movie is very exciting and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Each actor gives a great performance, each character is perfectly connected with the movie, every line, every frame is absolutely perfect. I would not change a thing in this movie. He has a great pace, never loses interest, the almost 140 minutes duration, goes very quickly that i didn't even realize. I only saw this movie once, but sure I'll see many more times in the coming years.\n\nI recommend this amazing piece of great cinema for anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or a fan of any of the actors they are all on their prime, odd as it is the debut of almost all of them Anyway a Masterpiece with capital M that deserves to be seen and revised every once in a while and should never be forgotten. My vote is 10.\n\nTitle (Portugal) - \"Voando Sobre Um Ninho de Cucos\" (\"Flying over a nest of cuckoos\")"

However, after reading the book, my opinion has definitely diminished a bit. The screenplay seems to consist simply of events of action only. The best parts of the book were the emotional rollercoasters the patients go through. Most of the best parts of the book were completely left out erasing much of the battle between Ratchet and McMurphy. I also missed the use of p.o.v through Chief Bromden's eyes. Overall, it was a great movie with unbelievable acting, however a sadly mediocre script seemed to leave out a great emotional story with an unbelievable theme."

The \"Chief\" in the movie is a good side kick of reality for Jacks character. The reality is also that of what happens to people once put into a insane asylum. Crazy or not. Many times the movie brings you to think, \"what if it was me\"? I watch very few movies twice. This is a picture that you can do that !

It clearly was a direct and frontal indictment on the mental health care system of the day, when antiquated and primitive methods of treating patients with mental illness were still being used. The movie indeed had a lasting effect on the study and treatment of mental illness afterward.\n\nThe movie presents a difficult subject for many to comprehend and appreciate given the natural perception of many towards mental illness. The movie was a complete success thanks in great part to a well assembled cast of actors, who played complex and vulnerable individuals trapped in circumstances not of their own making. The movie portraits very well the conflict between stern disciplinarians, technically-apt (impractical and unwise) professionals and social custodians vs. the carefree and unfortunate individuals in society, that still is relevant today."

        "review_title": "Just a Cinema Classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a Drama film that is just a classic of cinema and contains performances that are near unmatched. With clashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of mental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also a dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did have a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was solidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.\n\nThe story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other Oscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and the movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating to watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of you, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time lists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly done, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings the best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.\n\nJack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet excitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his character is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema history. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean VERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and her chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to the already high quality film.\n\nMilos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether Nicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the directing involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I enjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that means the film is never too serious or something that is always dark, it has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is haunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is in a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help them, score goes with it excellently.\n\nSo hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this is a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the movie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality we are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the actual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all the actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to them Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't there fault.\n\nIf you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises legendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do movies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for you, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and trust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time. For Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly his best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past the 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.\n\nOverall it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will add I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this movie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling the best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the performances are also some of the best. Another good thing this movie does is not to make mental disease seem just stupid and silly, they actually have hearts the characters and can be very nice at times, very great to see such things happening."

Jack Nicholson was far beyond the boundaries of amazing with his performance. Randle Mcmurphy is one of the best characters of all time, and Jack Nicholson was perfect for the part.\n\nOkay, so the movie takes place in a mental institute because Mcmurphy pretends to be crazy so he can go to a mental institute instead of going to jail. He doesn't realize that the institute is in fact worse than prison itself. However, he does make friends with patients of the institute. He soon makes friends with The Chief (Not that other guy from Halo), the only Indian throughout the whole movie. I don't want to spoil anything about the character but he is just as amazing as Mcmurphy in terms of character and likability.\n\nI'll stop there in terms of the plot. Watch the movie to truly understand how gorgeous this movie really is. This movie could possibly make you cry, so get tissues just in case. Maybe this movie could help promote mental institutes being horrible Nazi-like places.\n\nP.S. If you thought PIXAR movies could really get to you big time in terms of emotion, WATCH OUT, 'cause this nearly breaks the emotional barrier of PIXAR movies. It breaks your heart.\n\nGorgeous movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good character development and grade A+++ script and A+++ tear-jerking."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having heard all the pop culture references regarding Nurse Ratched over my life I expected her to be an evil abusive psychopath. It turns out she was just doing her job. Jail/prison guards today make Nurse Ratched look like a sweet little pussycat. The things they say and do to people are truly inhumane. Ratched was a woman in charge of a mental ward full of men, she had to stay in control or the whole place would turn into a mess. You never see her haul a patient into a corner with no security cameras and beat the crap out of them do you?\n\nShe did shame a patient pretty badly but considering the mess she walked into that morning her response was pretty mild, it's not like she killed him or even touched him. Plus, she told the orderly to stay with him and the orderly disobeyed. The real screwups were the orderlies, who spent more time shooting hoops than watching the patients, and the night watchman who wanted to get drunk and laid. I couldn't help but laugh while he was crying \"This is my job!\", like he somehow expected a different outcome to his actions. Come on... You know everyone but the nurses got fired after all that.\n\nOverall, it's a good movie. At no point in the 2 hour runtime did I feel bored or the need to play with my phone. I don't hold it to the mythical standing that others seem to but I was pleasantly entertained. I totally didn't recognize Danny DeVito until seeing his name listed on IMDb. His looks changed drastically between this movie and 3 years later when Taxi started. It was also funny to see how many of the actors would later appear in multiple Star Trek series and movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest about a decade or ago for the first time and found it quite entertaining. It was also interesting to see how many before-they-were-famous actors were in this movie. It was almost like an audition for their future careers to come! The last 30 minutes were, and still is, a roller coaster ride. Watching the movie recently, with an older perspective on life and social issues, I'm finding the movie isn't so perfect. I guess you could look at a movie as a metaphor for society and that Jack represents being an individualist and bucking the system. If you're into that approach to living, then you'll totally relate to his character. On the other hand, if you prefer social order and routine, his behavior will be seen as disruptive and anarchistic. My view on Nurse Ratched has slightly changed over the years. When I first watched the movie, I saw her as the huge villain. But on repeated viewing, I still see has somewhat manipulative, but not a huge villain. I mean, she does punish people based on them doing something wrong, as opposed to, just doing it randomly. I think the whole TV situation definitely put her on the wrong side of things. But it ultimately was a bit of a power struggle between Nicholson's Mac and Ratched. The thing is, the inmates were not feeling like they were missing much. In fact, as Ratched put it, they were in there on their own voluntary choice. Naturally it makes sense, considering these were not violent mental patients. Now, the one thing I think everyone disagrees upon is the electroshock therapy and lobotomy approach to treating these individuals. There's no disputing that. But I think in some way, this movie did a disservice by putting people who can't take care of themselves in society, in a wrong light. Like they were imprisoned rather than being looked after. Sadly, today, something like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest doesn't exist because so many people with mental health issues, who should be institutionalized, have been given a bottle of pills and told to look after themselves, on their own. I know I digress, but I guess the overall message could be, do people who cannot care for themselves, need to be emancipated? Or should it be accepted that they do better when they are in an environment that looks after their needs 24/7? Unfortunately the last 30 minutes of the movie kind of throw all the messages out the window, with violence. Or is that what it's all about as well? As much as you try to control through passive aggressive measures, the violence is always bubbling just below the surface."

The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The role of semi psychotic outspoken agitating Randle P Mcmurphy was given to Jack Nicholson. Personally I think no one could perform that role so perfectly than Jack had done. He was marvelous and outstanding and very much convincing .All the cast consisted of reputed actors as Danny Devito, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyds (debutant) as Jack's psychotic mates Nurse Ratched is considered most coldly monstrous villains in film history. Louise Fletcher intelligently acted as a soft spoken villainous nurse Ratched .No doubt that the movie kept you stimulating throughout and it's hard to forget the impression that it makes on your minds for a long time. One of its kind and must see movie\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085. Won five major category Oscars including best picture, best actor, best actress, best director and best adopted screenplay. Second movie of its time to achieve this distinguished honor after \"It happened one night\" Silence of the lambs\" is the third movie to be given this honor."

        "review_detailed_main": "One flew Over the Coo- Koo's Nest is the powerful story of one man, who gets thrown into a mental hospital and makes a difference n the patients lives. This person is Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson. Randle, who is an ex-convict being put in a mental hospital, tries to just be himself in the place and tries to break out. He has some smart remarks made to the nurse of the place, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who is a cold nurse. A nurse who is not tempted into doing anything and I mean anything, unless it's \"her way.\" The nurse's character is still considered one of the coldest characters in movie history.\n\nThe movie has a lot of action and always keeps you entertained. It has a lot of interaction between the characters, which is good, because you get to know them well. You see the change undergoing between the patients there after they meet Randle, and start rebelling against Nurse Mildred Ratched. It shows how they like to disagree with Nurse Mildred. One of the biggest characters to change was the character Chief. He went form doing almost nothing to moving around and even speaking but only speaking to Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy.\n\nThe director of the movie, Milos Forman, had different actors in mind for certain parts of the film, made the right decision in the actors that he chose. The cast is very well casted, and most of them went on to so other movies, Including Danny Devito, who got his start in this film. Devito would later star in the hit TV series Taxi. Christopher Lloyd, who also appears in the movie, also starred in this series with Devito.\n\nThough based on the book, the movie almost butchers it, according to the books author, Ken Kesey. He was saying that he would never watch the movie in its entirety. This is surprising due to the fact that the movie launched may careers and won 5 Oscars and was the seco9nd movie to win all of the main categories. The film in addition won 6 golden globes, in many of the categories it won Oscars for. The films success makes it one of the greatest films made, even by today's standards. It even ranks #12 on IMDb.com's top 250 films. The movie is very, very powerful.\n\nThe ending has big twist and you probably wont believe it to be true, but its really the ending that makes the movie what it is today. Without the way it ends, The movie would be next to nothing as a movie, and probably a waste of time for you to see. But that is why Milos foreman is a good director, and Jack Nicolson a good actor.\n\nOne flew Over the CooKoo's Nest is one of those rare movie that you watch and instantly fall in love with this one. It is a powerful and moving film that will forever capture you heart and really change you. It makes you see what's on the inside. This movie introduces a lot of talent, like Jack Nicholson, Danny Devito, and Christopher Lloyd. It's surprising how a movie like this isn't #1, but it good for where it's at. I personally would give this movie a 10 out of 10 and it deserves all of it"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is nothing that I can say or add that will testify to the greatness of this cinematic masterpiece. Many of the viewers here, considerably older and more familiar with writing critical reviews have already decked this work of art with all the glistening lace of high-brow comments it deserves. Still my concise and modestly candid opinion can nudge itself comfortably in the microcosm of viewer appreciation. I can start by saying that I saw this film two years ago and although I haven't seen it since, the theme and acting is so livid and memorable that it's as if I saw it yesterday. Ken Kessey's novel provides the essence of the story which is beautifully woven and crafted into first person through the perspective of Chief Bromden. Fans of the novel are not only delighted by the crisp, descriptive rendering of Chief's character but also of the characters of the patients of the ward of whom protagonist Randall Patrick McMurphy consists. He at once rejects the policies of the ward which are distinctly aimed at subjecting the patients to a systematic, vegetative mode of life from which there is no escaping. There were scenes in the film when tears welled from my eyes mainly when the other patients acknowledged that they were free to leave the ward at any time, but were afraid. The famous 'you should be bird-doggin' chicks and bangin' beaver' quote from McMurphy after he is stunned by patients' divulgence made me smile at its humor but sympathetic towards his situation.\n\nThe ward staff are also beautifully rendered and at once realistically strict and unflinching in their tempers. The chief of staff, Nurse Ratched is the most implacable of the ward employees as she does her best to suppress the freedoms of the patients to as great an extent as possible. McMurphy rivals her, or as the book indicates, is at war in a battle field over her strictures and insinuations. The climax of their dispute seems to end when McMurphy is strangling the life out of her with his hands like vice grips delving her throat until the blood flows to her face and cheeks. At this juncture, there seemed a remote chance that McMurphy had won the battle, but here, Ken Kessey shows Nurse Ratched's despotic wield of authority. Although it seems destined, the death of McMurphy's mind through lobotomy and then his physical death at the hands of the chief conclude the film on an idyllically sad note.\n\nRandall Patrick McMurphy's fictitious existence is just a small example of the mavericks in society who have risen up against powers which threatened to be far greater than their own. They have stood at the doorstep of impossibility and shattered it through courage and forbearance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.\n\nR.P. McMurphy (Fondly regarded as Mac or Randall) has to fight a nurse in a mental institution and before he fails he brought one man, freedom. The Chief got free and indeed freed Mac too. Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson).\n\nMiss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.\n\nWatch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.\n\nThe lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it.\n\nThis is a 5/5 movie and one of the finest pictures known for acting, it's a triumph even in tragedy."

Nothing really happens, there are flaws in the story, and are you supposed to think that head nurse is evil? I never thought so, she was just doing her job or what?

Star Wars and Jaws are two 70's movies that are better than this one. I give it a 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It has been almost 40 years since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest first entered cinemas but its impact has not diminished. Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films to win the 'Big 5' at the Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and Film) and it is easy to see why. Jack Nicholson excels in the lead role as Randle P. McMurphy, a streetwise conman faking mental illness so he can spend his time in a hospital rather than a jail cell.\n\nNicholson draws on all his talents as he does battle with the despicable Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, who seems to revel in the torment she inflicts on her patients. The conflict between these two characters is the driving force in the film, as Ratched strives to maintain order in the face of Nicholson's gleeful anarchy.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about Cuckoo's Nest is how funny it is. There is always a danger, when making a film about mental illness, that the subject matter becomes too dark and depressing. Cuckoo's Nest is able to avoid this by populating the hospital with a number of memorable, and funny, characters. Rather than laughing at the patients and their illnesses, the movie explores their idiosyncrasies and, with stellar support from the likes of Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, never threatens to mock the characters.\n\nDirector Milos Forman handles the pacing perfectly, with the movie flitting between comedy and drama with ease and never once feeling like it is overstaying its welcome. For a film almost exclusively set in one location, it moves along at a rollicking pace, with McMurphy pushing Ratched closer and closer to her limit, until we reach the absolute gut punch of an ending.\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an absolute classic \u2013 one of those instances where everything just seems to work together to create something truly special. It contains, arguably, Jack Nicholson's greatest performance, a cracking script handled perfectly by a talented director and one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history. If you are a movie fan and have not yet checked this out, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy."

This movie excels on so many levels: acting, cinematography, storyline, directing, music, and intelligence. Added together, this is one of the most amazing movies to ever hit the big screen.\n\nJack Nicholson is amazing as McMurphy, who's \"crazy to be in a loony bin like this.\" That loony bin is where the story is told; it is one of isolation, of human fears, of human mind, and of human triumph. Nicholson has had many great performances, such as Chinatown and The Shining, but this is the movie that made his mark. He is very convincing as a maybe-crazy, maybe-sane man.\n\nThen there is Louise Fletcher as the calm and very consistent Nurse Ratched. Her performance was simply brilliant. Supporting performances from Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Douriff are also terrific.\n\nThe storyline is one of thought provocation. After watching this film, one should (and hopefully will) wonder who was crazy and who was not. Many of the people were simply scared of society, others couldn't handle their fears, some were legitimately \"out there,\" but who exactly knows? That is the beauty of this film. It asks many questions: What makes one \"crazy\"? How has society defined it? How do we react to it? What can we do about it?\n\nOne Flew also contains the best climax to ever be shown on screen. It is probably the most powerful moment to ever be viewed. The ending is also tremendous and tremendously performed.\n\nCinematography was excellent and added to the feeling of isolation. The music was terrific; I recommend owning the soundtrack. Milos Forman did a tremendous job in bringing everything together to make this film a simple masterpiece.\n\nMany people wonder what class this film belongs to: comedy, drama, or comedy-drama. This is a question mark because there are elements of both comedy and drama, but it can be viewed, I think, in all three ways/styles. I can definitely say, though, that this film is a classic.\n\nRating: 10/10"

Nurse Ratched was not an awful person, in my opinion. She was merely trying to do her job. Thanks largely to this movie influencing the public's negative perception of mental institutions, many patients were eventually turned out and wound up homeless."

Jack Nicholson is perfect. He plays a wisecracking man who defies all authority. Louise Fletcher plays the infamous Nurse Ratched. She is absolutely perfect. All of the actors in this film perform very well.\n\nThe pacing is perfect and the runtime is short for the source material.\n\nMilos Forman has made films, that on paper seem mundane and boring, that capture the mind and soul. He is a master of storytelling.\n\nPros: Funny yet disturbing story, a great character study, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and how Milos Forman can create such intriguing and capturing films\n\nCons: The film is rather old but it holds up in most parts. The acting can seem outdated and the cameras used for the film make the film seem grainy\n\nOverall Rating: 9.4"

By this time it has been well-established that this is a truly great film, with an excellent multi-layered script and an absolutely brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. However, I think the true strength of this movie is partially in the supporting roles. The supporting cast never turns into lame caricatures of mental patients, all of them give very realistic performances. Their characters are mentally unstable, but they're still real people you can side with. They're likable guys, and they need to be because otherwise the contrast with nurse Ratched wouldn't work out. Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, in my opinion these guys add just as much to the movie as Nicholson does. Furthermore, this film has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. It's so fitting, it's so touching, and despite the nature of it it still leaves you strangely satisfied. One of the best movies ever made."

Both McMurphy and Nurse Ratched push each other like a competitive game, and it the end it hurt them and innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The acting was great, and the stakes they held were reasonable, they had a realistic view on the environment that they were in. I read the book too, but despite the book having much better detail, the movie did great, it told the story well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Age is relative, but I am old enough to remember seeing this movie shortly after it was released. Of course I was probably not even 10 years old, but even then I remember it being an interesting movie that wasn't as good as Star Wars or Jaws, but certainly painted a horrible picture of mental health facilities. Although I was young, I remembered enough of the movie to not want to re-watch it, at least until recently.\n\nWell it came on a commercial-free cable channel, and I decided to DVR it. And wow, I was blown away when I watched it. The acting is amazing. I mean, TRULY amazing. The story immediately pulled me in, and each scene is sharp and riveting. The location shooting in Oregon really shines (so much better than a sound stage). The film just feels authentic and has a soul, which is so severely lacking in most films these days.\n\nIn summary, the film was so exceptional that I felt compelled to write up a quick review. If you are looking for an amazing drama (and borderline comedy as this film has plenty of truly funny moments), then give this one a chance!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I invite you to read the review entitled 'the spirit of freedom vs. The spirit of legal-ism': currently, the second review under the category of 'featured' reviews, to get a good idea of the overall message of the film. No use my repeating that here.\n\nI will largely confine my review to several specific topics covered by the film.\n\nFirstly,: Smoking. Of course, in recent times, smoking has been banned in psychiatric wards. But, this film takes place in 1963(released in 1975), when the Yankees are battling the Dodgers in the World Series, when smoking, wasn't banned. It is well known that mentally ill people, in general, and schizophrenics, especially, tend to be smokers, and we see evidence of that in the film. At one point, Nurse Ratched severely rations cigarettes, as punishment for Jack Nicholson's character winning everyone's cigarettes in card games. As a result, one patient pleads that he has to have some cigarettes. Nurse Ratchet denies his request. He goes berserk, creating quite a scene. It should have been obvious to Ratched that he was suffering from nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but she wasn't sympathetic. Finally, Jack's character breaks the glass in front of the cigarette cartons, and gives a whole carton to his friend. Today, there are a variety of methods for intaking nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco, that weren't available then, as well as several drugs that reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.\n\nSecond: The abominal practice of lobotomy: removing part of the brain. 50,000 instances of this barbaric procedure in the US, alone, are recorded. Occasionally, it improved the patient's behavior, but more often it rendered then severely retarded or even dead. This was mainly practiced from about 1940 to early 60s, before more effective and safer drugs became available. In the film, this is not shown, but the scar on the forehead, as well as their much diminished behavior, implies its use on one patient. Actually, in this case, it was more a punishment for trying to strangle nurse Rachid.\n\nThirdly, the still commonly used technique of electroconvulsive therapy, is dramatized, as then practiced. Like lobotomy, this was subject to possible important detrimental effects, as well as, possible benefits for the patient. This technique has since been modified, using a smaller electric current, and done under general anesthesia, to create a temporary small brain seizure, which somehow may improve symptoms, with much less danger of significant detrimental effects. In fact, I was subjected to 21 such treatments: an extraordinary number, and very costly to Medicare because of the anesthesia. I got the impression that this was partly punishment for maintaining that my anxiety was originally due to a bout of lead poisoning from lead paint scraping. The doctors chose to discount this possibility, as there was nothing they could do about that. Instead, they judged this to be a psychotic delusion, ignoring several symptoms and a blood test done elsewhere. So, what was the result of these 21 expensive treatments? Nothing either the doctors or I could notice!. I still stubbornly maintained that, among other things, I was suffering from lead poisoning, which I am still certain of, still suffering the same symptoms years later, and being forced to retire from my job, which caused great financial stress. No treatment could diminish the importance of that in my mind. Rather, it has taken time, and several financial 'miracles' to reduce my anxiety about my future well being."

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent for evaluation at a mental hospital.\n\nUpon getting there Randle had an idea that he was to do time, not knowing that he was there till the doctors say he is free to go.\n\nHe made friends with some of the patients in the institution like mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Bromden (Will Sampson) who all thought was deaf and dumb and whom he called Chief.\n\nThe psyche ward is handled by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who is seen more like the antagonist in this flick.\n\nMcMurphy was an instigator of unruly behaviour from breaking him and his fellow patients out from the hospital to go on a boat trip and to a night party at the hospital which led to a tragedy.\n\nThe movie did have a message, live free, be happy don't allow yourself to be tied down by anyone or anything or let either stand in the way of your happiness.\n\nTwo of Milo\u009a Forman films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nThe movie was the second to win all five major Academy Awards which were Best Picture, Best Actor in Lead Role, Best Actress in Lead Role, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nThe thing about the movie that gets to me most has always been the ending, tragedy never sits well with me sometimes especially in the case of this movie.\n\nWell if you haven't had a dose of this movie, then you need to.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a very fine movie in many ways, most of which were rightly recognised on its release. It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.\n\nThey are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.\n\nThe polarities of the film - conformism/individualism, control/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic. This demonstrates why Ms Fletcher's achievement is so great: she carefully sidestepped the dragon the script offered up, instead creating someone altogether more difficult to write off in such simple terms. It is an outstanding performance, and remains the best reason to revisit this film."

Jack Nicolson is especially good as the lead character.I am a Psychology major so, I guess I could be biased toward a movie and book that take a look at the mental health care system and point out what is wrong with it. I will say that some of the content could be disturbing to those who have not read the book or are not familiar with mental illness. I feel that the movie can be enjoyed by everyone. It is funny, heartwarming, thought provoking, and has its serious moments. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book, has an interest in the mental health field, or who is in the mood to laugh, cry, and think."

Personally I would recommend reading the book. It tells a much more in-depth and touching tale. But the movie is a good substitute if you can not read the book. The movie tells the tale of old McMurphy only, while the book looks at the perspective of the old Chief Bromden. The movie does not do the Chief justice. It does not fully portray his character like the book does. The movie did have good acting though by Jack Nickolson which helped give a sense of reality to the story. The horrors that occurred in the mental institution are not exaggerated. The horrors of Lobotomy and Shock Treatment really did occur in some mental institutions. Overall I would just like to say this was a good movie, but one should consider reading the book."

Unfortunately, this is probably the movie that secured in everyones mind that Nicholson plays a crazy person well. He's been type casted ever since.\n\nIt has a great story that actually very accurately depicts the inner workings of a mental facility like that. Especially for the time. You may think that the barbarism that takes place in the movie no longer existed at that point in time, but actually it still takes place in facilities like that all over the country. You better hope that if you get locked up, you get put with someone like Nicholson!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R. P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the \"mental illness\" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\n\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.\n\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their \"therapy\" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be \"dealt with.\"\n\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched \"isn't that bad\" or that \"she was only trying to do her job\", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\n\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in \"Mommie Dearest,\" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\n\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\n\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that \"appearances\" are not about inward reality and, worse, \"the letter kills.\"\n\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).\n\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of \"Chief\" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes."

Nicholson shouldn't have been cats in the film seeing as how supposedly good he is. He didn't shine. Nobody else in the cast shone either.\n\nGenre- Was quite amusing in parts and dramatic in others.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ken Kesey's novel is narrated by Chief Bromden, who reminisces lyrically about the Columbia River country where he grew up. He also has insights into what is going on in the hospital, such as microphones in the broom handles, and machinery within the walls. But, then, he is a patient in a mental hospital. So that's our narrator, a paranoid schizophrenic. One of the features of film is that the camera is objective. A few directors have tried to create a subjective camera, most obviously by giving it the point of view of the main character or even the narrator. I seem to remember an Alan Ladd vehicle, The Lady in the Lake I think it was. But audiences generally trust the camera's objectivity. So instead of getting this story from a paranoid schizophrenic mental patient, the film gives it to us as objective truth. That the central message of freedom comes across is a tribute to Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher in particular. But there is a dimension missing, and to my mind it is Kesey's implication that America is a madhouse, and the only sane people might be those considered by the society to be mad. Maybe others see that implication but, having read the book before the film was released, I find the certainty of the narration undermines that dimension."

I feel that the movie left out important scenes that were made very important in the novel. Another reason why I would give this movie a 8 out of 10 star rating is how the characters compare in the novel and the movie. Each character seemed to be different in the movie than they were in the novel. Although I am giving thi movie a 8 out of 10 star rating, I would recommend watching this movie, preferably without reading the novel prior to the movie."

McMurphy quickly gains fame and thus the support of the retarded people. Together they repeatedly break the rules and regulations of the asylum and are punished. Believing he doesn't belong there McMurphy decides to run away until things take a very tragic turn.\n\nThe idea of the director to break away from normal day routine and enjoying life is conveyed strongly by the ending which tells us that even though McMurphy himself is not there but his idea of 'life' is."

Today was finally that day and what a magnificent piece of art work this movie is. An all time classic\n\nThe social commentary this movie provides is a very authoritarian and oppressive regime in the form of a mental hosptial with it's patients lead by control freak and sadistic Nurse Ratched. Ratched likes everything done her way and her way only. She's not so much of a physical threat or does any physical harm to her patients, it's the psychological mind games she sometimes inflicts.\n\nThen along comes Randal McMurphy, a criminal who fakes insanity in order to get out of serving time in prison and overall a true free spirit. McMurphy is 100% authentic beating his own drum who not only befriends some of the paitents most notably Danny Devito, Brad Dourif, Will Sampson and Christopher Lloyd's characters becoming not just a friend but a leader and a symbol of hope\n\nIt is through his rebellious but also kind and compassionate personality he challenges Ratched's authority several times throughout the movie, giving his friends new life and the ability to be themselves without the fear of oppression. The most touching part throughout all this is McMurphy's friendship with Chief Bromden, a native american who a mentally broken individual who pretends he is dumb and can't speak when really he can and he's also a war veteran who has seen and been through too much who through his time with McMurphy begins to find new found confidence in himself again and the ability to live again\n\nAlthough sometimes you can't always beat the system not just in a mental hospital or whether it's at work or through our Governments and what society perceives of those that are different to anyone else, you can sure as hell break the system and not live in fear. Be true to who you really are or want to be."

Nevertheless, the fact is still that the McMurphy is a criminal who is just playing it to avoid punishment.. in fact he is kinda manipulating all the others that are less sane than him.. taking advantage of his position in the society being above others..\n\nI also do not feel that the nurse Ratched is as bad as the tries to show her. She makes what she thinks is best for the patients.. And they know they can get out.. when she is in control, everything is calm.. no joy, but not a mess as when McMurphy steps in.. that is the other extreme.. Actually my favorite character was Billy.. Poor kid downtrodden by his own mother...\n\nDefinitely, the patients are not getting a good care. I hope mental health hospitals are being better these days! And if this is an allegory of life.. it may not be only communism.. every person may find tyrannical authorities in his teacher, parents, boss... but I don't think neither approach -> nor total chaos, nor total order is the key.. The movie can make you thinking about many things.."

An all time favorite of mine if you like a good deep movie watch this timeless Movie! In a word the Director did a fantastic job and Jack puts a most interesting and believable performance as the bad guy/just trying to stay out of the system as much as he figures a different way to get into more troubles then he bargained for.

I particularly enjoyed the fact that the film has very little or perhaps no musical score at all from what I was able to tell.

So let's be fair, Nicholson gives an excellent performance as McMurphy, his chemistry with the other actors is great and really gets you, the viewer, on his side with his likable persona. The supporting cast also gives a strong performance, providing the perfect pitch of crazy that is required and Nurse Ratched providing an instantly unlikable presence. So, if i had seen this film without reading the book i would probably be able to give it a higher mark but...well now the problem begins because, you see, the novel is perfect and the film is not wholly true to the novel. The major thing that really bothered me right from the beginning was Nicholson. Nicholson could never be McMurphy truly because he just does not have the physical presence that is required for a rugged street fighter type, it was a battle he could never win. The other problem for me was that the darker side of McMurphy wasn't shown as well as it could have been, meaning that the character could (and should) have had more depth. Chief Brompton was cast perfectly though (his character could have been given more attention though). So in summary, great film, see it...but read the book first, even if it blights the film, its worth it!"

A softened (albeit no less hard-hitting) film-adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about sex-deviate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) sent to a mental institution instead of prison, quickly butting heads with the stony head-nurse on his ward (a hissable Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Wretched--uh, Ratched). Ostensibly a downer, the film does get a rousing kick from Nicholson, going full bore with an actor's relish and infusing the movie with unpredictable, kinetic energy. Director Milos Forman helps us get to know the patients at this hospital, easing us through the preliminaries and yet sparing us none of the ugliness. Still, this plot is a bit thin on the screen; Forman does his best to \"open up\" the material, which was first produced on the stage, but the sequence on the boat is more an emotion-based relief for the audience's benefit than a logical turn of the story. Tough-going, compelling film is occasionally brilliant, with Nicholson and Fletcher both winning Oscars, as did Forman and producer Michael Douglas. *** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "First I'd like to say how unbelievable it is finding out the concept of mental facilities. No matter this movie was filmed over 40 years ago, I still think it's mostly applicable to methods that are being used in modern age as well. I suggest it's much easier to give a patient \"a happy pill\" to do all the work. I find it very disturbing, especially a part where they put electricity through your brain. Like that can do any good for a patient. In my opinion, those people weren't patients at all when they first arrived. I think it's applicable to present situation when people are sent to these madhouses. They arrive mostly like Mac did. I definitely wouldn't call him crazy. Those people just need someone to talk with, someone who can understand their feelings and help them solve any sorts of problems in a healthy way. But it's much easier to make a plant out of a human and announce he is insane, isn't it? I felt throughout the whole movie like they didn't even want their patients to recover from their, so called, madness. You convince yourself in that kind of environment that you actually are crazy, especially when you follow their rules and schedules. The littlest confrontations and changes of rules shock the whole system. That's exactly what Mac has done. Anyway, I didn't even feel like I was watching a 40-year-old movie because of its timeless thematic. Well, I only realized it because Jack Nicholson is not so young anymore."

He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it?

The only problem I would have with it is the unrealistic way the mental patients are described. This is hardly the way it is to be insane. The movie is also a bit sentimental like for example scenes where we see severely sick people partying at Christmas. What joy could they possible get out of that? However, all this is excused because the plot is so good. The role of the big Indian really makes sense, and this is, of course, really the story of America. \"They killed him.\" \"I'm not saying they killed him. They were working on him like they are working on you.\" This is the conversation between Nicholson and the Indian. It is very true. This is what \"society\" does to you as a person. There's always going to be some people who are \"working on you\" to get you down. But this movie is saying: \"Don't let the bastards get you down!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie, \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" directed by Milos Forman in 1975, was definitely seven out of ten stars. The movie, based upon the book, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, is an original novel coming to life. Words from a page are turned into a pleasing visual film that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. As a classic novel, the book does not follow the original written novel as closely, the main character changes from the book to the novel, and the emotions held within the novel are less-existing in the movie. The movie does not follow the book closely, leaving out key-events such as; the black boys seeming excited to take patients temperatures, or the event in which Mr. Harding's wife visits. Both of those events are not present in the film. The main character changes in the film, in the film, the main character is McMurphy, a wild man who is avoiding jail, while in the book, Chief Bromden is the main character; Chief Bromden tells the story through his eyes in the book, and this is not present in the film at all, instead Chief Bromden is rarely present within the film. Lastly, the emotions within the book are less-existing in the movie. In the book, mostly the emotions held are less pleasant and humorous, while in the film, the director tends to lean towards humor in the film. All of these reasons given further explain my reasoning for the rating I have given this movie. The movie does not follow the book, and after reading the book, this is disappointing, while the characters and their point-of-view changes as well, also the emotions shifts from the novel to the movie."

It goes to show how good the film was, that almost every main actor in this film made a success in acting after taking role in this movie. Jack Nicholson was truly made for the part as RP McMurphy, as nobody else could have played the part more convincing and dramatic as he did. To perform a film set in a mental Institution takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental, as Danny Devito(Martini) and Christopher Lloyd(Taber) were especially remarkable at this, as they knew how to put on such convincing mental facial reactions (ie.when C.Lloyd was screaming/laughing when Will Sampson(The Chief) escaped from the mental Institution and when D.Devito(Martini) was playing Monopoly with Harding as he put his hotel piece on the board.\n\nThis film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic, as all the way through the film you are either angry, laughing, crying, at something or other, that is going on in the film, whether its being angry with Nurse Ratchett(Louise Fletcher)over her legalism, or crying when Billy(Brad Dourif) harms himself at the end of the film or even laughing at the way RP McMurphy was acting, when he was listening/ observing Mr.Hardings and Mr.Tabers argument during Nurse Ratchetts therapy group. There is not a moment in this film, for which ones emotions aren't triggered, as this film is 'all go' and never drags-on. If you haven't seen this film and would like to, please watch it, for I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. PS Memorable/Favourite quote - I don't have anymore questions, do you have any questions Mr. McMurphy \"Where do you suppose she lives\""

This movie has a unique feel to it, and the cast does an excellent job through out. The point of rising over such a cold leadership, is timeless!\n\nIt's hard not to notice a young Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito in this one.

Nurse Ratched is also portrayed very well, by Louise Fletcher, and the acting overall is stellar. The portrayal of Billy Bibbit and his situation superb, as is the 1963 World Series scene. (Interesting: in real life, Tresh and Mantle did homer against Koufax, two-run and solo, respectively, but in different games, and that represented all of the Yanks' damage against him; Koufax pitched in games 1 and 4, Downing in game 2.) However, my favorite moment is McMurphy's lifting effort. We return again to the chief at the end, as the final scenes, like the rest of the movie, do not let us down. Striking a blow for freedom, this film is Nicholson's finest effort."

And yeah, I guess there's something there. Everything in this film simply works. And it works very well together. Jack Nicholson as the chaotic McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as nurse Ratched, who controls the mental ward with an iron fist, are both phenomenal in their roles. Nicholson is of course Jack Nicholson, but Fletcher's role, especially right next to Nicholson's, also must be praised. You're constantly being kept wondering whether her efforts to force the patients into an iron tight, rigid order are because that's what she believes will help them or is it just because she truly doesn't care and simply wants everything to go exactly like she prefers.\n\nIt's also a really professional-looking film. Cinemacraft at its finest. Although, I have to admit that 60s mental hospital is not exactly the most exciting of locations, but then it's a character movie anyway. The score is also atmospheric and moody in just the right way. The opening shot alone instantly sets the pace.\n\nI guess sometimes you just have to admit that you don't know something. I'm still not sure exactly why this film works. I just know that it does."

The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.\n\nJack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.\n\nLouise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.\n\nFor the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time. This film,like many great ones, stays with the viewer long after the end credits begin to roll.\n\nArguably, the movie may not have aged well since many of the practices in the medical discipline of mental health have improved drastically since the late 70s. However, I find this does very little to upset or throw off the open-minded viewer.\n\nI am not surprised by this film's inclusion in the Top 10 since, as stated earlier, it has a very wide appeal, not unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Honestly, this film should not be missed, even if you have to watch it on one of the classic networks with commercials and censorship (Heaven forbid!).\n\nThis film warrants 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Highly recommended. Should just about enter my top 100 at 99 or so."

You can look at Jack Nicholson's face and know exactly what he is thinking. He has zero unconscious bias against anyone and just wants everyone to find a way to enjoy life. Not to mention how amazing that it debuted supporting actors such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny deVito. This movie also made Nurse Ratched (sounds vaguely like wretched, or more like ratchet, a tool that clamps down but doesn't let go!) an icon for cruel treatment. Interesting that this movie was released just five years after Reagan signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act to end long term involuntary incarceration of mental patients.They just don't make movies like this anymore."

Giving the Oscar to Louise Fletcher for her performance has to be the all-time joke of the movie business. That much more able actresses had turned the role down speaks for itself. With the current lack of financial wisdom in the US in 2008, however, the film obviously had some serious irony up its sleeve to be kept for 33 years down the track. Fortunately since 1975, most Award seasons have seen logic and reason return to The Academy. One can only conclude that most of the Academy members who voted this Lulu Best Picture must have been smoking the butts that Ken Kesey couldn't finish."

While it is quite different from the novel, the strength of the acting, directing and the desire for a grounded film shedding light on a subject that still has a stigma attached to it.\n\nThrough the film, the funny scenes as well as the heart-wrenching ones, are all undercut with a realistic looming sense of dread. The acting, directing and quality of a screenplay adapted very differently from the novel were carried out and executed perfectly.\n\nThis film is tragic, but enchanting. Hypnotizing."

He helped shine the light on how tragic and terrifying the staff of hospitals and such places can truly be. Although she was such a horrifying character, Nurse Ratched, was very well played. You couldn't help but just hate her!! I liked that this movie showed that any sort of patient is still a person. It was good to see that even a criminal can have a heart and befriend them, even when he could talk his way out of prison. A MUST see film!"

The only thing you can do is `rip that ******* thing' from the bathroom and run away from that kind of closed life circle.\n\nNot one performance is overdone, not one line overwritten, not one moment unimportant, not one second of the movie flawed. It's a coherent brilliance of craftsmanship and a quite greatness of humility and dignity. The movie's anti-establishement intonation is already a thing of epochal diameter and it will stay that way for ever. The strenght of its unidealistic undercurrent is what makes all of us alive, even though no one is allowed to admit it. What is fascinating in this movie is that the people who made it know it.\n\nThinking back to the film I'm often thinking: `What if every human being in the world would allow himself to `rip that ******* thing' just one single time in his life?' Now, that was a scary thought.\n\n10/10. Best motion picture of 1970s."

McMurphy, a sane (or is he?) troublemaker sent to a mental institution. Sympathetic to his new roommates, he promptly involves them in cards, basketball, fishing and just plain old fun. However disturbing his presence is to the staff, including strict Nurse Ratched, the newest cuckoo fits right in while breathing new life into the orderly surroundings.\n\nEverything clicks in this one. The characters are remarkable and distinct without being exaggerated or unbelievable. The performers are a treasure, arguably constituting one of the most incredible ensemble casts ever seen. Nicholson again proves he's the master at playing characters we think we know while at the same time knowing we may not know. Is McMurphy merely a petty shyster looking for an easy way out or is he certifiably sick? Louise Fletcher is just as good as Nurse Ratched. Although she is often cited as one of filmdom's great villains, she doesn't come across nearly as evil as her reputation suggests. In fact, viewers may find themselves wondering who to trust -- the rambunctious jailbird McMurphy or the professional, buttoned-down Ratched. Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and big Will Sampson as the silent Native American are outstanding in supporting roles.\n\nGiven the subject matter involved, not everybody could have turned ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST into such a respectful, dignified picture. Give director Milos Forman full marks for finding just the right ingredients to make this a recipe for success."

It is entirely understandable that a movie about a mental institution would provide an insight into the daily routine of the inhabitants which is most likely quite dull and, well, routine. It is also necessary to provide for character development, but too much monotony and introduction is just difficult to watch. This is not to say that any of the actors were negligent in their craft. Everyone was very believable in their respective roles, so much so that it took me a while to recognize Danny DeVito. Jack Nicholson was his usually boisterous and slightly insane self and Louise Fletcher was a superb Nurse Ratched. The technical aspects of the movie were sufficient and fluid, but did not draw attention to themselves with any particularly notable exhibition of flair.\n\nThe second half did pick up a bit and the ending misses making the movie more than just worth watching by only a tiny fraction. I suppose I just can't help but feel a bit unsure about whether or not anyone actually escaped and whether or not that is the movie's intent on how I should feel."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is one of the signature films of the 1970s. Based on the 1962 novel by counter-cultural icon Ken Kesey, the movie focuses on the rebellious R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he becomes immersed in life within a mental institution. Over the course of the movie he bonds with his fellow patients and steadfastly opposes Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her dictatorial ways.\n\nOne of the things that \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is known for is for winning Oscars in all of the so-called 'big five' categories. These include Best Actor & Best Actress, with awards going to Nicholson & Fletcher, respectively. Both contributed excellent performances but they also benefited from some fine support by the supporting cast of mostly unknowns. Early appearances by Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd & Vincent Schiavelli are augmented by notable work from William Redfield & Scatman Crothers. And who can forget Will Sampson as the taciturn Chief?\n\nCzech director Milos Forman was also honoured by the Academy and so were screenwriters Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman. Between them, they found a way to approach the material that was simultaneously authentic, humorous and emotionally resonant. Among those who lost Oscar bids, particular recognition should go to cinematographer Haskell Wexler and composer Jack Nitzsche.\n\nIn the final analysis, I feel that the story takes a little while to hit its stride but once it does it ably sustains the viewer's interest right up to the memorable finale. It was up against some stiff competition for Best Picture so the fact that it took home the Oscar is a testament to its overall quality. That being said, I feel that it may be just a tad overrated, though it is undoubtedly essential viewing for any movie lover."

The difficult part of this film is knowing exactly where it succeeds from a story perspective. The plot has a meaningful ambiguity around societal differences, but also provides a simple distinction between wild and domesticated behaviors. Even with an abrupt conclusion that nearly derails the emotional development that Milos Forman identifies early on, there's an addictive energy that only increases from start to finish. Criticism is easy to give for stories that provide more clarity during a second viewing, but those are the stories that I prefer and this is the type of film that will only evolve as human beings continue to question."

Also notable are the careers that were launched with Cuckoos Nest. The almost unrecognizable Danny DeVito as Martini. The frenetic Chris Lloyd fitting so neatly into the band of lunatics. Will Sampson was inspiring as Chief Bromden. Cuckoos Nest, overall, coaxes such a wide range of emotions, from out and out hilarity to tear-jerking sadness, that it is nearly impossible to classify. Suffice it to say that One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is one of the greats!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film tells the story of R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), whose criminal record earned him a season in a labor camp. To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.\n\nDirected by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.\n\nTouching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the moment R.P McMurphy is admitted into the mental institution, he's instantaneously likable. He's daring, thoughtful, witty, and affable; He's the type of guy that can become friends with anyone, and Jack Nicholson plays him Perfectly!\n\nI have 0 complaints with the acting department on this film. The patients were all great, and while they weren't really developed (with the exception of a few), they (most of them) felt like their own thing and were interesting (particularly their reasons for being in the institution), rather than just copies of each other or stereotypical crazy people. Louise Fletcher was also phenomenal at being hateable. Her character is such an evil, threatening, controlling killjoy, and it's actually frightening for a person like that to have such excessive authority over people.\n\nOne thing I really loved about this film were the relationships. The relationship between the patients was immensely charming. --This is not really a flaw, but I wish there was more on-screen time between them. I can honestly watch them together for hours.-- The brotherly relationship between McMurphy and Chief is just wonderful, and, of course, the relationship between R.P and Nurse Ratched is just fantastic to watch; From their immediate annoyances with each other to their nail-biting climax. Apart from their confrontations they're also able to build their relationship just with stares.\n\nOn top of that, the film was successful at playing with my emotions Masterfully! It went from Joyous and Hilarious scenes where I felt like cheering and I laughed aloud, to chilling scenes where I was just appalled. Even up to the bittersweet ending where I, unashamedly, cried both tears of sadness and joy within minutes, and my god that ending theme is so damn inspirational.\n\nThere were however a couple of moments I didn't like. One minor thing was in a scene where McMurphy does something bold, AND HE DOESN'T GET INJURED AT ALL. I just thought it was stupid. Also, near the end of the movie there's something that McMurphy doesn't do that just annoys the hell out of me.\n\nAside from that, I genuinely loved this film. It's beautiful, inspiring, and really took me on an emotional roller-coaster. It's also possibly the best anti establishment film I've seen."

Just to start, I'd say this is one of those films that you recommend to every person you know; it's a \"must watch\" without any doubt. In my opinion, what makes this movie such a well-crafted masterpiece is the essence behind the plot. Milos Forman, the director, showed that he could handle a complex movie without trouble. Additionally, he managed to perform a great job catching the spectator's attention. In my opinion, what we see here is one of Jack Nicholson's best performance EVER. You can barely differentiate between the thin line that he's crossing; you can't tell if he's acting or that's just himself displaying his inner craziness. And that's beautiful. The composer Jack Nitzche achieved perfection with the main theme and the movie's soundtrack. You can feel a mixed emotion between what is sadness, happiness, madness and gloom... All at once. That's what just makes this movie even better. Music fills your soul. To summarize, this is a great and beautiful movie with the perfect components to make you feel that you won't forget it. If you haven't watched it yet, please, do. You won't regret, I promise."

Sometimes all it takes is just a change of pace and a little touch of personality which Jack Nicholson provides plenty. This has to be one of my all-time favorite movies! I gave it a 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "It is difficult to say which cinematic role defined the meaning of Jack Nicholson's career, whether it's his portrayal as the sadistic psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', the iconic DC villain 'Batman', or his role here as a criminally insane convict with the thirst for rebellion. Regardless, Nicholson has made a man of honest talent, and his talent still lights up to this day. This five Oscar-winning (including Best Picture) adaption to Ken Kessey's acclaimed novel shows this fine actor in what is arguably one of his most roles of his career. Directed by Milos Forman, Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy, a long-time criminal who is caught for criminal activity and sentenced to prison by the court once more. Upon the start of his prison sentence, McMurphy pleads mentally insane in hopes of escaping prison labor and is sent off to an institution for the mentally unstable. Upon arrival, McMurphy witnesses the dispiriting treatment of him and his fellow inmates by the hands of Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). Disgusted by her superiority and mental abuse, McCurthy takes matters into his own hands and rallies up the inmates to an effort to start a rebellion against the nurse.\n\nUnlike the critically acclaimed dramas such as 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Green Mile', this movie supplements a more light-hearted and less somber take on the prison genre. Milos Forman grants a fair charm and ingenuity into what almost feels like a Stanley Kubrick-style picture. This director plants an engaging narrative material and a decent sense of dark humor from the ever charismatic Jack Nicholson. His character is the pinnacle of charm and entertainment as he builds solid chemistry with the supporting characters and a heated rivalry with the antagonistic Nurse Ratched who is blessed by a sinister portrayal by Louise Fletcher without giving an over- the-top or downright evil vibe, but of someone who simply doesn't understand the harm she causes. This actor delivers a darkly comical performance to portray the stark and colorful protagonist. Aside from his performance is a large roster of actors including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Douriff and many others who turn in some fine performances but perhaps less memorable. There are moments of laughter, moments of dread, and a few scenes of shock, particularly the ending.\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a triumphant achievement by Milos Forman that demonstrates a fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson and a solid script. This movie is a must watch for film buffs everywhere as it serves as a good exploration into the early years of Jack Nicholson's career."

It is a film that will live on forever as its themes are universal and unending. Most of all the film will continue to live on on the back of the flabbergasting performances by the actors and particularly the amazing and superb Jack Nicholson.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, watch it and from then on life is just slightly different.

Jack Nicholson's performance is off the charts - the rebellion against the system and Nurse Ratched is like the ultimate mental game. The characters are a mix of crazy, quirky, and unforgettable - it's a rollercoaster of emotions, and you're hooked from the first scene.\n\nThe whole vibe of the mental institution is insane, pun intended. The rebellious spirit, the pranks, and the camaraderie are pure chaos, and it's like a rebellious anthem against conformity. The film doesn't just entertain; it makes you question authority, rules, and sanity itself. It's a cinematic journey that transcends the screen, leaving you with thoughts that linger long after the credits roll.\n\nSure, it's not your typical blockbuster, but that's what makes it special. It's a trip into the human psyche, a rebellion against societal norms, and a testament to the power of individuality. A solid 10 because it's not just a movie; it's a masterpiece that challenges, entertains, and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic brilliance."

        "review_title": "A Superb Look at Non-Conformity",
        "review_detailed_main": "When rebellious convict Randall McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is sent to a mental institution to avoid hard labour, he quickly clashes with the cold Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her methods, which begins a battle of wills between her and the inmates, in Milos Forman's psychological comedy-drama co-starring Will Sampson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Sydney Lassik and Christopher Lloyd.\n\nIn a way, it's lucky that attempts to get the film made in the mid 60s didn't pan out, as it probably wouldn't have been a mainstream hit a decade before. A decade later, however, and an America just emerging from the hangover of Vietnam and Watergate embraced its defiant spirit with open arms, recognising the conflict at the hospital as something much more universal than it might have been seen before.\n\nMcMurphy is almost a manifestation of rebellion, a larger than life figure that inspires the people around him to break out of their ordered routines, and Nicholson imbues this Lord of Misrule with a sly, ferocious charisma that's both dangerous and magnetic. It was a departure for the actor, who at that point had mainly played more brooding, understated types, but really defined his screen persona for the years to come, solidifying his both his stardom and place in the New Hollywood movement.\n\nI found MacMurphy a compelling character, but for a long time he seemed a bit too invulnerable and self-assured to fully connect with, never seeming to be affected by anything that happens. It's only towards the end that Nicholson lets some vulnerability in, showing MacMurphy deciding to stand up for his friends and put his own motives to one side, and this let the character feel even more rounded than before.\n\nAfter I saw the film I read that Ken Kesey's original novel had the Chief as the narrator, which makes a lot of sense for the distanced, almost mythic way MacMurphy's presented. It also explains why the focus seems to shift to the Chief's story towards the end, as while watching it the change felt a little abrupt. The deleted scenes also give more of a sense of it being from his perspective, although in the actual film the character's arc is still really well done, slowly gaining confidence and inner strength through his friendship.\n\nForeman's semi-documentary approach makes it immersive to watch, bringing us into the sterilised, claustrophobic world the characters inhabit in a way that feels incredibly realistic. However, I thought the boat excursion in the middle was a bit unnecessary, though, as although it gives more insight into the characters we lose some of the confined atmosphere the rest of the film builds up, opening the story up too much.\n\nThe actors all lived on the wing while they were filming, which gives their performances a lot of credibility, often never feeling like they're acting. Because of the ensemble approach, the supporting characters aren't developed all that much, often blending together, but each actor brings a conviction that humanises the patients, the film never feeling like it's talking down to them. Foreman seemed drawn to films about outsiders and outcasts, and it's quite touching to see the makeshift community form as time goes on, even if MacMurphy does seem to be using them a lot of the time.\n\nThis was Dourif's breakthrough role, and he really shows Billy's inner struggle between his deeply repressed side and a desire to break out of it, and you can almost see the conflict playing out in his mind. This results in a scene near the end where his newfound confidence is shattered that's stuck with me since I saw it, Dourif's performance helping to make it an incredibly raw and poignant moment.\n\nEach character adds something to the story, with Lassick's childlike sidekick, Redfield's pompous outsider and Devito's quiet shellshocked veteran each having their chance to shine, but it's Fletcher who stands out most amongst the supporting cast. What makes the performance so chillingly effective is how rationally she plays it, avoiding caricature by making Ratched seem almost relatable at first, but with a coldness behind the eyes that increasingly manifests itself as we realise just how ruthless she is.\n\nShe excellent here, providing the ice to Nicholson's fire, and the conflict between the two characters is absorbing to watch. Even though I knew what would happen, the ending is heartbreaking, effortlessly managing to move from comedy to intense drama to tragedy without ever falling into melodrama. The themes of entrapment and maintaining your identity even in the hardest circumstances still resonates today, and these final scenes help to round that off perfectly.\n\nFor me, a few little things keep One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Near from being a masterpiece, but it's still a brilliantly astute, offbeat and empathetic ode to non-conformity that features one of Nicholson's defining performances."

The film is a pinnacle of the world cinematography. It has everything that the real masterpiece has to have: superb direction and screenplay, casting, music, plot, and a theme that deals with timeless concept. What brings the film to the highest points is its power, by which the supreme humanistic ideals as freedom and democracy are, together with everyday-life-related human foibles, are kindly presented for our consideration.\n\nThe film makes us focus on valuable humanistic categories, without which a man is not a man, meanwhile admitting that no one's perfect, that less-important shortcomings of a man may be acceptable in our not idealized life.\n\nThe film has advantages compared with the original story, which is brilliant itself. Eliminating the Chief's narrative style, the film becomes more objective and realistic for perception: you get in a first-line contact with McMurphy and others. Nurse Ratched is nice-looking rather than almost a monster, as described so in the book. Moreover so, the film shows that Nurse Ratched honestly and altruistically serves the patients' life and health, although, as in the story, forgetting about freedom. Therefore, by widening the scope of Ratched's character and making it more common, the McMurphy-Ratched conflict becomes more powerful and substantiated.\n\nThere are a few scenes in the film, especially the final one, which I think are among the best scenes in a movie history.\n\nIt is a real art: elevated, transparent, at the same time loaded with ideas, and triggering thoughts, an ability of which is as important for the mankind as the principles of democracy and freedom."

        "review_detailed_main": "Milos Forman's second American feature is a loose adaptation of the novel by Ken Kesey that made so many changes that Kesey refused to ever watch it. Having never read the book, I can't comment on changes, but I can say that this is one of those Best Picture winners and well-loved films that I never quite get. I think it's a good film, well-made, acted, and lensed, but I don't get into the emotional groove its offering, feeling more distant from the action than it seems like most audiences do. It's a film I respect more for its craft than I actually enjoy watching.\n\nI think I never quite love this film because I never quite hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It really feels like the love of the film comes from hating her character, but I see her as a flawed human being with good intentions counterbalanced by a real mean streak that she's not afraid of using (what she does to Billy (Brad Dourif) at the end is outright evil). She's a bad person, but not a devil, so I can never quite get around to hating her and feeling some great joy at watching her attacked. It's helped by the fact that I see Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as less purely good and more dangerous than I think other people see him as. Again, he's not a bad person, but he can't control himself and puts himself in a spot where he's willing to harm sick people around him to win a fight with Ratched.\n\nSo, McMurphy was in jail for a series of assaults and convinced the state prison psychiatrists that he needed to be sent to the funny farm, the mental hospital. He shows up, and he finds seventeen patients, all largely placid in their own ways and under the heel of Nurse Ratched. What follows is a power struggle between McMurphy and Ratched. They have dueling philosophies on life, and those manifest in different little struggles, all with both of them using the other patients as tools.\n\nIf you see the film as McMurphy just trying to get people to discover their true selves and Ratched trying to oppress them, it becomes a very easy to root for one over the other. The problem is that I see them both as using these people in their fight with each other. McMurphy forces Bancini (Josip Elic) to put him on his shoulders without his consent to run around and try to show Chief (Will Sampson) how to play basketball. Was that kind? It seems at least kind of mean to me. It may not be Ratched arranging electric shock therapy, but it's also not McMurphy trying to help Bancini at all, instead using him to try and find a way to have fun.\n\nMcMurphy's open defiance of Ratched makes him something of a figure of awe among the patients, especially Billy, and he even gets the grudging respect of others like Harding (William Redfield) and Max (Christopher Lloyd). His desire to break loose and have fun is a great feeling for these people on tightly run schedules (so tightly run that Ratched refuses to change anything to let them watch the World Series) who love the sense of freedom, but they are also really sick people and taking them out of the hospital to steal a boat to fish on was not exactly great. That they all end up reacting well feels somewhat artificial to me. At least one of these people should have had some kind of breakdown, otherwise it's intentionally stacking the deck in McMurphy's favor. He takes them out of the hospital, some of whom are there by force of the state, and they're all fine. Either this is saying that these people shouldn't be locked up at all (which, considering Billy's fate later, seems to be a poor assumption) or that they just need to get out a bit. I think that the best way to read this is that the psychological approaches of the time were backwards and destructive, but that implies that these people needed it as well.\n\nYou see, my issue is that ultimately I feel like there's an intentional subtext here about society and competing views between control (Ratched) and freedom (McMurphy), but the application to the setting of the mental asylum is imprecise to the point of distraction.\n\nI find it hard to separate that subtext from the narrative surface, but the surface is where things work better. The characters are all very well drawn, starting with McMurphy, this guy trapped in a place that he didn't realize the implications of when he schemed to get in. As played by Nicholson, he's cocky and confident until he realizes the trap he's set for himself, using everything he has to jump around, domineer the patients, and try to have a good time. The patients all around him are convincing, especially with those early turns from Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Lloyd. Dourif ends up the tragic figure in the end, harshly manipulated by Ratched with one single line of dialogue when it becomes obvious that he won't listen to her anymore. Fletcher has a restrained performance, and she loves her control in small ways, never lording it over people except in her cool, calm voice. Her lashing out is in what she says, never in how she says it.\n\nI feel for Billy and where he goes. He was a mentally ill young man manipulated by both people over him, one far more maliciously than the other. What happens to McMurphy is the result of an uncaring system and a powermad woman, but he's less the hero than I think the film thinks he is. I see it as an imperfect application of Forman's experiences under communist rule during his upbringing in Czechoslovakia to the American experience. I appreciate Forman's craft in molding performances from his actors, clean filming, careful use of closeups, and general production quality, and I feel some sympathy for a side character, but I think it doesn't quite hit as well as it should. It's good, not great."

Reading the book prior to watching the movie, the movie felt like a butchery, all the thematic ideas were cut to make a pretty poorly constructed movie. Again, the plot of the movie made no sense without the prior knowledge of what was supposed to happen based on the book. Many characters were either cut or sidelined in an effort to make Taber relevant, even though it served absolutely no purpose to have him in the movie. Without giving any information, there seemed to be many important events and lines from the book that didn't make it into the movie, probably to make it a little more acceptable to viewers. This is disgraceful to the purpose of the book, which challenged the way society categorized and neutered the patients, so the director neutered the book."

It is kind of hard for me to explain what is so good about this film. Some other people probably can do a better job. But there is a certain feeling; an appeal to an emotion. There is a very deep meaning to this film, even though it is hard to describe it in words. The ending of this movie is beyond words. They could not give this film a better ending. There are a few scenes which are very well done, not just from Jack, but from many of the supporting actors.\n\nSo if you really haven't seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and go out and rent it."

To me the whole atmosphere in the institution is depressing and the expression I could use to describe it is the line 'waiting for god'. Every time you think that the regime might take a hit whereby some beneficial change might come along the doors close and almost absorb the positivity. There are some wonderfully funny scenes and some really sad ones. The whole is a roller-coaster of emotions but with the one umbrella like feeling pervading the film which is one of no hope. No one person is going to rock the boat for any length of time therefore the inmates eventually die after having had no reasonable quality of life. However I would recommend that anybody watch it because it is a very good film and like a lot of other good films it makes you think."

        "review_detailed_main": "A touching story carried by wonderful acting from all cast members. A rollercoaster of emotions packed into 2hrs 13 mins & worthy of the 5 Oscars it received. In the opening scene, the patients seem extremely docile - obeying Nurse Ratched's cult like rigour (one patient even takes his medication like communion), though upon McMurphy's arrival, life on the ward perks up. With his rolled up sleeve encasing a pack of cigarettes, the dishevelled hair, the mischievous look in his eyes, McMurphy establishes himself as a rebel without a cause from the get go. He brings joy & laughter back into the lives of the patients, and inspires the men to gain autonomy for themselves and indeed hope for a life outside of the institution. The group therapy scenes were excellent and really allowed time for you to 'get to know' each individual patient. Though Nicholson's character (McMurphy) is flawless, credit has to be given to the men behind Billy Bibbit, Chief & Martini. Their performances felt so believable - not once did I think oh, these are actors. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a touching, and culturally significant drama which stands the test of time - offering an interesting insight into the relationship between authority and freedom. (Is it necessary? Would chaos ensue without its presence?) I'll bet a buck (excuse the reference), that if you haven't seen this film, you'll realise what the fuss is all about when you do."

Playing a convict who is not necessarily crazy, but does seem to be a challenge, but he pulls it off with such perfection that I dare you to find a flaw. The accompanying cast provides an interesting and colorful backdrop to his crazy shenanigans, but be on the lookout for the performance of Oscar Winner Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, she is one evil nurse, she inhabits her role with such a powerful presence, that if she were really a nurse, most patients would pretend health just to be free. They really are memorable performances, capped off with Milos Forman's Best Work in my opinion, you really have a Grade A Movie.\n\nA Word of Advice, if you have some petty grudge against any of the actors involved, leave it at the front Desk, and come inside the Ward, you will be pleasantly surprised"

        "review_detailed_main": "Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.\n\nA funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.\n\nFor the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on \"Billy.\"\n\nJack Nicholson's character, \"Randle Patrick McMurphy,\" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.\n\nWho could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?\n\nYes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.\n\nThis is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am kicking myself for being so unobservant. Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages. None are good examples of their respective forms.\n\nBooks are plot-driven, requiring the right mix of story with dialog. Actually, dialog isn't necessary to make a popular book as Tom Clancy and John Grisham have demonstrated.\n\nFilms are visually-driven. When a film relies too much on the mechanics of books, they fail. Why have the Clancy and Grisham adaptations faded so quickly? Because the directors start with a story and then try to visualize it as best as they can while cutting out the guts of the book (the plot)...probably why the #1 comment is \"the book was better\". Thus a good film, in the visual sense, needs little dialog and even bad dialog can work. Ang Lee, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick proved that. These three start with visuals then use plot as an excuse for the vision, that's how they get away with clich\u00e9s.\n\nPlays are entirely dialog-driven, requiring mastery of language to create and perform. What works in books and films can fail because we take out the scene imagination of the audience in exchange for verbal imagination. The two don't mix.\n\nWell, 'Cuckoo's Nest' (book, play, and film) is nothing unique. Remember that Kesey wrote his book after Heller's 'Catch-22' and the film adaptation likewise followed Nichols' better attempt. We can see that if Heller hadn't succeeded this would never have been made. No one would have been interested in another examination of insanity, but this doesn't even have the clever manipulation of either the narrator or language.\n\nIn this particular case, the failure falls on Forman. Dialog and acting are pointless in this medium, especially Nicholson since his \"method acting\" here is no different than the Joker. Another problem is the emotionless images. This isn't the calculated coldness of Kubrick, just sloppy filmmaking. Perhaps this should not have been attempted at all...\n\nMy advice, compare this to that year's 'Barry Lyndon' to understand when adaptations take advantage of the different mediums. The problem with America is that we make everyone verbally literate and then expect them to go to movies with the same mentality. If we raise future generations to be visually literate then this movie would disappear. That's our dilemma: Hollywood vs. Education.\n\nFinal Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming: hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.\n\nThis brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.\n\nAlso, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember: we think he's dumb and deaf.\n\nAnother piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape: I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.\n\nIn conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today \u0096 a great and very memorable film."

(the part of this scene where he makes attempts [to do the impossible] to lift the sink from the floor). the amount of effort he put into that task. he was hyperventilating because he was trying with EVRETHING HE HAD... after the bet was setteled he said \"I TRIED, DAMIT at leastI TRIED\"...now that's motivation."

During these last years is becoming a fact that the budget is the main ingredient you need to make a great movie. I think that this movie is a clear example that it isn't the truth in fact Forman disposed a little budget making one of the greatest movie of all times.The only ingredient that is essential is the talent and the will to give great emotions with your movie.Too many people are forgetting these two things thinking too much at the money.This is why i think that \"One flew over the cuckoo's nest\" is a hope for everyone who wants to make movies."

At first I thought the film was decent but after a bit the movie starts blooming, the characters open up you create a connection to them, feel empathy towards them. This movie truly makes you smile or frown whilst you watch it, this is rather rare in movies nowadays but this one really is the definition of simple but beautiful. The ending really does make the movie, it almost feels as if you have lost a close friend, you remember the memories the beginnings and now the end. You want to continue their legacy, their dreams and goals to honour them and keep their memory alive. Seeing how somebody loses their souls, personality, love, passion and emotion is a unique but unfortunate experience, from happy charming to soulless and empty, the contrast almost made me tear up. This movie is a marvel, highly recommended for all.\n\nThis movie also shows how administration can corrupt, is unethical, and sometimes unfair."

I have my favorites like 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Shawashank Redemption', but again, that's not a lot. Cuckoo just did it for me.\n\nIt's been about 30 years (if not exact) to when this masterpiece came out. As a mainstream success, it won many awards, including 5 Oscars. One of those 5, was for Best Picture. That was why I decided to see this film. It came on this website as a high-rated classic. To that point, I was not surprised at how much this film affected me.\n\n'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is an unforgettable classic that affected me lots. It contains fascinating performances, an excellent screenplay, and great direction, not to mention a joyous soundtrack.\n\nThe performances in this film are so worth the watch. Jack Nicholson gives his career-best performance as 'McMurphy'. He delivers his soul towards his masterful performance and demonstrates an advanced understanding towards this film. His other films don't reach the heights of this one. Loise Fletcher, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance as the 'nurse'. She lawfully is completely different, self disciplined and serious. Both these performances cause a dramatic on- screen battle. For me, its Jack Nicholson who wins.\n\nAn excellent screenplay is orchestrated throughout this film. Michael Douglas hasn't ever done such a wonderful job. This film, however, is disheartening at times, but also heartwarming, forming a nice combination. When a film deals with a serious subject matter, but has a hilarious tone to it, not to make it depressing.\n\nLastly, the soundtrack of this film is highly praise. The joyous moments of this film flow very well this soundtrack. Unbelievable, indeed...\n\nOverall, this film is certainly worth the watch. If you haven't seen it, you've missed out on a film that changed my life. The ending of this film may seem abrupt, but I got over it, so no worries.\n\n10/10"

This is when i decided to watch it!!!\n\nStraight from the off we could see that there was so much talent and energy in the role that Nicholson potrays as mental patient MacMurphy who finds himself being monitored by the institution that he has been sent to in order to find out if he really is mental???\n\nAt the academy awards of 1975 this swept the board including Nicholson taking Best Actor and Louise Fletcher taking a well deserved Best Actress. But i thought that the incredibly talented Brad Douriff who made his debut with this film as Billy, was very unlucky to pick up best supporting actor in which he was nominated for. Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Will Sampson were all brilliant as the inmates of the hospital and showed that its all about the overall cast and not just one actor.\n\nThe film itself is incredible, nothing like i've ever seen before and puts very stupid versions like 28 days way out of context! You could cut the tension with a knife in every encounter between Macmurphy and nurse Ratched, it literally was end of your seat stuff.\n\nWhy i havn't watched this film sooner is beyond me, so please anyone out there reading these comments that hasn't seen this film, pick it up from your local video store A.S.A.P...........\n\n10/10"

Once there, McMurphy gathers a group of the mental patients to rebel against the oppressive and authoritative Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).\n\nFor a drama, the plot is incredibly well-paced from start to finish, which keeps you captivated at the story, from McMurphy's heated exchanges with Nurse Ratched to him breaking the patients out to enjoy a day of fishing. The characters are well-developed as the plot delves into the individual backgrounds of each of the main patients, including Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Harding (William Redfield), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), Martini (Danny DeVito), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), and Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif). The therapy group sessions between them and Nurse Ratched are what I think the highlights of the film as it generates the film's mood, plays on the minds of the patients and instigates the ensuing drama and tension.\n\nGreat acting by the actors - my particular favorite is that of Louise Fletcher. She portrayed the nurse as just a person doing her job, almost oblivious to her authoritative, cold stance and power-hungry grip. The characters generate both sympathy and indifference - especially that of Nicholson's character.\n\nGreat drama throughout and it all leads to an incredible ending.\n\nGrade A"

It totally fails to convey the message and meaning of the novel. I found the end of the film to be depressing, while the end of the novel is anything but. I can understand the filmmakers not wanting to make a film heavy with voice-overs, but without the narrative voice found in the novel, the story is a hopeless and despairing one, which was surely not Kesey's intent. I saw the film before I read the book, and after seeing the film I avoided the novel because I didn't want to be depressed again; after reading the novel I almost wished I hadn't seen the travesty of a fine novel that is the movie version of \"Cuckoo's Nest.\""

The characters are real, like the neighbors next door instead of unbelievable. Of course Jack Nicholson was and is still a great actor who after all these years pulls in the crowds. For a short while, I truly believed he would be typecast into \"crazy' roles from that point on. His mix of crazy and humor is the true mark of an Oscar winning performer. His dreams to crash the place and escape were well acted out and believable. Having seen this movie on the drive-in screen almost 30 years ago, I would still pay to see it again."

Batman, One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shining, the list goes on and on. Jack Nicholson was at the top of his game when he acted in this movie and got even higher at 1980's The Shining and even higher as he took his second role of a villain as Joker in 1989's Batman.\n\nNow I am only 13 but since I saw The Shining and Batman I thought, Jack Nicholson CANT get any higher then this but my friend let me borrow his DVD of this and i jumped out of my seat. Even if this movie doesn't get you to cry you are still doing that sort of thing when you get teary because you see a man faking but he is surrounded by people that aren't and hes trying to get them more active. Sort of like 2005's amazing movie The Ringer.\n\nThere is nothing else to say but to watch this movie and you are in for a nice treat."

AFI has it rated as #20 two above 2001, which is silly seeing as how 2001 is in my opinion only liked because Kubrick made it, in reality its slow, long, and boring. But back to One Flew, it is an amazing piece of film with some of the best acting I have ever seen, Jack Nicholson's character is the typical antihero everyone loves, just when you think he has learned his lesson....well I won't ruin it. DeVito, Christopher Llyod, Cheif, and the others in the hospital brought the movie together. This isnt the most exciting movie, but it is amazing nonetheless."

He plays the \"mental illness\" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface."

And when I say him, it reminds me that this movie is very disgraceful to the women. The head nurse Ratched is shown pure evil and oppressive to the patients from the starting till the end. There is no development of her character. Then, there is Cindy, who is in the movie just to be the arm candy of McMurphy. I could handle this much sh*t, but then she slept with Billy just because McMurphy said so. Writers, please write believable characters. Okay, the crazy ones' characters are unexplainable and non-relatable, but Cindy, why there is no character development of hers? The only good thing about this movie is the acting of Jack Nicolson. Even he could do a lot better."

One of the only films to win the five key awards at the Oscars, and \"Nest\" deserves everyone of them. McMurphy (Charming Nicholson) upon arriving at the local asylum, rounds up the patients and disturbs the peace. Amongst fighting with Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) and befriending a quiet giant Chief. Producer and friend of director Milos Forman, Michael Douglas was wise to produce this epic in cinematic history. \"Nest\" is filled with colorful humor and a well written screenplay (idealy another Oscar award) along with Actor (Nicholson), Actress (Fletcher), Director (Forman) and Best Picture. This is one of the greatest films ever made and with a bitter sweet ending, a sure tear jerker. My final rating 10/10"
