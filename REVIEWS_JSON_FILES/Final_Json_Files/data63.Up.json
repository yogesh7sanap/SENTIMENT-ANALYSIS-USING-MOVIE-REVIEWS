Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.\n\nThe first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar."

        "review_detailed_main": "This lovely film tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, a little friendly widower who lives alone in a house restored along with his late wife, Ellie, whose memory he cherishes constantly. Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn't want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.\n\nDirected by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like \"Wall-e\", \"Monsters Inc.\" or \"Finding Nemo\", this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.\n\nThe most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell's goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.\n\nFor all these things, \"Up\" is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.\n\nFirst of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.\n\nI have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.\n\nAnd finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.\n\nMy favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no \"new\" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.\n\nAs the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone \u2013 young \"wilderness explorer\" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.\n\nThe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.\n\nComing off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.\n\nWhat makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a \"bird\" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story \u2013 the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.\n\nBut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun \u2013 something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.\n\nBut of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).\n\nI cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Up\" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us \"Wall-E\" and before that \"Ratatouille.\" \"Up\" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.\n\nThe story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager \"wilderness explorer,\" has stowed away beneath his porch.\n\nThe second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless \"three days\" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: \"Kevin\" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and \"Doug\" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.\n\nWhere the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.\n\nMuntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.\n\nThe visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.\n\n\"Up\" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against \"Up\" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that \"Ratatouille\" or \"Wall-E\" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission."

        "review_detailed_main": "UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.\n\nThe one clue I can give away \u2013 because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise \u2013 is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.\n\nI'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting \u2013 perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.\n\nAlso, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.\n\nBeyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that \u2013 at least in the audience I was in \u2013 when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.\n\nThere's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie \u2013 particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.\n\nThere aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.\n\nUP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action \u2013 nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle \"Bambi,\" this film should be a breeze."

I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying \"this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs.\" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork.\n\nSeen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, \"How does the artwork get any better than this?\" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than \"in the old days,\" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.\n\nThe colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/\n\nBack to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.\n\nWhile I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.\n\nNo question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.\n\nSpecial kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.\n\nI am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved."

The beginning of the movie and the movie stars were excellent. I'm really sympathetic to Carl. Rarely is a cartoon character well written in a target for children. The story of the movie was excellent, the message of the movie was, and I feel that the movie made me feel the magic of the Disney films that I missed a lot, the evil of the film was disappointing and was not convincing unlike the rest of the bad guys at Pixar and Disney, my rating for the movie is 9.2"

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.\n\nA lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.\n\nA real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.\n\n3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.\n\nSoooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.\n\nWhat I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. Think about best movies you have ever seen - remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?"

My expectation was so high and I had been waiting for those good things coming to me throughout the whole movie, then found out there was nothing, no excitement nor surprise in this movie at all! Right now, I cannot recall a single thing which I think is special in this movie. A very so-so movie with a very typical Hollywood ending. There should be better story tellers out there. There should be a better movie deserves such high rating. Even my 7-year old daughter thought this movie was just OK. Very disappointed!"

        "review_detailed_main": "What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.\n\nThe movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.\n\nJust brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of \"robot\" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.\n\nUp is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10."

To this day, the beginning of the film is one of my most memorable cinema experience."

        "review_title": "Move Thee Reviews: Up Lets Me Down",
        "review_detailed_main": "Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.\n\nHowever, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to \"float\" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?\n\nOn the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated \"Up\" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's \"WALL\u00b7E\", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to \"King Kong\", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, \"Up\" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in \"Up\" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****"

Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family. It ended very gracefully with a happy ending for the two main and primary characters that lies within the movie. I am very glad that I had spent my time and money to watch this exquisite animation.

The rest of the movie is a super fun adventure and is one of the funniest Pixar films to date. The kid, the bird, the dogs, all great.

The characters we meet during this middle section are so over-the-top, and their motives so bizarre, that there's just no identifying with them. We quickly lose sight of the plot line that got us started on our adventure (or stop caring about it) only to be surprised when we rejoin it shortly before the credits roll.\n\nAnyway: See it once, but don't expect to feel any attachment.

Up has all of the qualities you could hope for in an animated film; high quality graphics, convincing voice actors, suitability for kids and adults alike, and a compelling storyline. You feel yourself experiencing emotions with the characters as they go through challenging, fun and frightening experiences. The way that this film makes you feel empathy is incredible!\n\nMy dad, who is renowned for hating animated films, was convinced to watch this with me, my mum and my younger sister, and afterwards he actually admitted to being very impressed and saying that he would happily watch it again in the future! So, even if animation isn't your usual style, I recommend that you take a chance and experience the wonder that is Up."

        "review_detailed_main": "The boy Carl Fredrickson is a dreamer that idolizes the adventurer Charles Munts. When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives.\n\n\"Up\" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in \"Gran Torino\". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like \"Wall-e\" or \"The Incredibles\". My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Up \u2013 Altas Aventuras\" (\"Up \u2013 High Adventures\")"

It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.\n\nI actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated.

Even after hearing that Pixar was attached to this film, I still thought the movie would failed.....oh boy was I wrong.\n\nUp is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's takes a crazy premise and makes it deep, confronting and oddly relatable. Makes otherwise annoying and one dimensional characters deep. And makes the audience look on in awe one minute, laugh out loud the next and then cry their eyes out finally.\n\nThere certainly is something to be said about a movie which can make you blubber like a little girl 10mins in only to do it again in the last 20mins. Hopefully I've said enough."

        "review_title": "Let's stop congratulating Pixar",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian \"Wilderness Explorer\" who wants to earn an \"assisting the elderly\" badge. The movie \"teaches\" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.\n\nThe film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's \"adventure\" scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.\n\nThere's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.\n\nI want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL\u00b7E' was\n\ntranscendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.\n\nThe house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of \"moral fable\" and damns the old Disney ones as mere \"psychological fables\" marked by \"cloyingness\" and \"malevolent overtones.\" Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.\n\nIt's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations?\n\nThere's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL\u00b7E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did."

In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their \"funny ideas to stick in a movie someday\" jar. They should have looked to see if it fit, first.\n\nThere were some moving scenes, stunningly rendered, but as a cohesive long feature it fails."

It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.\n\nI would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.\n\nThe movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said \"I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier.\" Well, I certainly concur.\n\nThis is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, \"It's not funny.\" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself. I promise you'll be brought to tears, but they'll soon be wiped away as scenes become more comedic.\n\nEnjoy!"

It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie.

To be fair, my first attempt to watch only came a few years ago.\n\n\"Up\" is a sometimes-dark movie about an old man named Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) who decided to fulfill his wife's dream of going to Paradise Falls in South America. His plan involved thousands of helium balloons and power of will. His trip was slightly derailed when a ranger scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) crashed the one-man party. The two of them made a real adventure of the house move.\n\nThe movie was pretty heavy at times, but I liked it overall."

        "review_detailed_main": "Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.\n\nCarl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).\n\nThe film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of \"Up,\" a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.\n\nMore importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Toy Story\" worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. \"Up\" tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.\n\nAt least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.\n\nI won't stop you from going to see \"Up.\" It's fun, but don't expect another \"Wall-E.\""

Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him."

It is about an old man getting the adventure of his lifetime, hoping to do it for his deceased wife, but eventually letting himself move on from it. The very end of the film when Carl lets his house float away saying \"it's just an old house\" perfectly encompasses this theme. I can totally understand people not liking this movie as much as me, or preferring a different pixar film over this one (I love just about every pixar film) but subjectively, this film has had the greatest impact on my life, and I appreciate it to the moon and back."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even trailer made me cry when he goes up mountain alone. For a few perilous moments in the middle of \"Up,\" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as \"king\" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with \"Toy Story\" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.\n\nThis generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.\n\nSo far, so good, as \"Up\" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as \"The Red Balloon,\" \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.\n\nThe trouble for \"Up\" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.\n\nYet, what eventually saves \"Up\" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the \"adventure\" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of \"The Wizard of Oz\"). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.\n\nThe animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, \"Ratatoille\" and \"Wall-E,\" but the less spectacular look actually makes \"Up\" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through."

        "review_detailed_main": "Up was definitely a good, quality movie. The visuals and landscapes were very bright, defined, and full of wonderful detail and description. Easily the best aspect of this movie, story-wise, was the early montage showing Carl moving through life from a young child, to marriage, older adulthood, up through the death of his wife. Though you didn't know this character too well at this point, you felt for him rather deeply by seeing his life progress, start to end. This flow of life from childhood to old age is an immediately identifiable aspect of the movie. Anyone with a depth of personality and a reflective side, can identify with this. It is Film-making at it's best. We all know the feeling. The vibe and feel one gets when at weddings, graduations, funerals and any place at which one can be witness to the fast flowing nature of life and the reflection that naturally comes with such moments.\n\nUnfortuntaley the rest of the film did not live up to the emotional weight that this scene created. The movie took turns for the inane and silly, without enough in place to \"ground\" it to the worthy beginning. The bird Kevin was sort of random and odd, as was the talking pack of dogs. These 2 plot creations would seem to be mainly geared towards the child audiences that any animated film is sure to garner. The weight and meaning from the beginning was lost in these campy moments.\n\nCarl's hero, Mintz, as an aged, obsessed, evil, egomaniac seemed to be out of nowhere as well. It appeared to be like something out of a week-day cartoon. The movie again lost its direction and focus during these parts, particularly as Carl was attempting to get his house over to the falls. Once you make it within eye sight of the falls, you're there! As the film ended, some emotional, weighty moments did occur, culminating in Carl's friendship with Russell and the pictures shown during the end credits. There were not enough of these moments and too many moments that went for the \"silly\", specifically scenes with the dogs, the birds, and, Mintz.\n\nI definitely understand the affinity for this film, yet I do not feel, when taking into consideration the loss of focus and random/silly moments in the film, the drive to describe this movie as one of the best Pixar movies of all time. Ratatouille, Wall-E, The Incredibles, for starters, were all more complete and quality films with more of a consistent flow, from cover to cover."

        "review_detailed_main": "Up, released in 2009, is a cinematic masterpiece that manages to be both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, the movie is a poignant exploration of life, love, and adventure. The animation is stunning, and the characters are memorable, making Up one of Pixar's greatest achievements.\n\nThe story of Up follows Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man who embarks on a journey to South America in his house, which is lifted by thousands of balloons. Along the way, he meets a young boy named Russell and a colorful cast of characters, and they have a series of thrilling and emotional adventures. The film explores themes of grief, friendship, and the importance of living life to the fullest, and it does so with humor and heart.\n\nThe animation in Up is breathtaking, and it captures the beauty and wonder of the natural world. The film's opening sequence, which depicts Carl's life with his wife Ellie, is a masterclass in visual storytelling, and it sets the tone for the rest of the film. The character design is also exceptional, with Carl and Russell each having unique and memorable features.\n\nThe music in Up is another standout aspect of the film. The score, composed by Michael Giacchino, is beautiful and moving, and the use of music in the film is both subtle and powerful. The film's signature piece, \"Married Life,\" is a hauntingly beautiful composition that perfectly captures the emotional resonance of the story.\n\nThe voice acting in Up is superb. Ed Asner brings Carl to life with his gruff and lovable performance, and Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell, a plucky and endearing young boy. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with standout performances from Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz and Bob Peterson as Dug the dog.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Up is its emotional depth. The film explores complex themes of loss, regret, and the importance of human connection, and it does so with sensitivity and nuance. The movie's emotional impact is powerful, and it will leave you moved and inspired.\n\nThe attention to detail in Up is remarkable. The film's sound design is exceptional, and every sound effect is carefully chosen and executed. The movie's use of color is also noteworthy, as it creates a rich and immersive world that is both beautiful and terrifying.\n\nUp is a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It celebrates the joys of life while acknowledging the pain and loss that come with it. The movie is a cinematic triumph that will leave you awestruck and inspired.\n\nIn conclusion, Up is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. The animation, story, voice acting, music, and attention to detail are all exceptional, and they come together to create a film that is unforgettable. Up is a must-see for anyone who appreciates great storytelling and animation, and it is a testament to the power of cinema to inspire and move us."

        "review_detailed_main": "Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.\n\nEd Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.\n\nBeneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.\n\nThe film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy \u2013 it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can \u2013 but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time."

This film was not just another goofy animated romp, however. It was surprisingly touching with some deep themes, while also strikingly original and altogether great! While a little slow in places for the toddler set, it nonetheless grabs hold of your heart and doesn't let it go. am not a fan of animation movie but when i saw Up, i was lost for words. was very much emotional for me and I loved every minute of it, and left the theatre with a big smile on my face...a must see movie!"

Maybe those expectations ruined it for me, as expectations often do, but I really don't think this movie deserves a spot this high. Okay, it's funny. But so are Monsters Inc., Wall-E, Finding Nemo and countless others. The story is imaginative and entertaining, but no magic. The plot tries to push us through a wide range of emotions, but the movie's sugar-coated, candy-like look and slapstick nature kept me from identifying too much with its fairly shallow characters. A while ago, I saw \"Spirited Away\", a movie that touches the soul, takes you into a land beyond your wildest imaginations and leaves you with magical, dreamlike images you won't forget for a long time. Compared to movies like that, \"Up\" seems like your typical \"let's all have a good time\" - Disney family entertainment flick. Which is perfectly all right, and I will gladly give it a 7 out of 10, but this movie is definitely no milestone in movie history."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"That might sound boring ... but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.\" Up has to be the most over hyped Pixar movie.\n\nFirst off let me say, the main theme for this film is so good it practically became Pixar's own theme, it's so beautiful.\n\nThe first 10 minutes are the peak of the film. Lovely, emotional, and surprisingly mature. After those 10 minutes I don't really care for it anymore as it descends into goofiness.\n\nI found Russell to be an extremely annoying and unlikeable character, (ironic that I used one of his quotes), but I do also really like where his character ends up.\n\nThen we have the dogs, I pretty much despise everything to do with the dogs (Dug especially). I found them used mostly for comedic relief that wasn't needed in the first place, and they serve no larger purpose to the story other than henchmen for the villain.\n\nThe villain never clicked with me either, his character seemed overly aggressive and evil for no rhyme or reason.\n\nAnd then we have Kevin, who singlehandedly saved this film. Her design and personality was just what this film needed. They should've just used Kevin as the comedic relief instead of the dogs in my opinion.\n\nUp very much conflicts me. There are parts in this film that are super beautiful and touching, then we have parts that are overly goofy and unneeded.\n\nUp does have a really nice story, (though mostly forgettable), an iconic score, and of course great animation, it's honestly a good movie, but I feel like the stuff I didn't like heavily outweighed the stuff I did like."

This desire to experience things, see the world, live life to the fullest, and to do it with someone we love. All of this makes Carl a very relatable character and one that we can connect to almost instantly. Russell is a bit annoying at times and is there to appeal to the younger audience, but I grew to love him over the course of the film.\n\nThe central idea is just pure Pixar genius and so full of magic and joy. I defy anyone not to crack a huge smile when that house starts to float. The plot is pretty standard Pixar, following the usual formula and with similar themes. It's very enjoyable, with a great pace to it and a terrific arc for our protagonist.\n\nAs ever with a Pixar film, the voice performances could not be better. The animation is just breath taking. Some of the cloud animation could have been real, it is just so well done. The use of colour and sound in Up are also magnificent. It's just such a joy to look at.\n\nI do think this film is *slightly* over hyped, but maybe that's just because I was over 10 years late to the party watching it.\n\nYet another Pixar gem!"

Some of us might have heard that this is Pixar's crowning achievement, surpassing the likes of \"Toy Story\" and \"Finding Nemo\". Regardless of the buzz surrounding \"Up\", the film remains, quite simply, one of the finest animated movies of recent history, if not of all time. Yes, the first ten minutes are extremely compelling, and I have never seen a movie achieve its exposition so well in such a subtle way; it's something beyond remarkable. The life of Carl Fredrickson is played out to show the love he shared with his wife, Ellie, and how they had some big dreams that never quite came true. The rest of the movie is a beautiful testament to how love and the spirit of ambition take new forms as life goes on, as Carl befriends Russel, an enthusiastic young scout, Dug, a talking dog, and \"Kevin\", an inappropriately named tropical bird. The way this film tackles heavy issues like loss and grieving is so profound and yet simple enough for any audience member to understand. There's enough laughs to keep the kids interested, enough touching moments for adults, and an amazing sense of adventure for the kid in all of us. I can't really name a favorite movie, but if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to decide, this would certainly be one of the first to cross my mind. Absolutely essential viewing. Perfect."

        "review_detailed_main": "The five brains of Docter, Stanton, Lasseter, Peterson & McCarthy, put out yet another heartfelt and moving, family-fun adventure film! They incorporated a lot of emotional notes, with some great laughs! The first act is the best first act Pixar has ever put out! It gets the audience connected and invested so fast, by using detailed flashbacks to set up a sentimental montage; making us truly care for our main protagonist, Carl Fredrickson.\n\nCarl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner, had the most pronounced character arch, being a character you truly cared about the whole time, despite his negative attitude half of the time. He brings a lot of mature wit to the film, dishing out the harsh truth at times. Russell, voiced by Jordan Nasgai is a loud, yet optimistic & charming character, that had great merit. He may have gotten to be a tad annoying as the film proceeds, but he is a fantastic addition to Carl. Charles F. Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, is our main antagonist. He really wasn't anything special, or unpredictable; he just served his purpose at a surface level. Dug, voiced by Bob Peterson was nothing but a fury enjoyment at first, but ended up having great character development, and a respectable place in the film. Kevin is just one of those animals, Pixar continues to throw into films, that they try to make important. Kevin was better than most animal additions, but I didn't truly care for his reason, or his character at all.\n\nThe cinematography and animation created this very vibrant and colorful film. The animations were beautifully detailed, along side the breathtaking backdrops and scenery.\n\nAlthough Up has a lot of entertaining moments, it doesn't come without a few bumps in the road. Even though the opening act is one of the best we've seen from Pixar, it's really hard to keep that pace up for the whole run time. Up does it's best to do just that, but does slack in some areas. With Pixar, they create these mental obstacles that you need to be able to overlook, and in Up's case, it has a few easy nitpicks. I had no problems overlooking some obstacles, but they incorporated a lot of stretched out abilities, with the leeway they were already granted. Another strange thing they did was create a few counteracting tones, trying to be poignant at some points, but silly throughout most of the film.\n\nOverall, Up is one of Pixar's finest, and belongs in the top ten!"

It is fun for kids as well as adults, it makes you care about the characters, the animation is flawless and the plot keeps your attention every second. Still, Up is one of the strongest arguments for closing the vote until the hype has passed (Maybe until the movie has been released on DVD?) Along with movies like The Dark Knight, Star Trek and the other Pixar Wall-E it makes me more and more certain that this is the solution. Don't get me wrong, I loved both Wall-E and the Dark Knight, but there still is no way that they're as great as the ratings say. Besides, Star Trek was plain awful. Slumdog Millionaire is probably the only hyped movie I can think of that has landed on an appropriate rating in the end. Anyway, I recommend Up, it is a good movie you and your kids probably will want to see again and again if you are a Pixar fan, and if you're not I recommend it all the same. 7/10."

I'd say that this movie is good for kids - it will teach them some generally good characteristics. And movie wasn't funny...it was cute and nice...and heartbreaking . Someone can say, that it is a sign of a good quality movie, when it touches your heart. I agree with that, and sometimes it can be too much of touching.

        "review_title": "'Up' is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness",
        "review_detailed_main": "Co-written by directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson from a story created by them alongside Thomas McCarthy, Up begins with an absolutely moving sequence that, in just a few minutes, depicts the beautiful love story between Carl Fredricksen and Ellie, from childhood to old age. With an extremely elegant narrative economy, this introduction portrays, almost without any dialogue, the routine of a couple who, dreaming of a trip to South America and a house full of babies, is forced to adapt to reality as they the difficulties and disappointments of everyday life get in the way - and when this sequence comes to an end, not only has the film already won and moved the audience, but it has also established, in an incredibly efficient way, the motivations and personality of the interesting protagonist.\n\nPixar's brilliance, by the way, can already be seen in the confident and intelligent way the narrative is conducted: aware that the intro would likely immerse the audience in a melancholy atmosphere, the filmmakers immediately break the mood with a small visual gag, when Carl , getting out of bed, cracks his spine while trying to stretch his body - and the contrast between this brief moment of humor and the sad scene that came immediately before already establishes Up as a film capable of oscillating with talent between pain and joy.\n\nAnd the drama of \"Up\" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other.\n\nWith a technical refinement typical of Pixar productions, Up represents the studio's first foray into 3D technology - and it is not for nothing that the film already begins with a metalinguistic joke by displaying \"archive\" images that, through the retreat of the camera, become reveal as scenes projected on a cinema screen, establishing a link between that audience's plunge and our own on our respective big screens. That said, directors never use 3D as an end in itself, using the resource only as a complement to the action - and so instead of relying on objects that seem to jump towards the viewer, Docter and Peterson prefer to deposit their energies in the beautiful production design, as when conceiving an airship whose conventional exterior ends up surprising by housing an internal environment whose narrow corridors end up opening up to impossibly wide spaces. Likewise, the look of the characters is an attraction in itself, from Carl's square face, which contrasts with his impeccably round nose, to the villain Charles Muntz (Plummer's) physiognomy, clearly inspired by Kirk's unmistakable face. Douglas. (Also, notice how the protagonist's beard starts to emerge over time, in a careful detail that serves as a typical example of what separates Pixar from other computer animation companies.)\n\nEach character in Up is a class in character building. Carl and Russel are, respectively, the maximum characterization of the grumpy old man and the electric child. Even though these \"reductions\" are clich\u00e9s, in the skillful hands of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson they become the springboard for two lives separated by many years of experience that gradually converge into a ballet of dialogues and small revelations that he is capable of. Soften the most rigid hearts. Before Scout Russell's arrival, Carl symbolized castration. Carl's old age, at the beginning of the film, is represented by a negative look, of disability and decadence. Carl is grumpy, stubborn, no longer has as much physical independence and does not want to interact socially. The cane and the heavy glasses he carries are symbols of old age and growing physical frailty. In addition to losing his physical and mental vigor, Carl also finds himself facing the loss of autonomy to choose where he wants to live, since he is practically expelled from his own house. The difficult interaction between you and the boy turns out to be permeated with a lot of learning. It is the daily life with Russell that makes Carl change his way of looking at the world and allows him to get the bonds of the past to be able to experience the adventures of the present.\n\nAn explorer, the boy has the strength and energy that Carl no longer has. He is, in a way, the opposite of him, and reminds Carl of the feelings he had as a child. If Carl symbolizes decay, Russell is the potential, the growth. In an original way, it is Russell, at the height of his childhood, who helps Carl to find his place in the world. The film raises the question of the relationship between the exchange of knowledge between the generations that are at both ends of life. The interactions between Carl and Russell allow both characters to mature. This exchange of experiences promotes an enormous identification with the public and awakens the viewer's memory for the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren or the elderly and children in general.\n\nWe also have other very pertinent criticisms. The expropriation of Carl's house, made unwillingly by the huge construction company, criticizes the contemporary, capitalist world, which prioritizes profits and sees in the widower's house only a space to increase the building he intends to build. When looking at the space and seeing only good ground for the work, the businessman denies the entire life story of Carl and Ellie, the way they rehabilitated the place and transformed the abandoned building into the family residence for decades. Residence is, therefore, a synthesis of life together.\n\nThe house has a very strong symbology in the plot: the walls of the house witnessed the whole relationship, from the first day of the meeting - when the two played together with aviators - until the wife's last days. The imagination here is what ends up saving Carl, who uses the skills of the profession he had - he was a balloon salesman -, to literally make his own home take off. The rise of the house by the balloons represents a double solution: on the one hand Carl manages to protect the house as it is, protecting it from the interest of those who wanted to demolish it, and on the other hand, it manages, from within its comfort and space, also fulfill your dream. The house also represents Carl's love for Ellie, which did not end with his wife's death. Taking the house to South America also means, in a way, transporting Ellie to visit the longed-for place of her dreams and to honor her. The character's entry into the new phase of his life can be summed up by the moment when he manages to detach himself from the house, throwing away furniture and other memories that proved his resistance to the past. The new, here, is only possible after Carl learns to deal with the memory of what was left behind.\n\nAnd the drama of \"Up\" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars' characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other. But not everything is perfect. What bothers me the most about \"Up\", is really the forced use of talking dogs, with them flying planes or sitting playing cards. But it also needs to be playful and it is a movie for children too, so I understand the purpose of such scenes and in the general balance it does not harm the drama or detract from the merits of the adventure.\n\nWe also have other obvious problems, which is a pity - and the most disappointing of these concerns the unimaginative way in which the directors conceive the \"locations\" of the film: if we could initially assume that the Paradise dreamed by Carl and Ellie would prove to be a breathtaking place, so we are forced to realize that it is nothing more than a rocky and lifeless environment, wasting the chance that the feature film would have to dazzle us visually (and, in this respect, Up is one of Pixar's most bureaucratic jobs ). As if that wasn't enough, the relationship between Carl and Russell sounds schematic, made even more artificial given the confusing and clich\u00e9d way the script portrays the problems the boy faces with his father. And what can I say about the fate of the evil Muntz, who follows the same beaten path as so many other Disney villains?\n\nIn fact, despite all the atmosphere of adventure and fiction present in the narrative, above all \"Up\" is a story about moving forward and building simple moments with important people. We often seek the grand, but the simple can be the essential that is often not valued, or invested. Up maintains Pixar's tradition of using its light stories to address surprisingly adult themes - and here perhaps the studio attacks one of the most difficult of them: the expectation of the human being in the face of their own dreams and loss. In trying to fulfill what he had promised Ellie, Carl is obviously seeking to recover the closeness he had with his wife, as if reaching the Paradise Falls (meaningful name, this) could bring some kind of comfort to his loss - and by stating that his loneliness and his pain remain unchanged, the protagonist has no choice but to continue living.\n\nJoining The Tomb of Fireflies and The Lion King on the list of animations capable of bringing adults to endless tears, Up - is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build what most filmmakers contemporaries fail to create with real actors: stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.\n\nThe last time I went to see an \"3D\" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those \"Cross your heart\" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.\n\nMy wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.\n\nAnd all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.\n\nThe audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the \"too young to even enjoy Dr Suess\" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done."

        "review_detailed_main": "For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.\n\nIn other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.\n\nLike all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.\n\nAll of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.\n\nWhat's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie.\n\nUp is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.\n\nThe bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Walt Disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. His goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?\n\nUp is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.\n\nOur cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to \"relate\" to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was \"America, only south\". Russell takes GPS for granted and says \"You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff.\" Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.\n\nWhat follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. \"Can we keep it?\" Russell says. \"No\" Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. \"But it's a talking dog!!\" Russell finally exclaims.\n\nUp also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart."

More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up. A truly remarkable film done with love and passion that deserves all the plaudits and all the stars in all the magazines and review shows around the world. Perfection."

        "review_title": "Good, but not great",
        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know, Up is very, very good, but I don't think it's quite great. Of all the Pixar movies up to and including Toy Story 3, I'd say the only movies I like less than Up are A Bug's Life and Cars (the latter of which is easily the worst). But the third worst movie of Pixar's first 15 years is still a very good movie, which I think really speaks to how great their initial run of movies was.\n\nI think what holds it back a little for me is that I don't find it as emotional or moving as most people. I can appreciate the opening is sad, but it's never really moved me or made me personally sad, which is strange, because the tearjerker Pixar scenes usually get to me (like the Jessie flashback in Toy Story 2, the opening of Finding Nemo, and all the stuff intended to be sad in Inside Out). Other minor flaws? I think the villain is a bit weak. He has little to no redeeming or understandable qualities, beyond \"he's crazy because he's been stuck in the jungle for 60 years.\" The way he comes across as okay and then reveals himself to be villainous like three minutes later just feels so awkward to me. Also, while I appreciate the music and the way that main theme changes throughout, I don't really like the theme to start with. I find it kind of grating, even if it technically and thematically works.\n\nWhere this movie does shine is in the animation, the humour, and the bond that forms between the two main characters. All the stuff with the dogs is great, too- I know that's the part of the movie that's most obviously aimed at the kids in the audience, but it's still the part of the movie I love the most.\n\nThe story is told well, and the voice acting is all good too. I just don't find it as moving as most Pixar films, I think the villain is a bit weak, and I think it has one of my least favourite music scores of any Pixar movie. But it's still good- it's solid and entertaining, just not quite great, in my opinion."

I attended with my 5 year old daughter, 8 year old son and two friends. We all really enjoyed this movie. The storyline was probably a bit over my daughter's head but she was drawn to the characters Dug the dog and Kevin the bird so it didn't make much difference. She was giggling through out the movie over their antics. My 8 year old son was drawn to the idea of a flying house and the adventurousness of the story as well as the characters. Certain parts of the story had my girlfriends and I getting choked up and teary eyed but that aspect of the story was over their head. There are a couple take aways from this movie depending on how old you are and not wanting to spoil it I will leave it at that. I highly recommend this movie! See it as a family if you can. It will make for wonderful discussion afterwords. My one regret was that my husband couldn't make it but we'll definitely see it again so he can. It's wonderful!"

Even if I really like them I still have a twinge of despair that they are in the 3D medium. I don't want to say that I am completely transformed and now love 3D, but Pixar always does a great job in lessening that pain.\n\nI found Up to be a very heartwarming film. We got a glimpse of Pixar trying to play with the heartstrings in Wall-E, but they definitely have some far more emotional moments in Up. But with the great laughs and story included. I found it to be a fantastic ride that will have you almost in tears one minute and then laughing out loud the next. Great story. Great voice actor. And great Animation. Well done Pixar.\n\nIf anyone could get a stubborn old traditionalist like me to enjoy a 3D film, it's you..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first time I've been to the cinema in about 18 months. That's having small children for you. So, it's my birthday. 42, since you didn't ask. It's half term, and the cinema is heaving with children; our own son is too small yet for the film, so it's just us adults. We're a little late, and the auditorium is a strange sight as everyone is wearing dark glasses. My first 3D film! Keep up. This is going to be relevant.\n\nI'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum, but anyone who's even half awake will know that Pixar's latest animated feature follows the adventures of an old man and a small boy who fly a house to South America using balloon power. Up is a beautiful movie. Every scene is lovingly rendered with a fantastic attention to detail- to take one example, the way the use of colour alters during the course of the film as the mood changes.\n\nThe film contains early in its running time a scene destined to become a classic of cinema, a wordless montage sequence explaining our hero Carl's life from a child to an old man. One shot alone contains more pathos and humanity than many films this year will manage in total. At the end of this sequence, it would be a hard heart indeed that was not moved.\n\nOnce Carl finds his young stowaway, the pace shifts up a gear as the two get involved in an adventure in the mythic location of Paradise Falls where Carl has always longed to go.\n\nOn one level, this is a fantastic film, surely one of the best of the year; moving, funny, heart-warming (with a soup\u00e7on of the environmental message seemingly mandatory in all such features). All kinds of lessons are learnt. Following one's dreams; living in the moment; the dangers of obsession. Carl's house becomes a very large extended metaphor, taking him soaring away from his old life, but then tying him down when he needs to be free.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet.\n\nWhat this most definitely is not is a children's film, especially not younger ones. Fairly early on, a small voice whispered behind me, \"I thought this was supposed to be funny.\" Yes, it contains its share of slapstick humour and chase sequences that will thrill smaller kids, but its main themes will go straight over their heads.\n\nFor adults, meanwhile, the plot fails on several levels. Yes, I know this is nitpicking, but movies have to follow their own logic. I am fully prepared to accept within the world of the film that a house can be floated by balloons and steered across continents. However, how does an old man who walks stiffly with a cane suddenly start taking part in action sequences? I can accept that someone has invented a device for translating dogs' thoughts into speech- but how do they prepare dinner (or fly planes)? Ultimately, these concerns will fade. My lasting impression will be the beauty of the pictures and the tear rolling down my cheek at the end of the truly amazing montage near the start of the film."

It had a good moral for the kids who watch it along with a type of feel good at the end. The movie contained humor which I love and it had a little action... even if it was animated.\n\nI'm a fan of movies such as Crank, Gran Tornio, etc... I love my action, but this is a great movie nonetheless. I would recommend it to anybody. I would personally rate this as a \"MUST SEE\" for anybody... or an 8/10.\n\nBTW, if you're wondering why I didn't recap the movie... you can get the gist from IMDb itself, or previews (I'm not one to spoil movies)."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people have written about the humour, excitement, sweetness, depiction of love etc. etc. of this film, and with most of that I'd concur; I want to write about the element I haven't seen mentioned much, and which I perhaps enjoyed and was impressed by the most -- Pixar's homage to the spirit of the past, right down to the authentic style of the vocals in the 'period' song that plays at the end of the credits. (Not just a bit of distort and crackle to make it sound old -- if anything, that's overdone -- but the singing technique and orchestration are spot-on for a pre-war popular record. Wish I could say the same for the rhymes, but 'adventure' clearly isn't the easiest couplet to complete..!)\n\nBy having Carl as the principal character and his adventures triggered by his childhood fantasies, Pixar have very cleverly contrived to have their cake and eat it: to produce what is basically a 'Boys' Own' adventure full of lost jungles, unknown species, biplanes and giant airships, mad scientific gadgets and a reclusive genius -- something out of the \"Eagle\" magazine, right down to its action climax -- and yet to set it in what is supposedly the modern world of its juvenile audience. The 1931 newsreel with which the film opens is wonderful pastiche (and was that a visual reference to \"King Kong\", as adventurer Muntz prepares to reveal his latest discovery?), the two children and their games bring the period to life as the real existence of people just like us without feeling in any way anachronistic, and then the segment that follows demonstrates Pixar's effective use and command of an even earlier idiom -- the fluent story-telling of the *silent* film era.\n\nToo much has been written already on the impact and poignancy of this wordless love-story for me to be able to add anything to its praise. I would agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is very rare for films of any kind to depict the married love of adults, let alone to do it in animation so sweetly as this.\n\nBut actually, the moment when tears came to my eyes was not during this segment at all, but the moment when the house takes off and Carl makes his defiant adventure/escape... (Shades of the Crimson Permanent Assurance!)\n\nI found most of this film very enjoyable indeed, especially the retro adventure feel and the dog psychology. What actually undermined it for me was not the surrogate-family-bonding scenario, which would normally have been anathema to me but is handled convincingly here, but the handling of the villain. Interestingly, reading comments on the IMDb boards suggests not only that I am not alone in this, but that the film's creators themselves weren't very sure right up to a late stage in production what to do with him -- the result is that the character, who could have been intriguing, is simply dropped into one-dimensional mode and wasted.\n\nI would have preferred a treatment more like the ending of \"Ratatouille\" (and would have preferred a beginning to \"Ratatouille\" more like this!; and for this idiosyncratic reason alone, which did significantly affect my enjoyment, I have rated it down one mark from the level of 9 (for \"deeply moving and exciting\") that it would otherwise have scored on my personal scale. Both films still score by my standards very highly."

What I love about Pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. They make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. And on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. They took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. Yes, UP has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. It is a must see.\n\nOne note of caution: because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, I would not recommend it for little little kids. Perhaps 5 and above would be a good start. I feel the \"married life\" scene while easily the best moment of the film would be too emotionally hard for them."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw the first clip of this movie on the WALL-E DVD, my first impression was, this is crazy, seeing a house rising into the sky by a lot of balloons! I liked the idea of using an old man as the main character, from the moment he said \"afternoon\" in the clip, it felt heart warming. When I first heard about the plot, everything fell into place, and the message behind the house was beautiful. I did have another reservation with the relationship between the old man Carl and the wilderness explorer, Russell, but when I went to see it, nearly everything worked.\n\nThe beginning is definitely one of the best parts of the film, the montage we see on Carl and Ellie's time together was a joy to watch, right through to the end, and it was the first time a film brought a tear to my eye at so early a stage of the plot. As I've already said the message of freedom and being able to do the thing you always want to do in your whole life, was beautifully shown through the flying house. What I was concerned about before hand was the relationship between Carl and Russell. From seeing later clips of the film, I was worried that the film was going to be hampered down by \"the main character and his sidekick\" gags, especially when you add in a bird that won't go away, and a witless dog. Yet the film doesn't fall into that trap, yes there are still sidekick gags, but the creators don't overdo it. What's more, in a way the characters, Russell, Kevin and Dug, are not like the usual dumb sidekicks you get in any short TV cartoons, they're natural sidekicks. Russell for instance is the kind of kid with curiosity and the idea that everything is a game, which would lead to trouble. There are action sequences in this film that takes you on a helter-skelter of a ride, and when I left the cinema I felt I had a great time. To anyone, this film would seem to be defying the laws of science, and it's not just because of a flying house. Yet, I didn't care about this because this is a children's film! The gags were great, yet there was one on the dogs voices which, though it was hilarious, I felt was a bit camp for Pixar's standards.\n\nThe Mis-en-scene was beautiful. Obviously the two contrasting settings in this film are the city and the paradise falls. Paradise Falls is of course the main attraction and we see a ray of colours from the natural setting, compared to the grey and organised city. The music meanwhile was charming.\n\nFrom other reviews, I heard that the 3D graphics didn't show anything amazing. For me I didn't think it was bad. It definitely didn't pop out of the screen, but I thought it was better than Coraline. I found that the airborne objects, like the house, seemed to stand out more and I enjoyed it There were however a few problems I had with this film. Firstly, there is the matter of the self-improvement in this film. In many of their other films, Pixar has used more than one self-improvement. In WALL-E for example, as well as the robots want for love, there was the human's self-improvement to find their humanity and return to earth, which fitted in nicely. In this film, it was clear that Russell had a self \u2013 improvement to progress in life, namely to become a senior in the wilderness explorers. However, once we got to Paradise falls, the creators seemed to let this self \u2013 improvement sit, and although there were moments, such as the time when we hear Russell talk about his relationship with his father with Carl, there weren't many signs of development. Once you add up the sidekick gags and the helter-skelter action sequences, they seemed to take over the whole plot. We only return to the self-improvement near the end, and at that stage, Russell had improved by then. I enjoyed watching Carl improve, yet it didn't balance with Russell's improvement, along with the many things that was going on. Also, there weren't many twists to the plot. The villain was defeated (so no nod to \"Ratatouille\"), and it was predictable what the dilemma in the second half was going to be (so no nod to \"WALL-E\"). In the end the plot was just the usual plot line you get in any normal film. Also, after seeing the last three films, I was looking forward to a song in the ending credits, and was disappointed when that didn't happen Despite these, the ending for Carl was lovely, and in essence, the things that make Pixar's films great are there. The film didn't bowl me over like \"WALL-E\", but I found it to be a charming film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.\n\nThis is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.\n\nSaying that \"Up\" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clich\u00e9d by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. \"Up\" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, \"Up\" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.\n\nThe rich story in \"Up\" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.\n\nI didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.\n\nOverall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like \"Up\" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of \"Up\" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that \"Up\" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it."

And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring.\n\nNeedless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone."

It seems for a lot of people the central premise/moral of the story touches a nerve, but that one idea alone isn't enough to lift the movie above an average rating.\n\nThe animation is very good, as one has come to expect from Pixar, but sorry, the bar has been raised - in 2009 this level of quality has become the norm, i.e. average.\n\nThe character development is good for Carl Fredricksen, but lacks depth for Russell and also for Charles Munts. Carl is really the only person in the movie who you kind of get attached to, but again, mainly due to the first 10 minutes montage of his life.\n\nThe movie doesn't contain a lot of humour - the one it does have seems forced and silly (dog voice collars, the bird swallowing Carl's walking stick, etc. - yawn). This movie is nowhere near the league of Pixar greats ranging from Toy Story to Wall-E. For other studios this might be considered good, but for Pixar I would consider it average at best."

Carl Fredericksen, a grumpy, yet sweet old man, was amazing. Russel, an 8 year old Boy Scout determined to get every badge, was one of the funniest characters. The child actor was great.\n\nIf you have a dog, or any pet for that matter, then Dug, a talking Mafia dog outcast from his peers, is for you. His facial expressions and funny lines make him lovable. Whereas with Kevin, a giant bird looking to find her baby chicks to save them, is just plain sweet.\n\nOverall, at times, Up was as magical as traditional Disney films, sometimes intense, sometimes emotional, but always entertaining and always hilarious.\n\nPixar certainly knew what they were doing."

Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults."

The mood and the storytelling, how it IS a animation, so over the top things works brilliant, the art direction supports this. I teared up several times during the film, already after few min, and I think you will to.\n\nThe pacing is brilliant, big concluding finale, nothing really overstays it's welcome. It has a lot of funny, clever jokes. It just puts a big smile onto your face, while also touching you in deep places, and with stuff we all think off. We want to do this, we want to do that. I know I do, forget to live in the now. Get over the past, it only does one thing, and that is hold you down, which this movie literally shows time again. Each time he makes bad decisions because of the past, the house gets lower and lower and harder to carry.\n\nIt's just a fantastic movie, I've seen more movies then I can count, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time.

        "review_detailed_main": "Up was I think a slight expansion for Pixar. Right Up in my mind. Their movies in the past hit home well with a wide range of audiences. But this one does even more so. A slightly younger crowd, as well as a slightly older one are easily captivated. This makes for an experience that is just simply amazing, across the board. A tear jerker of an animation, and one hell of a movie. But the expansion of audiences also invites some bad into their otherwise perfect work. I don't wanna give away too much but a high pitched annoying voice and some unexpected plane pilots caused an entire point off for this movie. Nearly two. This may please the younger crowd, but for the older I am afraid it hurt it. It hurt it bad. Besides breaking up the smoothness like a scratching record with this overplayed low-end television trick, it just gives you that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach: They obviously did not preview this movie enough. Now I'm no film critic, but my refrigerator could have caught that one. I mean come on. These moments, and a few more that I cannot seem to remember, leave a bitter taste in your mouth and a feeling of an unpolished work. But besides some absolutely gutter moments, the rest was extremely well done and absolutely a great watch for all ages. And I do mean all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what \"Toy Story\" did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.\n\nI particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.\n\nHowever the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide.\n\nWhile there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.\n\nIn summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be."

        "review_detailed_main": "One day, Pixar might make a film that will just fail to be decent. Fortunately, Up is not that picture. While the story is a little fragmented, this still remains a marvel of animated storytelling that continues the Pixar legacy of releasing solid 3D animated films.\n\nThe story begins with Carl as a child and we quickly watch his relationship with Ellie, through its various phases, through its untimely end. And then we pick up again as Carl decides to make his late wife's dreams come true. He launches his house into the sky via a ton of balloons, but manages to pick up a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell and then his goal gets derailed from there. Along the way, we meet a few other kooky characters, hilarity ensues and we end on a nice note. First of all, I think Up contains some of the most mature themes and story elements of all of their films so far, especially as we watch Carl and Ellie's life together in fast forward. I don't know how much children will fully comprehend what was going on, but despite the brevity, I still found some of the moments to be borderline tearjerkers. One downside to the story is that it's essentially fragmented and requires that \"life with Ellie\" at the beginning, but overall, the \"quest averted\" concept works very well to help bring out Carl's character. Russell does cross into the land of affably annoying and at times it's difficult to retain sympathy for him due to all the trouble he causes, despite his innocence.\n\nThe art is pretty classic Pixar, clean with lots of attention to detail and the animators definitely display their considerable skill in getting the characters to display various degrees of emotions. Voice actors do a great job with their characters, even the rather simple characters. Music is used well, even if it's not hyper-memorable.\n\nUltimately, Up falls into line as a good Pixar film, just under the tier of great Pixar film. Of course, a good Pixar film tends to mean a great film otherwise and I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 8/10."

Only people with no taste and Epic Movie lovers would hate this because those kind of guys are morons. Bottomline: A 10/10 movie with absolutely no flaws.

What Carl's journey represents is his way of dealing with grief and with grief, obsession is something that can easily slip into it and makes you forget what is truly important in life. Up is an incredible animated adventure film that, like others from Pixar's tenure, prove to be more than just for the children and is my favorite Pixar film (and that is saying a lot).

        "review_title": "Pixar Does It Again!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.\n\nOne of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and \"lucky charm\" John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.\n\nEven if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.\n\nBut, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of \"Just be yourself\" or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.\n\nThe only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.\n\nHowever, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life."

They are not intended to tell people how great these ideas are, but to let the audience re-understand the human nature of our lives, which has been abused and even distorted, but is always on the left and right. This sincerity will not let people down."

The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place."

I will first start off by saying the amount of work put into drawing all those balloons in just mindblowing and visually stunning . Also well I may have a bit of a bias Because I have been a scout. I love russell and find him very funny. If there is one problem I have with the movie it's that you will know the villain as soon as you see him. Also the final act of the movie can be a bit ridiculous. But to be fair we are talking about a movie where balloons can lift a whole house. Other than that it is a really fun adventure of a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had high hopes for \"Up\". I don't think it let me down. Maybe I let it down. I don't know.\n\nI think the secret to Pixar's success is that they knew before anyone else that a great children's movie is a great movie, full stop. You don't have to transparently attempt to please both children and adults: this was what was wrong with a lot of terrible family movies, like \"North\". Adult humour seems stunningly out of place in a movie best enjoyed by children, and the truisms children might be hearing for the first time are often ones that adults can do with being reminded of.\n\nAt least, that's what I always thought. \"Up\" starts very well, with an opening montage that makes everybody's list of saddest movie scenes. When the central premise of the flying house suspended by balloons is established, we realise the movie is off to a great start, but where it goes from there just isn't as interesting, and it lost me repeatedly.\n\nMaybe I'll watch it again later, now that I know what to expect, and hopefully I'll be able to replace this review with a more positive one."

The way the story is told, so beautifully realized with very entertaining characters, rich, extremely comical and appealing dialogues, and in the end, what is definitely the most important, a great range of emotions. The movie actually has a lot of material that will keep younger audience more than satisfied, \"Up\" will very much appeal to older viewers. This project is very dynamic, and has really a lot going on in it, but at no time does it lose control or dynamic. The movie was fantastically organized and designed, and definitely everything happens in proper timing. What I think is also very good feature of this project, and directly responsible for its success is that it focuses on a small number of characters. Today is a very hard to get your work characterized as original, but \"Up\" made it happen."

The animation is brilliant, packing little details inside Carl's house that are just stunning. Russel is also amazing. He brings joy to this, sad in a good way, film. The famous \"Married Life\" music really captures the heart and soul of this movie. Unlike other Pixar films, this movie brings out emotions. This movie has already become a classic, not just in my family, but around the world. Definitely give this movie a watch. You will not be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching the movie Up, by Pixar, the viewer is instantly connected emotionally. The love between Carl and Ellie is adorable. The viewer watches them grow old together from a young age. Whether it is working at their day job together or laying at the park staring at clouds together, any person would be envious of the love they have for each other. They always had adventure within them, from a young age they formed an adventure club and filled the pages of Ellie's adventure book with the dream to go to Paradise Falls together. They created a jar to put spare change in that would go towards funding their dream. Carl and Ellie face a lot of bumps on the road towards their dream, Paradise Falls. Some of them include Carl breaking his leg, getting a flat tire, and a tree falling on their house during a storm. This causes them to use the Paradise Falls fund which delays their trip. After these delays, they become content with their love for one another and soon forget about their dream from a young age. Carl remembers about their dream too late and Ellie suddenly passes away early on in the movie. Ellie passes without fulling her and Carl's dream and the viewer is overcome with sadness. However, Carl decides that he wants to make the dream happen for his wife after he is given her adventure book in the hospital in the days before her death. So he works towards being able to go there himself, for the both of them. This captivates the viewer to feel for Carl and wish for his success. In Pixar's movie, \"Up\", determination and loyalty is portrayed in the main character Carl despite the hardships he faces before and after the passing of the love of his life.\n\nAfter Ellie's passing, Carl soon begins working towards his and Ellie's dream. However he soon runs into a problem with construction workers working outside of his house. As the construction goes on, they accidentally smash Carl'a mailbox in his front yard. The mailbox means a lot to Carl because he and Ellie designed it together when they were young. Thus when he sees his mailbox smashed, he is angered. Arguing with the construction workers leads to a court case where Carl is ordered to move into a retirement home forever. By moving in, Carl knows that he would not be able to fulfill his and Ellie's dream of going to Paradise Falls. So Carl thinks of a solution to tie thousands of balloons to his house and make it fly. Carl is willing to do anything and everything to give him a chance at fulfilling his and Ellie's dream.\n\nHe had succeeded in getting his entire house into the air, an enormous feat in itself, but it is not long after he gets his house floating that Carl hears a knock at his front door only to find that it is Russel. The day before Russel showed up at Carl's house asking if he needed any assistance as he was trying to get his last badge for helping the elderly. Carl grew annoyed with him and finds a way to send him away. However when Russel surprises Carl by appearing on his porch, Carl decides to let him in. Russel causes more problems for Carl that he does not need. For instance, Russel accidentally throws the GPS out of the window making it more difficult for Carl to navigate. Carl must now try to navigate his house to Paradise Falls on his own.\n\nEven after lifting his home into the air and dealing with the badgering of Russel, he continues to face adversity. While in the air, they run into a thunderstorm. The thunderstorm shakes the whole house. This causes Carl needing to quickly gather all of his valuables such as pictures of Ellie hanging on the wall so that they do not fall and crack. Carl ends up in a jungle where he comes across a big colorful bird named Kevin. Russel falls in love with the bird, however Carl finds the bird annoying like Russel. Carl soon finds out from dogs in search of Kevin that Kevin is wanted by Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz currently has a skeleton of a real bird like Kevin, but nobody believes him that it is real. Thus he wants it to prove to people that he is still a great explorer. However Carl realizes Kevin is the last specie of the bird, so he pities Kevin and tries to protect him.\n\nCarl does not forget about his dream. After the hardships of being forced into a retirement house, getting his house in the air, finding Russel on his doorstep, running into a thunderstorm, finding Kevin and trying to protect him, Carl continues to work towards his dream. These hardships do not stop Carl. Carl's determination to reach his goal is shown as he does not give up regardless of what obstacles he faces. He is also loyal towards Ellie, as he wants to fulfill their dream. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing motivation. The movie \"Up\" captures the picture of determination perfectly, it truly is an emotionally captivating and well made movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The beginning of the movie is about how Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie Fredricksen, voiced by Elizabeth Docter, developed their relationship. They met when they were young kids and discovered that they shared a common admiration of Charles Muntz, who was a famous explorer. They shared plans of visiting a place in South America called Paradise Falls, where Charles had discovered an exotic creature that was difficult to capture. Carl and Ellie fell in love and grew up together. The movie showed a montage of their relationship that included their marriage, infertility issues, and their attempts to save up money to fulfill their dream of going to Paradise Falls. However, they experience many obstacles that prevent them from saving up the necessary amount of money to go. One day, a young boy named Russell, voiced by Jordan Nagai, visited Carl's house on his journey to earn his last merit badge to become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. Eventually, they decide to embark on the journey to Paradise Falls together. Shortly after arriving there, they discover that Charles Muntz is there and that they have something that he wants.\n\nThe theme of the movie can be seen in the beginning and near the end of the movie, which is the spirit of adventure. Even after experiencing some difficult challenges, Carl was motivated to continue his journey. It's similar to the Disney Pixar movie Onward, where the characters also go on an adventure to fulfill a mission that is filled with obstacles and discoveries. The film was developed in widescreen, which was appropriate for the theme of the movie. Most of the scenes were filled with action or landscape, so the widescreen was necessary and beneficial for the audience's viewing. The film also used music as a transitional sound. The audience can feel the emotions of the scenes by listening to the music. For example, the transition of a happy upbeat song into a slow song that was played during the montage of Carl and Ellie. There was also slow and intense songs that played when Carl and Russell were experiencing tough times on their adventure to Paradise Falls. The friendship that Carl and Russell built throughout the movie demonstrated the importance of friendship, maintaining your childhood, and the spirit of adventure. Russell's young age and enthusiasm reminded Carl how he used to be as a young boy and inspired him to continue to keep his dreams alive."

Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent."

        "review_detailed_main": "The word on the street was that Pixar's latest finally showcased the true potential 3D has in the movie market. Now we aren't talking about the gimmicky extra dimension you find at studio theme parks in the U.S. or in those schlocky horror movies like My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination - whose sole purpose are to make you duck and weave as things are swiped and hurtled at you - the third dimension here would add depth to each and every frame like never before seen. The word on the street was right. There is nothing cheap or sore on the eyes here, just subtle 3D that supports, not replaces, a worthy tale. If this is the direction that 3D is heading in, then I am very excited indeed.\n\nPixar (now owned by Disney) aren't the leading company in animated movies just because of the visual benchmark they continually set. They understand that the story comes first and without it the breathtaking imagery will mean next to nothing. With Up we have an endearing yarn about following your dreams before it is too late, which is genuinely moving for the most part, but it seems to steer into adult territory a little too often. Don't misunderstand, this is a truly wonderful story and it is nice to find a 'kids' movie that isn't afraid to make the audience, both young and old, think, however it could have used a lighter touch to get across the same message. An extra laugh here and there would've been welcomed too.\n\nWe have seen and loved a toy cowboy and spaceman, the last robot on earth, a clownfish and an ugly green ogre yet Carl is one of the most unlikely protagonists to feature in an animated family movie yet: a grumpy old man. However it is a breath of fresh air to see this square-jawed, button-nosed man in his seventies lead the way in a world that inhabits talking dogs and a female exotic bird named Kevin. His offsider, the loveably pudgy Russell, almost steals the show though. His bumbling voice and priceless facial expressions pave the way to majority of the laughs and subsequently ensure his escapades are the most enjoyable to watch.\n\nToy Story or Finding Nemo this is not. But worth seeing at the cinema in superb 3D this is.\n\n3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.\n\nThe plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.\n\nThe rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.\n\nThis is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout."

A couple of very challenging life events are addressed, in ways so graceful and subtle that one could not take offense or decide that the subject matter was inappropriate for a children's film or an animated film. I was fully engaged for this sequence, and ready for more. The opening is capped by a lovely, colorful, effervescent scene depicting a house taking flight.

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"Up\" is a 2009 Walt Disney film about a retired balloon salesman, Carl Fredrickson who is in his 70's living his deceased wife Ellie's childhood dream of adventure to South America. Carl is a funny little man who adored his life with his wife Ellie who he met as a child. After Ellie's death and the court's decision to send Carl to a retirement home, he decides to fulfill Ellie's dream of living on Paradise Falls in South America. Carl fills thousands of balloons with helium and ties them to his house in order to take the house to Paradise Falls. Along the way he realizes that he has another passenger, an eight year old wilderness explorer named Russell. This unlikely duo get off to a rocky start but through meeting new friends like Kevin the bird and Dug the dog they become like father and son. The theme of this film is about life, love, and adventure. In the beginning we see Carl and Ellie's life together up until her death when they are old. We also see the love that they shared. Throughout the rest of the film we see the adventure that Carl takes to live the adventure that Ellie had wanted herself. Towards the end of the film when Carl sits down and looks through the adventure book one last time he realized that Ellie had lived an adventure of her own and was happy with their life together. The film as a whole focused on an old man's dream of fulfilling an adventurous past. Each scene of the film offered a bit of imagination and suspense. When Carl finally reaches Paradise Falls with his house he quickly realizes that his adventure is just beginning. After coming in contact with Kevin the bright colored unusual bird and the talking dog dug the pace of the movie picks up to an action based plot. Carl is torn between saving his house and saving Kevin from his childhood hero. The film was bright in its color format and used very deep but brilliant lighting to enhance the characters themselves. The camera gave different angle shots on specific scenes to keep you in suspense. For example, the scene where the dogs were chasing what appeared to be a very large bird. I found this film to be very mature and more of a young adult type than of a children's style of film. I felt that the film gave a sense of sadness and reality."

Even though I didn't love the rest of the film to the same degree as it, I still enjoyed the film a lot\n\nFirst of all, have you ever seen a concept of a flying house assisted by balloons? I really liked Doug and Kevin, even if it's sort of a children's movie cliche but its executed well so it makes it enjoyable for me.\n\nIt has some pacing issues but it wasn't annoying in any way so it can be forgiven since the climax is exciting! It was kind of ironic how a 100 year old man was still boxing and beating up everyone but yeah, the climax was very endeering, fun, funny, and I specifically liked the scene where Karl views his old adventure book after splitting up with Russel\n\nRating: 8.5/10, Very nice film!"

This run-of-the-mill Disney/Hollywood action is only interrupted towards the end when the film remembers that it has an idea and that it needs to convey a message. It reveals what our true \"lives adventures\" are; this part and the beginning of the film earned the 7 stars from me.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Up\" is a Pixar movie, directed by Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson, which they both wrote with Tom McCarthy too. It has a run time of 96 minutes and was released in the UK in 2009 with a U rating. Featuring the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, and Jordan Nagai this is an absolutely charming movie that is suitable for both a younger audience looking for fun, and a more sentimental older audience that still has a sense of adventure too.\n\nBespectacled Carl Fredricksen idolizes the famous explorer and adventurer Charles Muntz. He learns that Muntz was discredited after it was proved that he faked the skeleton of his recent find, but this does not dampen young Carl's spirits too much as one day he'd like to follow in his hero's footsteps. Muntz was last seen boarding his blimp to go in search of the real bird to salvage his reputation and career. Carl bumps into Ellie, a young girl who shares his passion for Muntz and they soon make a promise to one day follow in his footsteps and head out to Paradise Falls in South America. Carl and Ellie fall in love, they get married, they get jobs as Balloons salesman and a zookeeper respectively, and they grow old together blissfully albeit with some hiccups along the way. Realising that they have not fulfilled their ambition of moving to Paradise Falls Carl buys tickets and plans to surprise Ellie with them. Unfortunately, Ellie's declining health puts her in hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl heartbroken and alone. Carl shuts himself away from the world and becomes a sour recluse - as an example, one day a boy scout called Russell comes calling, suggesting that he helps Carl out around the house so he can work towards his 'help the elderly' badge, but Carl tricks him with some silly task to get rid of him. The city which grew around Carl wants his house gone and eventually a court order wants to force him into a retirement home. Before he can be bundled away though the crafty old ex-Balloon puts a plan into motion which allows him to escape with his house - he uses as many balloons as he can get and floats the house away. Unfortunately, though, Carl is not alone, an accidental stowaway is with him - Russell, who was under the porch. They end up in South America where they meet a bird which Russell calls Kevin, they meet a talking dog called Dug, and they also meet Muntz. All of which, the bird, the dog, and Muntz are linked. If the adventure was not started when the house floated away, then it's definitely a-foot with Muntz back in the game.\n\nThis film is beautifully created, the animation and colour palette is vibrant and gorgeous. The attention to, and presentation of detail is absolutely first class. The imaginative story is a fun adventure combining fantasy, comedy, suspense, and emotions. While it is fun for children to watch the floating house and the talking dog, this film is multi-layered too, and definitely one for adults too. I am not ashamed to admit it, but this film is an absolute tear-jerker at the beginning. I must be getting soft in my middle age, and perhaps too many horror films have broken me, but this film genuinely made me shed a tear. The voice acting in this is brilliant and really helps to compliment and bring to life the beautifully stunning imagery. In Carl, Edward Asner presents a grumpy but sweet and sincere old character who feels familiar to me. Jordan Nagai as the voice of Russell is enthusiastic and passionate and really drives life into old Carl again.\n\nUnless you don't have a heart of stone expect a roller coaster of emotions; you will laugh, you will cry, and by the end of the movie you will have experienced one of the best Pixar movies in my opinion. As well as being a box-office hit which easily recouped its budget (and then some!) this film has become a bit of a cult movie due to its heart breaking and then heart-warming ability. I am glad I got to watch this film and it has cemented a place in my movie collection for its content and its beauty. I am happy to recommend this to people of all ages, and I am happy to give this a solid 8 out of 10."

The movie has a great idea at the foundations. The beginning is very pleasant and develops perfectly this idea. It arouses great emotions. If it was a short, 20 min movie, I would rate it 9/10 easily. But afterwards, the movie starts to be a lazy work with scenes seemed to be there only to fill the time or clearly contradictory between each other. The second, short part of the movie, is just terrible. Without spoilers, it involves a problem and a solution which happens out of screen and a completely contradictory development. Afterwards it becomes a cartoon as many others, with the same timer effect and save the weak theme as always. 6 or 6.5 out of ten is the right mark for this film."

Oscar stuff! As for the movie, it is not only funny but also quite heavy on emotions. It deals with life as a hole and many small children will make some hard questions to their parents after watching this.\n\nHowever, these subjects are dealt with gracefully and those question would need answers eventually. Pixar's just doing you a favor! I found two flaws in it that take the perfect 10 away (like WALLE deserved):\n\n1 - Not Pixar's fault, but the Portuguese distributor decided that the 3D version would be in Portuguese only. Most \"grown-ups\" I know wanted to see the subbed one with the English voices (as we usually see movies in Portugal) but instead we had to miss out on the original voice work to get 3D. VERY disappointing.\n\n2 - The movie is a little unbalanced. The first 15 minutes of the movie brought the hole theater close to tears (it's that good! - lots of grown man crying). The rest of the movie could never recapture the emotional weight of those first few minutes... loads of laughs though! Definitely worth viewing independently of your age."

Not to mention excellently executed. This is what stood out most for me.\n\nThe tale of partnership, family difficulties, lifelong promises, hopes, dreams and what's most important to ones self is told in a way that makes you shed a tear in joy for the beauty that is this film.\n\nThis is a TRUE FAMILY MOVIE! one that will keep the children entertained with a few laughs along the way and one that will surely give adults pause for thought.\n\n9/10"

Yet another part is the children's typical movie where kids stop the poachers and sing \"Kumbayah\". And we start off fast.\n\nIn less than 12 minutes our idealistic and naive 8 year old boy meets his future wife, we watch their generational dreams go through life's twists and turns, and we're left with a grumpy 78 year old man who is a cab ride from being placed in a retirement home. Brutal. Kids have a hard time with this drama. \"Nowhere To Go But Up\" may have been a more meaningful title.\n\nThen comes the boy and then the adventure. The story is a modern family testament, where who ever can fill a family role is considered family. The void itself is predicated as victim hood which being connected to others helps fill. I like the drama, despite its obvious course,. I like the adventure despite its obvious course. I like the visuals despite.\n\nFrom victim to hero to a video store near you. A solid family film but written by a leftist corporation for the next generation of American Consumers."

This opening sequence alone is a testament to the storytelling prowess of Pixar and the emotional depth that animated films can achieve.\n\nVisually, \"Up\" is a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail in the animation is remarkable, from the lifelike textures of the characters to the breathtaking landscapes of Paradise Falls. The vibrant color palette and attention to visual storytelling enhance the overall experience.\n\nMichael Giacchino's musical score is a perfect complement to the film, elevating its emotional impact and underscoring the sense of wonder and adventure that permeates the story.\n\n\"Up\" is a film that appeals to all ages.

        "review_detailed_main": "In the beginning of the animated film, Up, we are introduced to two young, enthusiastic and very different children who share a passion for traveling and their hero, renowned traveler and explorer Charles Muntz. This connection leads Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie to become best friends as well as husband and wife. Their passion for travel never abates and they spend their life saving money to travel to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately, as it often does, life gets in the way and their dream is never reached.\n\nFast forward many years and we find an old, stubborn, grouchy Carl as the world has changed rapidly and left him disgruntled and refusing to change with it, reminiscent of Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men. Refusing to sell his house he mistakenly causes harm to someone, which gets him in trouble with the law and he is forced to live in a retirement community. Refusing to let this get in his way, he manages to inflate thousands of balloons tied to his house, which causes his how to rise up and float away. His destination: Paradise Falls. It's at this point that the theme of the movie really begins to pick up: no matter what happens, life goes on and you should enjoy every minute of it because you don't know what will happen next.\n\nWhile flying to Paradise Falls, he hears a knock on his door, and unbeknownst to him, a local member of the \"Wilderness Explorers\", Russell has accidentally been brought along. Having no choice but to bring Russell along, he navigates them safely through a massive thunderstorm and almost arrived at his destination. Many balloons were lost in the storm and although still floating, it is not able to fly at high altitudes so Carl and Russell must drag the house to its final location.\n\nOn the trek across the mountainous terrain Carl and Russell encounter an exotic bird and a talking dog that is trying to capture the bird and return it to his master. During this trip the exotic bird runs away because they encounter many other talking dogs and they are escorted to a remote cave where Carl is united with his idol, Charles Muntz, who has spent the better part of his life searching for the elusive exotic bird that has befriend the group. Upon learning this Carl finally shows some emotion and spends the remainder of the film trying to prevent Charles from harming the bird.\n\nThis film used amazing computer graphics and enhanced colors to bring a mesmerizing setting to the viewer's eye. The focal point of this movie was the balloons that Carl used to float his house away and you can tell special attention was given to the creation and design to create an impressive display on the screen. The vividness they used also translated into Carl and his grumpy face and the transformation he goes through and without this superior artwork, they would have been unable to truly capture the essence of Up and the central theme of the film of how life goes on and to not waste a minute of it."

Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience. It rightly won an Oscar a sit is truly a wonderful animation to be loved by all."

The character development with the main character is great and touching, especially that scene when Fredricksen opens the book near the end, finally being able to move on from the burden grief of his wife's death. The chemistry between the unlikely duo Russell and Fredricksen along with the funny sidekicks are wholesome to watch, visuals and score are amazing as always, one of the Giacchino's best for sure. The villain is just fine though, he's good enough but a forgettable one, and I'm on second viewing right now, but I still didn't get why this movie ranked among the best Pixar movie in the catalog."

Not one I have any desire to see a second time.\n\nThe quality of animation was fine, good artwork, Pixar very well done.\n\nExcept for the 3D. It came in and out of use. Sometimes it seemed to have been drawn in layers. When there was motion, things got blurry and horrible, even worse than regular cinema. Yes, points for not giving us vertigo like some 30 year old drive-in. But other than that, this was just light years behind Monsters vs. Aliens in technical quality. Watching Up after seeing MvA was a bit like watching old NTSC TV on an old tube after having seen HDTV on a modern flat-screen. What were you thinking, Disney? This is not the future of cinema. I have to knock a full 2 points off for the terrible misuse of technology. Folks, don't go away thinking this is all 3D can do."

I may have laughed only once in the entire movie as the humor could only be funny to small children. It saddens me that this movie could have been great but I was clearly the wrong target audience.\n\nI do not recommend this movie to anyone over 10 years old, anyone with a good taste of humor, or anyone who wants to keep their opinion of Pixar in tact. Up is nowhere near as good a movie as anything else Pixar has created because those other movies captured the eyes of a variety of audiences.\n\nI have no doubts that all the other fantastic reviews of this movie have been written by family oriented people or Pixar employees."

It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed.\n\nAnd, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could.\n\nAs you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.\n\nPixar has done it again.

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I love animated movies, I somehow did not enjoy 'Up' as much the first time I watched it. Years later, I decided to watch it again. I admit to enjoying it more the second time around, but I still have mixed feelings about this one.\n\nThe film begins (and ends, as it turns out) with such a sweet, yet sad story. We all have dreams when we're young and carefree, but when reality steps in, some of these dreams are brushed off as fantasies and we loose the enthusiasm to pursue our dreams. 'Up' depicts this to perfection, and I can certainly relate.\n\nThe film then becomes a charming little fantasy adventure. I enjoyed the difference of opinion between the 78-year old hero, Carl, and the adventurer kid, who - as it turns out - was not quite as adventurous as he believed he was. The adventure element is exciting, although not in the least remotely realistic. Then again, this is a fantasy. They meet a lot of interesting characters along the way and despite numerous obstacles, Carl's determination is never doused.\n\nThere's a lot to admire here, and I believe the film sends out a strong message. Maybe I'll watch it again after a few years, and who knows, might enjoy it even more then..."

I know because I was a sobbing basket case within minutes. While the 3D is fun, I am not a huge fan since I don't think it really enhanced the story. Kids will probably enjoy the ride though.\n\nYes, I admit it that I cried a few tears, but did it with a smile on my face.

From the very beginning, the film pulls at your heartstrings with a moving montage that tells the story of Carl and Ellie's life together. It's a rare feat for an animated movie to evoke such deep emotions, and Up does it effortlessly.\n\nThe animation is stunning, filled with vibrant colors and imaginative landscapes that make you feel like you're part of the journey. The characters are wonderfully developed; Carl's grumpy exterior hides a heart of gold, and Russell, the eager young scout, brings a sense of innocence and joy that is infectious."

The jokes are bland and good for little more than a smirk. But the cartoon wasn't preachy, as animated movies seem to have become in recent years. I saw the 3-D version, and I wasn't particularly impressed. Although the 3-D provides added depth, the effect was very subtle. I was hoping for something that popped out of the screen more. I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible. In short, I'm confused by all the praise this movie has gotten, and I think the 3-D version is a waste of time and money. And to put this within the top 20 movies of all time on IMDb (its current ranking) is absurd."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pixar always makes amazing films, like Wall-e, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles. The ones that aren't amazing are usually pretty decent, like Cars or A Bugs Life. Finding Nemo has always been my favorite because of how great the story was, the beauty presented in the movie, and the variety of characters it had. Up has two of the three things Finding Nemo has \u2013 Beautiful scenery and a wonderful story. Up's story isn't as smart or complex as Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it's still entertaining and fun. Up doesn't have that many characters, but it is Pixar's most emotional movie to date.\n\nThe first ten minutes of Up will make you want to cry. It sure made me want to give up my god-like manliness. Those that don't give in to Up's emotional beginning don't have a heart. I like how the story isn't all about Carl (the old guy) and his sad story. The movie sheds some light on the other lead's (the little kid, Russel, who accompanies Carl. He also happens to be Asian!!) background. Carl is mourning his wife, while the film briefly explains Russel's issues with his father.\n\nAlthough there wasn't a variety of characters in the movie, there was still a whole bunch of dogs, a colorful bird, and another old dude, who happens to be the villain. The dog, if you've seen the trailer, is Dug. Dug is a very cute, playful, and loyal dog, who appears to be a Lab. Kevin is a beautiful female prehistoric bird that the other old guy, Charles, is searching for. The movie is fun because it offers so many laughs from the four characters of Carl, Russel, Kevin, and Dug. Charles, however, is a different story.\n\nCharles Muntz is Carl's childhood hero. He's a famous explorer that, about 70 years ago, discovered the bones of some kind of bird that no one has every seen before (we, the audience, know that it's Kevin's race). Scientists claim that Charles made up everything, so Charles swore that he would find a living specimen. This is where Kevin comes in. Charles spent the rest of his life trying to capture Kevin, and when Russel and Carl grow fond of Kevin, the two parties are at an opposition. Now, Carl finds his childhood hero trying to kill him.\n\nI respected Charles and his character in the movie, but I soon grew intolerant of him. I understand that he spent his life trying to capture Kevin, and it's his passion. However, Charles becomes an asshole to the other characters when they get in his way. Charles even endangers a little 7-year-old boy, Russel, just to get what he wants. By the end of the movie, I felt that Charles got what he deserved.\n\nUp is the best film I have seen all year, and is the only movie so far of 2009 that I've given a 10 out of 10. I can't think of any animated movie, or live-action, that has been as emotional, sad, funny, and charming as Up has been. I also loved the animated short film that appeared before Up, called Partly Cloudy. I liked how the short film kind of has a similar setting as Up, and I think that Partly Cloudy has a story that Pixar could actually make into a feature film. One think that disappointed me at the theater, though, was the fact that the trailer for Toy Story 3 wasn't shown. Every Pixar movie has a teaser trailer of the next movie that's going to be released, so I kind of felt cheated. Even though I saw the trailer for it already, I still would have liked to see it on the big screen, and also for everyone else in the theater to know about it."

Don't get me wrong Up is a very enjoyable film but didn't quite push the right buttons.\n\nThe plot confuses me a lot as it starts off very sombre (i had a tear in my eye at one point) and then transforms into something mainly for the kids, so it doesn't blend the 2 together as we are used to. So the kids will hate the first half, and adults will find the second half maybe a little silly.\n\nThere are lots of funny jokes in here that serve both sets of viewers. And the voice acting is superb and spot on. You just got to love the Doberman ;)\n\nThe characters, animation and general design are all out of the top drawer as normal for Pixar but i made the mistake of seeing this in 3D.....if you are charged extra to see it in 3D don't! The movie has no scenes of \"3Dness\" of the likes found in Ice Age 3, and Aliens Vs Monsters to name a couple. Even Valentines day Masacre made a better use of 3D, and for me seemed to just be thrown in \"cos 3D films are doing well this year\".\n\nOverall good film...........but.................even now i cant explain why it isn't as good as the others."

The old Mr. Fredricksen has his house floating by hanging from hundreds of balloons and set off to South America after depressed by the loss of his wife.\n\nThe first sequence that shows his earlier life is moving. From the first meeting with the neighbor tomboy to the marriage life in the house to the time when she is getting weak, we see his entire life with his wife and get totally in his shoes.\n\nThe main location is the jungle in South America where his wife had dreamed to visit. He happens to have three companions, a boy, a dog, and a snipe. The house also soon ceases to be accommodation and becomes a big floating companion itself, which he calls by his wife's name. The house's colorful balloons are very beautiful as if they show the house's emotion.\n\nThe mountainous geography is fully exploited for the 3-dimensional cliff-hanger action, which involves physics where they and the house pull each other by a rope. They have to deal with the balance between the buoyancy from the house and their weight. Characters' movement is briskly and comically choreographed. The materials are realistic, one of the best is the dogs' hair.\n\nHonestly, I am not really into the story. Mr. Fredricksen's purpose is vague. And I'm not sure if the film really needs that evil villain. But at least I like the companion characters. Among them, the boy Russell has a soft and round body like a rubber ball. And just like his body, his nature is also sensitive and resilient. I can't help hoping he will become happy."

In particular the most impressive thing is the narration of the love story between Mr. Fredricksen and Ellie that is powerful even without a word because of the music and of the inspired images. The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place. Even with this problem \"Up\" is still a great film you should watch at least once!"

Well, turns out our time would have been better spent elsewhere.\n\nI thought it was cute, but all the jokes were the ones where I would turn to my mom and tell her the punchline before the joke was halfway said, and about 40 minutes from the end told her what would happen, and she agreed.\n\nIn terms of \"Best Disney/Pixar Movie Ever Made\", I'm still waiting for something to top \"Finding Nemo.\""

It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films."

I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.\n\nAll in all, \"Up\" is not my favorite movie, but worth seeing. Also starring Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger, and even former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Laraine Newman in a supporting role.\n\nSquirrels can be a problem.

At least Toy Story had a semi-credible story line and Finding Nemo made sense from beginning to end. We wasted $9 apiece for this piece of dreck! That said, the characters Kevin and Dug were humorous, but provided too little humor to carry the rest of the film. Ed Asner is the human voice of a dirge."

        "review_detailed_main": "Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this \"exotic lost land\" as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.\n\nWith Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart.\n\nPixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.\n\nUp is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Is very good movie , i like it p is a 2009 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Pete Docter, the film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai). By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year- old Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his late lifelong love. The film was co- directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.\n\nDocter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.[3]\n\nUp was released on May 29, 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so.[4] The film became a great financial success, accumulating over $731 million in its theatrical release. Up received critical acclaim, with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film. Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl, and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and Pixar's first Best Picture nomination), following Beauty and the Beast (1991)"

        "review_detailed_main": "As with Wall-E, I couldn't help but feel less than enthusiastic while viewing UP. It's a well put together package, of course, but rarely have I felt that the emotional responses the film makers were going for were so forced. Many of the bits were amusing, and many came off as trite and trying way too hard to inject some humor or cuteness into the proceedings. For a viewer such as me, simply parading cute looking characters on the screen is not enough to warrant the masterpiece status that Pixar seems to get with each film. That being said, the film was beautiful to look at, no argument here. It had some moments that truly clicked, such as the opening montage. In fact, as predictable as the movie's story arc was, the first third of UP was enjoyable.The one thing that really did bother me during my viewing was that I consistently had to say to myself \"it's only a kids movie.\" Which is fine and all, but should a movie with such mainstream and critical acceptance really need this sort of free pass to be considered great? It seemed a scene couldn't go by without a major continuity error (by the way, WHY ARE THERE CONTINUITY ERRRORS IN AN ANIMATED MOVIE) or some new level of ridiculousness that betrayed the previous set rules of the film's universe. It was as if I was playing a kids game where the rules keep changing. I expected the overbearing sentimental themes seen in the beginning and end, but between the physics involved in an old man pulling a hose along by a garden hose and the whole ridiculous talking dog storyline it eventually came to a breaking point. There are ways to show sentimentality in a way that doesn't obviously manipulate the viewer, and pointing this out doesn't mean I don't enjoy an emotional story arc. Give me Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc any day over a film like this, which seemingly exists for those that need inspiration to be beat over their head repeatedly for 90 minutes."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is probably my favourite Pixar movie to date. I loved 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' but 'Up' is in another league - quite simply outstanding. It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.\n\nThe story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. It is also visually stunning and I would love to see it again in 3D one day.\n\nThis is as close to perfection as an animated movie has come and it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all. 'Up' is a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pixar animated movies like \"Toy Story\" & \"A Bug's Life\" were fun, creative and amusing. Up is strangely \"adult\" in nature and it's appeal to the very young maybe minimal. The best line in the entire film \"I finally get to meet my childhood hero, and now he wants to kill me\". Seriously, this should have been a PG-13 movie. Pixar films were more upbeat before they teamed with Disney. Now with Disney, their films have an added drama to them. Disney is great at musical animation storytelling, but I wish they had left Pixar alone.\n\nThe story isn't that great, although the love story between Carl & Ellie is admirable, ultimately it's about the widowed Carl and an obese stowaway but determined boy scout, Russell. Their encounters with a strange bird and a talking dog lead them to the villain in the movie, who probably should have had more screen time. There was no explanation of why he needed all those talking dogs.\n\nI thought the animation was superb but the scenarios when the main characters were put in peril, were a little too unbelievable. It seemed with all those bright colored balloons it would be a fun movie, but \"Up\" can be a downer sometimes and I'd only recommend it to fans of animated films."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"Up\" which was created 2009, is about the power of love. Love is a powerful thing, it can create war or peace. In the movie a journey is made; it teaches us to follow our dreams and teaches us to respect our elders. In addition, \"Up\" has excellent animation.\n\nFurthermore, \"Up\" has excellent animation. Presumably created by Pixar,it is one of their movies. This movie was rated PG and is appropriate for all ages. Nevertheless, some may say that it might be a little nerve racking at sometimes. \"Up\" made about $68,108,790 in the first weekend and has won 2 Oscars. Additionally, the producer of \"Up\" has also created many more famous movies such as \"Toy Story\". Henceforth, \"Up\" has many credentials and you can see that it will be a great movie.\n\nRespecting your elders is a key point in this movie; one of the main characters Russel meets an old man Carl Fredrickson. Eventually, Russel must learn to work with the old man and help him pursue his dreams. Russel soon finds that the old man is very wise and begins to work with him. To demonstrate the actor who played Carl; Ed Naser did such an outstanding job giving the character life with his voice. A good theme in this movie is respecting your elders.\n\nOn the other hand, this movie could have created a sequel to explain what happens after Russel and Carl get back from their epic journey. \"Up\" also demonstrates that kids can go and annoy elders. Russel did this in \"Up\", but good things turned out to happen of this. In conclusion, there was nothing I would like to change about this movie.\n\nFinally, the last theme in this movie is the power of love. Carl, the older man had a plan to go on a trip with his wife. Sadly, a tragic incident happened and he wasn't able to go. Eventually, Carl was to old to go on his own. Nevertheless, his love for his wife still kept him going and he sailed away to Venezaula with Russel. Russel also was influenced by love from Carl, to be inspired to make new friendships. Love is such a powerful theme in this movie and influenced the plot greatly.\n\nUltimately, \"Up\" is a great movie to go see with your family. Have you ever wanted to be inspired by love? or follow your dreams? if so, this is the right movie for you. Evidently with great animation and created by the best animation studio in the world. \"Up\" is an outstanding, tears in your eyes, and inspiring movie for everyone to watch."

There are so many roomers of what actually happened. Like Russel was actually a younger self of the grandpa. If this is true l, that is so creative. I would have never thought of this plot and idea. Up is amazing and family friendly for any age. PIXAR movies always make me cry but this one hit different. Overall of one the best family friendly movies ever. <3."

His adventures in the Amazon constitute the story of 'Up'.\n\nIt's a refreshing plot about one's dreams, but there is one jarring note. Why is Mr. Frederickson's idol shown to be the bad guy? He's not trying anything illegal. That note, and the subsequent storyline that stems from it, took away the charm for me.\n\nThe visuals of the movie were refreshing. The wide, flowing waterfalls; the wildlife of the Amazon, it all contributes to the larger-than-usual canvas of 'Up'.\n\nThe voice acting by the cast is extremely good. The dogs, the eagerness in the kid, the sinisterness in Mr. Frederickson's idol's voice comes out beautifully.\n\nFinal Verdict: 'Up' is an interesting concept handled very well. The jarring note about the idol aside, the movie keeps you engrossed thoroughly."

        "review_title": "A Flawed Film from the Pixar Assembly Line",
        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Tin Toy\" and other animated shorts first appeared from Pixar, it was like a breath of fresh air in the world of CGI. Instead of more robots, they boldly took on the challenge of rendering natural subjects, including human beings. The slightly drunken-looking wobbling of some characters (maybe, again, to avoid the precise, laws-of-physics appearance of most other computer animations of that time) was a bit distracting, but the images of flexible objects (like babies) were break-through accomplishments.\n\nNow, almost thirty years later, the technology has advanced considerably (close-ups in \"Up\" of fabric, fur, and hair, are stunning). But, it looks as though Pixar has hired one set of CGI characters and now has them all fulfilling their multi-movie contracts. If you saw \"The Incredibles,\" you will feel as though you've seen these characters before (perhaps, if you've also seen \"Toy Story,\" the same way you felt you'd seen those characters before when you saw \"The Incredibles\"). In a way, even \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Cars\" look like they all came from the same factory as this film. Well, they did, but... why should they? The exaggerated features, cartoonish proportions, and overstated gaits (a kind of bunny-hop if the character is young, a Frankenstein's-monster sort of lumber, if elderly) are starting to look very familiar. (Although, inexplicably, given how far the technology has come, the designers feel compelled to include elements, such as Mr. Frederick's slightly polygonal ears, that appear to be concessions to the computer's historical role in films of this kind.)\n\nThe story itself is flawed, alas. No spoilers here, but it did seem that the main character's emotional responses to events around him were inconsistent, as were his physical abilities. He chooses sides in the (dramatically necessary) conflict, but not the one it seemed that he would have, at least not at first. Also, while the idea that he can fly his house via thousands of helium balloons is well within the accepted tropes of the cartoon genre, it lingers on way too long and becomes an intrusively absurd aspect of the whole film, with scene after scene making it harder and harder not to say, \"Oh, come on now!\" In fairness, there are a couple of moments that will bring tears to adult eyes, proving that this medium really can deliver emotional content. If only there were more of that, and less of the outright nonsense, I'd have scored this film much higher.\n\nPixar broke the mold, decades ago. But now they've replaced it with a new one. What once seemed so daring and new, has become ho-hum and commonplace. A cynic, just maybe, would say, \"Hey, they know what sells.\" A shame, given that an animator--using a computer or not--is, in the end, not limited by the laws of physics, but only by our willingness to suspend our disbelief."

Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Two thumbs UP!"

Then there was tragedy :( I don't think anyone expect a sad tragedy film in a animated movie. :S The first part of the movie is very sad and I was wondering why am i watching this. Cos when I sat for the movie, I was expecting humor as Ice age .\n\nThe Only part I liked was when that giant Birdy came to the action :D It was so hilarious and I got a bit what I expected, humor and comedy.\n\nThe last part of the movie was Sci-fi plus Adventure... Which neither like Incredibles nor Spider Man.\n\nI guess this film was only aimed at the very young crowed (kids) cos, I think an adult cant enjoy this film much as he/she would have enjoyed Ice Age or Incredibles.\n\nBut, I was surprised when I saw that this film was rated PG for some \"peril and action\". :o\n\nSo who the hell is the targeted audience? anyway, I should say this is not merely up to the Pixar standards :("

        "review_detailed_main": "This was the first feature film that I have seen in 3d. Before discussing the merits of 3d let's discuss the film.\n\nPixar must be the most critically/commercially successful production company of recent times. They have no duds in their back catalogue and a number of classic movies. Up is another fine film and just fails to make classic status although I am sure many people will rank it alongside Wall E and Toy Story. Personally I found it a little bit too sweet although that's a fine line that most of the Pixar movies tread.\n\nThe film follows the dreams and ambitions of a couple of kids looking for adventure, Carl and Ellie. We see a quick clip of them ageing and putting off that trip they'd always planned to South America. Before we know it, it's too late ... or is it? The great thing about the movie is that you care about the characters. It always seems a bit strange to me that for some reason it is easier to feel empathy for animated characters than real actors. I've put it down to good script writers in the past, but I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on. Anyway I'm sure most people will love Up and that it will be many peoples favourite film of the year.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this was the first film that I have seen in 3d. I can't say it really added to my enjoyment of the film and I can't help feeling that it's a bit of a gimmick designed to increase cinema takings. I've been to several 3d presentations at theme parks, but I think that's where the technology belongs. Maybe there will be a killer app that really showcases the technology, but I don't believe 3d will add much to most films."

It took me days to get the poor old man's face out of my mind. It was like a ghost haunting me. The final message it was trying to convey was good but with what cost? If you are sensitive and have grandparents you love or had grandparents you loved don't see it!!! If you are over thirty and don't want to see your life flash before your eyes don't watch it!!! If you don't want your children to spend days thinking how they will lose you and everything they love some day don't let them watch it!!"

        "review_title": "UP!-emotional take on friendships",
        "review_detailed_main": "UP! Is a Disney Pixar movie released in 2009 with Pete Docter as the director. The movie was based on an old man named Carl Fredricksen who was a balloon salesman. His dream was to tie a bunch of balloons to his house and fly away to the wilderness. However, as he begins to fulfill this dream he stumbles upon a boy, Russell. Throughout the movie they live out an adventure, and learn to value the true meaning of the individuals around us. Learning how we sometimes lose sight of how important the people around us are until they are gone.\n\nA few of the main stars in this movie were like stated above Pete Docter as the director, Edward Asner as Carl, and Jordan Nagai as Russell. One big theme of this movie is relationships. It can be easy to lose sight of those around us, and easy to take those relationships for granted. However, Relationships are a huge part of the adventures that are taken throughout life. Friendship is shown throughout the movie, and is established well through the scenes.\n\nAnother aspect of friendship that is shown is friendship through age. The story of Carl and Ellie is depicted in the movie. This friendship grew with age, starting off with them being young and moving forward with their relationship into their senior years. This friendship in particular gave us a sense of emotion throughout the movie. Another film that is similar to UP! Id Luca. Luca is a newer film that explores the theme of friendship, and how they can inspire us.\n\nTwo techniques that were obvious throughout the film were camera angle and lighting. Camera angle in this movie was important due to all the different views needed. Oftentimes Carl and Russell were in the air, and with that the camera angle needed to be different than when they were on the ground. With Carl and Russell being in the wilderness at times and in the air the lighting needed to be adjusted. The director did a great job of using the lighting technique when in those different scenes.\n\nTo conclude, the theme of friendship is important for individuals of all ages to learn. It helps younger individuals to learn about the importance. For older individuals it is a good reminder to cherish the friendships we have made along the way. With that being said, UP! Is a great watch for individuals of all ages."

        "review_detailed_main": "After suffering the studio mandated crushing heartbreak Carl decides to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.\n\nThis features great visual storytelling, which is of course necessary when you have a protagonist who feels a lot but is too closed off to say most of it a lot of the time. Solid comedy, especially physical, without feeling the need to humiliate senior citizens despite centering one. Same thing for overenthusiastic chatty Cub Scouts.\n\nIt also delivers on excitement and tension, and is well-paced with not a single truly slow moment; it's not even tedious when watching characters be bored. I greatly appreciate the love of nature and animals, and criticism of aggressive city construction practices.\n\nI recommend this to everyone. 8/10."

His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.\n\nThe story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living life together.\n\nThere is so much depth of thought and dimension of the story that you could forget it is animated.\n\nI only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make. Luckily, you can ignore all this extra stuff and just play the movie if you like."

        "review_detailed_main": "5 July 2009. \"Up\" attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life. However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But \"Up\" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10."
