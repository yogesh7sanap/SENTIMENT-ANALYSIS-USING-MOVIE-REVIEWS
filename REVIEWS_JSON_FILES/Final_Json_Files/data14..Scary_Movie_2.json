The comedy in this film is right up my street, it's ridiculous and it makes fun of all the classic horror films that I love. The comedy is just pure crude and I find it absolutely hilarious and will always film it funny. This is a great film to watch with friends and have a good laugh with, it's just contagious once one person if laughing. I will forever think that this movie is the best of the series and I think that is hands down because of the cast, how did they get Tim Curry in this thing? I will never know! Overall though I just love this movie and I don't care what anyone says as this will always be up there for movies to have a laugh to. I love it!"

It's just as raunchy as the first one and just as tasteless. That's why the first one was so popular. It's a mouth full of laughs (just ask Tori Spelling)."

This film isn't good per say, but it is a lot of fun and definitely one to watch with friends.\n\nThe humour was ridiculous yet charming, very stereotypically 2000s. It had me laughing out loud from the very start but, there again, I have a broken sense of humour! The references to pop culture really added to the humour and made it funnier in my opinion. However, I wasn't a fan of the gross visual jokes and I found myself unable to watch them.\n\nThe film didn't have much interesting cinematography and visuals but I don't think it needed it. Plus the set designs were quite good, and there genuinely were some decent colour palettes throughout.\n\nThe acting was poor but this was definitely intentional, and the characters were strangely loveable in a way. All the acting was over exaggerated and the characters followed stereotypes that mock other horror films. There were some fun and unexpected cameos too, for example I didn't expect Tim Curry to be in it, and found his character very funny.\n\nLastly, the pacing worked well for this type of film as it was fast and witty, never dwelling on one moment for too long. Also, something I really didn't expect was that the story was actually pretty engaging."

How desperate. I don't even understand the basketball scene referenced when the basketball bounces down the stairs leading to some break dance sequence. How many today would know that reference?"

I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.\n\nWe have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.\n\nThe Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too!\n\n7/10"

        "review_title": "Scary Movie 2 is undoubtedly a continuation at the level that the previous film deserves, but it doesn't get to be funny all the time this time",
        "review_detailed_main": "Right after the release of Scary Movie, the production already indicated that there would be no sequel, and this is stamped in the subtitle of the original poster, \"No Continuation!\". The group, realizing the good reception of the work among the popular public, seeks to build a stylistic unit for future continuity. Thus, in the rhythm of the comedy, the production tries to play a prank on the audience that had become a fan since the success of the first film, using the slogan \"We Lied\", In the subtitle of the second film in the franchise, as a reference to the first feature, which in the subtitle said that there would be no continuation.\n\nAt this point, the idea of a franchise was already a reality to be worked on in the coming years - considering that definitely Scary Movie, in less than a year after its first public appearance, had already fallen into popular prestige, today, canonized in its genre. The fact is that the continuation of Scary Movie was released in theaters in 2001, bringing a humor that had not saturated and being a box office success, generating a split between specialized critics and audiences, who, until today, differ in the quality of the film. This second part again brings director Keenen Ivory Wayans in charge and even a short time after the previous film he managed several other recent and old cinema successes to satirize.\n\nThe management takes advantage and continues the narrative thread of the first part: the group that survived last summer enters college and friends meet again. Cindy (Anna Faris) is still a character who tries to be saintly and stars in sexual scenes as if she doesn't know what she is doing; Ray (Shawn Wayans) increases his range and throws himself at new guys, producing memorable scenes; Brenda (Regina Hall) still dates Ray, and Shorty (Marlon Wayans), the group's stoner, stars in one of the great scenes in the film when he is curled up by a tree and smoked by her. In a new adventure, the friends are invited by the university professor, Oldman (Tim Curry), and his assistant, Dwight (David Cross), to stay, in a field subject, at the house on the hill. There, the professor intends to study the phenomenon of insomnia, however, everything goes wrong, as is known.\n\nThe film begins with an interesting scene by first parodying the classic The Exorcist. Interesting for the great art direction, photography and costumes that purposely ended up simulating the 70s, where the events of the honored film took place. Thinking the prologue with a satirization of The Exorcist is already the best entry in the series of films, even better than the great start of its predecessor, which begins with the parody of the initial scene of Panic. The opening scene makes a point of naming the possessed family's home \"Casa do Inferno\", without regard or pity for the young woman's family. The party on the ground floor of the house, while the possessed dies in the bedroom, is of unbelievable nonsense and the eschatological minutes of the character of James Woods, together with his unwillingness to exorcise her, makes the scene complete. In this film, the direction introduces hints of eschatological humor in some scenes, which it did not do in the previous one. The eschatological is well placed, it causes discomfort by nonsense and brings laughter for dealing with situations so distant, but also so close. The curious thing here is that Marlon Brando was originally chosen as Father McFeely and completed a day of filming before leaving production due to illness. Charlton Heston was even asked to take Brando's place, but he declined the proposal; Bill Clinton, who at the time had just stepped out of the position of President of the United States, was also considered to play the role. Finally, it was up to James Woods, who received $ 1 million for four days of filming, to play the priest.\n\nThe change of focus in the story is not free. The writers wanted to make fun of other types of films and explore new ways to disrupt some classic horror movie scenes. And since they manage to do so well in a story involving a serial killer, there is nothing more fair than trying to explore the supernatural, after all, clich\u00e9 productions involving haunted houses exist in droves and several of them are practically begging to be satirized. Although obviously not being able to be as smart as the original, this sequence manages to remain dignified, especially with its numerous connections with the previous film.\n\nIn the first episode, the central theme was to play with Wes Craven's Panic series (started in 1996) and quote other similar films with a lot of humor. This time, the story was centered on the movie \"The Haunting (1999)\" and several scenes resembled satires to the films The Exorcist (whose director's version was released at the time), The Man Without a Shadow, Hannibal (in the famous brain sequence), Premonition, Revelation, and even films outside the fantastic genre such as the new version of the police adventure of Charlie's Angels, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago with their choreographed fights, and the catastrophe of the Twister hurricanes (in a scene where a ghost cow flies into a tornado), among other references. Titanic is also quoted, as in the original, with a direct allusion to the scene of the iceberg. It also shows a great scene of prominence closer to the end that makes reference to the movie Charlie's Angels and even Mission Impossible 2 (in a scene of action in a wheelchair, entitled to the famous doves of John Woo) ... There is still space, even, for a quick and hilarious joke with Harry Potter.\n\nFor these scenes, some visual effects were very good, such as the clown scene. Others, on the other hand, were very artificial like those of the cat, but they worked very well at the time of its release, managing to amplify the laughter. Just like the previous film, the cast repeats their characters once again and continues without developing them in any way. For those looking for fun, the film manages to get a good laugh despite the short duration, the shortest of all. It continues with some creative scenes and is especially worthy of paying homage to other films recently seen. Once again the sexual jokes are very present in practically every scene and will certainly please your target audience again. The eschatology show is immense, with a urine bath, spurt of sperm, vomiting, flatulence, bad jokes with disabled people, etc. A film that is a waste of time, but that still serves to laugh without compromise.\n\nIf in the first feature the grace is due to the novelty - for example, the novelty that is to discover, through Ray's hilarious holes, scene after scene, that he is homosexual, or also the novelty that the humorous style of Scary Movie brought to the genre, that is why it was so well received in public -, in the second film, the grace is due to the reused reasons of the first feature, which are renewed as new situations are proposed. It is a big mistake to think that the second film in the franchise has made a mistake, since everything that made Scary Movie funny, such as Cindy's stance, Ray's sexuality and Shorty's high, had already been shown and explored in the first feature. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe continuation delivers a mood with similar vigor when applying the same script in a new environment, renewing the possibility of finding and taking the laughter out of other situations, expanding and multiplying your universe. However, even though it kept exactly its essence, this continuation presents good isolated moments, but it loses a lot even by the characteristics of the films honored this time. With House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, The Exorcist, Poltergeist as a basis, that is, all films whose main action takes place inside a house, this parody follows the same steps, which ends up , in a way, limiting the situations to be explored. The choice of the honored films certainly obeyed this logic to what was proposed here, providing several new situations without necessarily leaving the environment of the haunted mansion. The problem is that this is a limiting factor for the plot.\n\nNow, however - in tune with the current taste of the average American teenager - this type of satire is only commercially successful if it is filled with eschatology. In this field, Scary Movie 2 is more than fertile. The film already opens with a urine bath. Sperm squirts, flatulence, vomiting in buckets and - worse - the most infamous and embarrassing evils against disabled people follow. Intelligence and subtlety don't stand a chance. Scary Movie 2 is undoubtedly a continuation at the level that the previous film deserves, but it doesn't get to be funny all the time this time. In this one, the direction leaves aside some acidic criticisms that it brought in the first film and introduces a more organic and ridiculous humor. Without taking away the strategy and expanding the humorous experiments to other groups to be parodied, some even a little more delicate, the film by Keenen Ivory Wayans plays with cinema and the daily life in an authorial, familiar and precise way, reaching, many times, the nerve point of laughter."

Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, \"Scary Movie 2\" is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensive\u0085yet, I couldn't care less about that! It's not funny and that's pretty bad for a supposedly hilarious parody/comedy. Avoid in case you've got some brain capacity left!"

There are a couple of scenes where the gross out \"humor\" was just too over the top for my taste. Tim Curry is in this movie, and I didn't really hate his character, but I certainly didn't love his character either, I didn't really care whether he was in it or not. If you liked first scary movie then you will probably like this one. But I just didn't care for it, the jokes were lame and dull, nothing to brag about.

Scary Movie 1 is greatly overshadowed by this wooly mammoth, and Scary Movie 3 is funny but much different and in no way really related. With extra room and creativeness, it's a worthy movie.

Now, they too, have befallen the same trap that they once set out to destroy through comedy -- they're coming up with half-brain ideas, full of young actors, making a comedy movie simply because they can and in the foolish belief (although at least 60% of the time it's not financially foolish) it will sell lots of tickets/DVD's.\n\nFace it, the Wayans brothers have become what they most feared -- cheap writers making teen movies for the mere purpose to make a few bucks.\n\nMore power to them \u0096 but sellouts nonetheless.\n\n83 minutes too long.\n\nAvoid."

The first one didn't have one and people didn't mind, why now?\n\nI guess it's the old, sequels must be bad (especially if they are comedies/spoofs). I beg to differ. I do think that the jokes do hit their target and if you don't mind the fact, that you do not have a coherent plot/story, you will enjoy this movie very much. There might be a few too many jokes concerning intercourse, but that's what people wanted to see at that particular time. Still no match to the great spoofs, like \"Airplane!\"."

I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt. As the epithet suggests, this is indeed a Scary Movie, terrifyingly, spine-chillingly bad. Don't Do It."

Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully, again, and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters, as well as the new ones, are excellently portrayed and likable, in a sense, and the movie has a high replay value, for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either, because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.\n\nThere were a lot of funny parts in this film, such as the opening song, the Charlie's Angels spoof scene, the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book, and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film, you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well.

This film made me laugh so hard at some scenes and others were tend to be too gross and not funny at all.\n\nUnlike David Zucker's Scary movie films, the Wayans push their Scary Movie films to be rated R. Their jokes can go far as they want it. It can be as crude, gross, or sexual as they want it. Some may like their style better than David Zucker's so it just depends on which team you like.\n\nThis is the worst, not meaning bad, film of the series.

I personally know very few people who didn't enjoy the first film, so the fact that the sequel was garbage just can't be!\n\n3: They saw the film on the worst day of their life, which had subsequently demolished their taste and humor to horrific lows,thus ANY comedic movie, good or bad, funny or unfunny, was just what the doctor ordered.\n\n4: They were really, REALLY toasted when they saw this movie, thus EVERYTHING, including the projector rays penetrating through the dust of the theatre, was funny.\n\nAdmittedly I am somewhat grading this film compared to the first installment, which isn't really fair, but I doubt even without that bit of criteria that this movie would have been enjoyable. Besides, that's the price you pay when you make a sequel, especially when you promised that there wasn't going to BE a sequel! (see tagline of \"Scary Movie (2000)\" The first film was VERY good, I can't stress that enough, frankly I haven't laughed that hard in a movie theatre since. With the sequel, I giggled a few times, but that hardly makes it a genuinely funny movie. Am I being overly harsh? Nope. I myself was in the midst of an average, take it or leave it day, am only slyly optimistic, care not what my friends think about my tastes, and had not taken part in any mind altering benders that day, and hence saw the movie for what it was: A WASTE OF TIME."

What i don't understand is HOW they could fail to spoof \"The Haunting\" which is a movie that offers ample opportunities for spoofing. But somehow they succeed. And basically all other attempts to make fun of movies, TV-commercials, music-videos etc. fail just as much.\n\nBut this movie does have ONE redeeming feature. And that is that the only scene in the movie even remotely funny is right in the beginning, even before the credits!

This is a great idea, but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film, I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place.\n\nYet, the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film. Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty, Regina Hall as Brenda, and Marlon Wayans as Ray.\n\nThere are several other new cast members, such as Tori Spelling, who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student, Alex. Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious.

The film's weakness are mostly to do with the story and the pace. The story is very weak and thin a vast majority of the time, and the film feels rushed sometimes. While most of the references/spoofs are fun, some don't work, especially the forced and messy Titanic one. And there is some uneven performances, Marlon Wayans, David Cross and especially Chris Elliot come off best, but Anna Faris while better than she was in the first overdoes it and while Tim Curry was a welcome presence he doesn't have anything worthwhile to work with. However, the film thankfully doesn't look sloppy or straight to video quality and the music was quite good as well. Of course the film is silly and mindless, but most of it is very funny, the dinner scene with the running joke about the hand, the talking parrot and the Charlie's Angels spoof work especially well, and a lot of the script if bizarre and silly is hilarious. The highlight though is the Excorcist-beginning, with a very amusing cameo from James Woods. That scene alone made me think it would be a good movie, but while the rest of the film wasn't quite as good, it is entertaining enough and not as bad as some say. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

James Woods is always entertaining to watch in any genre and his performance here didn't disappoint.\n\nBut what the hell happened after that? Director Keenen Ivory Wayans sense of whats funny from the 1st film seemed to elude him here. The jokes just fell flat and flat after that, the acting was terrible and often stupefying to watch. The rest of the film just felt like a waste of time. And that f****** parrot was really annoying!\n\nScary movie 1 and 3 were both enjoyable, and no. 4 does look promising, but I recommend skipping this one in the series, you'll be glad you did."

        "review_detailed_main": "most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen.\n\nWhereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s).\n\nThe film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts.\n\nI've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not going to totally badmouth \"Scary Movie 2,\" because I admittedly laughed a lot. Of course, most of those laughs came in the first half. I felt the second half was hit-or-miss. My issue is ever since \"There's Something About Mary\" was released, we've been bombarded by these gross-out comedies! Every time another comedy is released, it tries to outdo the previous one in grossness. The writers and directors assume they're pioneers, because they just disgusted audiences to the fullest. Well, what they don't realize is what made \"There's Something About Mary\" and \"American Pie\" work was their sense of wit and structure. There was a certain sense of intelligence behind the grossness. Now, filmmakers just assume you can have a young man shoot a wad of...manly juice...in a female's face and that's going to get a laugh. That's mostly because these comedies appeal mainly to young people. And young people, in general (not including me, of course), will laugh at ANYTHING scatological! It's unfortunate, but true! I admit, I've enjoyed tasteless comedies like this, the first \"Scary Movie\" and \"Road Trip,\" but I've never seen a tasteless comedy that I can actually regard as great. Some of my favorite comedies of all time are films by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks. Those are comedy writers/directors who know how to get laughs without even uttering the word \"penis.\" Now, though I did enjoy the aforementioned comedies, there comes a point where enough is enough. Sure, the young ones are eating this stuff up with a spoon and they'll probably tell ya \"Hey, get off our backs! Go watch a historical documentary, if you can't handle it!\" Normally, I would say something identical to that, but there always comes a point where it's just too much. And \"Scary Movie 2\" displays every indication that we have. At least, release some ADULT comedies. In case the filmmakers forgot, there ARE IN FACT grown-ups/mature human beings who go to the movies. But how often do we see adult comedies? Almost never! I guess they feel that's not where the profit is, so screw it!\n\nOn a positive note, I think there are a few sequences in this sequel that were very well done. The James Woods/bowel movement scene is purely tasteless, but let's face it. There's a certain thrill in watching a serious actor humiliate himself like that, so this is your only chance to encounter Jimmy Woods taking an on-screen dump. I liked the parody of the Nike/b-ball commercial, in which everybody bounces the basketball to a certain rhythm. In this case, even the guy in the wheelchair joins in. The Wayans were pretty sharp in writing the satirical moments. Some other good ones are a \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" parody and one of \"Charlie's Angels.\" Don't ya love it when they crack on movies that you absolutely loathe? Another scene I have to note is the Wayans' take on \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" in which Tori Spelling gives a b**w job to a ghost. That's an example of humor (as I mentioned earlier) with a degree of wit and structure. It's a very original idea (I can be wrong, email me if you can name another movie where a woman gives h**d to a ghost) and I felt it was used wisely.\n\nOne actress they should've deleted from the cast all the way from the get-go is Anna Faris. Though the film's comic timing, in general, is nothing priceless I felt she was totally off-key and her gags come off less as funny and more as...bad acting. She's a beautiful actress, indeed, but looks ain't everything babe! Chris Elliot is another one of those comedians who has good comic potential, but can come off as extremely obnoxious in a badly written role. This is an example of the latter. He plays an annoying butler with a deformed hand (was that supposed to be funny?). He made me groan a lot (especially in the dinner sequence), but I got no laughs. Shawn and Marlon--what were you thinking???\n\nThe crude humor begins to fade out in the second half, to the point where you just say \"Enough already!\" There's hardly a single joke that doesn't wander into scatological territory. We are also forced to sit through a recycled gag from the original, in a parody of \"Hollow Man.\" Though many in the audience laughed at the outcome of that scene, I saw it coming (no pun intended). Most of the humor is pretty cheap, predictable and forced, so there are few gags that I can regard as priceless. I still have to say, the funniest sequence is the opening in which we're treated to an interesting rendition of \"Shake That A**.\" The scene contains my main man Andy Richter (as you can probably tell, I was and still am a huge \"Conan O'Brien\" fan).\n\nIf you're seeking a bundle of dirty laughs, I can't object to purchasing a ticket for \"SM2.\" As I said, my main dispute is the lack of variety among comedies today. I urge you comedy writers: Get your mind OUT OF THE GUTTER!!! JUST FOR ONE DAMN SECOND!!! Try it, it works. You can still be funny!\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)"

The clever moments here were few and far between, and it seems as though it is merely a cynical attempt to cash in on a successful franchise. If you liked the first one and it's a rainy night with nothing to do, you might get a laugh out of this, but rent it, certainly don't buy it, and please don't support a SCARY MOVIE 3 if they make one."

I don't mind gross out humor if it's funny, but here, it's not, it's just plain stupid. I do have some respect for the Wayans Brothers (and the endless list of other writers involved) for at least trying to parody different movies this time around, instead of sticking to the same ones as the first (although a few of the same jokes do show up again here). Unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off. The teen slasher movies from the original were easier to parody, I think, because they're just really horrible to begin with and very easy to make fun of. People would have laughed no matter what. It seems like they were expecting the same thing with the second movie. However, most of the movies they choose to parody are a little more on the serious side, and therefore, are more difficult to make fun of. Not that it couldn't be done, but the writers would have to put more work into it. They didn't. All but a few of the jokes fall flat, and are more likely to inspire blank stares, not laughter. There are a few really funny jokes, but not nearly as many as the original Scary Movie, and not nearly enough to fill an entire movie.\n\nRating: 3/10"

If you define it as something that's filmed and put together, I suppose that you could claim that this falls under that definition, but if you define it as something that has structure, continuity and meaning, then this isn't a film. It's just a bunch of gags and scenes(badly) cut together. Every single character that you hated in the first, and was glad to see die, has returned, including a few new clich\u00e9 characters to hate. The film is entirely carried by stereotypes, and tries continually to make you laugh at stuff that anyone with just a tiny amount of moral wouldn't laugh at if his or her life depended on it. Stuff like homosexuality, the physically and/or mentally disabled, junkies, etc. The list goes on, but I really don't feel like typing it all here. The gags and jokes are powerfully unfunny. I think I smirked once during the film, and that's it. The humor obviously tries to offend, and it certainly succeeds; they just forgot to make it funny, in the process of thinking up stuff that will make plenty of people find the film disgusting(what's wrong with the Wayans', anyway?). The humor consists entirely of tired clich\u00e9s, worn-out stereotypes, gross-out comedy, and bad spoof sequences. Throughout the entire run-time(which is less than 90 minutes, what's wrong Wayans', did you run out of material?), there was only one single gag that was mildly amusing; a spoof of the Nike commercial that was on TV back in '01, which of course doesn't seem funny now, when they're not sending that commercial. Pretty much all of the movie spoofs in the film don't work, they mostly seem forced, and very weak. I guess you could basically sum up my opinion of this \"film\" by quoting the very words my father said when he saw the first few minutes of the first Scary Movie; \"All that sex and violence... what's the point? Really, it's not even funny, it's just offensive and disgusting.\" I don't really recommend this to anybody, except, of course, if there actually exists anyone who are *that* big fans of the Wayans brothers, that they actually could sit through this badly edited and terribly unfunny mess. 1/10"

But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are:\n\n1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross.\n\n2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.\n\n3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.\n\n4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.\n\n5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.\n\nThe only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl. Kathleen Robertson gets to play the sex bomb and Tori Spelling is the \"athletic\" girl who has sex with the ghost, and who dies pretty soon. Both are pretty underutilized and aren't even present in most scenes. The new addition, besides Hanson and Dwight, is a parrot saying dirty/rude things, which is pretty predictable and boring.\n\nAll in all, a very disappointing sequel. Not worth watching. 1/10."

Still, that doesn't mean that they can't be good fun from time to time and seeing a parody on about every famous movie is a nice pass-time, like the first \"Scary Movie\" already proved a year earlier.\n\nIn \"Scary Movie 2\" four teens are tricked by their professor and his paralyzed assistant into visiting the haunted Hell House for a school project about sleep disorders. In this house a bad exorcism took place and the ghost still lives there. Chaos starts as soon as they arrive. They meet the creepy caretaker of the house, have to face the evil spirit and will have to solve some dark secrets, no matter how disgusting they are...\n\nI admit that I liked \"Scary Movie\" and normally I'm also a fan of other spoof movies like for instance \"Hot Shots\" or \"The Naked Gun\", but this movie certainly didn't do it for me. This wasn't just vulgar, it just wasn't very good. The beginning with the exorcism was quite funny and the movie certainly had its better moments, but the overall quality of the story and the acting were so low that it really started to annoy me. Take for instance the fact that all the characters from the first movie are back, even when they died in that one. That can only mean that the story and the sense of reality (although that is perhaps not the exact word for this kind of movies, but you know what I mean), weren't of any importance. The only thing that mattered was the extra profit this movie would be worth. They didn't even have the time to come up with something new or original, making this movie feel like it was written in a couple of weeks time with a crate of whiskey and 10 joints per man...\n\nThe jokes and gags that the Wayans brothers and their enormous team of writers, producers,... came up with were clearly inspired on the first movie. Never change a winning team they say, but sometimes the audience wants to see an underdog win. They don't want to see the same thing over and over again, they want something new and that's where this movie failed completely. I give it a 6/10, because not everything was awful, but it could have been a lot better."

If you aren't likely to find a string of gay, sex, toilet and the like jokes entertaining, then you should avoid. I fell into the latter category and still decided to watch it, and it got a couple of laughs out of me and a few smiles, mainly from the exchanges between the guy in the wheelchair and the guy with the withered hand, the guy with the withered hand in general, the Big Daddy Kane nod, and the high tech devices they used for communicating near the end of the film. There is a nice bit of comic acting in here too, and as with most parody movies, you will also get more out of it if you've seen the films it spoofs.\n\nUnless you're a fan of general toilet humour, be aware of what you're getting into."

This whole idea is wrong on its own, but then they just had to add lame jokes about sex and other vulgarities. You can be funny without that! By example, the Charlie's Angels parody was good. If you saw the real movie afterward, you truly realized how ridiculous it was. But all the other humor was just way over the line. Those are jokes ten year old kids giggle at.

There are so many corny, absurd, overworked clich\u00e9s in these types of movies, a writer with any sense of humor at all should have a field day lampooning them; yet this is the result: an hour and change of meandering, mindless, humorless dreck, appearing to be no more than skits strung together in random order. None of them evoke a single laugh. It takes more than reenacting a scene from a movie, adding a few swear words and tossing in some toilet jokes to be funny.\n\nThis dog is not worth your time or money.

The spoofs are unjustified and every single gag is just plain gross, opting for the lowest common denominator every time.

        "review_detailed_main": "Since the 1970s end, dirt-exploitation became in fashion through Hollywood's mainstream comedies, with a lot of producers enjoying manipulating the lowest human desires, with heavier and filthier load as time goes by. Till I came to a point where I believed that they deal with animals, not humans anymore. Naturally, (Scary Movie 2) isn't far from that point; it's nearly it!\n\nIn 2000, the Wayans brother's (Scary Movie) was a hit. For good parody out of the 1990s horror / teen movies?, for the dirty comedy? For both? Anyway, in the sequel, their target was making a parody of many horror movies, TV shows, and TV ads, while immersing all of that in an ocean of filth!\n\nFilth, in this movie's makes' conscience, is comic. In my conscience, it isn't. It's only filth; purely, powerfully and torrentially made this time too. They sure thought \"Hey, if 50 filthy joke made millions, so how about 500!\". Not obligatorily a good move, but the producers must have LOVED it, giving the Wayans a mighty freehand to be as filthy as they could, to bring double the money that the original brought!\n\nBut profitable or not, the movie is ultra awful. Watching it is like swimming in a dreadful sewer. And completing it assures nothing but the masochist side in every human. The real comic moments are rare coincidences; it's like running into sane persons in a nut house. Here, filth comes with many shapes. Chris Elliott's character does the biggest job of it. I guess the Wayans peed themselves out of laughing while making this, and we just were left to smell the conclusion.. of their peeing!\n\nAction movies are all about many action sequences. Toilet humor movies are all about (Scary movie 2). However, this movie is cheaper than porn, because it could have been more but ended up being a nightclub designed as a real, so busy and so dirty public toilet. I won't say comedy was never more loathsome; it's loathsomeness was never more loathsome. The problem is that not nominating it for even one Razzie Award as if refers to its being as a good comedy anyway. Well, a 1000 Razzies from my side then, and one Razzie for the Razzie foundation itself due to its shameful overlooking!\n\n(Scary Movie 2) reached a zenith concerning the dirt-exploitation. Being that extremely overfull produces 2 kinds of audiences; a die hard lovers, and a die hard haters. I'm with the second. My only consolation is that it has fewer farts than (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps - 2000)!\n\nFinally a note: 2001 witnessed a wave of comedies with various nastiness, like (Scary Movie 2), (American Pie 2), (Freddy Got Fingered), (Not Another Teen Movie), (Say It Isn't So), and (Shallow Hal), being not what 2001 is distinguished by, rather ashamed of! Though, after 10 years, I have to thank God. Because having in 2011 only (The Hangover 2), and (Bridesmaids), refers to how this sort of comedies has reduced through the years. Ahh, does humanity finally prevail?!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Normally comedy sequels aren't exactly the better movies but in this case I feel that this is a much better movie than its predecessor \"Scary Movie\" from 2000.\n\nWhat makes this movie better is its comedy. \"Scary Movie\" was still in lots of parts a very lame movie. Of course \"Scary Movie 2\" also does has its lame moments in it but overall the humor seemed more structured and better written and executed this time. Not to call this movie very mature though.\n\nIts story also progressed better. This time there actually was somewhat a main plot-line and the many movies that it spoofs in this one are better fitted in into the story. The first movie was simply being a spoof for the sake of being one. It makes this sequel a bit more pleasant to follow. Strangely enough this is a movie that got made under pressure from the big studios that wanted to cash in quickly one year already after the success of the first movie. It's strange because this movie its end result seems far better, as does its story.\n\nThe characters also work out better in this one. Most of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles in this one again, so the movie doesn't has to waste a lot of time of introducing them again to the viewers. This movie however also has some more big names in it this time, with some big actors appearing in some small roles, such as James Woods and Tim Curry, who both did a hilarious job.\n\nBetter humor, better story, better characters. Simply a better movie than the first \"Scary Movie\".\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Directors Keetan Irene Waynes and Shawn Waynes channel their genius into silly, outlandish scenes that parody the very best horror films. Featuring a seductive ensemble cast including Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the film delivers smiles and laughs from start to finish. While some of the jokes can be a little over-the-top and low-key, the overall concept and mockery of the genre is truly laugh-out-loud fun. \"Scary Movie 2\" is a cheerful carnival of parodies, voicing the performances of those happy and overcome with laughter."

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching \"Scary Movie\" I never thought there would be a filthier R-rated movie ever!! But then the sequel came along and...for all those parents who covered their kids eyes during the original, make sure you keep a thick blindfold in handy if you're planning to take the young ones to this filth-fest!\n\nI'm gonna give this movie a mild recommendation, because I did laugh a lot. The first half is hilarious! The opening, I think, is the funniest moment. I don't want to give it away, so I'll just say it's an interesting rendition of the song \"Shake That A**.\" Of course, this is your only chance to see veteran actor James Woods taking an on-screen dump. Who can resist that? Can you believe Marlon Brando actually considered that role initially? It's just refreshing to see a big-time, serious actor humiliate himself like that! So for that: Thank you Keenan, Shawn and Marlon. The film's second half is not as successful, and pretty much sinks to a hit-or-miss level. As I said, Shawn and Marlon (and the many co-writers of the script) didn't once get their minds out of the gutter. So the dirty jokes do get tiresome after a while. Chris Elliot has an obnoxious role as a creepy butler with an underdeveloped hand. He has a few disgusting (not funny) scenes, especially one at the dinner table, that simply made me groan. I don't know what the hell the Wayans found funny about the character when thinking him up. There are some sharp, smartly written scenes that spoof pop culture, just like the original's attempt at spoofing the \"Whazzzzuppp!\" guys. There's an interesting and wildly funny scene where they spoof a sneaker commercial (I think that's what it is, I can't remember exactly what the commercial was for) where the characters bounce a basketball to a certain rythm, including the guy in the wheelchair. There's also a fine tribute to \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" and another one to \"Charlie's Angels\" (Don't you love it when they spoof movies you totally hate?).\n\nI think the main actress (Anna Faris), who was also in the original, has totally awful timing and most of her comedic scenes just come off as bad acting. Then again, the timing in this movie isn't exactly priceless. You can usually tell when the next punchline is coming. You don't always know exactly what the joke is, but you sometimes have a good idea (any opportunity to journey into the scatological).\n\nMy beef with this movie is pretty much the beef I have with a lot of the recent comedies. First of all, most of our recent comedies are aimed towards young people. And comedy writers assume young people will laugh at ANYTHING that deals with sex or bodily functions. The problem is: they're usually right! There are many young audiences (with the exception of me) who crave anything tasteless and crude, no matter how cheap and mindless the joke happens to be. Even dirty jokes should require a certain degree of intelligence. One good example is the Tori Spelling ghost/b**w-job scene. I can't go into detail about the gag without the IMDB staff kicking me out, but the joke was hilarious and original. There was a certain amount of brains behind the comedy, in that instance. \"American Pie\" is another good example. There are some great, though crude and scatological, gags in that movie. The reason why they worked was because there was intelligence behind the comedy. Let's not forget, even comedy is an art. With \"Scary Movie 2\" and other past movies like \"The Animal\" and \"The Ladies Man\" the writers tend to write things that are dirty, just because they're...dirty. I know there are tons of young people without a brain, who can't handle humor that doesn't journey into that territory, but does that mean you should cater to them and lower all comic standards? You'd think in 2001 writers and directors would've advanced, and learned to write things that are MORE effective comically, rather than slack off and write a comedy/softcore porno flick. But it's the exact opposite. And some of the best comics are still people like Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy. They're timeless classics. No matter what age you are, you can crack up watching those old-time comics. There are some great contemporary greats at comedy, but as a general comedians and comedy writers are becoming more and more lazy by the minute.\n\nSorry to be preachy, but it's true. I'm not totally badmouthing \"Scary Movie 2\" and still feel it's a very funny comedy. I just wish there was more variety in the movie biz. Give us more adult comedies! And if you can't do that, write a teen comedy with SOME sense of maturity and intelligence! If the teens boo and complain you're not giving them what they want--screw them! It IS possible to be funny without being disgusting. I can just hear the comedy writers going, \"Really?\" Yes, it's true. Get to work!\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10), but for the Wayans--try to be a bit more tasteful next time."

Me and my friend always say the quotes from the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, since we both love the series, and this is the movie in which we quote the least. Brenda said our favorite quote which was, \"WAS! I'm gonna miss ya girl!\" This movie is rated R. Very sexual stuff and some harsh language. Not recommended for people 15 or under."

I laughed once in this movie - and it was a short, single, derisive laugh when that poor girl gets creamed by the bus. That's it. And, unlike other \"bad\" movies that are so bad that they are actually hilarious, I am not able to dredge up a single memory that evokes even a smile from my lips. I enjoyed myself more during my wisdom teeth extraction. Even the nimrodic kids in the row in front of me only laughed a couple of times. A group of 16-year old boys. They spent the previews throwing popcorn and making gross noises.\n\nTHEY didn't laugh. Sad. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this. Not even at gun point. Take the bullet."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is equally as funny as the first, for those that criticise it for being dull or over the top, it's a spoof parodying horror films, it's not meant to be taken seriously in the slightest.\n\nThe opening scenes, the parody of The Exorcist is one of the funniest things, I can no longer watch The Exorcist without picturing James Woods. There are so many funny moments I can pick out, Hanson's hand and the dinner, Ray and the Clown, but I can't help rewinding Cindy's scene with the cat, that's just too funny.\n\nI think this, like the first was such a great movie, but then they had so much material at the time to work with, so much to parody. Films recently seem so unoriginal, they continue to rehash old material, that's why I couldn't see this type of film working right now, perhaps that's why the fifth instalment was so poor.\n\nNot one for everyone, as it does manage to offend everyone, if you can take it for how it's meant, it's hilarious."

Enough visual gags in the beginning of the film and you'll start laughing. The audience was a tough crowd, as usual, when I went to go see it but unlike as usual, I wasn't the only one laughing. It was clear that most of the material was created the same way stand-up comedy routines are, except that instead of all the visual comedy being simulated by someone on stage with a mic and describing it, visual effects, stuntmen and actors were able to portray the ridiculous events. A couple of things didn't work but most of it did. Cindy Campbell and Buddy's characters aren't surprising, knowing who wrote them but Anna Faris and Chris Masterson playing their parts was hysterical because Anna Faris has a very wide range of expressions that are quite striking. And Buddy is basically Francis Wilkerson with some updated lingo. I had a lot of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much like Scream 2, the original was a huge success (if only financial) and everyone knew the inevitable sequel had to be bigger, bolder, and even better. In both cases they failed though Scream 2 is a decent follow-up and Scary Movie 2 is not decent. At all, really.\n\nParody and satire are two forms of comedy that overlap well. Parody to be making fun of a particular film while satire targets an institution or ideal. The first Scream satirized the horror genre and the audience's awareness of formulaic conventions of cinema. Scream 2 to a lesser extent satirized the necessity of sequels while Scream 3 became a parody of itself. Scary Movie 2 attempts neither and, as Scary Movie 1 did with Scream, popularized the trend of referential humour. Do you remember this scene from that movie? Well here it is but dumber, no real punchline or set-up, just try and find the laughter yourself.\n\nThe film is slower, looser, and plain meanders through what coherent plot there is. Whereas the adopted structure of Scream gave a natural flowing pace, the new targeted genre of the Old Dark House is so poorly accomplished. The two biggest strengths of films such as The Haunting and the House on Haunted Hill being suspense and atmosphere. Unless a complete absence of those two counts for parody then the writers are left with resorting to arbitrary current pop culture nods from Charlie's Angels to Nike commercials with little to no connective tissue between scenes.\n\nThat Nike reference becomes a perfect summary of the Movie franchise from here onward. The riff of The Changeling into the basketball commercial is an almost clever subversion and yet they expect audiences to laugh continuously through every single character performing dribbling and passing until you forget what movie you're even watching. Monotony leads to false expectations of a punchline but there is none bar a character getting hit in the nuts before just moving on with the next scene.\n\nI give the original Scary Movie some credit. It is lazy in just taking Scream's formula almost scene for scene but at least moves with a steady pace and some sense of purpose. These sequels are the equivalent of a YouTube playlist of fan-made parodies of completely unrelated films."

Will the teacher and students survive?\n\nThis movie is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (I'm Gonna Git You Sucka) and stars Anna Faris (The House Bunny), Marlon Wayans (Requiem for a Dream), Veronica Cartwright (Alien), James Woods (Vampires), Tim Curry (IT), Regina Hall (The Best Man) and Shawn Wayans (White Chicks).\n\nIt's always tough for me to decide which one was better, this Scary Movie or the original. The exorcist opening with James Woods was outstanding. The entire cast is impressive. It's hard not to love Tim Curry and Tori Spelling was a fun addition as well. There's so many classic scenes in this - the \"tucked in\" question, the dinner sequence, the handicapped jokes, the clown under the bed, the \"I can do it myself\" skit, there's just too many to name.\n\nOverall, this is one of the greatest horror parodies ever created. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."

The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.\n\nToday's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.\n\nHopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.\n\nOne thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a \"3\" out of \"10\"."

If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either."

I liked that moment, only because it was different than every other time I had seen the movie. This is something you tune into & keep watching because you have already seen every movie in HBO's current lineup. While the other Scary Movies parody contemporary horror films, this one seems aimed more at the \"Young Frankenstein\"s of the movie world: Mel Brook's vision of horror.

This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie was a brilliant, hilarious, and intelligent satire of scary movies. It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care. The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty. You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of. This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for. It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year. I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie. Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.\n\nScary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one. When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place. There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle? Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place? There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one. There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience. I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes. I kept waiting for it to get better. But it never did. For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do. What was the point of Chris Elliot's character? Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film? Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films? What was he? I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him. He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage?\n\nTo give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial. I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes. But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere. There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger. It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.\n\nBack in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices. They called this their \"nostrum\", meaning literally, \"our remedy.\" Well my nostrum for this foul-stenched excuse for a film is for the Wayans to put a little more effort into the writing and maybe cut down from seven writers to two. This way ideas don't mesh and egos don't get bruised. As it stands this is one of the worst films I have seen this year and seeing how good the first one was, they should be ashamed of this deplorable, egregious, vapid and totally unnecessary film that they have given to us. And that is a shame.\n\n1.5 out of 10- The 1.5 being for the clever beginning and the Nike/Changeling send off. The rest of the movie receives a 0. Instead of making fun of films that are here today and forgotten tomorrow, why not take on the greats like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cujo, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre? There is plenty of great material out there, so why go after films that people disliked? It doesn't make much sense."

        "review_detailed_main": "This sorry sequel to the original spoof might have been okay if it had not had the problem of being unfunny. The first movie was okay, mixing gross-out gags and parody of the Scream movies, but this movie is simply a stinker. The jokes are obvious, and can be seen a mile away. The dialogue isn't funny (arguably the worst thing in the film is a foul-mouthed parrot that repeats expletives at everybody within earshot). The movie spoofs are bad (why anyone would want to send up garbage like the Haunting and Charlie's Angels is beyond me). When the jokes were being doled out at a surprisingly clunky pace, I found myself staring blankly at the screen instead of laughing.\n\nThe gross out gags in the film are not funny, just nauseating, and most can be sniffed out very quickly (unlike the bathroom scene in the original, which was a shocker to everybody). Gross out gags can definitely be very funny, as in There's Something About Mary or American Pie. But here the writers (for lack of a better term) want us to laugh at someone sitting on a toilet just because its gross. It doesn't work that way.\n\nThe fact that this film makes the original look like a comedy classic just about sums it up. When I saw the original, I was surprised to hear audience members laughing at even the worst jokes. In Scary Movie 2, though, the audience didn't go for it. I heard lots of courtesy laughs and nervous laughter, like some felt they had to laugh because the film was billed as a comedy. Aside from one dinner scene featuring Chris Elliot there are no scenes that inspire raucous laughter, like a good comedy should. If you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere. This film should be avoided at all costs."

Other performances are second rate, but that doesn't matter as the movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of laughs. The down side to the movie is that it can't make up its mind if it wants to be a spoof (of the Excorcist movie) or a collection of comic skits. Maybe that has something to do with the non-exsistant script. All in all, its worth renting out, honest!"

A retarded butler molests a roast turkey, Ray, a gay character, humps a clown under a bed and Anna Faris gets covered in jizzum again. Nice! The plot is poor, the performances annoying and the jokes only mildly funny at best. James Woods is great though. For his 10 minutes of the film. And when the opening skit is the highlight, you know something's wrong. I hope a third isn't released."

Anna Faris and Regina Hall were riots delivering both in their brands of humour but the ones to look out for were the males mainly Shawn, Christopher and James. The entire movie is enjoyable with humour at every end and absolutely no dull moment. Especially to one who appreciates good humour and has a good sense of one too.

I had guessed every scene up to the point that I left, so I just imagined a dull, uninspiring ending and got popcorn instead. The movie was lazy, not scary and not funny. Essentially, Scary Movie 2 exists to capitalize on it's predecessor's name and make a lot of money off of teenagers (and me). I enjoyed the original Scary Movie. While I admit that it was lowbrow movie fun, it was hilarious. The performances were funny. The writing was clever and satirical. It was worth my money. I feel that the makers of Scary Movie 2 owe me money now. To think that I actually gave up an hour of my life for this worthless chatter angers me. I will, however, say this about one of the actors . . . Chris Elliot (previously in Cabin Boy, There's Something About Mary, and the Doritos commercial) is hilarious as the disgusting misfit butler Hanson. If this movie is ever on HBO, try to watch Chris' scenes. He really is a comic talent. I suspect most of his dialog was improvised, since it contrasted so starkly to the rest of this depressed film. Scary Movie 2 is drivel."

Because people were really doing good jobs with their given roles and characters throughout the course of \"Scary Movie 2\".\n\nTrue to the spirit of the first movie, and the rest of the movies essentially, this is a hilarious spoof movie which has no restraints and respects no boundaries. As such, then there are many really funny scenes throughout the movie, and if you enjoy a good spoof movie that pokes fun at a lot of other movies, then \"Scary Movie 2\" is definitely well worth watching.\n\nCompared to the first \"Scary Movie\" installment, then this 2001 sequel offers more of a storyline, better spoofs, better effects and and all-round better cast. All in all, a more enjoyable movie experience. And I guess I enjoy this sequel more because the spoofs are based on some more impressive horror movies, compared to what was seen in the first \"Scary Movie\".\n\nEven the introduction scene which spoofed \"The Exorcist\" is enough in itself to make it worthwhile to sit down and watch \"Scary Movie 2\". That really was a great way to start off the movie.\n\nI am rating \"Scary Movie 2\" six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then \"Scary Movie 2\" is well-worth sitting down to watch."

The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly done movie."

The film has a mean sarcastic streak to it which you sometimes found in the early 2000s. Some of the better bits of clearly recycled from the original. The plot is also confusing and doesn't really have a story. I'm not even clear which films this is supposed to be a spoof of. Dead characters are now back which makes no sense either. Unlike the original there's no good twists or mysteries really either. Instead the film just doubles down on the crude sex gags, bad language, disability jokes, anything offensive or tasteless is thrown in. The story also takes so long to get going too, again unlike the original. At times it just seems to be killing time, there's a long basketball sequence which does nothing to advance the story, it's just wasting time. The comedy also gets even more surreal too with talking birds and a fight between a person and a cat..."

From what I saw of the previews I figured that it would be a ton of vulgar jokes aimed at spoofing more movies. I was pleasantly suprised. The jokes were great, although I was right about the vulgarity. The movie was short, but it was one great moment after another. I won't go into detail about the plot summary, because then anyone reading this would go into the movie and would not get the same effect as me. Scary Movie 2 is definitely worth seeing, and the trailer for American Pie 2 was also hilarious, so it's like you'll get double your money's worth of laughs, something not happening too often in movies lately."

A sequel trying to push the envelope even more, and that's what it did. Yeah so what, it was full of cheesy gags and bodily functions, but come on, at the end of the day, that kind of thing can make you laugh. It's tasteless, crude, and it's hilarious! Movies like this are never made anymore, so be glad the Wayans brothers have the guts to come along and do it, and do it well. Don't rip this film to shreds, it is what it is - funny."

        "review_detailed_main": "This original film was 88 minutes of the grossest, nastiest toilet humor with enough on-screen gags to warrant an NC-17 rating. And yet, it was an enjoyable film for the same reason that South Park: Bigger Loner, and Uncut is an enjoyable film- they are both so shockingly vulgar and shamelessly stupid that they become something greater than toilet humor. However, the thing about shocking people is you can't shock them with the same things twice. The creators of South Park knew enough not to make a sequel. After just seeing Scary Movie 2, I wish the Wayans's Brothers would take a cue from them.\n\nThe movie does not make any attempt to be original; it does not make any attempt to shock us; in fact, we wonder if any effort as put into this at all. I can clearly see the writers, pressed for time and ideas, piecing together a script out of the worst moments of Scary Movie 2.\n\nThe original spoofed the tired and worn slasher film formula- particularly Scream. This one spoofs the equally tired ad worn formula of haunted houses. There are some smart pokes at Mission Impossible 2 and Charley's Angels; Chris Elliot and James Woods have funny cameos as a caretaker and an exorcist, respectively; and the film's most brilliant gag: a foul-mouthed parrot are the few examples of Scary Movie 2's originality. Most of the film repeats the same jokes from the original, or includes new ones that make the audience groan when they should laugh.\n\nThe jokes are painfully unfunny and dangerously overplayed. And the movie as a familiar feeling- like we've seen the exact same movie before. Without its shock value, this is mere toilet humor\n\n*1/2 out of ****"

Well the trailer was great and then Scary Movie 2 started. It seemed great at first having an awsome cameo by James Woods, but then it just got really really horrible, worst than the first one. It plays some of the same jokes, just changed up a little bit. It is just Scary Movie one with 3 or 4 different characters and even more sexual humor. My advice is don't waste your money on this flick, instead got to your nearest Blockbuster and rent a good movie like Tail Lights Fade or Chasing Amy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first part of the series was very superficial, dumb and boring and only turned around movies such as \"Scream\" or \"I know what you did last summer\". The second movie is easily an improvement as the number of referenced movies is much bigger and even some of the cinema's classics are ridiculously honoured in this follow up. You may really laugh about some scenes if you have seen movies such as \"The Amityville Horror\", \"The exorcism of Emily Rose\", \"Rose Red\" and so on. There are not only childish teen horror movies but some really solid flicks that inspired this movie. Even some movies that have nothing to do with the horror genre such as \"Charlie's Angels\" are referenced in here. One can say that this movie is more diversified and surprising than the first one.\n\nThe sexual jokes are still the majority of puns in this movie but they are not as present and childish as they were in the first one. Some of the highlights in here are for example the vomiting scenes during the exorcism, the insulting and weird parrot or the wheelchair rat race between a scientist and a ghost. The puns are still predictable and childish but more diversified and far more entertaining than the jokes of the first movie.\n\nOn the negative side, there is only the fact that some chase scenes in the haunted castle are way too long and get quite boring after a while as well as the bad ending that indicates a lack of ideas and seems somewhat suddenly.\n\nNevertheless, this movie should not be criticized too hard as it is once again a good party movie with some absurd jokes that is mostly well entertaining if you have some good friends and some good beer around. Rent this one to have some fun but once you have seen and enjoyed it, there are no further reasons to purchase or watch it again very soon."

However, Oldman's really wants the ghost of the house's former master resurrected.\n\nThere are a lot of gross sexual humor is this film, as well as over-the-chart shameless stuff. While I got a couple of chuckles out of the movie, the plot was rushed through and there is nothing supposedly scary or exciting about the story. If you want a good scary film comedy spoof, watch Scary Movie 3, which is much more entertaining and serves much better as a parody of scary movies.\n\nGrade D---"

        "review_detailed_main": "The second movie in the \"Scary Movie\" series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile.\n\nThis movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of \"The Exorcist\". It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. \"You guys know this one?\" he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- \"Shake Ya Ass\". Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris (\"F--- this!\" McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic.\n\nThen the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of \"The Haunting\", a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie).\n\nHonestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the \"scary\" skeleton that tries to terrorize them (\"This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?\" Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat \"Raging Bull\"-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie.\n\nThis may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect \"Airplane!\" or even the first \"Scary Movie\" when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't \"Spy Hard\" either."

Like there would be long stretches where nothing was funny, and that it was trying to move like a regular movie would.\n\nAlso, this movie is called Scary Movie. It is supposed to be a spoof of Horror movies. That is what one would believe, correct. Well, then why did it spoof \"Cats and Dogs\", \"Charlies Angels\", and other such movies more than horror movies. Sure it had the basic story of The Haunting, which I was trying to remember that bad movie enough as it were, as well as having a little Exorcist and What Lies Beneath.

He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl, she spins her head around and he takes one look and says \"F**k this!\" And walks out, I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly, crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.\n\nI can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted.

It seems that yes, the toilet bowl mentality is used here, but to some effect and if you choose to see this movie... I am sure that if these kind of gags are your cup o' tea, then you will be rolling in the aisles. It was kind of fun to see a couple of the 90210 vets in this film, as the two ladies looked beautiful and apparently the Wayans brothers did find sexy outfits that they had not already worn on that show. On a business note, this movie I am sure will not succeed to the heights of its predecessor, but with the nickel and dime budget that I am sure that this production company has, this movie will make back it's money in spades. A funny, average written slapstick with a semblance of a plot with sight gags and vomit jokes for everyone to enjoy... once again, if this is your thing.

Many say Scary Movie 2 went to far as many said the parody scenes are to gross, but I found this film very sexy even more than the first. Just to mention sexy how about Anna Faris she also stared in the first Scary Movie now keep an eye on this cute female in years to come people will see her in film after film. Kathleen Robertson gave a very sexy performance I was once again glad to see her getting some work I'm sure the sexy Kathleen will be seen again. Scary Movie 2 is a great funny movie to go out and see, people had better be glad to have films made like these because they are so much fun to watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "* out of (****)\n\nIt was inevitable. A sequel to a financial succession that jump-started the spoof genre back in 2000. However, with disappointing box office revenues and harsh criticism, it goes to show many people did not like \"Scary Movie 2\". I am not one of those people. I HATED it. The opening for \"Scary Movie 2\" starts with a bang and is just very loud and eccentric, but with reasonable intentions. From there, it gradually goes downhill and by the third act, you just want to be done with this movie. The fact that the IMDb average score is 4.8, Rotten Tomatoes has it a dead 15%, and Metacritic has it at a 29% should really tell you something.\n\nFirst off, the performers are just tried and annoying to say the least. In the original, they were fun, zany characters that just had something that clicked with the audience. Not in here. Furthermore, the story just goes nowhere. Going from scary movies to a random basketball showdown to a Charlie's Angels fight, it's all just sloppy and feels like the filmmakers just throw a bunch of random bologna and saw what could stick. The verdict is none. Hey, at least the first had a plot, albeit a shallow one, that you could easily follow and it would actually be a story.\n\nTo top it off, when your comedy falls dead flat on its face when it comes to jokes, then you know you did something wrong. The jokes are gross, in-your-face, and top each other in terms of raunchiness, but they are tired, dead, and truly redundant. I'll use a quote from critic Michael Phillips. You won't hear crickets in the audience. You'll hear dead crickets.\n\nAnd lastly, this movie is just boring. While the original was not a good movie, it at least held my interest. This was just such a drag.\n\nAll in all, \"Scary Movie 2\" just doesn't miss the mark, it misses the target completely. They can throw all the gross-out gags and random penises at the screen, but I could care less. I need a fresh, hot script and some good performers to make the movie. If you fail on those accounts, your movie fails. What was once fresh and hip, is now just old, tired, and begs the question, \"why?\". I think the filmmakers got the title right this time. This movie is scary, because it isn't funny and just terrible to watch."

And of course this wouldn't be a Wayan bros. movie if it weren't chock full of political incorrectness; it's loaded with cripple/deformity jokes, gay jokes, drug jokes, racial jokes, (including a statue of Thomas Jefferson, complete with his black mistress and a half dozen black rugrats), even a joke involving a former president and a stained dress! Perhaps my favorite joke was when one of the girls was running away from a skeleton, and the other girl says, `What are you scared of? This is bones! Would you run away from Calista Flockheart?' To be sure, this movie isn't as good as the first one (the one whose tagline promised, among other things, `No Sequel') but for pure gross-out, turn your brain off fun, it's not bad.\n\n6/10"

The characters weren't very interesting, nor well-developed and they were all very annoying. The filming location of the movie was just a big old haunted mansion. Sadly, there weren't any death scenes on that movie and most chase scenes were really silly. Moreover, it wasn't as funny as the original movie and most jokes were really sexist and racist. The ending scene was definitely expected, but it was kinda boring. Overall, it wasn't an enjoyable sequel and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie 2 directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, is a satire comedy film parodying classic horror films from over the years. Starring Anna Faris as Cindy, our protagonist along with an ensemble of comedic actors.\n\nMy main take in this film is to not take it seriously, and when you don't, it can actually be a pretty good ride. The thing about satire comedy is the sky's the limit with the options to make a good joke. Plus this was made at a time where comedy had more free will and was open to explore topics which today wouldn't be accepted or appropriate.\n\nObviously, this film has numerous flaws. If you take a look at this film objectively, by parameters of good cinema, it lacks a basic structure along with other problems. Plot development has little to no value, yet this film is barely 80 minutes so not really a lot of time to really have a strong story. This would be better off as a series of sketches from a late show.\n\nNevertheless, for what this film is meant to be, I really enjoyed it. I rewatched it many times over the years and am always left with a good laugh. If you are looking for a comedy that isn't affected by today's standards and just want to have a pleasant evening, I would recommend this."

As it turns out, not much. (*no spoilers*)\n\nSo these kids are put in a haunted house for a class. Okay. After that, the plot goes no where. It is never explained WHY they are there--the beginning is simply followed by random puns and gross humor. The jokes were good for a quick laugh, but they weren't much when you thought about it later. And I found myself revisiting the same jokes that were used in the first Scary Movie far too frequently. The fact that the cast is nearly the same didn't help.\n\nI'll give them one thing--the opening sequence was pretty funny. There were new actors involved (James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, etc.), and some great spoofs on the Exorcist. But when it came right down to it, the movie lacked a good plot, decent actors (Tori Spelling? come on), and most of all, a healthy amount of humor for what was advertised. I'm glad I knew the guy at the ticket counter and got in for free--my $8.50 will go to better use."

While it wasn't brilliant--it basically borrowed the plot from Scream--it was pretty entertaining. This movie, however, was not. The only tidbits that I found funny were carried over from the first movie. Most of the jokes were over-the-top bathroom humor or constant sex jokes. The characters weren't developed at all which added a great deal of confusion to the movie. I wasn't exactly sure why Chris Elliot's character was in the movie. All I know is that he sounded a lot like a Southern Cartman. I think he was supposed to be the villian, but the movie left out exactly why he was the villian. There was also some major continuity problems that were so bad that they were insulting to the audience's intelligence. The original Scary Movie was hilarious enough that they did not have to make another movie. I rate this movie a 1 out of a 10."

All of the sudden it gets good again, when the action starts up (complete with the toilet humor).\n\nThe only thing I am curious about is why we heard about Marlon Brando being in the sequel.

Having used that for the first movie, the sequel is left with having to use things like 'The Exorcist' (can you say overdone?) and gross-out humour to make us \"laugh.\" They even use their own gags (from 'SM1') but not as well.\n\nAll in all, the movie isn't terrible. It just shows why Hollywood can, for lack of a better word, suck: rather than waiting a few years to make a sequel that could have been as good as the original, they rushed this one out to capitalise on the success of the first movie. In its own right, the movie would be O.K. As 'Scary Movie 2', the follow-up to one of the most hilarious and on-target parodies of all time, it sucks."

All the situations that made the first movie click with audiences (i.e. sex, drug use, handicapped people, racial issues) are reproduced here, but just not nearly as funny. Anna Faris plays well in this movie, but it would be nice to see her branch out into a project that doesn't involve the Wayans', and give her a chance to showcase her talent away from the genre of gross-out comedy. I give the Wayans' credit for making the attempt, but I can't help but feel that this movie was rushed in production to ride the coattails of the original film's success. Unfortunately, that production rush left little place for funny jokes and laughable situations, and only made room for mediocre screenwriting that was pounded out without thinking about whether it would be funny or not. A big fan of the first movie will somewhat enjoy themselves here, while a mild movie-goer will probably wonder what happened to their 8 bucks."

Close attention to the story line isn't the most important thing for this type of film, but this time it's completely ignored so often as to make the film incoherent. Another major problem is that they try to reference every commercial and recent mediocre film they can think of. Be more selective, guys, as in the first one.\n\nThe first movie was much funnier than this one, but there are a few moments here. However, many of the jokes are disgusting without the context to make them humorous, and others are just plain bizarre. Perhaps the most appropriate thing to do is to appropriate Roger Ebert's response to Freddy Got Fingered. The film may someday be seen as a masterpiece of surrealism.

I thought that \"Scary Movie\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \"Scary Movie 2\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.\n\nThe Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.\n\nNow, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy.\n\nSomething that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.\n\nAlso, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.\n\nSome jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \"Scary Movie\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny.\n\nThe bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.\n\nTori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.\n\nBut I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes."

First off, the new characters were incredibly mundane and unentertaining. Tori Spelling's role as a ditz was terrible. Getting it on with a ghost was absolutely pathetic. Some of the bathroom humor which is something I normally don't mind, was used to such extremes that the first 5 minutes of the movie ruined any chance of it getting off the ground. The rest feels so rushed, and it seems that no thought was put into the script. The writers tried to create some new material rather than making fun of current movies(I won't spoil the \"story\" for ya), but everything sounded insanely immature and insulting. Throwing ideas in a hat and randomly picking one was the name of the game here and it got ugly. Speaking of parodies, the few redeeming parts, such as the Nike basketball commercial rip-off and the scenes with the parrot were sufficient to prevent this film from making an all-time worst movie list, but that's hardly a compliment. Curiosity is going to get the best of many, but I'm giving it my highest recommendation to avoid at all costs."

I've haven't been this tempted to walk out of a theatre since I saw Batman & Robin. It was like the Wayans took all of the gross-out gags from the first one, and decided to make the sequel completely based around that. This time around, the cast is in a haunted house spoof, that consists of so many unfunny jokes, that you throw your arms up in the air saying \"what were they thinking?\". The humor in this movie is extremely desperate and contrived; even going as far as to spoof movies that aren't even horror movies. As my local newspaper said, Chris Elliot \"milked out every scene as much as he could without garnering a single laugh\". The only funny part of the movie was the Exorcist spoof (especially the party scene with Andy Richter playing the piano). After that, your waiting for the movie to be funny, until the halfway point when you just give up. For the remainder, your subjected to an annoying parrot that gets old really fast, Chris Elliots deformed hand, Anna Farris's very Jan Brady like disposition, recycled ejaculation jokes, and other very redundant examples of toilet humor. Don't get me wrong; I think toilet humor can be funny if it's done well. But this was just ridiculous. Worst movie this summer."

I had a good time during it, but it wasn't until I got home that realized it wasn't very good. I though the references to other films were really funny, but I was sitting in an audience predominantly filled with people who knew nothing about the films being spoofed and just laughed when Marlon Wayans said something in a high voice. It spoofed films like Hannibal, What Lies Beneath, Hollow Man, but I and a few friends of mine were the only ones who found them funny. It reminded me of the ending to the film's predecessor, Scary Movie, that ended with a spoof on Usual Suspects that was hilarious. Scary Movie 1 is much better, but Scary Movie 2 is funny because of David Cross and Chris Elliot. I love the shriveled hand gag. If you are not looking to think for (It felt like the movie was about an hour long) however long the movie was, then go see it. It has a few laughs"

Still, that's two more than the original, so I guess this silly sequel could actually be considered an improvement!).\n\nThankfully, the charms of a pre-blonde, pre-surgery Anna Faris and the ample curves of busty babe Kathleen Robertson provide just about enough impetus for guys to persevere to the end (the girls stripping to their underwear is worth the wait); female viewers aren't catered for in the same manner (unless you count Shawn Wayans posing semi-naked with his todger tucked between his legs\u2014eeek!).\n\n3.5 out of 10 (marginally more than I gave the first film), but not good enough for me to round it up to a 4."

It is also apparent that when they run out of dialogue (which is often) they just insert a bodily fluid gag of some sort. And the less material they have to work with, the more liters of fluid they weave into the plot. It's lazy, it's disgusting, and it isn't funny. It reminds me of that comedian open mic night who doesn't tell jokes but just curses the whole time and raises his voice. Volume isn't comedy. Vulgarity isn't \"jokes.\"\n\nThis is the movie that you see on one of the higher number HBO's and you pause on it for two minutes because you understand a joke is coming really fast so you might as well squeeze in one, and then it finally arrives, and you change the channel with an eye roll, disgusted with yourself over the fact that you allowed yourself to watch such a pathetic display of entertainment...

The original movie was a parody of the film Scream along with every other popular horror movie both slasher/non-slasher. Some moments from the genitals to the pubic hair might have gagged some audience members, but no matter, the film itself was funny making Anna Faris a star before she would later appear in the entire Scary Movie series prior to making a serious cameo in Brokeback Mountain.\n\nScary Movie 2 crossed out the \"No sequels\" slogan since more movies needed to come.\n\nKeenan Ivory Waynes, director of the first movie of the franchise, returns in the director's chair where instead of slasher films, it's all about haunted houses and things that bump in the night as Cindy (Anna Faris) starts a new life in college where other members of the surviving party from Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Waynes) and Ray (Shawn Waynes) go with her as well. This time Cindy has a boyfriend (Chris Masterson) where the two of them along with Brenda, Shorty, Ray and other guests are going to a haunted mansion for a field experiment to see about a ghost. Some parts of the film made me laugh from certain pop culture (Raging Bull, Nike Shoes) while some of the sex jokes just didn't work for me. I felt that I was watching a movie where the laughter needed to be forced out of me than seeing something innovated."

I hated the original, for obvious reasons, so I was shocked that this ridiculous sequel managed to sneak beneath the abysmal level to which the original sank less than a year ago. The Wayans brothers have returned to the spotlight to remind the world of their immaturity, their sickening sense of humor, and their absolute lack of any type of film-making talent. This is drivel of the lowest order and is completely devoid of redeeming values of any kind.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a place for a film like this, even among educated people. For example, if you are a professional film critic, or even an average movie-goer who writes reviews for the IMDb (a group of people with whom I proudly associate), then a movie like Scary Movie 2 is worth watching just because it is so much fun to shoot it down afterwards in a review. There's something morbidly satisfying about watching a dumbass movie like this and then tearing it up in a review, even if you already know that not too many people will bother to read it. I can't even begin to satisfactorily convey to you the absolute idiocy of this film, I can only say that there is a total absence of any kind of talent or thought behind it, and it results as nothing more than an hour and a half of blabbering nonsense.\n\nDid you ever wonder how many perfectly good careers are ended, some even before they've really began, by hideous movies like this? Tori Spelling's flailing and altogether unenviable career is officially over, Tim Curry is too good an actor to be completely destroyed by movie like this, but this was clearly his version of Travolta starring Battlefield Earth. There can be no doubt about Anna Faris's talent as an actress, and she's beautiful, too, but she'll never be able to overcome the awful reputation that she has established for herself in the Scary Movies. Marlon and Shawn Wayans are the lucky ones here, because neither had anything to lose when they took on these crapfests. This kind of movie is a metaphorical handgun with which various actors can voluntarily commit career suicide. For shame.\n\nAnd one more thing, if any of the people behind the Scary Movies are reading this, I'd like to ask a huge favor for the greater good of mankind - \"FOR GOD'S SAKE, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\""

So that means the movie works, right?\n\nWell. It's like a chiclet. At first it tastes great, but chew on it hard, and the taste is gone. First of all (the apology has ended, BTW), I am SURE I saw a censored version of the movie, since there was a huge gap between the professors' death and the kids trying to get out of the haunted house. Second (and I cannot stress it enough), how come the directors are so keen in showing us the drug addict as the cool guy? I mean, kids are going to watch this movie one way or the other (rental, anyone?) and I can only imagine what they'll think when they see that the dopey guy even gets the girl at the end. Do we really need a drug-glorifying culture nowadays? Sheesh... I have known friends who regularly use drugs, and they ended up isolated and alienated. Nothing at all what is shown on the films.\n\nThe story, as it is to be expected, stinks. No continuity, jumps from scene to scene, lots of jokes that simply don't work (the whole skeleton thing is stupid), and way too many counterculture references. Which will only help to date the thing. Which will make future viewing difficult or impossible.

AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2 AT ALL COSTS! It\u00b4s horrible, terrible, disgusting, unfunny, boring, shocking and easily one of the worst so-called comedies of all-time. I just hope the third part will be able to top the second part as it has one of the Zucker brothers at the helm and Pat Proft as one of the writers. Beating Part 2 won\u00b4t be hard, though. You simply cannot get any lower than this.\n\n>"

I even liked Wrongfully Accused even though it was more than apparent no one was really putting their full effort into it. However, when a spoof is not funny, it fails horribly. What's to go back on? Plot? No. Character development? No. Uh, acting? Nope.\n\nThis movie is simply not funny. Nothing in this movie is funny. Chris Elliot's character is not funny, not one of the spoofs on any movie is funny, and added to that, I didn't even get that it was a spoof on M:I 2 until the scene was almost over! The Wayans said they researched through tons of movies to make this one. All it proves is that they've wasted their time watching movies rather than actually MAKING one!"

The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission: Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned. Some of the new cast isn't great, all the main adults aren't well done, but the new teens Theo, Alex and Buddy are great. Overall, there are A FEW funny moments and chuckles in this movie, but the original is better."

There are some truly original moments which will have you holding your sides and are much funnier than some of the spoofs. If you liked American Pie and Airplane!

Watching a bad horror film can be rewarding, but Scary Movie 2 is not a horror film, it's a comedy, and bad comedy is not an artform. There aren't too many websites dedicated to unfunny comedies, as there are for bad/silly/cheesy/campy horror flicks. I did not hate SM2, it was a fine date movie, but as with the prequel the \"satire\" breaks down into an endless stream of toilet jokes. Toilet jokes can be funny, as they occasionally are here, but to rely almost solely on them in a film that presents itself as a SATIRE is wrong. I have the same gripes with SM2 as I did with the first one. Not enough genuinly smart jokes. Most are just gross-out style. With so much to parody in the realm of horror it's sad to see the comedy ball dropped so often. An over reliance on swearing and bodily fluids really detract from the actual satire. At least this one went away from the \"Scream\" style movies that it rheemed in the SM1. This one is more like The Haunting, with a little Excorcist and What Lies Beneath thrown in. I have to say this much, Cindy had me hypnotised, she's so beautifull I just wanted the movie to focus solely on her and never leave. Chris Elliot is also quite funny as the grotesque and gimpy caretaker, he steals most of his scenes. The clown under the bed scared my girlfriend, so it scores points for that. Tim Curry is fat; Tori Spelling is ugly; Cindy is hypnotic; the chick with the leather pants and visable thong should do Playboy; Chris Elliot rules; Drug/Penis jokes get old fast; that's what Andy Richter's been doing? James Woods has no shame. TWO and 1/2 STARS out of four."

Relying on gross-out and sexual \"jokes,\" this film insulted the viewer with non-sequiturs, build ups for which there was no punch line, and scenes that run pointlessly on. The film had only one truly funny moment, a scene which had little to do with the rest of the story and involved a \"potted\" plant. \"Scary Movie\" was sharp and funny. The sequel is just pitiful."

It does have its moments though, and the deleted scenes and alternate endings are some of the best that the series has to offer. If only there was more to offer in terms of a really storyline, this would be much better. Still, it remains better than most parody films, many of which fall extremely flat. The original ending may be unsatisfying, and many of the characters are clich\u00e9d and open-ended. Nobody has a real personality, and it seems to be spoofing one movie after another. Which brings us to the only real major problem: there is too much going on. The movie gets consumed in all of the material it is trying to spoof, and becomes sucked up in the stupidity of it all. Still, the acting is superb and many scenes really shine through. The rare scenes that have actual character development are actually written quite well, and pretty much anything involving the 'handyman' was excellent. Tim Curry's presence was truly a gift. Overall, the movie is worth several watches and it is a very good spoof film, but it is not without its share of flaws."

It has very funny opening moments with the spoofing of the Exorcist. However, the movie takes an absolute downfall afterwards. It had maybe and I'm being generous here, 2-3 more laughs scattered throughout the movie.\n\nFor instance, there is a talking parrot who uses more curse words than I do, but in a VERY extremely non-funny way. It uses jokes like I had your mother last night and stuff like that. The jokes were so unoriginal, I wanted to shoot the person who wrote this crap. Since this movie is suppose to be funny and slapsticky, I expect funny for my buck. I don't expect good acting, plots, character development in these types of movies, but for god sakes, please show me the funny. Marlon Wayans brought a few laughs here and there as did Shawn, but the down-syndrome girl is oh my god, TOO ANNOYING TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS!!\n\nAvoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see some funny spoofs, then I suggest renting National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Naked Gun, Naked Gun 2 1/2, Hot Shots part 1, Christmas Vacation, Airplane or Spy Hard. This movie doesn't even get a star. 0 *'s out of 4 *'s."

Why did they even bother to spoof the movies they did spoof, they should have picked better movies to spoof cause the ones they spoofed did not have that much stuff to make fun of. Most of the humour in this movie was ridiculous, like every 5 minutes someone farted or something stupid like that. I still thought that some of the parts of this movie were funny but not all. Overall, this movie was pretty bad/okay and even if it was funny it was not laugh out loud funny, it was more like he - he - he that's kind of funny. I don't recommend watching it cause then you would not be interested in the other scary movies which were good."

As I started watching it, I almost started to write down the films they were lifting scenes from. Fortunately, I stopped myself and went back to laughing. Still, it's interesting to watch scenes progress that switch from one flick to another. For example, the \"trapped in the freezer\" scene from HOLLOW MAN switches to the \"do I drown or freeze to death\" scene from TITANIC.\n\nOther flicks I caught references to--\n\nTHE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (Richard Matheson's homage to THE HAUNTING)\n\nTHE EXORCIST (most of the opening sequence)\n\nTHE AMITYVILLE HORROR (the flies in the bathroom)\n\nStephen King's IT (the clown doll)\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (the invisible seduction)\n\nTHE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the remake; the maze of basement corridors)\n\nHANNIBAL (the second dinner scene)\n\nCHARLIES ANGELS\n\nCROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON\n\nHOLLOW MAN (I think they LITERALLY swiped the infrared goggles from that flick)\n\nSCREAM (talking to Dad on the phone at the end of the flick)"

Instead of poking fun of the genre in a hilarious over the top manner like the first one did, this film instead goes for gross out humor and various unfunny jokes. There are only so many times I can say \"thats not funny\" so I just leave it at this. Scary Movie 2 is not funny, its dumb, vile, and idiotic. Just watch the first one instead."

Another reason for that is they feel the need to throw SO many random, totally unrelated parodies in, that they are forced to parody things that may have been well known at that year..but no one remembers. So...where everyone remembers the disaster movies craze that Airplane! was parodying and can enjoy the jokes 10, even 40 years later..NO ONE remembers a stupid Nike basketball commercial, so people watching Scary Movie 2 pretty much any time after 2004 will be wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nI gave it a 5 solely because it is better than all the parody movies that have come out since.

The main films spoofed this time around are The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill.\n\nScary Movie was so funny because it pushed the envelope. It was stuff you've never seen in a movie before. Now, in Scary Movie 2 it's old news. There is far too much toilet humour in this movie and it just gets redundant after a while. Of course I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh. It did. The only problem was that it reused many of the same jokes from the first one. That, and it was too short. Everything happens to quickly, and it makes the plot seem sloppy.

Whilst the first flick focused on parodying the slasher sub-genre, the second instalment targeted classic supernatural horror films. A group of college students must stay in a manor for an assignment, where a ghostly presence starts to haunt them. A mixture of 'Poltergeist', 'House on Haunted Hill' and 'The Haunting', yet somehow the plot seems less cohesive than its predecessor. Reminiscent of random sketches stitched together in an attempt to create a story. Starting with 'The Exorcist' which holds no importance whatsoever, and concluding with an action sequence from 'Charlie's Angels' (although actually my favourite scene). It makes no sense. Heck, I myself could invite some friends over and imitate some horror films for you and mash them together using Windows Movie Maker calling it a \"film\". The vulgarity is increased to maximum potential, including a myriad of fart, poo and vomit jokes. The dinner preparation scene highlights the sickening tone of this sequel, and unfortunately that type of humour has expired. It's not funny in the slightest, it gained no laughs from me. Regina Hall as Brenda is just euphoric. \"Cindy, it's a skeleton! It's just bones!\" to which she really is the only good aspect to this. Tim Curry is in this, no idea why. Although, I have calculated a formula to solve the \"Curry Conundrum\". 'Charlie's Angels' is parodied which features Curry in a towel who is in 'It' as a clown which is not spoofed in this, therefore mathematically proving that Curry was in it for the money. Yes! It makes perfect sense now. No other way to justify his involvement in this piece of rubbish that bathes in the runny poo that it adores using in the countless unfunny jokes presented to us. Fortunately, the next sequel is a big guilty pleasure for me..."

Weird people - including a creepy owner and a sick chef - turn them off and they soon find themselves being pursued by evil.\n\nIf the plot sounds lame, that's because it is.

I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but am willing to admit that the first one did have some funny jokes or sight gags. My biggest problem with the first one, overall was the lack of any real plot and the jokes that fell flat, which could have very well made up for the choppy plot. The second film has a _lot_ of flat jokes, although I will admit some of them were pretty funny, the crudeness has come down to an modified on steroids version of \"Home Alone\" - some of the films they make fun of aren't really too clear and stray too far from the orginals to really be parodies of them- The Mummy parody was unclear with a skeleton chasing them around? And the Sabrina The Teenage Witch parody was also unclear, with the cat fight and the \"Rocky\" ending? It was like a giant saturday night live episode- some funny, some not. But people will love this movie anyway, I saw it in a theatre filled with people laughing so loud, I may have to see the movie again, if for the sole purpose to really hear all of the jokes, or what the hell is going on. Just an added note- the script was pretty awful, but most of the perfomances were really pretty good, like Chris Elliots - even if the script seemed like it was written by a bunch of guys sitting down with a case of beer and Attention Deficit Disorder."

David Cross plays the by far most fun character in the movie (and all \"Scary Movie\" movies). Every single second on screen with him is priceless. Sadly, he's just a small (but valuable) part."

But as a whole, \"Scary Movie 2\" is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.\n\nThe first \"Scary Movie\" was a laugh a minute film. It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold. The humor in \"Scary Movie 2\" is as heavy handed as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movies stars are former cast members of \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! In the final analysis, \"Scary Movie 2\" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon. The script needed a lot more time to age. 2 stars out of 5."

For god's sake go and watch a proper stand up comic in action, they can be hilarious in the same way that this film tries to be.

That in itself is original these days.\n\nThis film is the best of its kind since the original scary movie which in turn was the best of it's kind since Spaceballs. Just watch it and let yourself laugh at the jokes, at the plot, at the acting and at how something with so many bad parts can actually put a smile on someones face, after all isnt that the most important thing ?"

No one goes to this kind of movie looking for a coherent storyline, as is evidenced by the first film's blockbuster grosses. And as a fan of the first film, I can say that \"Scary Movie 2\" fails on every level. It's not humorous, engaging, or even remotely watchable. The desire to flee the theater struck me more times that I can even count, and yet I stayed, hoping for some salvagable, hilarious set piece. No such luck. This 4th of July weekend, or any other weekend for that matter, do yourself a favor, save your 8 bucks, and stay the hell away. Only a masochist could enjoy this bomb.

When things really start getting bad, the gang must work together to find a way to capture this ghostly menace.\n\n'Scary Movie' was a decent spoof film. Wasn't fantastic and wasn't terrible. Unfortunately its sequel 'Scary Movie 2', fails to deliver a decent movie. The stars of the film are their usual characters from the previous film. Marlon Wayans isn't as annoying as Shorty Meeks, and Tim Curry makes an nice addition to the cast. The opening spoof isn't actually that bad and i found it quite humorous, but after this, the actual funny jokes are few and made the film drag on. Fortuantly the sequel had an improvement over this. They should have really picked much better material to spoof than 'House on Haunted Hill' or 'Charlie Angels'.\n\n\"Suck on this.\" - Father McFeely (James Woods)"

The only really clever scene is the part about the Florida votes.\n\nSo, I would recommend watching numbers 1, 3 and 4 before you watch this one. In fact, they kind of got better once Leslie Nielsen joined the cast. Don't let this one bias you. Also starring Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Masterson, Regina Hall, Chris Elliott, Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, James Woods, Andy Richter and Veronica Cartwright; I get the feeling that they don't wish to be remembered for this."

It's all downhill from there\u0085 There is an unfunny Charlie's Angel's spoof (Why did that need to be spoofed, again?) The cast itself is just fine. It has way too many juvenile jokes. I always expect hit and misses with these movies, but most of them ARE misses. There is plenty of semen jokes and crude stuff like that. We also get one of the most annoying comedians in the world today. (Chris Elliot) I can't stomach the guy. He does nothing but gross out gags throughout the film, and I just wanted to slap him one. Watching Kathleen Robertson's cleavage bop up and down is a rather nice distraction. Her cleavage does the acting for her. Great performance! Anna Farris is fine as per usual. She plays it all straight faced like a trooper; I just wish she had better stuff to work with. Christopher Masterson makes me pine for Jon Abrahams. The Wayan brothers do their thang and it's not as funny this time around. Regina Hall sticks out like a sore thumb. I actually got very annoyed by her in this one. Tori Spelling & Tim Curry are both OK. David Cross is excruciatingly unfunny as the invalid\n\nFinal Thoughts: This is what happens when you get greedy and rush production. Scary Movie is quite funny, this isn't! By far the worst in the series\n\n2/10"

How can we make this moment gross, and a bit different from the yuck in the previous scene? No faulting them for debased invention. It's not like the Horror genre is noble, not as a rule, but traditionally one does want someone to root for, not just gloat over. Every opportunity to hurl sexual humour of the nastiest kind, or toilet humour, is seized with glee in this movie.\n\nI used the word parody before, but parody can be achieved with a certain intelligence, even respect for its source material. The Scary Movie franchise has ZERO respect, and only limited affection, and as such it is parodic of Horror in much the same way that pornography holds up a grotesque mirror to the mainstream, with 'stars' whose names and even their appearances are vulgar copies of entertainment industry celebrities, and with parodies of mainstream content that reduce whatever happened in the source project to the soulless display of bodily functions on camera. I don't know if the fact they really do those things, whereas the Scary gang only pretend, doesn't in fact give the adult industry folk more integrity. At least they have a special skill, whereas this lot can't act, can't write, can't imagine. It's all a knock-off.\n\nBut is it funny? Well, yes. In a horrible, self-hatred inducing sort of way (again, like the consumption of porn). I think later movies, the ones with Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards and Leslie Nielsen, probably had better writing, but to be sure of that I'd have to watch them again. And I don't know if I can stomach that."

When we finally rented it and watched it, we laughed many times, but the movie overall wasn't great. What I'm trying to tell the reader's is that Scary Movie 2 is a movie for teens to see, not for adults, because it is concentrating on jokes and less on the film direction and writing, which messes up the whole plot. So, I liked the movie, but wouldnt' say it was a great movie. So this movie is for teens to enjoy, but not by themselves. When watching the movie it should be in a party or with many friends, and I did watch it with my brother and my friend, that's why we enjoyed it. I'm sure my cousin would like it also. So the movie is strictly for teens, and to be watched with many people."

Of course there are a lot more black and white jokes in the sequel and they are funny for a little bit. The black and white jokes, however, are very over used and eventually become offensive. The only other type of joke you find in this movie is a fart joke. None of them are remotely funny. No jokes in this movie are new. They have all been used many times before. The beginning part with James Woods is really funny and would have been even better had Marlon Brando been able to fill the role. I laughed almost never during this horribly thought up \"comedy\"."

All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy(which in this movie is amm), and everything else you would expect from a parody.\n\nIt's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember \"handsome\" and all the other iconic situations and characters of the movie which aren't many.\n\nThe story is as clich\u00e9 as you would expect from a parody movie. Clich\u00e9 story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works kinda well.\n\nOverall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and a portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like not the greatest parody at all and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 5 out of 10. Would kinda recommend to anyone familiar or not with parodies, but it wouldn't be my first choice at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie 2....Boy wasn't this film made in a hurry? Its pretty obvious, just watch the movie, and you will think they did the whole film in one take. The film is VERY short....Thats what makes it feel very cheap, you would expect alot more, the original was GREAT this sequel had potential but it was far from great.\n\nThe movie starts off with an Exorcist spoof...Wow.! Well done, that was a good job and left me laughing alot...After that though, many of the jokes just aren't funny or are simply irellevant. Many of the jokes fall flat some examples would be (The clown scene,Nike Ad, Weakest Link,Hannibal,The Haunting) they obviously weren't thinking, after seeing these scenes you would think to yourself \"How long did this really take to make\"?. The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the \"I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE\" chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.\n\nOn the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls. Scary Movie 2 was very sexually crude, i dont reccomend this to anyone under 15 at all....Gross Humor is good in American Pie...Gross Humor in Scary Movie 2...Well..It doesnt quite work.\n\nACTING: The acting wasn't good at all...Acting was barely required in the whole film, it is SO short and there is barely any dialogue, and this is what furthers the gap between this and its worthy original.\n\nACTORS: Most of the original cast is back (Even though half of them died) a few good names...Excluding Tori Spelling, i guess the casting was ok..I wasnt expecting any better.\n\nSCRIPT: Very poor, this is what made the film sink....If they spent abit more time on the script, closing pot-holes, making the movie make sense etc. etc. Infact if they re-wrote the whole thing it would have been better...Seriously, they must have written this with their eyes closed.\n\nCINEMA: Very poor, lack of locations, its like the movie was made in a few days, i wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt.The lighting was good for the Exorcist but other than that, poor Cinematography.\n\nCOMEDY: Had alot of potential, didnt really reach its goal. I did expect better, sure you will laugh in the movie, but dont expect many laughs...Just a few official laughs...Not artificial laughs where you are just laughing WITH the audience even though it aint funny to you.\n\nMUSIC: Hmmm music? all i really remember is GRADUATION DAY by VITAMIN C...Oh there was \"LET ME BLOW YA MIND\" by EVE and Gwen Stefani, also the music during Charlies angels was ok..Not bad!\n\nOVERALL: Scary movie 2 i recommend you watch ONLY if you liked part one, and i am not promising that you will love this film, you might end up hating it.... Yet i personally think the film had lots of potential, it tried...But not hard enough.\n\n** (2 stars)"

I like the Wayans brothers, and I think they are pretty damn funny. Theres just one problem: When the Wayans are good...they're really good, but when they're bad...they really suck...HARD. A good example of that is when Shawn and Marlon hosted the MTV Video Music Awards..they stunk it up. Scary Movie 2 starts out ok. The parody of \"The Exorcist\" is done well, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The big problem with this movie is that the unfunny scenes drag on WAY too long. Marlon's character is really annoying and not funny at all. That cursing parrot is extremely stupid and gets old very quick. The scenes don't flow together well either. It looks like they wrote the script in 3 days. I did laugh pretty hard at some parts, but most of the scenes were painful to watch and I felt bad for them. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but they made it impossible. What happend here Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan? Didn't you take the time to watch this thing before you put it out there? The casting was also a huge mistake. Chris Elliot is a funny guy (sometimes), but he sucks in this film. Don't even get me started on Tori Spelling, I'd rather watch my dog lick himself then watch her. Another big problem is that none of the characters die! Thats what made the first one so good...the parts where they got killed were hilarious. This was a huge disappointment. What is going on with comedies these days? The past couple years have delivered some of the biggest let-downs ever. Such as \"Little Nicky\", \"Joe Dirt\", \"Freddy Got Fingered\", and now \"Scary Movie 2\". Please Hollywood!...For the love of God! Take your time while making these movies, and make sure they are atleast funny before they are released."

After watching this film, I basically feel they must have thought to themselves, \"Gee, the first one did so well we could just throw this one together and toss it out there and it will do well just on the merits of the first one.\" And based on the first weekend gross that maybe what happens.\n\nIt basically felt like the just threw the movie together without any real thought for the script at all. I don't they think they gave any real attention to detail, writing or anything. This is very sad because one of the best types of film genres there is, is parody. Look at the NAKED GUN films. The original SCARY MOVIE was excellent but number 2 just tanks.\n\nStrangely enough, I hope they do a number 3 because I think there is so much good material to use but I hope they decide to give it some time and thought and try to actually make it good instead of just tossing something out there for a quick buck. Based on the $35mil it made on it's opening weekend (and I expect a fairly low budget), I'm sure this one will make money but I'd be willing to bet that it won't come close to the first when all is said and done. After a big opening weekend and, I expect, a mediocre second weekend, I am expecting this one to drop out of site and go to video quickly.\n\nPersonally, I feel that if you haven't already seen it, then don't bother. If you really feel you must see this one, then wait until it comes out to rent. Or better yet wait until it's on HBO or Showtime (or whoever ends up with it). But if you can at all go without it, then don't even both with it when it comes out on video. It's just not worth it. :("

There are 2 funny jokes within the first 3 minutes, and the rest of the film is uninspired, unfunny and just plain awful. I warn you all...avoid this film like the plague. Its that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "This teen film (one of the most abominable cinematographic genres I know) was made to parody some well-known horror films, just as it had happened to the film that preceded it. This time, the most obvious victims are the famous \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Haunting\". I don't know to what extent it was a predictable sequel, but the fact is that it seems to have honored the initial film, even though the formula is not so interesting and is already more difficult to bear.\n\nThe film is more of a satire on horror films, made to entertain young audiences with easy laughter, eschatological jokes and a thousand of allusions to sexuality, in its several options and variants. Unlike its predecessor, which seemed to me a kind of \"guilty pleasure\", capable of even pleasing those who don't like this type of humor, this film was not so successful: it will almost certainly please everyone who loved the first one film, but the same is not guaranteed for audiences that are already more demanding with the humor they consume, or who have a loathing for \"teen\" films. The reason for this is simple: it is not as fresh, nor as funny as the first film, and there are lots of perfectly boring or predictable jokes.\n\nThe cast is again led by Anna Faris, again in the shoes of Cindy, and she does as good a job as in the first film except that it's not as fresh or brings anything really new, and sometimes the character was overly sexualized, the that removed the stupid na\u00efvet\u00e9 that made her funny. Another actress who is returning is Regina Hall, but she manages to be even more funny and iconoclastic than in the first film. Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans keep the same record with less interesting results. Tori Spelling does not bring anything special or interesting. Kathleen Robertson is a walking pair of breasts and Tim Curry isn't funny at all."

It was clearly rushed, and for that reason only, it is better than expected. Adding more TV actors in the sequel, was the inside joke, I think. And a way to make the second film just as appealing as the first on was. I don't mind Tori Spelling and Kathleen Robertson, but that guy from Malcolm in the Middle, was not a memorable part of the movie.

I still laugh whenever I see it, and I had been so looking forward to an opportunity to see this next installment. My advice to all of you: don't tarnish your memories of the first with this abysmal sequel.\n\nOne accepts that by the very nature of the series as a parody the story will be stupid, the acting deliberately bad and the humour silly. That was the case with the first movie, but in the first movie it was funny; it worked. Here, it's lost its edge. That's the problem with parodies. It's hard to do them more than once and keep them funny. This reminds me a bit of the \"Airplane\" movies spoofing airline disasters. The first one was great, after that - why bother? Now, sometimes the parody format can work in a sequel. I'm thinking of the \"Naked Gun\" movies or \"Austin Powers.\" But \"Scary Movie 2\" doesn't cut it as a worthy sequel. I'm not sure that I even broke a smile the entire way through.\n\nWhile most of the cast is back (including Anna Faris as Cindy, around whom the sequel also focuses), I have to say that I really missed the character of \"Doofy\" from the original, and there was no one in this cast to really fill the hole that was left. And this movie needed something to recapture the fun of the first.\n\n2/10"

They couldn't have thought that Marlon and Shawn Wayans were going to change the writing style they used on a movie that grossed well over 200 million dollars. Anyway, the movie was funny. I must say that I did like the first better, but I still thought this one was hilarious. Marlon Wayans is my favorite actor and I am a huge fan of the entire Wayans family. Although I don't believe that any type of comedy is better than another, if I were to follow these beliefs then I would have to conclude that Keenan, Marlon, and Shawn are just very versatile. Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote and produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a spoof of blaxploitation films. This movie received rave reviews and didn't have \"toilet humor\" as many people like to call it. Marlon and Shawn wrote and produced Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which critically was not as successful as Keenan's spoof, but was a huge hit with fans and had very little \"toilet humor.\" Last summer the brothers Wayans wrote Scary Movie and mastered gross-out humor in the spoof. They did it again this summer. Perhaps many of the jokes in Scary Movie 2 are taken from scenes or even movies that many people might not remember, but the movie is still hilarious. Straight up, if you didn't like the first one, don't go see the sequel expecting something totally different. If you liked the first one and didn't enjoy the second, I supposed I can understand. I give it a 10 because it did its job which was to make me laugh. One final note, to anyone who says Marlon Wayans isn't talented, go out and rent Requiem for a Dream."

I don't think it brings shame upon the Scary Movie name though.\n\nThe Wayans were forced to develop this film quickly and as expected it does feel a bit rushed and lacking in comparison to the first.\n\nThe plotline is mostly a parody of 'The Haunting' with elements of some other horror and non-horror films thrown in. Like the others in the franchise though, the storyline isn't exactly the main part.\n\nThe humour is. Does the humour deliver in this film?\n\nWell, kind of in parts but so much of it is just crude jokes with the odd good one thrown in. They wouldn't be able to include many of them today it's fair to say. There are countless outdated references here too like nods to Charlie's Angels and Dude Where's my Car so I can imagine younger viewers who weren't around at this time being quite confused by this film as so many references are over 20 years out of date.\n\nThe acting is mostly average, though Tim Curry and Anna Farris put in solid performances.\n\nThe effects look pretty outdated and cheap looking, more so than the first one for me.\n\nIt's enjoyable enough for what it is but I don't find it particularly memorable or good.\n\n5/10."

Thankfully comic brains David Cross and Tim Curry come to class up the juvenile cast, but cannot save, or even attempt to save this very questionable possibility even for rental."

The problem with this movie is that there are very little gags, and many of them are not that funny at all. Some of them are just stupid and not laughable. It had some good gags too like the Charlie's Angel's spoof and a few others. But many of them were just repeated from the first part. A few scenes, like the basketball scene, were good to listen but didn't really make any sense. I can't comment that much about the acting here as all had to act stupidly. Though I feel that the lady who wears lesser clothes and is one of the friends, has no acting capability as she wasn't funny either. One thing was good. Less nudity and whatever was there wasn't shown that clearly. 5 out of 10."

Instead it relied on jokes about potty humor, sex and drug use. That would have been fine, except I wanted to see a movie that spoofed horror.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Scary Movie\", was a somewhat breath of fresh air in the year 2000, with a concept in the tradition of \"Airplane!\". Making a movie that parodies every clich\u00e9 of the late 90s teen horror genre like \"Scream\" and \"I know what you did last summer\" seemed like good fun. The Wayans brothers hit the target with their particular brand of crude humor that was very attractive to the MTV generation of the end of the last century.\n\nA year after, they broke their promise of no sequels with this movie focused on the big CGI horror movies like the remakes of \"The Haunting\" and \"Thirtheen Ghosts\" as well as other popular movies of the time, keeping the crude humor and the sex jokes in the same style as the original; the difference being that, as any sequel, there is the more of everything.\n\nActually those two aspects are the main problems in the film; first, the popular culture references are only funny if one is familiar with those, and also become dated quickly as the time goes on. The comedy aspect of the film, unlike the original movie, is very weak, with most gags being repetitive and masking the movie tiresome. Sure, the Wayans are a very creative team and still can make a laugh, but in this movie it feels as if they had written the script on a hurry and without caring too much on the result.\n\nThe acting is mediocre at best, with Anna Faris being again not only our lead character, but also the only one who knows how to give a good performance. Such a shame that her most famous role to date is as the lead star of this series of films, because she is a real talent on the rise. The rest of the cast is unconvincing and even the Wayans brothers seem bothered by their own script. The brilliant cameo by James Woods at the beginning of the film is among the few really enjoyable moments of the film.\n\nThe special effects are far better than in the first one; having a bigger budget helps and director Keenen Ivory Wayans makes good use of them. Unlike the horror movies it parodies, \"Scary Movie 2\" doesn't abuse of CGI and at times it keeps the indie-look of the first one.\n\nThe first \"Scary movie\" promised no sequels. If they had stayed true to their promise, maybe \"Scary Movie\" had been remembered as a jewel product of its time and not as the multi-sequel bore that is right now. 4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are a lot of reviews bashing this movie but I think if you go into the theatre with an open mind for a new movie (this sequel has a slightly different feel from the original)and don't take it too seriously (these kind of movies require no real brain use) you will crack up at some of the funniest and most extreme sight gags to grace the screen in a while. I find the opening 'exorcist' spoof to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen, more so than the rest of the movie or it's prequel. James woods does a great job (this is his least serious role I've seen him in, I'll always remember him as Max Renn) but his and Andy Richter's characters are only in the opening sequence. The most memorable characters from the original return, although most of them died in the first one, but in this movie they are more than the simple straight copy from another character in a scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. In this movie the characters, being in a completely different spoof, have more of an identity. With this sequel being pretty much as gross and extreme as the original (I was just glad ms. man didn't return) it's still not for little kids, although I'm sure tons of little kids will end up seeing it anyway. The acting gives me a lot of respect for the actors and actresses, because just not every actor in a big budget Hollywood movie is willing to do such self-demeaning gross-out humor (like the Cindy character). The Wayans were lucky to find such great and willing actors/actresses because performing a lot of their jokes (in what millions of people will see) is not easy to do, and for that I give them respect. I laughed very very much when I saw this movie. One thing that may hold back a viewer's laughs: you need to have seen a LOT of movies to get most of the jokes, most importantly: The Haunting (1999), Poltergeist, Hollow Man, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Hannibal. Oh man, I thought this movie was hillarious. Best gag: The exorcist's reaction to seeing the little girl's head spin around. It is a simple and fast joke, yet it was hillarious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie 2, the second installment in the popular horror comedy franchise, attempts to satirize contemporary horror films like Hannibal, The Exorcist, and The Others, but ultimately fails to recapture the magic of the original. While there are moments of genuine humor, the film often relies on tired parodies and struggles to maintain a consistent tone, resulting in a disjointed and ultimately forgettable viewing experience.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing Scary Movie 2 is the sheer volume of horror films being released each year. The franchise, which thrived on satirizing iconic horror classics like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, now faces a daunting task of keeping up with the ever-evolving landscape of modern horror. This leads to a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as many of the parodies feel derivative and lack the originality that defined the first film.\n\nThe film attempts to tackle several popular horror franchises, including Hannibal, The Exorcist, and The Others. The spoof of Hannibal, with its over-the-top gore and absurd cannibalistic tendencies, offers some of the film's most memorable moments. The parodies of The Exorcist and The Others, while relying heavily on familiar tropes, also provide a few genuinely funny scenes. However, these moments are often overshadowed by a barrage of uninspired gags and forced humor.\n\nThe film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone. It veers wildly between slapstick humor, dark satire, and juvenile gross-out gags, often leaving the audience unsure of what to expect. This inconsistency undermines the film's comedic potential and creates a disjointed viewing experience.\n\nThe performances, while serviceable, are largely forgettable. Anna Faris, who reprises her role as Cindy Campbell, seems to be going through the motions, lacking the same energy and enthusiasm that she brought to the first film. The supporting cast, including Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, also fail to make a lasting impression.\n\nFurthermore, the film's reliance on topical humor, while relevant at the time of its release, has aged poorly. Jokes about reality TV shows and celebrity culture feel dated and fail to resonate with contemporary audiences.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, Scary Movie 2 is not without its merits. The film boasts a few genuinely funny moments, particularly in the spoof of Hannibal. The visual effects, while not always groundbreaking, are generally well-executed and contribute to the film's over-the-top aesthetic.\n\nUltimately, however, Scary Movie 2 fails to recapture the magic of the original. While it offers some laughs and a few memorable moments, the film's reliance on tired parodies, inconsistent tone, and uninspired performances ultimately undermine its comedic potential. It serves as a reminder that even the most successful franchises can eventually run out of steam.\n\nIn conclusion, Scary Movie 2, while attempting to satirize contemporary horror trends, falls short of its predecessor. The film struggles to find fresh ground and relies heavily on tired parodies, resulting in a disjointed and ultimately forgettable viewing experience. While there are moments of genuine humor, the film fails to deliver the same level of comedic brilliance that made the first film so successful, suggesting that the franchise may have finally run its course."

I don't have a whole lot against Tori Spelling, but why was she even in the movie. She did nothing. Well, most of the cast is wasted here. The Wayans can, and have been much funnier. Tim Curry didn't belong. Chris Elliot is usually much better and more effective, but he just wasn't. David Cross is one of the funniest people I have seen, and his comic prowess is wasted in this movie. Just avoid Scary Movie 2. Go see a decent movie for a change. 3 out of 10."

The audience to the scary movie 1 were dying of laughter which wasnt even funny the scary movie 2 audience were mute compared to the first one. So its not only me who thinks this movie is b.s.\n\nNo wonder this movie was made so fast after the first one. Its like mummy's 2 scene after scene of war gore and bore this scary movie 2 is scene after scene of comedy for 5 year olds. Wrongfully accused 5/10, scary movie 7/10, scary movie 2 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite finding the original Scary Movie an incredible disappointment I was dragged to see this much-of-the-same sequel.\n\nThe opening 10-20 minutes are actually quite funny; there are hit-and-miss moments but generally the jokes hit the spot. I found myself laughing at both the Exorcist parodies and the cringingly disgusting \"Caretaker\", and was preparing myself to be pleasantly surprised. However I should have known better and the film quickly descended into the same boring junk as the original.\n\nWhat is so infuriating about sitting and watching a film like this is how you can watch it and KNOW in yourself: \"I could write something funnier than this\". 'Spoofing' is one of the easiest forms of humour yet the writers of these Scary Movie films still seem to be able to miss the spot on so many occasions. The majority of the jokes are lame and predictable and I felt embarassed being amongst fellow adults who were laughing hysterically at the most pathetic scenes. The makers have also managed to miss many obvious comedy moments which - while being predictable - would have at least added some generally amusing moments to this weak attempt at a spoof.\n\nI was also ashamed to see the amount of scenes that had been stolen from other films. I am not talking about the parts that had been spoofed but rather the bits that had been taken straight from other COMEDY movies, such as the cat attacking Cindy (remember There's Something About Mary, anybody?). And why was this film given an 18 certificate when it was clearly designed to be enjoyed by viewers in the lower-age teen bracket?\n\nI am a young adult who enjoys 'toilet-humour' comedy films, but I did not enjoy this. It just isn't funny."

I went to see this with my best friend when it released in theater's. There were 2 other people in the theater.\n\nWhat really makes this movie so bad is the awkward scenes that draw on way too long. The movie had potential with the comically spooky plot, but the script, directing and casting ruined it.\n\nThe only two actors/actresses that make this spoof movie funny in a couple parts are Marlon Wayans and Anna Faris. Marlon Wayans is responsible for one of the most memorable scenes in spoof movies, which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen it. Anna Faris does the best she can with the script she's been given, it would have been much worth with someone else cast in her place.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm an Anna Faris fan, but this movie almost killed the franchise for me.\n\nSome of what was supposed to be funny, instead made me completely uncomfortable as with anyone else I watched it with.\n\nI rate this a 2/10 because of two funny scenes that prevented the movie from being completely boring and not watchable. Scary Movie 3 saves the franchise from extinction in my opinion. The first Scary Movie was quite good for its time in my opinion as well.\n\nI hated Scary Movie 4, but Scary Movie 5 was a a lot more funny as a spoof movie than I expected.\n\nPlease remember that the Scary Movie series is a collection of spoofs, not parodies. Movies like this are designed to be completely unrealistic. Spoofs are comedic copies of other movies.\n\nScary Movie 2 almost has nothing to do with the rest of the series, so I'd suggest skipping it in the series entirely. Scary Movie 4 also has nothing to do with Scary Movie 5, but its a lot more watchable at a 5/10 in my opinion, so the choice is yours."

A box office take that large will only encourage more ill-conceived sequels. And dare I say it...a second sequel to Scary Movie! I can only hope that will not come to fruition and if it is made people will not see it.

As you may have guessed the gross out humor was piled on pretty darn heavy and many times it just looked idiotic. There really is no plot or story to speak of, the movie just runs from parody to parody (some good, some painful to watch.)\n\nThere were, thankfully, some good parts to this movie. Kathleen Robertson, first of all, is just gorgeous. Christopher Masterson \"blew up\" (see the freezer scene, you'll understand) in the role of Buddy in my opinion. Some of the parodies were good, (\"The Exorcist\", \"Charlie's Angels\") but not quite on par with other spoof movies like \"Hot Shots\" or, another Keenan Ivory Wayans project, \"Don't Be A Menace.\" Marlon Wayans was good at times as Shorty, but overdid it in spots.\n\nThere were terrible parts also. Anna Faris, for as good as she looks, can never get that same goofy look of her face the whole movie. It really gets under your skin. Chris Elliot and the part he played, Hanson, were an abomination. Shawn Wayans...oh, nevermind. Although no plot was intended, the choppiness and confusion that the storyline brings is \"nails-on-a-chalkboard\" annoying. The list goes on, but I'll spare you.\n\nSo all together, I wouldn't waste my time to see this movie. And when Scary Movie 3 comes out, I think I'll roll right on past the theater. You've been warned."

Too many scenes fall short of the necessary comedic power the first one had. The whole thing with Chris Elliot and the wheelchair guy was lame, and the dinner scene was a complete flop (and pretty stomach churning too). Nice to see Night Court's Bull Shannon back at work, though. RECOMMENDATION: If you can sneak into the theater for the first 10 minutes of the movie (the Exorcist scene w/ James Woods, Andy Richter, Natasha Lyonne & others) do that (you'll nearly wet yourself), then run away as quickly as possible from the rest of the movie. Too obviously a rush job after the success of last summer's Scary Movie."

Though there are somethings about the original which made it better. Mainly spoofing the Haunting, the plot comes very quick and doesn't seem to take long to settle. The caretaker in the house is quite creepy, though with some funny gags. A talking crass mouthed parrot is one of the highlights.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, most seem to believe Scary Movie 2 as rushed and a downgrade from the original, though one's opinion is slightly different. The same original cast is brought back with added some newer ones.\n\nScary Movie 2 does feel very short with a runtime of only 83 minutes (without end credits it's about 75 minutes), so everything that happens is crucial.\n\nAs a rewatch 04/07/23' and watching this sequel almost directly after rewatching the original. Can see as to how the original Scary Movie is better than this sequel. This film isn't as funny, witty or clever in its jokes. The supporting cast aren't as great as the characters from the original. The plot is weaker and not as suspenseful or overall enjoyable. Still some solid moments and the film is relatively short. Rating changed from 4 to 3."

As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs \"Charlie's Angels\", \"House on Haunted Hill\", \"13 Ghosts\", \"Paulie\", \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" and \"The Poltergeist\". One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song \"Graduation\" and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!"

Cross and Elliot are beyond funny and Keenan Ivory Wayans shows that he still has his finger on the pulse of what is funny. Let me get this straight, people paid to see this so they could see the trailer for \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\"? This was much funnier than that Kevin Smith piece of nonsense."

The Wayans Brothers have been funny since In Living Color and they continue the tradition with this movie. If you enjoy laughing and are like stupid, silly humor, see it in the theater. If you enjoy laughing, rent it when ti comes out on video."

        "review_detailed_main": ".. Although, it was to be expected. The same goes for this movie being made. The poster for Scary Movie reads \"..No sequel.\" but it was bound to happen given it's opening gross. Even though the sequel offers the same crude humor and cringe worthy moments it doesn't make it a bad film. If you've seen the first you know what to expect, so you have the option to ignore Scary Movie 2.\n\nI found the only thing dissapointing about Scary Movie 2 was the deleted scenes on the DVD. In my opinion they were the funniest, and unfortunately, Regina Hall appears in them all. I felt her role in Scary Movie 2 was much smaller than it was in the first film and her best moments were cut. Anna Faris and Tori Spelling also had classic moments erased which would've made the film less similar to the first.\n\nOverall the movie doesn't dissapoint as long as you know what you're in for. If you think you're about to see something original you're kidding yourself. The fact that it's a sequel didn't do it any favours, but it delivers just what you'd expect.... whether you enjoy it, or not."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scary Movie 2 was by far just as funny as the first. Most sequels never live up to their predecessors. However, a parody such as this one exceeded all expectations I had. It definitely kept me laughing. This film not only poked fun at horror flicks (new and old) but also other comedy and action flicks from the recent years-much like the first did. The kids this time (minus Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro, and Jon Abrahams characters) gather with some new friends and are tricked by their professor into spending the night in a haunted house (sounds like The Haunting, right?). This scenario in itself is destined to be humorous. Don't try to look for meaning in the opening Exorcist parody scene. There isn't any. It's just there mainly there for added comedy. If you are looking for a good, rolling on the floor laugh, Scary Movie 2 is the summer movie to see."

The only problem is it ends too soon."

Classic honestly it may be a bit sloppy but the comedy scenes are pure gold I laughed tell I cried in certain scenes. And even though there is no love for doofy, I still love this film. The best late night comedy. An hour and a half of almost non stop dumb humour, cheesy plot, and mediocre acting, but I wouldn't have it any other way."

Collen Ann Fitzpatrick) and Collen tells her to shut up on the radio. But, aside the sexual gags and gross humor, other than that, it was a great movie.

Shawn Wayans was hillarious as not gay Ray. Marlon Wayans as Shorty was also a blast. Every scene he was in he was funny. Regina Hall i just couldnt get enough of she was the funniest girl in the movie behind Tori and i just loved her. Natasha Lyonne was very good as Jasonia. James Woods was funny as the preist. And Andy Ricter was funny too. The movie spoofed everything which was also funny. Not a momment in the film did i not laugh.

It has the bad jokes out-numbering the good ones, some missing jokes they could have done but didn't and some jokes that lasted too long (the scene with the basketball). The sex jokes are seemingly toned down as are the body fluid jokes, but then they must have used up most of them in the first movie. The Excorcist/Amityville Horror spoof at the top of the movie was funny, almost a rip-off from Repossessed with Linda Blair, but it may have done a lot more damage to the Catholic church than the series Dave Allen at Large. Anna Faris is as cute as always, but she is embarrassing herself in some of the scenes. Calling her animal fighting moves for one and in her spoof of the cat fight scene from the Legend of Hell House are two examples. Kathleen Robertson is an obvious sexpot, but Tori Spelling ruins every scene she is in. Annoyingly grating as a middle-aged college student, she just doesn't belong in this movie. Regina Hall, Shawn and Marlon Wayans steal every scene they are in, and Chris Elliott and Tim Curry show the more tolerable range of their talents. The disability jokes between Elliott and David Cross are a bit tactless and tasteless and Chris Masterson is funny to watch in this full feature away from his role as a Malcom in the Middle second stringer. For me, the ghost effects are superb even if some of the simulated phenomenon was too over the top. I am definitely waiting for a Scary Movie 3; I only wish I could star in it too !"

This time around, they're making fun of ghost films. This is why there isn't as much gore and gross out jokes. The ghost films simply didn't have that in them originally, so there's no reason to have them in this film.\n\nThose people who hated this movie should just shut up and let those who liked it write reviews. Cuz this film is as good as the original, and better."

The new incarnation, while keeping the same sort of gross-out humor, remains fresh and interesting through its entirety. However much though that Scary Movie 2 is a comedy, it's a twice as good parody. Instead of attacking the slash movie genre however, Scary Movie 2 goes for the heart of horror movies such as, The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill, and The Exorcist. The Exorcist provides one of the best parodies in the film's opening segment. While Scary Movie 2 isn't the best movie to see for cinematography or art direction (see A.I.), it does however provide a good laugh for teenagers and teenagers at heart."

I will admit there is a few moments that are to stupid but that is no way enough to stop me from giving this a 9. I am just going to give you an idea of how many things I can think of off the top of my head that are hysterical. Firstly the Exorcist scene, the red dress scene, the wheel chair V hand scene, the I.T the clown scene, Sydney escaping form the panic room scene, the Hannibal scene and like I said that is off the top of my head. I think who ever watches this knows they aren't going to get a well written masterpiece but this is a simple story filled with so many good jokes that it is worthy of much higher than 4.9. I can honestly say I have watched this about 12 times and still laugh at all the best one's. Just give it a try, I think its the best out of the whole series. The 1st one is good, this 2nd one is brilliant, the 3rd one is good but the 4th one is a let down (apart from the Tom Crusie scene at the end, that is genius)."

I couldn't stop laughing, and I rarely laugh hard at movies. I could tell everyone in the theater liked it, too! I suggest you should see this movie over the horrible comedies that are out. It was refreshing to see a movie that I was dying to see live up to my expectations and then some, especially since I've had a lot of disappointments this summer w/ movies( Pearl Harbor, Swordfish,Evolution and tomb raider)go see."

There is nothing intellectual or taxing about this film. It simply mocks everything in it's path including itself from beginning to end. I would recommend this film to any member of my family including the elderly and infirm. If you love movies and haven't got your head stuck in some sad politically correct mire go and see it.

This is just their way of making fun of movies that lack continuity.\n\nOverall, it was a great movie (a \"10\"), just not as good as the first. It was definitely better than any other movie out recently.\n\nIf you enjoy movies that portray unrealistic circumstances and (extreme) humour (i.e., the Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc. movies), then this one is for you. If you are wanting to see a drama with character development, then look elsewhere.\n\nFor those of you who are concerned, there's more than enough pea-soup vomit for everyone! Way-to-go James Woods!"

Anna Farris is a goddess in this film, she is so hot, not to mention a great actress(really? Why hasnt she been in more mainstream films?).\n\nSure there is a choppiness to the film, and not all the jokes work, but this is still better then half the crappy comedies out there. And like I said before, better then the immensly lame, first film."
