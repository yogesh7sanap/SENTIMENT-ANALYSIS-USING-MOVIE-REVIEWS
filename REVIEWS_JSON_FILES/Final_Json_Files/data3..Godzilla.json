It's still not a great Godzilla movie, at least not how I quantify that, but it is an enjoyable \"big monster movie\" on its own merits. The special effects are great, the action is pretty well staged, and the music is surprisingly nice. The only real problems for me are that the cast is a little too goofy at times (I think they were going for some kind of Jurassic Park humorous/serious blend) and the movie does run a little long. Overall, though, I think it's an entertaining movie that deserves a second look."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Flash Review)\n\nStarting off relatively well, this turns into Jurassic Park as it felt like a dinosaur chase movie rather than focused on the mythical Godzilla. This new Godzilla also doesn't hold true to many of the original's traits such as what it eats and how it can be killed. Now on American soil of course Godzilla ravages Manhattan while the military try to take him down as they create a ton of (needless) damage. The media desperately looking for the inside scoop also create their own damage by stirring mass hysteria. One special scientist learns Godzilla is pregnant and warns that it's nest of eggs must be found to avoid hatching more of these beasts. As expected, this is full of explosions, destruction, roars, human ineptitude, light romance and heroics. Your typical Hollywood CGI fluff action monster movie with some notable plot holes."

Is the script weak? Yes it is rather. Is the direction unfocused? I think so, but it is Roland Emmerich, a director I never found particularly good anyway, that said I actually think it is one of his better directing jobs here. Is the acting bad? Sort of and sort of not. Matthew Broderick is very bland, and his character is poor, same with the female lead whose acting style doesn't belong but Harry Shearer is fun and Jean Reno is surprisingly dignified.\n\nI did love the idea of Godzilla though. There may be the odd hole here and there, but thanks to a quite riveting final half hour especially it remains interesting. The scenery is splendid, the editing is good enough, some sequences are entertaining and Godzilla while different is very well designed. The score is also memorable. And while there are flaws to Godzilla, I couldn't help being entertained. This film isn't Emmerich's best, but contrary to what others might say I don't think it is his worst either. Overall, it has a lot of problems, but I kind of liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

It has pretty good special effects, nice pacing and some good action sequences involving Godzilla himself. Well its not entirely a Godzilla everyone knows, its more of a dinosaur but still its a good looking creature, especially when it interacts with environment (city buildings in this case). The downsides of this movie were pretty lame script at the moments, zero chemistry between Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitillo (and her poor performance as well) and just the look of this movie - literally almost all movie time action takes place at night, sure because its much more easier (and cheaper) to make all the big special effects sequences in a bloody dark, but not so much fun to watch it.\n\nOverall, \"Godzilla\" is a guilty pleasure. As a pure fun flick it does its job, nothing else and nothing more. A pure guilty pleasure."

However, it would be unfair to consider this movie a bad movie. Instead one can view this English version of the relatively more cheesy 1950s Japanese \"Godzilla\" movies with Jurassic Park overtones as entertaining, blockbuster-like. It attempts along with Broderik's own wonderful personality to insert a fairly large dose of comic humor throughout the movie. Yet the balance between comedy, drama, and horror is more uneven than the best of these monster movies. There a bit more gore than the typical Jurassic Park movies, but not necessarily over the top considering how gory movies have become. There are also lapses in rational or logical chase scenes were Godzilla seems to speed away from helicopters but can't catch up to a speeding taxicab. The attempt to create a somewhat sympathetic monster is also intriguing though it wasn't completely successful in pulling it off. Overall, this is a feel-good action monster movie that could have been better, but it wasn't nearly as awful as the dollar numbers indicate."

Of course, the monster soon makes his way to The Big Apple and all heck breaks lose. If that weren't enough, it also has ridiculous subplots with an ex-girlfriend and some French secretive group(I was in the bathroom when they first met). Sound stupid? It gets worse.\n\nThis movie could have been semi-decent if the acting was. Instead we're treated to the worst mauling of a screenplay(that's not too great to begin with) that I have ever seen. Broderick did not say one line convincingly, and, on top of that, never said one line as it SHOULD HAVE been said. He doesn't get excited, scared, happy, just one emotionless goop. But, well, Matt Broderick deserves an Oscar compared to the horrific acting of his girlfriend. I kept on wondering if they wandered the streets looking for the first pretty girl they saw and then asking her to be in a movie. If you want some laughs, rent the movie, watch the scenes with her, and fast forward to the end when she says \"I quit!\" as wrong as she possibly could have made the line. Oh yeah, the acting of the quintessential geeky photographer and the best friend plain suck too. Overall, don't waste one cent of your money on this trash."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1954 Japanese classic film Godzilla is very good as a horror film and a fun movie, which was thankfully recently given Criterion treatment. Alas, in the West the film has not always been available in its true form. In 1956 it was butchered thoroughly, massively edited and manipulated into Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, a goofy movie in badly dubbed English. If that weren't enough, in 1998 the Americans decided to butcher Godzilla again, with a movie about as bad- Godzilla, by the makers of the smash hit Independence Day (1996).\n\nBecause of my love of Independence Day as a youth, when I saw Godzilla '98 in theatres I assumed I had to like it, and tried to convince myself it was a good movie, much as with Batman and Robin the year before. Time has made me realize how much of that was self-deception, however. Godzilla '98 is loud and often stupid, and the action scenes never really blew me away. Most of the damage to New York City in the film is done not by Godzilla but by the army trying to kill the creature. The moments of comic relief all fall flat (we were supposed to be rolling over laughing every time someone called Broderick \"the worm guy\"). The movie repeatedly pulls the same tricks, with people thinking they're clear of danger before Godzilla pops up suddenly again. The dialogue is often painful, as adult characters interact as if they were children (\"You were supposed to be my friend, I trusted you.\")\n\nSome parts defy logic. Why can't the military ever actually shoot Godzilla? Are we really supposed to believe Godzilla can pick up a car in his mouth and crunch on it but the car and people inside it are still functioning? The Nostalgia Critic also did a good job illustrating how the \"Babyzilla\" scenes imitate the raptor scenes in Jurassic Park (1993).\n\nAdmittedly, I still love this movie's soundtrack. \"Macy Day Parade\" by Michael Penn and \"Untitled\" by Silverchair are beautiful songs, though unfortunately they don't seem to be in the film itself, which favours \"Come With Me\" by Puff Daddy which is only sort of okay because it sounds like \"Kashmir.\" The special effects are mostly good, although we don't actually get a good look at Godzilla besides his feet. The movie also had an attractive ad campaign. One commercial showed Godzilla stepping on and destroying a tyrannosaur fossil, and that unfortunately isn't in the movie either. Ultimately, Godzilla '98 has none of the charm of the Japanese original, and is more of a clich\u00e9 Hollywood disaster movie."

Cinematically it was cutting edge (at the time), and it was entertaining. I would argue this film is the reason so many people watch/know Godzilla today. Before 1998 it was just an old monster movie mostly cult fans cared about (at least in my part of the world).\n\nI can't say it's flawless or has everything (no film does). It isn't scientifically accurate, but it's a monster/disaster film all of them are unbelievable (look at King Kong, or Planet of The Apes). It doesn't have monsters battling the whole time, quite frankly it was more believable than the newer one with mothra, and had better characters. (Not that the newer one doesn't have advantages).\n\nIn all, watch the film if you are interested, it may not be as true to the source material (I don't know, nor have I ever cared to) but so many people these days say it's bad just because that has become the expected perspective. Or maybe modern critics can only stand out by bashing formerly popular films?"

People even named this film GINO (Godzilla In Name Only). Even the Japanese poked fun at it, dubbing it as \"Zilla.\" I didn't care too much about this film after I first saw it. It is basically just another monster-on-the-loose movie; the producers just decided to borrow the \"Godzilla\" name for marque value and put the monster in its own flavor. I guess they couldn't completely imitate the original Godzilla movie.\n\nThis movie begins with the aftermath of French atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific. After the explosions, it was discovered that a gigantic monster dubbed Godzilla rose out of the water and the scientists concluded that Godzilla is an irradiated lizard created by the explosions. Godzilla then makes its way to New York and begins wreaking havoc. It's somewhat entertaining-lots of monster destruction, with the military frantically trying to save the Big Apple from the Big Guy. The atomic bomb theme is surely a homage to how the original Godzilla was created. The acting, though, was unremarkable and very campy. The Godzilla design wasn't that good - looking more like an overgrown lizard than the original Godzilla. There are also monster scenes where the filmmakers ripped off elements from Jurassic Park and Aliens - no originality. While some of the action was entertaining, the story itself is dull and boring.\n\nI personally am glad, in a way, that this movie was made because the demand for the Godzilla franchise grew in America in anticipation for the film's release, which resulted in Godzilla merchandise to be exported in America, including the release of the remaining original Godzilla sequels from Toho: Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. Toys and video games related to the King of the Monsters were in high demand, and the book \"The Official Godzilla Compendium\" was published. Everything you wanted to know about the 22 original Godzilla movies (made by the original Godzilla producer), and his foes and allies like Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah and Gigan, can be found in this book. When I bought this book in 1998, my brother (also an avid Godzilla fan) and I were ecstatic. At that time, we had not seen all the Godzilla movies and this book revealed the missing movies we haven't watch, and much more. All thanks, ironically, to the American \"Godzilla\" film.\n\nBut overall, a below average movie. If you're a hardcore Godzilla fan, stay away. If you're a general and casual fan of sci-fi action, give this a watch, but don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nGrade D"

When it's suspected that radiation from nuclear weapons testing in French Polynesia may have instead produced the monster, biological radiation specialist Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is called to the scene. While investigating the monster's path of destruction, a new sighting arrives--just off the coast of New York City!\n\nIt's no secret that Godzilla has been much maligned. Even Fangoria editor Tony Timpone stated in an editorial that he thought it sucked, and he's usually willing to give movies the benefit of the doubt. The reasons why director Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla is hated are as varied as people stating opinions. But I tend to think that there is also a strong bandwagon effect with this film that will be tempered by time. There are already signs of a number of people giving it a second look and lessening the severity of their criticism.\n\nThe chief complaint seems to come from a very vocal but relatively small crowd of fanboy purists--they dislike that Godzilla is different here. In the Japanese films, made by the Toho production company, Godzilla is a guy in a rubber suit who stomps on models of buildings and such. He tends to lumber, as irrelevant military attacks on him provide pretty fireworks. Most Godzilla films feature him fighting some other monster, \"professional wrestling\" style, and Godzilla arbitrarily falls down and gets back up as he is attacked and attacks with various \"death rays\" from his mouth, eyes, etc. Now that might sound like I don't like the typical Godzilla film, but that's not true. I like them quite a bit, but a big part of the reason why is that most of them are very cheesy. I'm a fan of bizarre cheese/camp, and you get tons of that in Godzilla films.\n\nBut I'm not a purist. To me, there's no good reason why Emmerich's Godzilla needs to be similar to the Toho incarnations, which in fact are often quite different from and inconsistent with each other, too. At this point, I see Godzilla more as a recurring character type--think of the various instantiations of Dracula or Frankenstein throughout the 20th Century. The Toho films can't really be seen as chapters in a single, long story. But whether their arguments are wrong or not, the fanboy purists are at least noisy and prolific, and too many people are followers.\n\nIf Emmerich would have given us a guy in a rubber suit, acting just like the Toho Godzillas (not \"Godzilla\"), with the typical gobbledy-gook of a Toho script, this film would have bombed even worse (if we can call a 100 million dollar film that made a profit a \"bomb\") and the fanboys would have still found something to complain about. Even though I love the Toho Godzilla films, too, we can't deny that they do not tend to be bestsellers on video in the U.S., despite the fact that they're readily available for purchase.\n\nSo what Emmerich gives us instead is an epic, expensive-looking film that spans a number of genres, features more coherent dialogue and subplots than a typical Toho Godzilla film, and showcases a redesigned, mostly cgi cast of monsters, where Godzilla looks and behaves much more like a \"real\" giant, mutant lizard. For those of us who are not purists, who do not care if our opinions match the majority, and who evaluate films on all or their technical and artistic levels, it's difficult to deny that Godzilla has many merits.\n\nFor example, the cinematography in this film is gorgeous. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack (score and songs) works well with the film. All of the action sequences, and they comprise a large percentage of the film, are expertly staged--Emmerich doesn't resort to darkness, blur-cams and overly quick cuts like many other directors. It's always easy to follow the narrative during action scenes, it's always easy to see what's going on, and it's always coherent. That goes for the non-action scenes, too--the entire film is ingeniously designed in terms of the progression from one sequence to another. Also, the cgi is amazing--it's often difficult to tell where it stops and mechanicals/models begin.\n\nBut the story is great, too. Broderick's Tatopoulos is an attractive anti-hero, a nerdish scientist who solve dilemmas with his professional knowledge. The other hero is Jean Reno as Philippe Roache, a humorously enigmatic French \"insurance agent\". The obligatory romantic subplot, involving Tatopoulos and Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) surprisingly avoids clich\u00e9s, and Timmonds provides a launching pad for an all-too-honest satire of the media.\n\nSatire is high up on Emmerich's agenda. Godzilla not only satirizes the media, but the military, New York/New Yorkers, film critics, and even monster movies. While the film is simultaneously giving us a lot of genres--sci-fi, horror, adventure, war film, drama, etc. the most unexpected motif is the almost cartoonish, spoof-like humor. Godzilla is more frequently laugh-out-loud funny that anyone expected it to be. It's not just one-liners and overt jokes, although those are certainly present, but the amped up intentional absurdity of situations such as the final taxi cab \"chase\".\n\nEven if you think that Godzilla has some internal problems as an artwork (and I agree that there is a slight clunkiness in parts of the narrative flow--it caused me to subtract a point), there's no way it deserves the trashing it's received so far. This is at least a well-made film on a technical level, and if you have any taste for slightly campy sci-fi/monster flicks, you should find much to enjoy here."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many Godzilla purists rejected this CGI-based reinterpretation of the story (#23 in the series) but it is not a bad kaiju outing in its own right. The Toho release (Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, 1995) preceding Emmerich's version continued the trend toward improbable monsters, new-age subplots, and self-righteous greenery and I found the US version to be a refreshing return to the original concept: humanity vs. a single, destructive monster born of radiation. Typical of Emmerich's unsubtle style, everything is very big (Godzilla) or very numerous (e.g. helicopters) and the human drama of the 1954 original, which treats the monster's destructive rampage more as a tragedy than an adventure, is replaced by light-weight shtick, primarily revolving around the Roger Ebert-lookalike mayor (apparently an Emmerich in-joke). Godzilla itself is (IMO) quite well done with a very different look from the original (reflecting 'iguana' rather than 'dinosaur' origins) and the production has fun with the sheer scale of the monster. The opening credit scenes, which establish Godzilla's genesis, are extremely good and the film builds well from there to the arrival of the monster on the shores of Manhattan Island. The cast is fine: Mathew Broderick's playing the scientist who seems to always guess correctly and Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria as intrepid reporters (both tropes familiar to anyone who has watched the Japanese films). Jean Reno is great as the French secret-service agent trying to ensure that the role France's nuclear tests in creating the current disaster remains unknown and he (and his team) have best lines in the film, riffing on both Gallic unflappability and the challenges of running a clandestine operation in America. Within the context of the film, a general plausibility is maintained (other than reconciling Godzilla's size and its ability to fit in the New York subway system) until the 'third act', an overdone and ridiculous chase scene that is by far the weakest part of the film. Future Japanese entries in the Godzilla franchise make the occasional amusing dig at Emmerich's fish-eating version of the iconic kaiju, but overall, I thought that the film (the 23 outing for the big guy) was was a worthy effort at 'Americanising' Toho's famous monster and liked the film more than most viewers (based on IMDB) and certainly more than most Godzilla-philes."

The plot was almost nonexistant, much like the original Godzilla movies. The monster Godzilla and its babies were ok, but nothing too spectacular. I was hoping a few of the main cast would be eaten or fried or something, which didn't really happen.\n\nMost of the jokes really didn't work, the story was boring, the characters were flat and annoying and the movie itself, although it had a few fair moments, was very dull.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film's legacy is that it was a gigantic misfire that was trashed by critics and hated by the fans it was trying to impress. I think a lot of people hate this movie because they think they are supposed to hate it. If you look at this movie for what it is, not what people wish it was, you will find that is one of the most expertly constructed monster movies ever made. Roland Emmerich is a master action filmmaker. The action scenes in this movie are clear, coherent, breathlessly suspenseful and exciting. Comparing Godzilla to the action films of today makes you realize the extent to which the filmmaking craft has deteriorated. So many action scenes now are a dull, sludgy CGI mess, with quick cuts and sloppy editing that render the action incoherent and weightless. This movie feels so grandly cinematic and epic in a way that movies just don't feel anymore. The lines between film and television have been blurred now, and that cinematic language has been lost.\n\nThe main criticism of this movie is that this Godzilla does not have the characteristics of his Japanese counterpart, which is true and valid. This Godzilla is not impervious to traditional weaponry, he runs and hides and uses stealth attacks instead of being a slow, lumbering wall of destruction, and his mighty atomic breath beam attack has been reduced to more of an oral flamethrower. But it is important to realize that a Godzilla movie had not been theatrically released in America for 14 years, the only way most Americans knew of Godzilla was through TV reruns and VHS tapes. He was simply not a major cultural force in America at that time. What was a major cultural force was Jurassic Park, so it makes sense that in order to create the largest draw possible, the filmmakers would reference Jurassic Park more than traditional Japanese monster movies, because that's what most audiences would be familiar with. Indeed, Godzilla and his offspring are more akin to a mutated T. Rex and raptors than to the big G himself. Also, the conception of giant movie monsters is fundamentally different in America vs Japan. In America, giant monsters are mutated animals on the loose, that cause a lot of violence before they are inevitably destroyed by military might or scientific ingenuity. In Japan, giant monsters (called kaiju) are immortal, indestructible, god-like beings. Japanese monster films operate much more in the realm of fantasy than their American counterparts. If Godzilla 1998 had gone for more of a traditional Japanese approach, wide audiences might not have understood it in the same way as they would a giant T. Rex run amok in NYC.\n\nForget expectations and cultural baggage. Watch this movie for what it is, and you will have a good time."

Some people say Godzilla is his worst film to date well let me start by saying its a hell of a lot better than either of those two. The story is Nuclear tests have happened in France and the radio activity has come of on some of the Lizards inhabiting the islands. Fast forward some twenty years and we learn that a giant dinosaur creature is attacking boats around the globe. It comes to Manhatten were it wrecks havoc and there are quite a few fun sequences along the way. Thats all I will say its vague but I hate spoiling movies. The creature looks cool indeed and 90% of the time the visual effects are of a very high standard. The story is solid if a little simple, but at least it ain't covuluted a la stargate. The acting is a mixed bag however with Hank Azaria and Jean Reno in fine form while Matthew Broderik and Maria Pitillo putting in appalling performances. Some of the characters are unnecessary and annoying such as Harry Shearers Charles Caimen and some of the military guys. The finale is great and the film is on a par with the previous years equally underrated The Lost World Jurassic Park. Its a good movie for kids as it never gets to scary and always remains entertaining, but it also works for adults as Saturday night entertainment. Well I enjoyed it anyway, so sit back don't take it to seriously and you to might find yourself enjoying it to"

The damsel in distress flops her way through every scene, amazing me with exactly how little energy she can have. I don't even see Godzilla until about an hour or so into the film (yes, I know, that was a marketing ploy for the commercials to make people want to see the movie, but once you're in the theater, they've kind of got you), and I'm in serious pain from the gargantuan plot holes. Godzilla leaves his/her home in the middle of the Pacific, swims through the Panama Canal and around Florida to New York because that was the most convenient place to lay eggs??? Matthew Broderick is brought to the group because he specializes in mutations caused by radiation, but when he suggests that Godzilla is perhaps (this is a shocker) an animal mutated by radiation, everyone acts shocked and thinks he's crazy! What??? This movie is just so horrible until the end, so my suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen it is to show up with only a half hour left in the movie.

The movie have a couple of side plot that goes nowhere interesting like Audrey news plotline, the French secret service, and that romance between Nick and Audrey. That romance plot have zero development to it and is rather predictable on the direction it goes. But the strongest part is the giant monster scenes. The movie itself is really enjoyable with the amount of action scenes with Godzilla and the destruction of the city. It contains great special effects and set designed of the destroyed part of the city. Even the movie is suspenseful during the Madison Garden Scene and climax.\n\nThe characters themselves are pretty generic and one-dimensional throughout. Most of them have one trait to them and lack any development towards them. The acting is poorly done on the performance of the actors.\n\nAs for Godzilla himself, he's pretty interesting on how the movie presented him. While he is nothing like the real Godzilla, I do like his design since he looks pretty cool looking and they do their best on making him feels like a different monster. Also some of the CGI doesn't look bad, but some of it does look bad.\n\nOverall I have fun watching this movie."

But this was especially bad because it was a big screen to big screen translation.\n\nGodzilla is supposed to be invincible. Not die with mere missile fires from F-16.

The story is generally interesting and I liked the characters played by Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The strange creatures look pretty real, especially Godzilla's offspring. Despite all the violence there is no blood or gore, but I still think it's way too intense for kids and should be rated \"R.\"\n\nTHE BAD - Mostly annoying lead characters, some of which are painted as unrealistically dumb (the mayor and the sergeant). Maria Pitillo, as the lead female, is especially unlikeable and I can see why she never made it in on the big screen. The action and the noise gets to be too much, wearing out the viewer after awhile. Almost all of the last 40 minutes are pure action as the dinosaurs keep coming, one after the other after the other, even when they presumed dead. The filmmakers just don't know when to stop! Some of the chase scenes are too hokey as the people would have killed for certain. There are a couple of stupid sex remarks which serve no purpose in the film and too much usage of the Lord's name in vain, which also isn't needed. Like the King Kong re-make, it's too much action."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another good work by Roland Emmerich, but the film has some problems. The cast has strengths and weaknesses. Jean Reno is fine as are the other supporting actors, but the protagonists are not quite on the scene. Broderick is often naive and does not give credibility to the viewer, hindering the involvement with his character. Pitillo is terrible making the same face and expressions in practically all his scenes. Her character relationship with Broderick's is mentioned but at no time did we hope for the two of them to be together due to the lack of chemistry between the characters. The story explains how the originally Japanese monster ends up in New York. However, in action, the film gets a little lost by not defining itself in a single genre. In my opinion the film should be treated as a great suspense / terror, with the intention of showing in fact the horror caused by the lizard in the city, through the perspective of ordinary citizens, authorities and specialists. The big problem, perhaps, was to have given little emphasis to the monster that ends up appearing in less scenes than it should and when it appears, no expectations are created in the viewer. The action scenes and effects of the film are great, especially at night, but perhaps they have been used too much, and everything that is too much harms the end result of anything, especially on the big screen. Regarding visual effects, makeup and the action scenes themselves, we can't say anything since they become even more grandiose in the hands of the competent blockbuster director Roland Emmerich, although in most of them it's all a bit surreal, especially the escape of protagonists of Madison Square Garden when they are surrounded by dozens of monster pups. It is an authentic popcorn film by Emmerich, where the viewer knows what he will find: fantastic effects, even more fantastic action scenes, with a typical script for this type of film. It certainly amuses and always deserves to be seen. But your biggest problem may be just having more fun than scaring. The action scenes without exaggeration with a greater atmosphere of suspense would be perfect, more or less in the Alien style of Ridley Scott. But be sure to watch this great movie success at least once!\n\nFilm seen on February 22, 2021."

This is TriStar buying a famous monster's name and then trying to use it to sell a totally different monster.\n\nNot that this is necessarily a bad monster. Heck, I actually LIKED the monster, even if they are just animating the Jurassic Park 'raptor' model on a macro scale, especially for the baby monsters.\n\nThe point is, this is obviously not Godzilla, not by any stretch of the imagination. They don't even take the time to explain WHY the beast is CALLED 'Godzilla' (or actually, 'Gojira', as they take enough time to make a lame joke about). The solution: don't call the movie 'Godzilla'. Give your new monster a new name and put the movie out.\n\nStill, even if they HAD done this, it would have been a pathetic movie nonetheless. The monster, interesting though it was, is a big part of this problem.\n\nGINO (Godzilla In Name Only), as the monster will hereafter be referred to, simply doesn't seem to exist. Yes, the rubber-suit Godzilla was hokey and campy, but he had some stage presence, for crying out loud. GINO is nothing but a special effect. Since it can't actually be filmed against a real background, even a campy miniature of downtown Osaka, it never gets the chance to truly interact with its environment. When your audience can't believe in your title character, your movie fails.\n\nAnother little suggestion for future filmmaking: either DO, or DON'T. I'm referring here to the tacked on 'fire-breathing' scenes that appeared twice in the version I saw.\n\nBeing a longtime Godzilla fan (the real one), I was involved in several discussion groups and online lists while this movie was in production. One of the questions that kept recurring was, 'Does the new Godzilla breathe fire?' The answer we finally got from the source was 'No, it does not,' but they didn't have the guts to stick by that. In a pathetic attempt to win the true Godzilla fans over, they spliced in two post-production scenes of Gino bending low over burning debris and apparently just exhaling forcefully enough to LOOK like it was breathing fire. Bad, bad choice.\n\nSpeaking of bad, bad, how about that dialogue? How hard IS it to pronounce 'Tatopoulis', anyway? It's a FOUR-SYLLABLE-NAME. It's not even a remotely challenging Greek surname, so the attempt to make a running gag out of it falls as flat as the acting itself.\n\nThis movie can't be fairly compared to the Toho Godzilla series, because the two are totally different. Apples and oranges, as the saying goes. However, taken on its own merits, TriStar's 'Godzilla' is still pathetic."

The reasons for their discontent were multitudinous: it was an Americanised version of a Japanese creation; the new creature design barely resembled the original; the creature changed size throughout the film; there was an over-reliance on CGI; the acting was poor (particularly from Maria Pitiful... sorry, I mean Maria Pitillo); the film turned into Jurassic Park halfway through.\n\nAdmittedly, many of these complaints held some degree of water, but what many people neglected to mention was that, despite all of these things, the film was also hugely entertaining\u2014chock full of top notch special effects and spectacular action sequences. Even though, at a whopping 133 minutes, the film is unnecessarily long, I don't think I could ever tire of a huge, mutated lizard stomping Manhattan and have no hesitation in recommending this film to anyone who enjoys big-budget creature features. Sure, it may be dumb, but it's also a lot of fun."

I can never hate this film because it was the film that introduced me to the king of the monsters, even though it tried to be but failed. I understand what everyone says but I feel like its my duty to try to defend this film. I'm not gonna act like its a masterpiece, its not, but it is entertaining. Is it a Godzilla film? yes. Is it good? It's watchable to say the least. Does it stand as a great Godzilla film? no. It's far from perfect but not to the point where its God awful. So I don't think its right to hate this film. I've seen plenty of other Godzilla films like Gojira 1954, Godzilla vs King Ghidorah, Godzilla Tokyo SOS, Final Wars, and when it comes out on theaters, Godzilla 2014 :3 If someone told me to write down the names of all the Godzilla films I've seen, I'd add Godzilla 1998."

Have you ever wondered what was holding up that suspension bridge when the cables snapped and were tangled around Godzilla? How the car wasn't crushed in his mouth? How that high voltage cable happened to be in reach and remain there long enough to be grabbed?\n\nThat aside, I also hated the 'heroine'. There was this attractive, interesting redheaded scientist available but the hero winds up with a woman whose only gutsy action was to selfishly and foolishly steal a tape? Argh!\n\nA last criticism would have to be that HELLISH music playing while the end credits rolled. It had nothing to do with the movie and was nothing but low brow street rap. What were they trying to do - clear the theatre as fast as possible?\n\nOddly, the effects make this movie somehow enhoyable to watch, problems aside. I just wish the creators didn't have to give us such dumbed down trash to go along with all that eye candy."

How could they not see their blunder and correct it by feeding Audrey to Godzilla at the end? I have never been to a movie wherein I eagerly joined audience members chanting \"EAT HER!\" We were disappointed.\n\nAnd why, I wonder, did they think it was a good idea to name 4 or 5 of the French characters \"Jean-_____\"?\n\nA recommendation to any aspiring directors: make sure the annoying characters get eaten, and if you really insist on naming 80% of your French characters Jean-something, at least have them laugh at themselves for it IN the movie - don't just hope people will notice and think its funny, because they won't."

True, there were some rare occasions where the monster looked almost as campy as the old Japanese movies, but overall, I'd put them just under Jurassic Park. From the first half-hour onward, until the credits rolled, the whole movie seemed to be one gigantic climatic scene, leaving my heart beating almost twice as fast as when I first sat down to watch it.\n\nSecond: the plot (& sub-plots). The plot going on through the entire movie of the three friends and Matthew Broderick, as well as the whole deal with the news station, really killed the plot for me. It seemed that Maria Pitillo was just whining the entire movie. Her character was a complete waste of film. The movie should have concentrated on the team containing Broderick and Vicky Lewis, whose character could have been evolved much more than was.\n\nHank Azaria was good in his role, and Jean Reno was great, although the sub-plot with the French really could have been smoothed over and explained in more detail; it stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, the entire Madison Garden scene seemed to be ripped off from Jurassic Park, however it probably was the most intense scene in the whole movie.\n\nAnd how could we forget pudgy Mayor Ebert and his bald friend Gene. What was with that? Probably the single stupidest thing in the whole movie. The only reason I could see for putting them in here is to garner points with Siskel and Ebert. Terrible idea.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the movie, but it could have been improved immensely by revamping and/or removing some or all of the subplots. Let's hope they fix their plot problems in the sequel.\n\nOut of 10, I give it a 7."

        "review_detailed_main": "Plot A large reptile mutated by French nuclear tests in the Polynesian Islands goes on vacation in NYC.\n\nWhat I Liked Matthew Broderick (playing Nick Tatopoulos) adds another genre to his list of acting credits (following War Games, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Biloxi Blues, etc.) and takes on the role of the disrespected scientist who knows all about radiation effects on all creatures great and small because he has been studying mutated worms in Chernobyl. The special effects are pretty good (covering underground, undersea, heart of NYC, etc.), and there is something somewhat more menacing about this big dumb creature than the smaller but far more intelligent raptors from Jurassic Park. And the scene at the start where three fishing trawlers are destroyed is far more interesting than anything seen during the sinking of James Cameron's Titanic (with the possible exception of the propeller guy). Although this movie is not an actor's dream, Matthew Broderick does a good job and seems more comfortable in front of the camera than usual. Jean Reno (playing outside \"investigator\" Philippe Roche) is the best of the supporting actors and he steals a couple of really good scenes. Hank Azaria (of sitcom fame like Herman's Head) is surprisingly good as cameraman Animal.\n\nWhat I Didn't Like The sub-storyline is Nick's reunion with his college sweetheart Audrey Timmonds (played by Maria Pitillo) -- an aspiring reporter who left him after college to tackle New York and who really wants this story as her big break. Standard fluff for the movie and no real sparks between the two of them -- more like old friends running into each other on the street. Pitillo is poor generally, with some really bad lines and some really terrible scenes where she's trying (but failing) to act upset. Other times you almost even care what happens to her -- almost, but not quite. One downside to the special effects is common in many movies of this type...most of the action takes place at night -- in fact, there is not one single shot of the creature in good light and the efforts to stop him are hampered by the fact that it rains the entire \"week\"."

There is NO Godzilla to be seen in the whole movie, thus I cannot imagine the title of the film...Mr Emmerich must have read the wrong script... Well, I admit that some of the sound FX were really good, but this doesn't make a film. I waited for nearly two hours to see any Godzilla - but none did appear. The visual effects can be seen in all earlier Emmerich films combined with Titanic. Nothing new. Just boring. OK, now some facts: if you compare Emmerich's budget (about 120 million U$?) to the cost of ALL JAPANESE GOJIRA-FILMS TOGETHER, you will see, that it is less than his. But each of the original films is indescribably better than this DINO-movie... I don't like it a bit. And, as true Godzilla fan (I've seen nearly all of the films more than once), I hope that Toho Inc. will never again give the film rights away to Hollywood or anywhere else than Japan.\n\nBut the worst message was that there could be some more movies done by Emmerich dealing with Godzilla.

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1998 adaptation of \"Godzilla,\" directed by Roland Emmerich, is an ambitious attempt to bring the iconic Japanese monster to American audiences. While it makes a commendable effort with its special effects and scale, the film falls short of expectations in crucial areas.\n\nThe strength of \"Godzilla\" lies in its impressive visuals and action sequences. The creature design, although drastically different from the classic Godzilla, is detailed and appropriately enormous, and Manhattan's destruction is convincingly portrayed. The sheer spectacle of Godzilla stomping through the city, combined with some thrilling chase scenes, provides several moments of popcorn entertainment.\n\nHowever, the film's narrative and character development leave much to be desired. The plot is formulaic and offers little in the way of surprises or deep engagement. The character arcs are similarly thin, and despite a competent cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, and Maria Pitillo, the human characters often feel underdeveloped and unengaging.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring issue with \"Godzilla\" (1998) is its deviation from the source material. In trying to reinvent Godzilla, the filmmakers largely abandoned the allegorical roots that made the original Godzilla films resonate. This Godzilla is more a mindless animal than a symbol of nuclear destruction, and the film as a whole lacks the depth and thematic resonance of its predecessors.\n\nThe film's pacing also suffers from its bloated runtime. At over two hours, \"Godzilla\" often feels like it drags, with not enough substance to justify its length. Despite several exciting set pieces, the action is too often interrupted by lengthy stretches of dialogue and subplot that don't add much to the overall experience.\n\nIn summary, \"Godzilla\" (1998) is a spectacle-filled but ultimately hollow take on a beloved franchise. While it delivers in terms of action and visual effects, it misses the mark in terms of character development, plot, and thematic depth. It's worth watching for fans of monster movies and 90s special effects, but those seeking a faithful and thoughtful Godzilla adaptation may want to look elsewhere."

Would be redundant. Suffice to say, it is one of the most catastrophic bombs since the dropping of \"Little Boy\". With apologies to the Japanese people for making what surely seems like a callous comparison to the actual devastation on Hiroshima; I hope the knowledge that in someway this could be seen as an indirect and small form of vengeance, gives some comfort to someone, somewhere, because it certainly offers none in its viewing.\n\nIf you choose to witness this horror, you should do so knowing full well that it would be easy for anyone to classify such an act as a masochistic one and the humiliation you will feel afterwords may not be of the type you can live with the rest of your life. Take it from someone who actually shelled out money to see this,if the monster could actually defecate, this film would be about the size of it.

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1998, Godzilla got an American make-over by \"Independence Day\" director Roland Emmerich and audiences haven't stopped complaining since. Rather than make the atypical Godzilla film, Emmerich and his co-conspirator Dean Devlin took the \"Jurassic Park\" approach and turned the mega-monster into a really, really big T-Rex and instead of using aliens, bad weather or the apocalypse as an excuse to destroy a city, decided it would be best to watch the beast all but devour Manhattan. In the rain.\n\nThe first thing that will likely hit you upon your first viewing of \"Godzilla\" is \"well, that wasn't so bad,\" but then you come to the ultimate conclusion that, well, it wasn't as good as it could have been, either. Emmerich, who surely knows how to turn out an entertaining popcorn flick (often at the expense of logic and character development) puts on a good show here, with solid special effects, fun chase scenes and lots of lots of destruction. Matthew Broderick takes the lead as a scientist brought in by the military to try and tame the savage beast. For the most part, the film works, but where it really falls apart is in some of its atrocious acting (Maria Patillo, I'm looking at you) drawn-out plot and it's seemingy endless series of endings. Seriously, the movie feels like it's over once it hits the hour and fifty minute mark, but intead overstays its welcome by becoming more ridiculous by the moment and not knowing when to stop.\n\nPerhaps a better editor could have tightened up the film and made it more enjoyable to the end. Hell, one can't imagine why Columbia Tri-Star didn't step in and take it down a notch, when most other studios are all too eager to trim big and bloated block-busters. Given the time and the patience, and with the right mindset (more specifically -- the mindset that is earned by checking your brain at the door) \"Godzilla\" is an overall entertaining film with its redeeming moments, but is perhaps one that could never live up to all the hype.\n\nOn a side note, the film's famous ad-campaign featured the tagline: \"Size Does Matter.\" Well, in spite of the innuendo, the film certainly supports that theory by proving that a film too big and too long simply doesn't cut it."

The first time I watched it though was when I was around four years young. It was one of the first, as I called it then, scary movies I watched.\n\nI actually will never find the strength to call this film horrible, even though my opinions on it have of course lowered a lot over time, because I watched it when I was so little, and I thought it was the best movie ever. This film is still really enjoyable, because it's value doesn't decrease as much as the person who watches it entertainment does, but it still sickens me to know it has such a low rating and many look down on it, while really it should receive more appreciation.\n\nI might have lowered my opinions on this film, but it is still a pleasing film that does not deserve the rating it has. I didn't see much of anything wrong with it, even now, and I just thought it was suspenseful and exciting, somewhat more suspenseful than a lot of other movies that have been made, with a lot of fun performances and excellent CGI. Godzilla, yet classified as a horror\\suspense, was actually a touching film and was sad in some parts, as well. I will never understand how someone could hate a film that's just meant to be all around fun and enjoyment. It is still my favorite out of the original and newest remake.\n\nTwo thumbs up for Godzilla."

But when word got around, it's no surprise that it was quickly forgotten (or at the very least, people TRIED to forget it). The story is a carbon copy of thousands of past movies, the characters are one dimensional cardboard cut outs, the dialogue is completly ludicrous, and the special effects aren't very special. There are only two, slightly original elements of this story: Godzilla shows up in NYC, and it's pregnant. Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season. Avoid this one if at all possible and rent the original instead; at least its camp is somewhat entertaining, while the remake just disappoints."

        "review_detailed_main": "It had to happen eventually. 44 years after the original the Americans have to bastardize the Japanese classic. Well the results are here, and they are not looking good. The story is simple, all you really need to know is what you expect. Godzilla comes, he destroys, people fight, they die, eventually they defeat the creature. Well simplicity isn't the problem. Stupidity isn't either. Don't get me wrong, the film is stupid, but what do you expect from Roland Emmerich and his pals. I am not going to talk about how the people manage to lose a 400 foot tall creature several times, and I am not going to talk about how he changes sizes throughout the film. Stuff like this is to be expected. The Japanese movies commit atrocities just as bad as this.\n\nWhat I am here to talk about is the shere boredom induced by this movie that the Japanese movies never brought about. The film is over 2 hours long, and throughout the only mildly entertaining scenes are the first time the creature shows himself and the car chase that concludes the film. There is a certain visual wowness factor at watching Godzilla tear his way through the city, but it wears away quickly. It was more effective on me when I first saw it when it came out when I had just turned six. I mean seriously, this movie is over 2 hours long and Godzilla is only on screen for about 15 minutes. Something is wrong with that. I mean really, did they expect us to be entertained by the idiot humans and their pointless talking.\n\nThe comedy is lame and so is everything else. We don't care about these humans and would rather Godzilla just kill them right of the bat. The movie also wastes a full 45 minutes dealing with Godzilla's children in a blatant Jurassic Park rip-off. It is yawn-inducing, as is most of the film. This film is a dull experience, from beginning to end, only occasionally resulting in some fun, but it is not nearly enough for a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of course most blockbuster are 'dumb' and over-the-top movies, with a simple and silly story and shallow characters. \"Godzilla\" however really pushes it at times. The movie is at times insulting to our intelligence and the story and storytelling is heavily lacking. Still \"Godzilla\" does what it's supposed to do; It brings more than enough entertainment to have a pleasant evening.\n\nThe movie has almost totally nothing to do with the Japanese versions of Godzilla (or better said; Gojira.). It has a totally different atmosphere, feeling and approach. \"Godzilla\" is a very Hollywoodized version of the well known Japanese creature. No wonder most of the fans of the Japanese movies were extremely disappointing with this movie and perhaps even mad. Still, if you have to judge the movie for what it is, you still come to the conclusion that \"Godzilla\" has an entertainment value.\n\nIt's too bad that the story and storytelling of it in the movie are so weak. The movie is incredibly simple and the movie lacks some fundamental things, a movie of this proportion needs. The movie lacks a real good and likable main character and exciting memorable scene's. Sure there are action-sequences in the movie but it honestly isn't something that we haven't already seen before. The movie lacks a real feeling of danger and panic. I mean, hello there's a giant lizard walking loose in New York, causing mayhem but yet nobody is busy surviving or is in real panic. Some of the elements in the movie are unbelievably bad and insulting to the viewer's its intelligence. It's just all too simple to leave a real lasting impression. Also the dialog is just plain bad at times.\n\nThe special effects are good. Seriously, come on what is everybody complaining about? The special effects are convincing, especially considering that this is a 1998 movie. Yes, the movie is made deliberately dark and rainy to conceal the fact that the special effects aren't that advanced yet but hey it works doesn't it? It might not all impress very much but it's all very convincing looking.\n\nRoland Emmerich certainly isn't a bad blockbuster movie-maker but he really pushed it with this movie at times. There are still some good and entertaining moments in the movie which all still makes this movie a very watchable one. Also the musical score from action-movie composer David Arnold is quite good.\n\nGood enough entertainment, that perhaps deserves just a little bit more credit than it's getting right now at the moment.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Hell, I didn't even go see this movie at the theater. I just watched it at home when my brother got it for Christmas (no idea why he would want it).\n\nInstead of a huge, vicious T.Rex-Stegasaurus combo destroying a major city without much effort, we have a cowardly iguana hiding in New York City! Instead of Godzilla destroying an entire army, we have this big iguana running in terror from a few friggin' helicopters! Instead of an indestructible terror, this big iguana is killed by a few measly helicopters. This ripoff from Jurassic Park does less damage to New York City than the armed forces do! Oh, and lets not forget about the baby iguana-zillas, a blatant ripoff of the Jurassic Park raptors.\n\nMy rating for this movie is 0.5 out of 10. What a horrible movie! Toho probably made Godzilla 2000 just to repair the damage caused by this poor excuse for a Godzilla movie. Hopefully, Hollywood has learned that if it isn't broke, don't fix it."

The wafer-thin plot is down there with the worst of the Japanese Godzilla films and the film is very over-length. The monsters here are computer-graphics, and it shows - they're just so bereft of character or realism. The big creature is barely visible through the grey skies and rain and its face, complete with Desperate Dan chin, makes it look comedic rather than frightening. The babies are just laughable and are quite obviously CGI graphics.\n\nA wasted opportunity. Even the badly-dubbed, atrociously-edited Godzilla '85 was better than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a huge fan of Godzilla since as far back as I can remember. I remember that every Saturday I would go to the Blockbuster Video and rent \"Godzilla vs. Gigan\" or otherwise known as \"Godzilla on Monster Island\". It was my favorite Godzilla movie for numerous reasons. Along side that, I also rented \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\", \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\", \"Godzilla 1985\", and \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\". After that, as the Internet was growing increasing popular and easier to use (this was just about four years ago), I would often go to different web sites and basically catalog anything I could get about Godzilla and every single other monster that the \"Big Guy\" has ever been affiliated with. Then, during one of my usual cataloging sessions, I somehow came across an advertisement for the new Americanized version of \"Godzilla\". I automatically knew that this was going to be good. I also knew that since this was coming from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin whose two previous films \"Universal Soldier\" and \"Independence Day\" I was a fan of. The movie was also going to star Matthew Broderick, who I had been a very big fan of since \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". Anyway, I eagerly waited for that special day (May 19, 1998) to come. Finally, the big day came and I went to see it. Boy I was blown away by this masterpiece. It had everything I expected from it: action, more action, and the brand new \"Godzilla\". I came out of that movie theater a very proud customer. During this films run at the movie theaters, I saw \"Godzilla\" a total of six times, each time getting better and better. Also during this time, I grabbed up every single piece of literature about the movie as I could get as well as the films soundtrack, which featured music from P. Diddy (who people need to just back up off of) and The Wallflowers. I even bought the action figures (only the Godzilla and his offspring, forgot the human action figures). Then I patiently waited for the VHS to be released. That day came and I got the VHS. It was just as good as it was in the theater.\n\nBut that was then (1998) and this is now (2002). That is four long years and believe me, a lot happened during this time\n\nI've recently and very carefully looked back at those years (1990-1998) and I wonder, \"what happened?\" You must also remember that this is coming from a DIE HARD Godzilla fan. Ever since all the hype from this movie died, I feel so did a piece of my childhood (I'm only 16). I've been reading some of the bad and good things about this film and I feel that I agree with some of them. My readings have brought me to several of the following conclusions about this movie. My first realization is how Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have tarnished the Godzilla name. Godzilla has been one of the best things to ever happen to western audiences during the 1950s through the 1990s. Despite the hilariously bad dubbing and some corny story lines, somewhere inside, there was a lot of fun to be had and some serious topics to be discussed. Since 1954, Godzilla has basically become an icon and has stood as a testament to the post-World War II era in which nuclear testing on Pacific islands was very common. Godzilla himself, who is a product of nuclear testing, has stood as a symbol and as a constant reminder of man's tinkering with things that should not be tinkered with. Godzilla is a menace plain and simple, but somewhere in the mayhem, we saw a truly tragic creature that was only doing what it could to survive simply because of man's carelessness. This explains why Godzilla acted so fiercely towards newcomers such as King Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla, because he was defending his home. This brings me to the \"new\" Godzilla, which in the movie is nothing more than just a big lizard who eats a lot of fish. I heard that in an interview with Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, that they had attempted (and with very poor results) to make this Godzilla more like \"animalized\". This basically means that they had tried to make Godzilla seem like the animal he is: a lizard. This Godzilla only defended himself when he felt threatened, ran at the sight of the army instead of stomping them down, was vulnerable to attack (the original wasn't), and lastly, what the hell happened to his atomic blast? Oh yeah, it was the fire. The biggest difference between the two Godzillas was the whole with thing with reproduction. The old Godzilla had only one child, while this Godzilla laid eggs. What the hell? I've heard a lot of people pan this, saying that the baby Godzillas look a lot like the raptors from \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nMy second realization was the somewhat questionable casting. Matthew Broderick is arguably an obvious choice for this film. Even with his somewhat geeky looks, he does have the wit and charm of someone who could play a scientist. Jean Reno plays a French mercenary who is on assignment in New York, who is there to clean up his country?s \"mistakes\", that being Godzilla and his offspring. Jean Reno is good as a hit man like in the \"The Professional\" but not as a mercenary whose only role in this movie is to serve, as someone Matthew Broderick's character has to look to for help. Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who both regularly play characters on the animated show, \"The Simpsons\", are good as the cameraman and sleazy news anchor. My biggest problem with the both of them is that they aren't given a lot to work with in this movie. Hank Azaria seems only here as a little comic relief and Harry Shearer is only here as someone to laugh at when he gets told by Maria Pitillo's character.\n\n\"Godzilla\" is really at best, failed potential. In the hands of another action director like John Woo or someone around those lines, then maybe this movie may not have turned out to be something so bad. I mean, I really used to like this movie, but I question the motives behind it. Aside from all the recently discovered faults that I've found with this movie, I still give it a six out of ten for providing me with the entertainment that I found necessary to satisfy my interests in Godzilla.\n\nI still reflect on those days when Godzilla was my idol, my only escape from reality, and the only thing that primarily interested me. I really hate to say it, but this movie unfortunately did it for me. But, despite my newfound un-interest in Godzilla, I still have all of the information and collectibles that I gathered over the years and I occasionally look at them."

This creature does not look like Godzilla in the least, and that's not even the worst part!

        "review_detailed_main": "There are only two good things in this film, Jean Reno as the French spy, and the editing, which keeps the film moving even when the screenplay clearly does not. For these two reasons alone, it might be worth wasting some time on this, but surely for nothing else.\n\nHere are some of the bad qualities of this mess:\n\nBAD science: it is physically impossible for this lizard to have laid 200 eggs in two days.\n\nBAD history: The French are brought in to hide the fact that it was the US that did most of the nuclear testing in the Pacific.\n\nBAD politics: In a State of Emergency military response HQ, the mayor would never be present - he has no authority in such a situation; so why do the soldiers here even tolerate him?\n\nBAD story construction: Only a couple missiles to kill off a monster, but two similarly explosive torpedoes can't do the job? And how did the lizard get from Guam to NYC without any further notice - in a single day, apparently. And why? We all know Toho's Godzilla's grudge against Japan, but it's senseless for GINO to swim thousands of miles, just to sleep in a NYC subway.\n\nBAD characters: The hero is boringly monotone, in appearance as in speech; the hero's girlfriend is a real bitch and deserved stepping on - why then bring the two of them back together? Are they sadomasochists as well?\n\nBAD special effects: The color values of the skin of the big reptiles never change, despite radical variance in tone, amount, and direction of the environmental lighting of any scene. A godzillion dollars on special effects, and they make such a serious goof?! Of course these critters are phony - they look pasted on the screen.\n\nBAD in-jokes: The Siskel and Ebert gag was amusing for precisely 10 seconds - unfortunately it was repeated through-out the film. And it is overtly insulting to two critics who deserved our respect, no matter how we disagreed with them.\n\nBAD performances: Is Matthew Broderick's face capable of more than one expression? If so, I've never seen it.\n\nBAD musical score: the main theme of the film is played over and over again, until we just want some big reptile to step on the orchestra.\n\nBAD psychology: The endlessly replayed musical theme is composed to arouse sympathy for the beast, when everything else in the film makes us dislike it. The disjunction is painful.\n\nBAD timing: This film goes on and one - the eggs are introduced for no other reason than to prolong a film that desperately needs trimming.\n\nI could go on, but what's the point. Roland Emmerich needs to find something other to do with his life, he's clearly not cut out to make movies. In an interview on a featurette in the DVD release of this film, director Roland Emmerich says that he wanted to make a \"completely different\" Godzilla, the original being - according to him - out of date. Does this man suffer from brain damage? Godzilla doesn't need to be different. Godzilla is the protagonist of a popular ongoing series of films made in Japan. Beginning in 1984, the producers of these films decided they would gradually update the series to take advantage of new special effects technology. They didn't need some snotty Occidental to show them how to do this. They were gracious enough to license out the series to Americans because they know our fascination with these films. I suspect they assumed that an American entry into the series would give it new energy. Instead, their series' title was ripped-off for a remake of a completely other American film.\n\nIf you're going to make a pastiche of a famous adventure series, you had better find some way to fit your pastiche into the series as a whole. For instance there are many pastiche Sherlock Holmes stories written by authors other than Arthur Conan Doyle. Some of these stories attempt to fill in a gap in the original series - the years following Holmes' struggle with Professor Moriarity at the Reichenbach Falls, when Watson loses touch with Holmes for a few years. So a reader is permitted to imagine Holmes as having lived a whole life - no past Holmes episode is denied; no Holmes story to come is effected. The reader can thus ignore the question of authorship and concentrate on following the adventurous life of the great detective.\n\nWhile the original Godzilla series is not chronologically sequential (A few are, presumably, set in an \"alternate universe\"), they do share a remarkably consistent set of themes and subtexts. And while the appearance of Godzilla changes over the years, these changes are consistent with the notion that the monster somehow matures with every film.\n\nIt is utterly pointless, therefore, to make a Godzilla film without any Godzilla in it. It is actually insulting - to the producers of the original series and to its audience - to discard the themes that brought the audience to the original series in the first place. And it is absolutely stupid (and racist) to presume that, because you work in Hollywood rather than Tokyo, you can get away with it.\n\nSo this is not a Godzilla film - what is it really? It happens to be an over-bloated overly-rewritten remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic, \"Beast From 20,000 Fanthoms\". That film is also way better than this one; heck, while made in the '50s, even its special effects are better.\n\nAgain, if you have two hours of spare time, and you can think of nothing else to do with your life, by all means let Emmerich give your brain a visual enema with this movie. But keep the toilet-paper handy, I guarantee watching this will leave a mess to clean-up."

But there are simply too many flaws to make the entire experience enjoyable.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it's simply too dull at the start. Revealing the creature bit by bit is a classic device; unfortunately, the massive hype, endless trailers and ubiquitous merchandise utterly ruined the attempt. Nobody watching this film is in any doubt about what Godzilla is going to look like, so holding out just seems like a mean spirited way to save on the FX budget.\n\nWhile the main Godzilla FX are superb, the Godzuki raptors are inconsistent and a little blue-screenish. They also seem to be suffering from a strange disease where they can easily smash their heads through windows and steel doors, but seem unable to drag the rest of their bodies through. This gets tiresome very fast, and the other thing that drags this sequence down is that it's so obviously ripped off from Jurassic Park that it becomes painfully intrusive.\n\nAs a pet peeve, the military hardware in this movie really annoys me. Hollywood seems stuck somewhere in the 1950's as far as technology goes. Every single weapon or vehicle in this film is badly - and deliberately and wilfully - incorrect, and the continuity is shoddy: note how many times aircraft fire off their \"last\" missiles. The reason that this annoys me is that there ARE weapons that do everything the scriptwriters wanted. If they'd done TWO MINUTES of research, they could have found them. That they didn't bother to do that says a lot about how seriously they take their job. Add to that the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to invent a plausible excuse for some of the idiotic snafus (why can't the helicopters fly UP?) and it becomes plain insulting, and makes it very hard to suspend disbelief.\n\nThe actors in this film are irrelevant, and so it really doesn't matter that they range from mediocre to insipid, and that they have lines so trite that they would make a five year old blush. Honestly, it doesn't matter, so try to get over it.\n\nOn the bright side, the score is acceptable. It's blaring, but it does match the action. The sequences are well lit and shot, and there's a definite big budget feel to everything (except the cast).\n\nI really do think that this is close to being the best possible Godzilla movie that Hollywood could make. Unfortunately it's a dull, patchy, soulless, derivative, irritating snoozefest with exactly zero unexpected scenes or twists. It's the perfect example of how to make a zero-risk film by committee, and given that it made it's money back and more, it did exactly what it needed to do, which is to pander to the sheeple that make up multiplex audiences.\n\nWell done Hollywood, you've managed to lower the bar another notch."

Excited by pre-release, 'Lost World' bashing hype (the museum trailer is still one of my favourites of all time), a great number of people were obviously disappointed that this was, well, just another monster movie.\n\nI have to wonder what these people expect to see when they go to a film like this? I, personally, don't enjoy British gangster movies, so I don't go to see them. If you don't LIKE monster movies, why go and see one?\n\nGodzilla is a monster movie. Devlin and Emmerich obviously know the rules for making monster movies, and follow them religiously. Hence, you have a close encounter with the beast, then you're introduced to the ensemble cast of dopey but likable stereotypes (none of whom are the star, naturally), before the creature emerges from the deep to stomp through a famous city and lay it to waste.\n\nThe effects are great, the musical score is a blinder, and there are more than enough memorable scenes of monster-mashing mayhem to keep this G-Fan happy. It's certainly more fun than Phantom Menace or either of the Jurassic Park sequels. You just can't win making a film like this unfortunately, as so many people are going to immediately turn on it for reasons of their own. It's a shame, as I for one would like to have seen what they would have done with a sequel or two. Oh well, back to Japan for the Big G. At least they love the big lug over there."

As an average movie-goer, I have felt entertained though having some problem with its run-time. I have seen people comparing this with some Japanese Godzilla movies, and making negative remarks. Honestly, i feel that Japanese Godzilla movies look pathetic, and make no-sense at all. Technically, American Godzilla is far superior to them. Even, i don't have a problem with characters; you can see these kinds of things in every superhero/sci-fi/disaster movies.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, I'm a die-hard fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, but that's not the only reason I hate this film. Like many fans, my biggest problem is that the American 'Godzilla' is that it's nothing but a CGI lizard with NONE of the character, personality, symbolism, or even sheer power that made it's Japanese cousin so indescribably cool.\n\nHowever, forgetting this, even when I view this film as a run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster, I can honestly say it's among the worst I've ever seen. So what's wrong with it? Where do I start? Annoying, unlikeable characters, (Particularly the downright hateable Audrey, who I got the impression we're supposed to LIKE [!?]) flat, uninspired acting, a unimaginative and ridiculous script, (Yes, I know some of the Japanese films suffer from this too, but they were at least fun to watch) sloppy direction, a stifling lack of originality, and sheer bad taste combine to make this the cinematic equivalent of nails on a blackboard.\n\nEven the super-high-budget special effects aren't too impressive; while the Japanese films used their $11 million budgets to create awesome scenes of pyrotechnic destruction, this film's $120 million budget seems entirely devoted to endless shots of a giant iguana running through city streets. The LACK of satisfying destruction is hugely disappointing; to put things in perspective, imagine what the Japanese filmmakers (Especially Shusuke Kaneko) could do with a budget of $120 million. Wait a moment while I wipe the drool off my keyboard.\n\nBasically, this is a downright terrible movie, and not just from the perspective of disappointed fans. If you want more proof, check out the 'Awards' section for this film; it won Razzie awards for Worst Remake/Sequel, and Worst supporting actress (Maria Pitillo/Audrey) and was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Director. All I can say is that it should have won the last two."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been almost five years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.\n\nIt's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's \"Godzilla\".\n\nThere are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.\n\nIf you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.\n\nAnd what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.\n\nWhat the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.\n\nI personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.\n\nThis is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.\n\nSo take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as \"GODZILLA\"."

I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?\n\nOH GOD... I think I'm going to get sick all over again...

The other actors were part of the back ground. (The actors in Independence Day were better??? Look once more that film).\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the rating of the film (5,1) I had decided not to see it. But one day between various films we chose to see Godzilla. All four of us ENJOYED VERY MUCH THE FILM.\n\nLast week we have seen \"The Mask of Zorro\". Excellent acting, very good production, \"old style\" adventure, very nice actors, very beautiful sets but all four of us considered Godzilla a BETTER FILM!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1954, the new film \"Godzilla\" hit the theaters in Japan and made an impact that nobody foresaw or thought would have happened. Sure, in 1933 the famous King Kong was released but Godzilla was still an inspiration for many monster films to follow. These movies include the classic 1954 movie, \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and even more recent films including the 2006 South Korean film, \"The Host\" and \"Cloverfield\" from 2008. So many monster movies world-wide have been inspired by the original Godzilla movie.\n\nIn my mind, around the 1990's, we were long overdue for an American Godzilla film for many years. It is true that in 1956, there was an American production of Godzilla, King of the Monsters! but it had mostly the same footage from the original Godzilla to introduce the monster Godzilla to an American audience. It would seem that a new American version would surely find an audience in the States and create a new audience so to generate sequels.\n\nIn 1998, an American version of Godzilla was indeed released. It came with a risk because of the past history of Godzilla movies and it also needed a big budget to properly depict this large monster. In the end, this movie version of Godzilla is mostly hated but I was able to look past this.\n\nAfter a sudden and mysterious attack on a Japanese vessel and also some big footprints found in the Panamanian forests, Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is contacted by the U.S. State Department who discovered a giant mystery which a monster we later called Godzilla and who's main target for attack is the Big Apple, New York City. This is an attack that later turns into much more.\n\nAt the time of the movies release, director Roland Emmerich was coming off the huge success of Independence Day and there was much hype surround this film because of that. He brought Matthew Broderick in for the lead role but I believe Broderick is a questionable lead because he has never been the action film actor and his inexperience in this genre shows in this movie. Emmerich also casts popular television actor Hank Azaria as Victor Palotti as a funny guy but he mostly meanders around and is not very funny. Maria Pitillo is the love interest of Dr. Tatopoulos but her acting here is a mess and she gives some clear reasons as to why she's not around in films any more.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like this is a simple plot but the plot does have some substance. Even though New York City comes off as a simple setting, the film does give us many interesting shots of the city during it's action scenes. The action scenes don't really stand out and the ending is tiresome but the action here is enough to get by. Popular actor Jean Reno plays an very interesting French secret agent which adds a foreign spy angle to this new Godzilla.\n\nWhat's becomes even more interesting about this American remake is the Godzilla creature itself. Godzilla sure looks like a dinosaur and that maybe is understandable considering this film was made during the heights of the popularity of Jurassic Park. The special effects here are hit or miss. The film does sets itself up perfectly for sequels but these were late canceled due to the poor audience reaction to this movie. There is also a baby element which later turns into a type of biology lesson that involves asexual reproduction. As you can see, the substance of this movie is kind of all over the place but it sure does add some elements to a film that could have easily been too simple.\n\nIn the end, this is a somewhat standard Roland Emmerich film. The movie is very dumb at times and has many problems but in the end Godzilla works in a cheesy kind of way. This was a silly action film from the 90's that I wish had found it's audience. This is \"guilty pleasure\" fun indeed."

The parts of the dialouge that are supposed to be funny are everything else than funny. No, if you want fun you have to look for other things.\n\nLike, the main character says something about them using something to lure Godzilla in. Close-up on three fish lying there nicely stacked. I mean come on! This is like watching a Leslie Nielsen movie.\n\nAnother even better example is when the main character is speaking about the baby godzillas being born pregnant and could take over the world as the dominant species. They cut to those slack-jawed kids sitting there listening to it, I laughed so hard! It's not quite worth it sitting through all the drivel just for these parts, but still. No, have a look at the original Gojira from the 50's. Great stuff compared to this incoherent tripe."

I must admit, part of this film, maybe 20-30 minutes of it(I'm referring to a specific portion), entertained me more than the entirety of Jurassic Park(why is that movie so popular?). The end scene is also somewhat interesting to watch. Something that got my attention was the number of Simpsons actors in this: Hank Azaria(Animal), Harry Shearer(Caiman) & Nancy Cartwright(Caiman secretary). I found that to be a funny coincidence, if it was a coincidence, that is(or is someone in the casting department rounding them up? I'm not aware of any other movie with that many of them).

For anyone who thinks that making a brainless, fun, monster movie with a big budget is easy, look how badly it can all go wrong! I felt as if I were watching a first,lazy, REALLY lazy cut with all the flab and the extraneous dialogue and needless subplots and cutaways left intact. The effects are nowhere near good enough to stand up to close scrutiny: (check out the scenes of Godzilla v. submarine and see if there is ANY sense of scale conveyed whatsoever.) The pacing is the worst I have ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie, and I've seen plenty of ropey movies in my time. But beyond all of this, the greatest sense of the movie I was left with was one of sadness and sympathy for the tragically brilliant Hank Azaria who acts as if he thinks he's in a movie 700% better than the one he's actually appearing in, for Maria Pitillo and her thankless wet lettuce role, unfairly savaged half to death in most of the reviews I read at the time of release, and Jean Reno for bringing his brand of dignity to a film that in no way deserved it."

Ironically the producers already had a pre-sold audience (Star Trek & Star Wars being other examples of pre-sold audiences). If they had simply delivered on their promise - a GODZILLA film - it could've been a slam-dunk hit. But they simply expected us to ooh and aah over technical effects *we've already seen* in lieu of plot, story & character; here's what any Godzilla fan will tell you what belongs in a Godzilla film:\n\n1. Godzilla has PERSONALITY - namely, a bad attitude and is clearly \"masculine\" - NOT \"just an animal\" as defined in this remake, and definitely NOT an egg-laying mother (!)\n\n2. Godzilla *always* battles another monster; he first emerges for a destructive temper-tantrum, then goes head-to-head with another beast intent on destroying the world; Godzilla never intends to destroy the world; he just keeps us in our place, then saves us all from something *really bad*.\n\n3. Godzilla does not get killed - ever - especially not by humans, as in this one; although in Toho's most recent GODZILLA VS DESTROYAH, Big G is self-immolated by his own radioactive heart, he will most definitely return in one form or another.\n\nYou get the idea; pass on this turkey and pick up GODZILLA VS.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the only films bad enough to make wanna leave halfway through. I mean, I was so bored, so disappointed, that I was squirming in my seat. This horrible waste of time, talent (whoops! did I say TALENT?), and money completely convinces me of how bad and commercialized films have gotten in the 90's. Does a film really have to have a multi-million dollar budget, nonstop action, and a no-brainer plot to make money nowadays? I'm just downright sick of it. I usually stick to the lower budget pictures in order to make sure I keep my brain cells, but even those have gone to pot in our cynical society. So just ask yourself one question: how the hell did this film get made?\n\nEasy answer. You see, according to today's Hollywood standards, all you need is a bankable icon, such as a star or a franchise, and people will allegedly pack the theaters in herds. I see it happen again and again. Stupid, dumb, idiotic moron movies like this one are making swarms of cash, while the little-known better pictures are being dubbed as \"boring\". Well, let me tell ya, THIS IS BORING. And totally stupid to boot. Like the dreaded \"Independence Day\", another one of my pet peeves, this film has a script more contrived and pathetic than a five year old could write. Where are the brains in these characters? How stupid can one character possibly be? And how stereotyped as well? The writers must have just rushed into the schtick of the Godzilla character and forgot about a story. All these idiots care about is making their shots look \"cool\" and seeing how much money they can blow on moronic special effects that were, in my opinion, frankly not that good. I could care less about how neat they can make Godzilla look. Who cares? I'm frankly getting sick of stupid computer special effects, because, unless they are used to move the story along, they're worthless and sometimes look ten times worse than just using conventional stock motion animation (look how they ruined \"King Kong\"). If I had it my way, you wouldn't even see the friggin effect. You'd have to imagine it. Or at least it would be good for camp. This isn't even worthy of that status. I mean, isn't that the only reason to watch the original Godzilla? For camp? To see how cheap and tacky the creature and cities look? Not for some mega budget, computer-generated moron who looks like he doesn't even have a face. Kinda reminds me of the bugs in \"Starship Troopers\" and how they were so uninteresting and lacked any personality or facial expressions whatsover. At least with stock motion animation you get some sort of emotions.\n\nBut stock motion is too outdated, now isn't it. And so is talent. Roland Emmerich and that Dean Devlin character are the two biggest airhead sell-outs in film, and Hollywood whores to boot. Why are they still employed? Simple. Because they had a big hit with \"ID4\" and now they're cash cows, a perfect necessity to Hollywood. Frankly, I think that if I had that huge budget, I could make fifty little films, each twenty times better than \"Godzilla\", each more entertaining, and each would probably pay the bills. And I don't need all the sugar-coated Hollywood hype either. Word of mouth spreads fast.\n\nSo give me one reason to even waste my time explaining the plot. A big dumb creature stomps on a big dumb city. Whoopie. And he stomps on big dumb people while he's at it, the only redeeming quality to this tripe. Sounds sorta like the catch to \"Independence Day\", huh. You can either sit back and take in how stupid the plot and characters are, and how horrible the actors are (in a mega movie. hmmmmm.), or you can go to sleep. For some reason I saw this crap in the theatres. Human nature I guess.\n\nNumber one on my All Time Worst Movies List.\n\n{zero} outta **** stars on my personal scale (Before this garbage, it never even went to \"zero\")."

He is an iguana vastly mutated by atomic bomb testing in French Polynisia rather than a prehistoric monster coming out of hiding. Godzilla migrates to New York where he makes a home for himself in the sewage and subway systems, occasionally coming above ground to wreak havoc. While Godzilla is not a great movie, it is highly entertaining. In fact, it's more entertaining than the original films.\n\nI'll start with the good. First off, Roland Emmerich is like Irwin Allen for the new generation. He makes some really good sci-fi/action/disaster movies, even though they don't have great acting or writing, the plots and action scenes are entertaining. Roland Emmerich puts his style into the new Godzilla and it makes for some great action sequences including a couple of scenes of Godzilla tearing through New York. Every scene involving Godzilla is about as entertaining as you can get. This movie even shows what I would believe to be an accurate view of how far the U.S. Army will go to end a threat by showing the army blowing up buildings and streets in an attempt to stop Godzilla.\n\nNow with the bad. The actors cast in this movie aren't great. Matthew Broderick is really weak is Nick Tatopolous, the scientist trying to learn from Godzilla. Maria Pitillo absolutely sucks as Nick's love interest. Jean Reno is always pretty good, but he's just playing his average french action hero in this. Hank Azaria isn't a great actor, but he's okay in this due to his comic relief. Oh, and what's with the Simpsons alumni in this film? Harry Shearer (Mr. Burns, Smithers) plays Charles Caiman, Hank Azaria (Moe, Apu) plays Animal, and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) plays Caiman's secretary. The dialogue in this film isn't anything special. All of the touchy love scenes that they threw in for dramatic effect fall flat.\n\nOverall, an entertaining film, but not an accomplishment.\n\n6.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I know I've already commented on this movie, but I'd like to respond to some of the indignant defenses I've seen since. I didn't go in looking for \"Gone With the Wind,\" \"The Sound of Music\" (ugh!), or \"American Beauty\". I went in looking for a summer blockbuster in the \"ID4\" & \"Jurassic Park\" tradition. What I got was a summer blockbuster in the \"ID4\" and \"Jurassic Park\" tradition THAT WASN'T AS GOOD AS EITHER.\n\nSpecial effect movies are like a drug, anyway--the next high has to be better than the one before. In this case, said high didn't even come close. \"Jurassic Park\" had my pulse pounding a lot harder than \"Godzilla\" did, or could. When you have worthless effects in a special effects movie, you're in trouble.\n\nThe plot was not only derivative of movies, it was derivative of BOOKS. The whole find-the-hidden-nest thing is straight out of the end of the novel version of \"Jurassic Park\" (the sequence didn't make it into the movie). The numerous rip-offs from other films would be fine IF the creators were trying to do a spoof, as Wes Craven did in \"Scream.\" As it is, they're just betraying their creative bankruptcy and hoping we won't notice. I go to movies to be entertained, not insulted.\n\nThat leaves the acting, and I'm sorry, but even in effects movies it should be less pathetic than they are here. Take Laura Dern in \"Jurassic Park\" and Maria Pitillo here--is there even remotely a comparison? The \"Star Wars\" scripts were equally clunky, but Harrison Ford never phoned in a performance the way Matthew Broderick does here. Jean Reno is tolerable, but only just.\n\nAll in all, \"Godzilla\" has very little to recommend it. If you like it, fine, but if you're really honest with yourself, you'll see that it takes a distant second place to almost every other movie in its class."

It goes down there with Batman and Robin, Species II, Speed II: Cruise Control and the Lost World. Also, for most of the film, you only see Godzilla's foot. A more suitable name for this abysmal production would be \"Godzilla: Foot to be Feared!\". The two leads (Brodderick and that woman) are possibly the most miscast actors of all time. Oh wait, the guy that replaced Keanu Reeves in Speed II was the most miscast actor of all time, but these two people come a close second. The lady just can't act. She can't. Brodderick can act, but in this film, his acting is...Laughable to say the least. This film also rips off other films. Let's see now. When the discover the eggs in Madison Square garden, Devlin and Emmerich (The producers) rip off alien. When the four characters are being chased around in a cab, the film rips off Jurassic Park. When Godzilla jumps into the water, before you can say \"Brain Dead Production\", it rips off The Hunt for Red October. I read a review and the reviewer said \"The only rip off I was waiting to see next, was of Devlin's or Emmerich's head\". Whoever wrote that is a genius. I couldn't agree more. This film is just putrid. Horrible. Whenever the lead female came on screen, I felt like vomiting all over the screen and protecting everyone from her...Well, crap acting. I hope Devlin and Emmerich never make a film again...Honestly, do they think we will just eat anything they dish out?"

I was 100% certain they couldn't come up with anything worse than the utterly dismal Independence Day, but these guys always seem to come up with the goods. Godzilla must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, it's a nitpickers' heaven; the script is chock-full of illogical skips and jumps, nonsensical ideas and just completely stupid in-duh-viduals. The photography looks like a TV -show, the actors (in the broadest sense of the word) have been left completely without direction and despite the loud action, the movie's boring you to tears in less than an hour. When the movie had been running for 75 minutes, a friend of mine leaned over and whispered \"This has to end soon. I can't take much more of this\", to which I replied \"only an hour more to go\". He got up, collected his jacket and left. I used to think that Matthew Broderick was a passable actor. Well, no more. While he was horribly bad, it was nothing compared to the female lead. In one scene, she is sitting on a bed, sobbing. I couldn't tell whether she was supposed to be faking it and trying to get some sympathy from the other person in the room, or whether she was actually trying (and failing miserably) to portray a woman crying. Even the most preposterous faults in the script are too numerous to go into here, just go and find a nitpicker's website and laugh yourself silly. I'm going to see the movie again, this time armed with a print-out of the script's faults and ready to ruin the movie for everyone by pointing out the faults in a loud voice. Thank God I don't have to pay for the admission. I suggest no-one else does either, ever."

        "review_title": "An enjoyable monster movie. But bad Godzilla movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Before the critically acclaimed GODZILLA 2014, Hollywood had attempted an Americanized remake of the classic Japanese monster back in 1998. They turned to Roland Emmerich, the man responsible for turning old B movie genres (alien invasion, otherworldly adventures and genetically enhanced soldiers) into big blockbuster hits. Hoping that he would do the same for the giant monster movie. To that end, Hollywood gave him Godzilla, the much beloved Japanese giant monster, to remake to his vision.\n\nAmericanized, neutered and changed beyond recognition, GODZILLA came out as a decent monster movie, but a disappointing Godzilla movie. That issue lies in the portrayal of the titular Titan. Gone is the thought provoking nuclear disaster allegory, replaced by a feeble \"man is the real monster\" Aesop. Nuclear tests in the 1960s gave rise to a giant mutant bisexual lizard. This creature makes a beeline for Manhattan where his arrival is met with mass hysteria and chaos. Named \"Godzilla\" by the media (thanks to a misinterpreted comment from a dying Japanese sailor), America sends wave after wave of military hardware against the beast, causing more destruction than ever but failing to bring it down. Into this chaos comes dr Nick Tatopolus, an expert on radiation mutations. As the military tracks the monster through new york's concrete jungle, nick discovers that the creature may not be the only one of its kind for much longer. The hunt is on with French secret agents, a budding romance with a wannabe reporter and a parody of some well known movie critics all thrown in.\n\nThe first thing that stood out for me in this movie was how enjoyable the scenes with the human characters were. Like INDEPENDENCE DAY, Roland Emmerich peppers this movie with a healthy dose of humor. This makes the one dimensional characters less of a pain to sit through. Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Henry Shearer, all renown comedians, shine in their respective roles, delivering appropriate drama and laughs. Even Jean Reno does well as the offensively stereotyped French agent Philippe. Their scenes are fun, making an overall clich\u00e9 ridden story more enjoyable than it is. Only the lead characters turn out a tad flat. Dr Nick, played by baby faced Matthew Broderick, brings his best \"wide eyed\" expressions to play as a man child caught up in the wonder of this giant beast yet running for his very life so he does not become dinner. Wide eyed shock, wide eyed awe, wide eyed terror, that seems to be his only expression. And the redundancy of Maria Pitillo's character Audrey cannot be understated.\n\nOf course, the true star of any Godzilla movie is Godzilla himself. This leaner, faster, velociraptor inspired look by designer Patrick Tatopolus is a terrific looking beast brought to life by cutting edge special effects. For a 1998 production, the effects still hold up well till today. The creature is elegant yet menacing, grand yet grim, with twin rows of fierce spikes on it's back, unbelievable agility and that trademark big chin that is common in Patrick Tatopolus' designs (eg: underworld's Lycans, pitch black's creatures, outlander's moorwen). However, it just isn't Godzilla, the unstoppable force of nature. It shows none of Godzilla's powers, nor his intelligence, nor his durability. Where the original Godzilla would be unfazed by missiles, smash tanks and planes out of his way, and carry on, this remade Godzilla squeals, runs and hides!\n\nPerhaps it would not have gotten that much hate had it been billed as a remake of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, rather than a Godzilla movie. The basic plot of a lost giant creature drawn to New York and ultimately taken down by sheer luck and superior military firepower already mimics the broad strokes of that stop motion classic. Godzilla can easily pass off as a redesigned Rhedrosaur. But alas, here it is billed as a Godzilla movie.\n\nAs a Godzilla movie, Roland Emmerich's multi million dollar blockbuster would rank in the lower thirds. Better than the likes of GODZILLA VS MEGALON, GODZILLA's REVENGE, GODZILLA FINAL WAR and GIGANTIS THE FIRE MONSTER. But compared to the rest of the Heisei era Godzilla movies, the early millennium era, and especially the original 1954 classic, this American remake is a disappointment. So disappointing in fact that the titular Titan of a lizard has been officially renamed \"Zilla\" by the original creators of the Godzilla franchise. I for one enjoyed this purely as a modern monster movie. It entertains, it has cool special effects, and it is good fun. Nothing much else though."

The film starts well, the monster is realistic and the attempts to kill it entertaining mainly because they don't succeed. Of course the whole thing is preposterous and we aren't supposed to take anything about it seriously. The humorous comments make sure of that.\n\nOK so how shall we end it some executive said. I cant believe a writer could have thought up such junk. The original Godzilla is so much more satisfying - the idea that this monster is just a juvenile. This film starts to go downhill with a series of ridiculous and predictable near escapes and Spielberg copying. Suddenly the monster can't catch a taxi. It can crush a tank but not a taxi and it goes on in the same unbelievable way. Really silly. And it would take a psychoanalyst to say why the slaughter at the end should be something we are supposed to enjoy. Does anybody?\n\nI was ready to give it a 7 because although as predictable as any other Hollywood film, it was well done until the denouement - suitable for 11 year olds. Disappointing because of that."

The dialog is sub-childish, which is why the actors avoid wasting whatever little talent they possess in trying to energize it.\n\nThe original Godzilla films may be dated - the whole Godzilla phenomenon really belongs to the 20th Century - but at least the Toho left a body of work that stands as something of a legend.\n\nThere's something legendary about Emmerich's film, too - it's a legendary waste of time and money.

As a child I was completely thrilled by this film and even cried at the ending when I was young, but have since turned my back on to it after I read all these reviews hating it, what were they looking for, the meaning of life? Get real it's a monster movie. I finally picked up the Blu-ray and I must say it was still a blast, I recommend the Blu-ray, it enhances the action scenes very well. Sure the characters were mediocre and the dialogue is a hit or a miss, but I can look past that. The visual's still look decent and the special effects are cool to see. This film is not a Godzilla film, he is very different from the original, mainly he can be injured from missiles. I kind of like his design here, it's not bad. The ending was a set up to a sequel that never happened. But of course there was the animated series. I would have loved a sequel were he fought another monster. Comparing the two Godzilla's is a no brain'er, the Japanese one is superior in every way. I could go on for a few more paragraphs of talking about this, but instead I'm going to cut it short. It's a fun movie and is very entertaining. Give it a watch, but keep in mind it's just a monster movie and should not be viewed as anything else."

At least then the cheese is consistent.\n\nWhat are my complaints? I don't want to give anything away so as to be a spoiler, but let's just say the actions of the military personnel, the effect of the munitions, and the reactions of Godzilla are so ridiculous at one point I thought to myself, \"the writers obviously didn't spend any time on research.\" And the dramatic pauses?

Although Emmerich's style of the film is similar to the original version of King Kong, Jurassic Park and even Q:The Winged Serpent. The story isn't first-rate and most of the characters are shallow. This was an box office disappointment in the summer of 1998. The movie goes on too long but it's fun, nonetheless. Screenplay by the director and Dead Devlin (Universal Soldier). From a story by Ted Elliott (The Mask of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl, Small Soldiers), Terry Rossio (Aladdin, The Puppet Masters, Shrek), Delvin and director:Emmerich. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****)."

We see T-Rex in New York, for 2 hours. If the special effects would have improved compared to the original there would have been at least a minor reason to see this trash. But they didn't improve. In fact , they are much inferior - that's probably the reason why 90 % of the CGI effects take place in darkness and pouring rain. To conceal their unrealistic looks. But then again, who would complain about the effects if the film was thrilling and fun ? We have an extremely weak script here that bores us with cardboard characters who keep saying the same old unoriginal lines over and over. It's really hard to keep yourself from thinking \"I could have written this when I was 10\". At the premiere I attended in Germany, about 1/4 of the audience left the cinema prior to the ending. I wasn't one of them, but I wish I hadn't wasted 2h of my lifetime with such a boring, unentertaining film. I'd hope Emmerich will spare the world with a sequel, but of course he won't."

Godzilla 1998 is the exact opposite: looks more realistic, more fun, decent plot, good comedy relief, fantastic action: we don't immediately see all of Godzilla, but it doesn't wait until the best end of the movie to show us Godzilla either! So what it takes place in the USA and so what the design isn't like the original and so what this Godzillas origin is an iguana mutated by Nuclear Radiation: all in all, I'll watch it many more times throughout my life...

Pretty sure since they made an animated series and plenty of Godzilla toys and figures and merchandise that this movie was made for kids like me. As an adult rewatching I can see the things that people criticize about the film but that just makes it funny. Like understanding an adult joke in a kids movie once you're older. Super inappropriate but another sign of how times have changed. I would definitely recommend this movie for for older kids and adults looking for a laugh or to unwind.

It definitely isn't rocket science, nor did it have to be to be entertaining. \"Godzilla\" is a popcorn movie, no doubt about that, and that is what works so well about it.\n\nThe cast ensemble in the movie was good, with the likes of Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner, Harry Shearer and Doug Savant.\n\nVisually then \"Godzilla\" is good. The CGI effects look good and does help to make the movie all the more enjoyable.\n\nMy rating of \"Godzilla\" lands on a six out of ten stars. A good first American attempt, but you just can't beat the Japanese original."

This film didn't have that. Heck, there is only one or two Japanese people in the entire film.\n\nReal Godzilla films have the following...\n\n~Godzilla is breathes radioactive fire. ~Godzilla never actually intends to destroy the city. It is always a side effect of his fighting the monsters that want to destroy the city.\n\n~The movies are always based in Japan, primarily Tokyo.\n\n~Godzilla fights other monsters. These other monsters (Ghidora, Megalon, space Godzilla) are the real bad guys.\n\nThis film did not have any of that. Part of the whole appeal of the real Godzilla films is the cheaper graphics, the man in a lizard suit, poorly dubbed voices, and NO Americans. (I don't hate us, it's just that we have a tendency to want things our way only)\n\nLet's face it, the only thing really going for this was the clean look of the film.\n\nAnd as a final thought, why DID Godzilla go to New York? (New York belongs to King Kong) Why didn't he go for Los Angeles or Seattle? Both are closer to the south pacific.\n\nVerdict: Godzilla belongs in Tokyo, facing other monsters, whilst destroying parts of Japan. This film is not a Godzilla film. It's sci-fi film that resembles Godzilla films."

It wasn't a good story. The CGI wasn't great, even for the time. Character interactions were shocking at times. But, I still found myself watching to the end and I had a good time.\n\nThe more recent 2014 Godzilla was outstanding in my opinion and this '98 mo ie does not touch that. But, I just viewed it as an over-hollywoodised monster film and just enjoyed it as a B-Grade movie in a better budget. That way I could laugh in some places.\n\nI don't really recommend the film. But it wasn't a total disaster. It really did remind me of how a lot of films were done in the 90's - the style in which they wrote I mean. We've come a long way."

Creature designer Patrick Tatopolous (sound familiar?) was aware that Jan de Bont's cancelled Godzilla film had been rejected in-part because of disagreements with Toho concerning the character concepts. Tatopolous distanced his design from Toho's and De Bont's mostly out of his respect for the original Japanese monster. This distance pays off, visually. A problem I'd long had with Tsuburaya's monster was (relative realism considered) just how bottom-heavy he is. GITO is much more mobile than old Thunder-Thighs, which properly matched Emmerich's vision of a high-speed chase with a titanic reptile.\n\nAny Emmerich fan can at least appreciate the ways that this film avoids simply trying to one-up an already established cinematic mold."

        "review_detailed_main": "Godzilla (1998) is an entertaining monster movie as long as you treat it as a film on its own and not relate it back to the other Godzilla movies. I saw Godzilla when I was a kid and was not familiar with the original films. I just saw this film by itself and had a good time. It has some good effects and good action. I did like some of the characters too. Matthew Broderick I think does a good job. He gets a lot of hate, but I did not mind him. I also like Jean Reno who plays the French soldier named Philippe. There are several problems, but I did ultimately enjoy the film.\n\nThe plot is quite simple. Due to nuclear testing from the French one lizard mutated into a giant creature that comes to be known as Godzilla and is wreaking havoc across the globe until it finally reaches New York. The military enlist a scientist named Dr. Niko (Matthew Broderick) to help them stop the monster. Meanwhile the French military work under the radar to stop the creature in an attempt to make-up for their mistake.\n\nI already stated the things I really like about the film. I like the effects including the design of Godzilla. Many people hate the design but I like it. I like the action scenes, especially the ones in the nest. I also like Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno's characters. However, the film also has things I do not like. Firstly, I do not like Audrey, who is Niko's love interest. She comes off as annoying and unnecessary. The same can be said for her fiends Victor the camera man and his wife Lucy. They also come off as annoying and useless to the overall story. They are just the comic relief that was not that funny.\n\nSecondly I do not like how seemingly incompetent the military seems to be here. They attempt to take on Godzilla in the middle of the city which they can easily kill countless people and cause much collateral damage, which is exactly what they do. In fact, the military causes more destruction than Godzilla half the time. They cannot seem to land a hit on Godzilla with all their firepower even though he is the size of a skyscraper. Not-to-mention Godzilla gives them the slip on multiple occasions despite his size. A lizard the size of a skyscraper should not be that hard to spot.\n\nOverall, Godzilla is a fun action/monster popcorn movie. It has good effects for the time, great action scenes, and a couple decent characters. There are several moments that require you to suspend your disbelief. But if you can you should be fine. If you do not compare this to the original Godzilla films you should have a good time."

You got the army throwing everything they got at Godzilla and not even a scratch, they even lost some of their own men and weapons. And they went and did it again! Gives new meaning to military intelligence. And since when can a torpedo lock on to organic material. Great move evading those torpedoes Godzilla."

I'm amazed at how much of ID4 we can see in this one. The main character could be the same guy basically. A forgotten scientist who gets drawn into the big events. He's still in love with his long-gone girlfriend. By the end of the movie they get together again. (btw, that annoyed me as hell! I really hated that girl, he should've chosen the other one).\n\nI don't think the acting was very bad. There were many good actors in the movie. They just had a bad script.\n\nThe basic idea of the movie is not a bad one. I like the concept of \"Huge Godzilla-monster goes downtown New York\". You could do something very interesting with that. But it's sad to see that idea drowned in moronic characters (the french somewhat excluded) and drama effect after drama effect.

Rather than make Godzilla a giant monster, they gave the creature a personality with its behaviour, a personality that can best be seen at the Madison Square Garden explosion. For anyone to not find that scene poignant, they must be heartless.

So instead of feeling like the good guys kicked butt and killed the evil monster, you feel like the good guys weren't so good and killed a big, but essentially harmless creature. During the best scene in the movie (the helicopter chase) I was cheering for Godzilla!\n\nBroderick's character was a problem - his feelings about Godzilla were never clear and he was far too wimpy to be the hero.\n\nUltimately the movie is (just) saved from being a total waste of time by star turns from Jean Reno and Hank Azaria, and by some great special effects and action set-pieces. It did manage to hold my interest through all 140 minutes. But with just a little more time spent on the script it could have been so much better."

Now, it's not a serious action movie, that's probably the reason for all the negative responses. That and the fact that it was Americanized. I guess the fans were not pleased by that.\n\nThis is as much comedy as it is action. It actually makes fun of all the previous Godzilla movies and in my opinion it does a decent job.\n\nIt has a certain sense of humor and to enjoy it you've got to like similar films such as independence day. I really liked that movie, so I like this one also. With lines such as \"mayor Ebert\" with the guy who looks like Roger Ebert, it's just too much fun.\n\nBack in the 90's, we had many original good films; so this was weak in comparison. It almost copies films such as independence day or Jurassic park. Two decades later with so many bad films being made this actually looks like a strong film. In my opinion, it's much more entertaining compared to the original 1954 film, and I give it higher points just for that.\n\nThere's a limit to how much an original film with boring plot, bad effects can hold up after 60 years.\n\n6.5 out of 10"

What could be better than a new Godzilla flick, in English, fancy graphics and set in my home city? Everything. I'd rather watch the old 70's Godzilla cartoon than this, at least that was slightly funny.\n\nThis movie made me wish I was blind and deaf. I gained a greater love and appreciation for a cheesy green suit with a man inside of it. I never knew I would miss that so much. This movie proves one thing: Better graphics doesn't make a better movie.\n\nI honestly regret seeing this, and add it to the top of my \"Movies that should not have been made\" list."

        "review_detailed_main": "As much as I'm surprised from how good the movie turned out to be, I got to admit it was really fun and enjoyable. The visual effects were good and better than I thought they would be, but they were still old, you can definitely tell the visual effects were from the late 90's and so it looks silly. Not like the visual effects in later years of Godzilla movies: (2014) and (2018). Even the character of Godzilla seemed a little funny and ridiculous. The updated version of him in the newer films looks better. Though I think the plot was more interesting than the plot we had in other of Godzilla's movies. Let's make a comparison: the movies of Godzilla today have a lot of green screen and CGI which is necessary but on the other hand takes control over the film. Which means the movie is left with characters screaming left and right and doing nothing. Now with this version there is CGI and green screen but there is a bigger plot more interesting, with characters who do a lot and a bigger film set. Like it's not only green screen but real film locations. Overall an enjoyable film and it doesn't matter much which film of Godzilla you prefer, they'll likely be the same."

It's awful, no questions it's just awful with to many reasons:\n\n1. The Godzilla design's is nothing look like the original version and it make me mad that this version was a female, but TOHO themselves said that original Godzilla was a MALE and also mocking 1998 Godzilla known as Zilla.\n\n2. Idiotic characters like Dr. Niko, Audrey and even the US Army.\n\n3. It also parody and mocking at Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel as the Major and Assistant, which i find it offensive for against only critics.\n\n4. This US Army is destroys every building than Zilla.\n\n5. Poorly acting.\n\n6. Both Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich is used to disliked the original Godzilla franchise which it make fans of Godzilla angry.\n\nI'm sorry everyone this movie is give an 1 out of 10."

It is a competently made and very watchable monster-disaster film, much more so than the voguish Cloverfield, which has stunningly bad characterisation, and a distinct lack of narrative structure. As a film, Cloverfield is woefully underwritten and the monster looks awkward and derivative of the creature in the excellent Host.\n\nThe action sequences in Godzilla are far more intricately choreographed, and the monster is more convincingly rendered, which is saying a lot considering the CGI is ten years older, but then a number of modern CG films seem to trade fidelity for hyper-kinesis, so that everything is moving too fast to make out details, which is just conning the audience; there are very few money shots, like the Brachiosaur in Jurassic Park.\n\nThere is a corny aspect, but it is charming, and not hopeless hokum, like 2012, which is probably the worst Emmerich film i've seen, and i've seen 10,000 BC.\n\nLike a lot of films of the mid to late nineties, there is assumption that the audience still have a respect for story, and most nineties films of this genre stand up quite well to the dross like the later Star Wars prequels, Transformers, Skyline and Clash of Titans, which have no sense of writing talent behind them, and the characters are just types.\n\nEven the effects of newer films look poor, due to aforementioned hyper-kinesis/ shaky-cam visuals.\n\nWhy is it that most modern event movies are so poor on all fronts?"

All of its flaws, technically or otherwise, would have faded if it would allow anyone to be sucked in. But instead, it reminded me of my experience in theaters - basically turning me from fan to non-fan of Reno and Broderick. That takes some effort. I can't think of anyone in the cast that I liked at all. That's pretty bad, and it's the director's fault.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see a story that you can predict from the disc cover to the end scene and want to hate everyone in it and be bored by boring scenes, boring lines and boring screenplay while you're at it, this is the one.\n\nIt is terrible. I mean it's a movie, it has some form of story, actors say lines, but it's just completely pointless to watch."

I just don't get why Hollywood so often have to make own versions that tend to be worse than the originals. Anyway, if you forget all the Godzilla-stuff, then this is an OK disaster movie. Taking place mostly in Manhattan, New York, I guess everyone can figure out what happens. The movie is entertaining and has some good special effects, but I think they should have ended it much earlier. The last 20-25 minutes was really too much, as it had been more than enough action in the movie before that."

Some things don't make sense, but this film is just meant for fun. The acting is a little shabby and weak. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are fine. Maria Pitillo does need some acting lessons.

Not judging it - but the movie is not for those who want to find some meaning. It is pure entertainment. It's called sci-fi but its only fiction not science. People go watch it. Its good entertainment.There is also a bit of politics. Emmerich was very careful not to stress on the nuclear tests as it could lead to unwanted attention on the sub-plots.\n\nTed Elliott(story) & Terry Rossio (story) and Dean Devlin (story) & RolandEmmerich (story) Dean Devlin (screenplay) & Roland Emmerich (screenplay seem to hold to the Shakespeare method of making subplots for realism instead of Aristotlian principle of here and now. But they are careful not to get too much into the subplots to take away the electricity - good job! The acting was bad (flat). David Arnold won the BMI film music award for his music as he deserved. David Bloch and April Webster did a bad job finding the crew. The sound effects were good then again all technical aspects of the film were good. Over all it is a good movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "With the new Godzilla film being released in cinemas now, I couldn't help but think back to this 90's version of Godzilla. A film so poor that it is often called Zilla because people do not consider this film to be deserving of the name. But what made this film so bad? Well, everything. From the weak writing to the poor CGI there was nothing that made this film worth watching.\n\nBut the bigger question is, how do you screw up such an easy premise? The concept of Godzilla is easy, a monster who causes havoc and destroys cities, often choosing to fight other monsters also. In this film however, the destruction that Zilla causes is minimal at best, as more damage is done to the city by the army. And this is probably the main reason people hate this film. If you can't understand the basic concept that the monster is supposed to destroy the city then don't make a monster movie.\n\nYou can also go at great lengths talking about why none of the characters work at all. Broderick being bland and generic. Mario Pitillo being weak love interest who we never see any reason as to why the pair were interested in one another. And then there is the dreadful Siskel and Ebert parody which was a very weak poke at two of the greatest critics just for putting down Emmerich's films (which Ebert actually commented on stating that if Emmerich was trying to put them down on film they could at least have them be killed by the monster). But far more than anything else in this film we again think of how they screwed up the monster. He is a bland monster who lacks any character whatsoever. In the old Godzilla films the monster did have a personality with various fighting and death scenes having an emotional impact. The only way this one can have an impact is how we feel about it killing are beloved real Godzilla from the classic movies.\n\nThen there's the action itself. The destruction that Godzilla does cause is often off-screen with the film only showing us the aftermath such as badly designed destroyed building. Then when it does get to showing us the action (in those rare scenes) the effects are weak. In contrast to a film like Jurassic Park which came 5 years earlier using ground breaking special effects and making us believe those dinosaurs are there, Godzilla seems to do the opposite and do everything possible to show that it wasn't there. It would be difficult for anyone to believe that he wasn't computer rendered for a single frame with a weak design and incredibly unnatural movements.\n\nThe worst crime this film commits is that it lacks a single moment to make this film worthwhile. It had no good action sequences. It lacked any funny moments. And it failed to create the monster Godzilla instead creating a bland generic monster who seemed to be coming off from the Jurassic Park hype, trying to rip of the film in every way possible with its monster. I can only hope that when I see Godzilla (2014) next week it's a better film than this and at least bares some resemblance to the character of Godzilla."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film starts out with a great deal of promise, but soon degenerates into a display of the efforts of the special effects department to dazzle the viewer. Unfortunately the story line somehow gets lost in all of this. A major glitch occurs when the creature, Godzilla, has attacked New York but disappears, only to be found underground when Matthew Broderick opens a man hole cover. A creature of this size can burrow underground without leaving a trace? NO WAY. The creature then pops out and once more terrorizes the city. The city is supposed to go through an evacuation, but, if this happens, it is cleverly concealed, since it remains populated with myriads of people. The creature supposedly lays a few zillion eggs, requiring massive efforts to destroy them, apparently successful until the ending. I wonder how Matthew Broderick managed to get himself trapped into this turkey. He was excellent in Torch Song Trilogy, The Freshman and Glory, but this was a real mistake for him. I think he needs to fire his agent and get a better one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is this movie bad? I suppose so...\n\nI still love it! And nothing will ever change that.\n\nGodzilla was created by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the same team behind Independence Day. There is no better way to describe what this film turned out to be. It's Independence Day with a giant Iguana, instead of aliens.\n\nAs a lifelong Godzilla fan, I do have to agree that this is Godzilla in name only. But how does it stand on it's own merits.\n\nThe tone and direction is exactly the same as Emmerich's other films. Fun action, amazing special effects, cardboard characters, wooden performances, and clich\u00e9 filled scripts. Matthew Broderick is amusing to watch in the film, he seems to be trying to do the \"awkward nerd\" routine, but it just comes off as rather awkward in general.\n\nJean Reno is fantastic. I maintain that there is no movie this man could not save. He does all he can with this performance, giving us mystery, a commanding presence, and some of the films genuinely funny moments.\n\nThe design of Godzilla (or Zilla as he is now known) is very strange. At the time this was somewhat of a disappointment after all of the marketing. We we're expecting Godilla, and we got a ugly looking Iguana. They really, truly did take the \"God\" out of Godzilla here. The effects are cool though, even for a nineties movie.\n\nSo why do I love this movie? It's a fun movie, and it doesn't need to be anything more then that. The 2014 Godzilla and Pacific Rim became the new standard for American monster films, but this one came long before, it failed. But it's still fun...\n\nGranted I was 7 years old, that could be a factor I suppose. Is the movie good? Nope, not really. Would it work for a modern audience? I doubt it. Did 7 year old's in the late nineties like it? Good god I hope so!\n\nIf you found this review rather boring, you most likely would not like the film."

Submarines chase Godzilla down in the East river (or wherever it was) and blast it with missiles. It dies but we're not sure. Then eggs hatch (200 of them) with Ferris, his pretty ex-fianc\u00e9e, Hank Azaria, and french hero guy in the Garden. But godzillies get blown up without Ferris and everyone else dying. Ferris kisses the girl. But soft, Godzilla lives, and he's pissed. But Ferris and friends out-race it and lure it to the Brooklyn bridge. It gets blasted with missiles on the bridge when it gets tangled in the support wires. It dies, heroic cheers ensue, the end...But soft! A baby godzilla egg survived the blast! Part 2 look out!\n\nNow you don't need to watch it. Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.\n\nok, now for the comment: this flick annoyed the hell out of me. Here's why:\n\n-about half-an-hour is wasted to show people with wide eyes and dropped jaws, frozen stiff every time they see the thing. I realize people probably would indeed be frozen with fear, but for the movie and our sake, RUN! We don't need to see them stare every single time.\n\n-it took an hour before we saw the damn thing's face.\n\n-for God's sake, helicopters can fly vertically.\n\n-cliche, cliche, cliche. It's only an action/fantasy movie, but for crap's sake, they could have used different methods in presenting this movie to us. eg, different lines, camera angles, methods of keeping us in suspense. I was rolling my eyes in the first minute of the movie.\n\n-basically, it's been done before, only Speilberg actually presented a movie with newer methods of suspense, and too many films after it have ripped him off, this one was the last straw.\n\nI actually yelled in the middle of the movie, out of anger, because I was so ****ed off. Every line, every scene, every camera angle, every character, was played. The effects are fine but they were done 4 years ago. I have a feeling that this movie was meant to be a cult classic. You know, bad but yet people love it. Well, I hated it. After careful consideration, I've determined that it's my most hated film. Well, at least it affected me. Movies are supposed to do that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hard to believe it's been 16 years since we were force-fed this film! But, on the eve of a new Godzilla thrashing theaters, I felt the urge to see a blast from our G-Fan past. Fortunately, much of the hatred for Zilla '98 has died down (mostly due to anticipation for the upcoming redemption by Hollywood next month).\n\nWhile I could sit here and write volumes and volumes on 'the bad' of the film, I think it's been done to death. Instead, I'd like to focus on some of the 'good' the film had to offer (yes, there was SOME good to the film). For parents, this movie is what I could call a \"safe\" G-flick (much like the original Toho films). By this, I mean there's barely a foul word uttered, no graphic violence I can recall, and no \"every film's gotta have one\" sex scene. I felt it was safe enough for my 8 year old step-daughter to watch (yes, my step-DAUGHTER loves Godzilla! I'll make a Jedi out of her yet!).\n\nThe action is over-the-top, well in line for a Godzilla movie. Lots of Godzilla stomping (away from the military), big and loud building explosions (mostly by the military), and absurd amounts of \"under-the-line\" references to other sci-fi and action films (mostly by the military). There's a lot in Zilla '98 for giant monster fans, action movie fans, and summer \"popcorn\" movie fans.\n\nAs a giant monster movie, Zilla '98 works, and it works rather well. For a Godzilla film, maybe not so much. I myself have accepted it as part of the Godzilla mythology, much in the way as \"Halloween-III: Season Of The Witch\", or maybe \"Friday The 13th Part-V: A new Beginning\". It will forever be razzed as a Godzilla film. But, if you look past that, and see it more as a giant monster film, it's not half bad. In the end: don't hate the monster, hate the movie."

But when the film came to the flicks we heard it stank, so we stayed away.\n\nGodzilla came on TV last night so I decided to watch it. The buzz was true: it didn't live up to the hype or the legend.\n\nThe storyline started promisingly, with loads of nuclear blasts and shots of lizards, the Japanese boat getting slashed and sunk, and the old guy screaming Godzilla's Japanese name. But when it switched to Dr. Nick hunting for earthworms and started following him around it quickly turned into another mediocre movie with taglines to tell the audience where the characters were.\n\nThe love story with Audury was out of a TV movie. Most of the characters were out of TV movies. The special effects were great: the shots of the planes chasing Godzilla around the canyons of New York skyscrapers were breaktaking.\n\nBut poor Godzilla didn't get to do what he does best: knock down buildings, scream, breathe fire and flatten cars, people, and anything that gets in his way. Godzilla mark 1998 is Godzilla lite. He isn't angry, he rips into buildings by accident with his tail, he's too busy looking for fish. The plot with the eggs was as plausible as Dr Nick discovering Godzilla was pregnant with the aid of drugstore Be Sure tests. The idea of Madison Square Garden full of eggs that started to hatch was awesome, and the baby Godzillas fighting over bags of popcorn was cute, but it was a plot from another film.\n\nI was glad when Godzilla came back and started eating the main characters. Why did the writers have to digress with the pregnancy plot? It wasn't the Godzilla everyone knows and loves.\n\nThe movie needed to focus more on what makes Godzilla great: wailing and stomping buildings, cars, people. The Rugrats' tribute to him with Reptar was right on target. I wanted more shots of mass destruction that made Tommy gurgle and kick over his blocks with joy. I wanted to feel that delight in strength and power too.\n\nIf this is Godzilla, I prefer Reptar!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Yep, Hollywood did it again. They took yet another Japanese star and turn it into a movie, this time under the direction of Roland Emmerich. Now\u0085 I will never, ever deny that I enjoy this film, I really do. I always wanted it in my collection, I was amazed by the trailer and I was blown away by the film\u0085 but in all that shock and awe\u0085 alas\u0085 the movie is one large, noisy turd\u0085 as most of the Emmerich films. But, I got to admit, Emmerich can make some highly entertaining turd films. And I think this is one of my favorite of all Emmerich films ever\u0085 I still have it in my DVD collection.\n\nNow, if you have watched the original Gojira (1954), then you realize that you are expecting a totally different story. First the movie opens with atomic bomb footage, in French Polynesia, something big\u0085 emerged from the depths and attacked a Japanese fishing ship. Yep, that's one of those \"slap in the face\" scenes, where the writer, or director wants to say to the original Japanese film \u2013 our monster is better! Well\u0085 talking about ego. And after that, another accident occurred, this time with US fishing boats. Now\u0085 that's entirely different from Japanese movies. In their movies we saw Godzilla fights numerous monsters, aliens and even King Kong\u0085 but the Americans are the one who increased the plot with the Godzilla's plans to make a nest in New York\u0085 where else? But, the idea of nesting? Hmmm\u0085 well, I guess that we needed a new idea for a big lizard. And it's not male, or female, it breeds asexual. Although I thought that there are two big lizards, but fortunately I was wrong, and good thing I was wrong. So, the story is simply American\u0085 in a simple American way. It's bearable.\n\nTime for actors: Matthew Broderick as Dr. Tatopoulos. Matthew was definitively very well payed for this film, so he looked all the time without any emotions, he was just staring at people and stuff and a big lizard\u0085 and talk in his usual youngster voice and\u0085 the guy never seems to get old. But, what I like about his performance that he constantly looked funny, especially in Madison Square Garden scenes, he entertained me pretty enough. Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache\u0085 the French intelligence agent who came to \"clean up his sh*t\". What do I mean by that? Now\u0085 this is not a big spoiler\u0085 the French atomic testing were done by\u0085 French people\u0085 and that's why Roache (his last name was there to make ridicule of him) is here. Reno was good, in his own French guy in US element. He was the badass of the film. We have Maria Pitillo as Audrey Timmonds, a former girlfriend of Nick's. Pitillo was so funny, so bad in her performance, no wonder you didn't saw her anywhere else in other films, this film remains the best known in her career. Hank Azaria? Oh, that's not all. Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright are also in the film. Moe the Bartender , Mr. Burns and Bart Simpson are in the film? What was that for? You expect for American audience to recognize them? To recognize their voices? Well, maybe some of them maybe know\u0085 but that does not helping! Hank and Harry were funny\u0085 well it was their job to be funny in the film. We also have Kevin Dunn and Doug Savant, they were good\u0085 but somehow\u0085 aw f**ck it, they were all funny in their performances, it's like you are watching a film based upon a world where everyone is comedian except Japanese and the monster itself. To also mention Michael Lerner's appearance in the film as Mayor Ebert\u0085 yep, you are right\u0085 another slap in the face to the two famous, respected and hated critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who obviously didn't like Roland's previous films.\n\nWhen it comes to the monster design, I won't lie to you\u0085 I kinda liked it. It was an idea that Godzilla mutated from ordinary Iguana, but when you look at it, It doesn't even look nearly as Iguana. This Godzilla is more lean, to make him more faster and more well built for swimming. So\u0085 it's not that bad. Overall, this is one large, imposing turd of a film. It's your opinion\u0085 you like it, or you don't. And I do, because I think that the movie is very entertaining. But I do not include the humor in the film\u0085 not all the time. I mean the script is just ridiculous, CGI is not bad, it's very good at some scenes, visuals are good, camera work \u2013 not bad, I like the underwater scenes, sound effects are brilliant, but I think the best thing is the music score by David Arnold, it's powerful and it presents monster pretty good. So\u0085 no matter how amused I were\u0085 it's still\u0085 that's a lot of turd\u0085\n\nAnd one more thing\u0085 Hollywood\u0085 stop touching Japanese things"

Spectacularly stupid and visually unspectacular, this monstrosity is the very definition of a tentpole-wannabe; even on the level of effects-driven \"popcorn entertainment,\" it's never wise to insult the intelligence of the audience this badly. Broderick isn't exactly a prime candidate for action-junk leading man, but it's hapless Pitillo that could really use a good reptile-on-a-rampage squashing (at least Reno emerges unscathed, as expected). For anyone afraid that it might get monotonous watching ol' Gojira stomp around a city for over two hours, rest assured that there's an extended bit involving its newly-hatched babies scurrying about and looking for human-flavored snacks that shamelessly rips off the \"Jurassic Park\" raptor scenes. Makes Emmerich's last picture, \"Independence Day,\" astonishingly watchable by comparison. Plus, the soundtrack desecrates Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" so there isn't even a respite when the credits start to roll.\n\n24/100"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, this is not a Godzilla movie. It does fairly well as a monster movie except for the god awful choice of Maria Pitillo as the lead actress. She makes dumb blonds seem like Einstein. There are plenty of really smart blonds out there but Pitillo is just plain embarrassing. The computer graphics are outstanding. I would have rather seen someone like Peter Weller as Dr. Tatopoulos. Why they kept making a joke out of his name is beyond me and the total disrespect shown him is uncalled for. This man is a scientist of some esteem. How he ever had Pitillo as a romantic interest with his genius and her crass stupidity is a true mismatch. Jean Reno is very good as he is, in my opinion, all of his roles. Vicki Lewis, who I think is sexy as hell, as Dr. Elsie Chapman, also did well in her role considering the script. Hank Aaria as 'Animal' and Arabella Field, another cutie, did quit well with their parts. Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks was a disgrace to our officer corps. When Broderick corrected Hicks' mispronunciaton of his name, Tatopouolos, Hicks answered with a 'whatever',,,disgusting! What's the story with Sergeant O'Neil? He is not funny, just plain sickening. He is as dumb as a brick and a disgrace to every non-com in our military.\n\nThe opening scene with the fishing vessel in natural and 'unnatural' distress is impressive. I was nine years old when the original 'Godzilla' was released and it scared the bejeesus out of me. I now have fifteen follow-up 'Godzilla' films in my collection and love each one. These are tongue-in-cheek matin\u00e9e gems. I am a physician and when I want to escape from reality, and 'Godzilla' movies are a real escape from reality, I pop one in the VCR/DVD player.\n\nFor crying out load, one has to understand that this new version is still a reality escape but with tons of acting flaws with weak scripting which I can love in B films like 'The Monster that Challenged the World' but are inexcusable in a costly film like the one under discussion. With all of the actors and actresses out there that would probably jump at chance to play(and have fun)in a really good write of this film, I can see why they did not jump. If they had a really good screenplay script and the actors were anywhere near believable this could have been a really good film. They missed a real opportunity here, an opportunity wasted,,a chance to introduce 'Gozilla' to an entirely new generation of kids and adults that are kids at heart,,not to mention the opportunity for at least one sequel. Where was the Morgan Freeman narration, Will Smith's excitement or even Elvira's campiness.\n\nSad. When I left the opening day showing at the local cineplex, I was almost in tears. No fire breathing, no empathy for the big 'G', ...what it could/should have been and is not...so sad :("

        "review_detailed_main": "It felt like this take on Godzilla was advertised for 2 years in advance of the actual release, every time (it seemed) I went to the cinema I was awestruck by little teaser trailers, in fact the one of the old guy fishing and hooking Zilla is a personal favourite...SIZE DOES MATTER! Love it I do. Sadly as most of us now know, the film didn't meet fans and critics expectations at all, but was the film done down by the hype and an expectation of a masterpiece for the genre?.\n\nWell it didn't help that is for sure, but taking aside that problem, the film only glimpses at what might have been. It has many great points that seem to have been forgotten, so sadly we are all too aware of the film's failings on the makers behalf. The build up in the film is excellent, the makers mount the tension in steady strokes, doing what all classic monster movie makers do, they have you waiting with gripping expectation of the creature by a series of scenarios and inventive dialogue. The sound is incredible, making it an essential viewing for those who cherish home surround cinema, while some of the shots and destruction of New York are well worth the viewers time.\n\nBut then? Well they throw the good work away by turning the film's focus away from the big lizard to a story line that was only fitting for the cartoon version of Godzooki. Thus rendering the film as a poor man's Jurassic Park, which quite frankly doesn't sit well. Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria all deserved better scripting, hell we all did!\n\nIt's not the evil stinker some would have you believe, it does have its moments of both good and bad, it is, by definition, very much a film split down the middle. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "If only the creature had only been named something else and not touted as the \"Godzilla successor\", the movie would have done much better.\n\nI saw the movie in a theater almost as soon as it came out in 1998 and I own a VHS copy. It's been about five years since I've seen \"Godzilla [1998]\" (hereafter G98), but I generally have favorable memories of it. No, G98 is not a masterpiece; it has its flaws, but it is far from being an abomination. The movie's major strength and flaw simultaneously is Pseudo-Godzilla himself(or is it herself-oh androgyny!). As a mythic force of nature, it falls short; it is vulnerable to heavier artillery, it is not wantonly destructive, and it deigns to stoop to Tatopoulos's (Matthew Broderick's) level (like a man wishing to communicate with an ant). As a super-beast, Pseudo-Godzilla is more impressive; it is extremely powerful, lithe, agile, clever, and tenacious in self-defence and of its raptor-like brood. I think the decision to cast Pseudo-Godzilla as a plausible animal with plausible animal behaviors, instead of, well, as a \"God Lizard\" was G98's major fatal flaw.\n\nWhen Pseudo-Godzilla is striding across New York, one feels a frisson of awe; he's so tall all you see are his muscular legs trampling across the street. But, the problem is, this Pseudo-Godzilla is apparently agoraphobic; he prefers to burrow and live in subterranean passages (although as an irradiated iguana, instead of say, a Gila monster, it's not really built for digging). Instead of terrorizing the world, all this titan wants to do is eat fish (again, not part of a herbivorous iguana's diet) and raise its young. Like a zookeeper using a steak to rouse a sleeping lion so the visitors aren't disappointed, Tatopoulos and the military employ fish mounds to entice the lizard to the surface. In short, Pseudo-Godzilla is not the supernatural monster summer audiences anticipated, but a simple creature that is monstrous only by accident.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, I believe that to get the most out of this guilty pleasure of a movie, pretend that the creature is not Godzilla, but instead, say, the more prosaic Beast from 20,000 fathoms. Then one can appreciate the thrilling set-pieces more thoroughly. Also, to compensate for Pseudo-Godzilla's relatively scanty screen time, take the banalities the human cast utters with a block of salt, block any comparisons to \"Jurassic Park\" in savoring the infant Godzilla sequence, and commend Tatopoulos for his ruse in leading Pseudo-Godzilla to his Waterloo. I am aware this involves some \"intelligence dampening\", but again G98 was always intended as a roller coaster sensation machine, which it succeeds in being to some degree, certainly more so than the outlandish dubbed Toho schlockfests of the last four decades or so.\n\nIn conclusion, to paraphrase a former acquaintance who saw G98 in the theater with me, it's not Godzilla, but it's fairly good."

Whether or not he is a good director is hard to say, since he spends his time helming large disaster epics that owe more to things blowing up than a serious plot and character development. This is no exception.\n\nJames Berardinelli wrote, \"Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-Manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind. The script isn't just 'dumbed down,' it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone.\"\n\nIndeed, as much as the film was panned by audiences and critics, even earning the Golden Raspberry for worst film of 1998, it also won a positive award: the Saturn Award for special effects. So Berardinelli nails it when he points out the film's strength. That being said, effects alone can never made a film good.\n\nRoger Ebert (who is lampooned in the film) wrote, \"One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes no sense at all except as a careless pastiche of its betters... You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome.\" Well played, Ebert."

        "review_detailed_main": "Godzilla is a good remake but overlong from director Roland Emmerich whose admirable in making this movie but a slow pacing at times and a predictable ending is what weighed it down but it's still not that bad it just could've been better. The cast for the most part are solid in their roles including Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pittillo, Hank Azaria, and Kevin Dunn. The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well but don't have much to do. The special effects are impressive especially for that time and it does off some suspense. The Godzilla creature is cool but you can tell it's CG most of the time and seemed to resemble a giant version of the raptors in Jurassica Park movies. Godzilla looked terrific none the less showing audiences glimpses of it first before revealing what looks like in full view. The action sequences are well executed and there is some comic relief mostly because of Azaria. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times but once the action kicks into high gear things seemed to movie at a steady pace from there. The surprise at the end I saw coming and does sort of leave it open for a possible sequel but if they had changed the conclusion the film would've been a little better. Overall despite its flaws, Godzilla is for the most part an entertaining film with enough action, cool special effects, some suspense, thrills, humor, a little romance, and decent performances by the cast who make it worthing watching at least once."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is such a sad, misunderstood film on all accounts. \"Godzilla\" 1998 is probably one of the worst adaptations ever. Godzilla himself really isn't present at all in the monster character featured: A radical re- design, a cowardly nature, being a biological parent to raptors, death by military, etc. It's no wonder why Toho, Godzilla's parent studio, completely segregated the character from Godzilla, copyrighted it as Zilla, and made it the subject of joke and ridicule in at least two of their later pictures. This film should not be counted as a Godzilla film, reducing the count to 29 movies in total. While it's a horrible Godzilla film, the movie is a decent popcorn flick to watch occasionally if you butt out Godzilla himself. The characters are really not that great, Nick Tatapolus, Animal, and Philipe are just as caricature in nature as all of the characters in Michael Bay's Transformer series. The acting isn't so hot either, Audrey being the worst easily, not to mention the script is occasionally atrocious and meaningless dialogue is everywhere, especially during the beginning. The CGI effects are also dated and cheesy looking when you compare them to Godzilla (2014). However, the monster sequences are still fun to watch and are still entertaining, even if there are a few rip-offs from Jurassic Park here and there. Overall, this movie is a half decent monster flick, but a terrible re-adaptation/imitation of the Godzilla character. Although it may hold nostalgia for myself and others, it's really not as good as some people might try to point out. If you're looking for a monster movie, this one isn't too bad. If you are looking for a Godzilla movie, please stay away from this. It's probably best forgotten and left to sit in the dollar bin."

It seems to me that if they make a film that has a great storyline, good acting, good producing and good directing the audience would come back again and again to watch a certain film because of the company that made the movie possible.\n\nyet in this film we find that there is terrible acting, a bad script, and a poorly directed film that expects the audience to look past it to a higher \"cause\". That cause would be \"give me money because the movie cost us a lot of money\".\n\nThat doesn't do it for audiences. For example, look at \"The Dark Knight\". A well written story, a strong cast, well directed, very well edited. Furthermore, it gave the studio who produced it credibility with audiences.\n\nThis movie \"godzilla\" was just a pathetic attempt for Sony to cash in. How could people actually like this movie?"

You might even say they had gone \"akimbo.\"\n\nAnyway, I do regard Godzilla as the ultimate example of story and characters shamefully subjugated to money-making devices, such as explosions, big shiny weapons, and giant piles of fish. To all those that mock the likes of me for \"expecting Shakespeare,\" I say this: clearly I was not expecting high art. The title alone should suggest, even to the most unsophisticated moviegoer, that one is in for two and a half hours of lizard warfare. Most of the time, I enjoy movies like that, escapist movies, simply because I find it fun to get caught up in the action. But isn't it a bad sign when, in the case of movies like Godzilla, you CAN'T get caught up in the action, because you are completely distracted by the flaws in the plot, the endless lifting of material from other films, the truly despicable \"heroes\" and the fact that the monster is BORING?!\n\nAs if that weren't enough -- this is where the film jumps from \"bad\" to \"indefensible\" -- does everyone remember Mayor Ebert and his little nerd sidekick Gene? Well, that stupid act of bitter self-conscious critic-bashing is a good example of just how childish as filmmakers can behave. Siskel and Ebert gave a negative review to \"Independence Day,\" so that bit was a little act of passive-aggressive revenge on the part of the filmmakers. By virtue of that act alone, the makers of this film have hereby been disqualified from the \"artist\" category forever. Amen.\n\n\"Godzilla\" is the worst film of 1998, and the worst film I have ever seen."

Most people that say that this movie is awesome have just never seen the rich quality of the real Godzilla movies. And then we see that Godzilla had 200 babies. He only had like 2 from the original series! The one thing that makes me want to set fire to places that sell this movie is the fact that Godzilla has those spikes on his back that normally would've powered his fire (or nuclear) breath! Not including that is seriously like making a spider-man movie when he doesn't shoot webs.

I finally did see this movie. This movie is ahead of its time. The technology to make CGI characters was very limited in 1998. To show a really big lizard trash New York city for a movie of that time is something that deserve props. For a movie that came out in 2007 it was more than possible to show giant robots battle each other and trash a city. All that can be done with blue screens and a computer. But in 1998, model cities had to be used while the CGI lizard was composited in. And remember the lizard is like 10 times the size of optimus prime. Whether these smart ass critics like it or not, films that use a huge amount of special effects will always be a hit at the box office. This movie was way ahead of its time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Roland Emmerich's Godzilla remake is an old enough film now to have a solid consensus on its quality laid upon it. Common knowledge would say that it was a very bad film. And yes, technically speaking it's not the best by any means. The plot's like swiss cheese, acting on most fronts is perfunctory, which compliments the script's quality nicely (if unintentionally) and the whole thing borrows and cannibalises many, many monster/sci-fi genre conventions. And you know what, ever since i first saw it on the big screen, i still enjoy it. Maybe that's because i was so young at the time that i couldn't care less about the finer qualities of cinema (i was, and still am to a limit, a self proclaimed monster movie nut) and have seen it so many times from then onto the present that i haven't had time to mature to its faults in between viewings. I'm not saying its a great movie by any extent. In fact there are moments where I admit it is very poor. But it does enough things right to stay afloat.\n\nStaying pretty close to the fundamental concept of the original Japanese \"Gojira\", \"Godzilla\" is all about a phenomenally massive, radioactively mutated reptile, causing mayhem and destruction to the nearest mass populated metropolis. It's up to the local scientists and militia to find out where this thing came from, why its here and how to stop it. That's not the most concise version of the plot, but it's not too bad either. Lets elaborate on the new stuff.\n\nChanges have been made to Americanize the story, two of which are obvious; the lizard wasn't a result of the Horoshima fallout but of French Pacific Island nuclear testing; the city under siege is Manhattan, not Tokyo. Attempts at modernising the tale for a contemporary, more environmentally conscious audience have resulted in turning the monster into a fish eating, asexual, egg laying creature just trying to find a suitable nesting site, thus he (why is it called a he if it's pregnant?) isn't just destroying stuff because it's a nifty past time. The person who finds this out is a biologist Nick Tatopolis (Matthew Broderick), who's dragged out from his study of Trenoble earthworms to deal with this slightly bigger specimen. Him, along with the US Army led by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn), track the beast from early sightings and boat attacks on nearby island chains up to the big apple itself. They aren't alone. A French secret service group led by Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) is on the same trail to clean up the mess his nation indirectly caused. On top of all this we have Nick's college sweetie Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) in the city pursuing a news reporter career, with help from cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria) and his wife Lucy (Arabelle Field), with a chauvinistic anchorman Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer) getting in the way. (You can choose to ignore the last plot strand if you wish)\n\nSo that's Godzilla without the big 'plot twists' that take place at various points, but will no doubt be anticipated by any conscious individual watching. The main story and characterisations have never been the monster/action/disaster flick genre's main attraction and that's no more true than it is here. All the players are caricatures and genre stereotypes and any attempts at depth (Nick and Audrey get back together after a long hiatus) are dealt with very poorly, but thankfully its not enough to sink the whole ship. Its left to the actors to carry all the scenes that don't feature the titular monster (too few) and most of them do the best they can with a script that does nobody any favours. Shearer, Azaria and of course Reno have good comic moments and seem to take the script as the preferable but unintentional tongue in cheek variety, Reno especially, hamming it up as the dude who knows the score and goes through the whole ordeal with a knowing confidence and swagger. No one else makes an impression. Broderick is adequate for the lead but nothing more. Pitillo, despite looking gorgeous, comes off kind of annoying as the love interest, playing it in semi-dumb blond mode (still, that girl is hot!).\n\nThe movie is successful in two areas, the first been Emmerich's once again not very subtle but still amusing political satire on America, from their gun ho culture in neutralising threats, the scathing media, to the mispronunciation of Gojira that becomes Godzilla. Genre movies are also parodied (although that could be kind talk for outright plagiarism) from the likes of Dino DeLaurenti's \"King Kong\" to \"Jurassic Park\" (featured in a horrendous chapter containing Baby Godzillas), plus the Mayor of New York, Mayor Ebert, is a caricature of the real movie critic Roger Ebert.\n\nThe monster itself is the second and most noteworthy success. A concoction of both the original Godzilla and modern day reptilian design, it's a marvel to look at. Yes, the fact that it's a CGI creation is unmistakable, but it transcends the dated technology with a soulful performance, present mostly due to the way it's animated, with a lot of naturalistic detail in its behaviour, instilling feelings of intimidation, awe and endearment (its phenomenal size adds to the intimidation factor). The action scenes are directed and choreographed with Emmerich's nack for large scale destruction and special effects, and both are therefore top draw. There are some stand out sequences, the most memorable been when Godzilla first takes a stroll through Manhattan which is both awe inspiring and exciting.\n\nGodzilla is no masterpiece, not even a good film in some areas and as far as remakes go it doesn't rank highly. But it's an enjoyable piece of fluff that overcomes its glaring faults by been occasionally funny (sometimes unintentionally), satirical and containing a handful of well orchestrated action sequences featuring one of the best movie monsters in recent film history."

Over all, its OK and great for the action, but doesn't count as Godzilla.

Jean Reno plays Philippe Roache (an even more criminal waste of talent than Broderick's role), an agent of the French government who is trying to cover up the fact that it was the French who woke up this 100 meter tall lizard. This movie is great video fodder if you can get it at \"Two for the price of one\" night at your local video store, and it will test your Dolby system to the limit, but in the end it is funnier than it is frightening and the only reason why I could give it even three stars was Reno, who somehow manages to come off as a serious character in what is otherwise a very silly movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had watched this movie in my childhood and was left in awe to the special effects as well as Godzilla himself. This was the first iteration of any Godzilla movie I had watched then.\n\nNow I am 33 years old and I watched many Godzilla movies, which are \"true to its nature\". After all these years I decided to give it a try to see what the hate is all about and I still enjoyed this piece like it was my first time. The sequences, the creature itself, the sound effects and special effects for 1998 were top notch.\n\nMany of the hate coming for this movie is because it's titled Godzilla and titular monster is not what we are used to see in many other Godzilla movies. It has no ulterior motive, not a titan, does not have a radiation breath etc. But this Godzilla is an overgrown lizard who just entered the waking world. Also it has some sort of a radiation breath since it blows up cars just by screaming at them, not in a beam shaped though. Also it's not immortal either.\n\nAll and all, I think this was a solid entertainment movie. I will probably watch this in many years to come and still enjoy it since it gives everything I look for. I am not looking for the meaning of life in a Godzilla movie, I just want to see effects, get entertained and this film gives it all.\n\nAnd unlike newer Godzilla movies, human characters are not annoying as hell in this one. You can very well skip the human parts in new movies and will not lose a thing. Here, you may not lose anything either but you don't have to urge to skip the scenes with humans in the first place.\n\nOverall, a solid 7/10 is what this title deserves in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was a huge problem with the mid/late 90's, early 2000's movies when it came to big action set pieces and this movie was ahead of the curve on how much money you can throw at a movie and still fail. It was not only too ambitious but they didn't even make Godzilla look like Godzilla. Fast forward to 2014 and at least that is a proper Godzilla. Early CGI at that time had very little use in nearly ANY movie let alone a big budget film. They didn't appear to know what could be done vs what should be done. Case in point was John Carpenter's Escape from LA to have some of the worst CGI that didn't need to be used but WAS used because they wanted to push boundaries. It didn't work in that and that's why Escape from NY is a far better film. You have practical FX and matte painting in earlier films that look better than this strange decade long worth of crappy CGI. There is no way around it but not every movie seemed to know what limits look absolutely terrible and what looks passable. These movies will never become classics because the CGI dates them so badly it takes you completely out of the story. Godzilla 98 was never good it was simply meant to be ID4 using Godzilla's name and it failed. It pretty much had zero plot, they just wanted to get Godzilla from A to B. They had plenty of source material to go with and instead created what looks to be a huge raptor instead of the classic Godzilla. Even as far as The Matrix Reloaded stuff didn't look 100% real even though many scenes in the movie looked excellent. Lord of the Rings had some very decent CGI but that movie surpassed the 2000's. A big leap did happen with Final Fantasy in 2001 but that was 100% CG characters using motion capture. Simply put Godzilla 98 bit off more than it can chew alongside many other films that should have just waited or used practical FX a bit longer. There are reasons many 70's and 80's films remain \"classics\" and many mid to late 90's films that have terrible FX cannot be classics. This movie just failed to realize it shouldn't have tried. It has been 21 years since this came out and it has literally no redeeming qualities to look back on except how bad CGI was at the time. If they had waited even 3-4 more years it might have still sucked but the FX would have been better. It's no different than a movie in 2019 that cheaps out on visual FX because they run out of time. Case in point, Justice League and Black Panther. Both had scenes that were tolerable and scenes that were pretty bad. Black Panther's ending was rushed and the CGI was obviously VERY lacking and the choice to reshoot Superman created the famous mustache-gate. So as you see I'm not ragging on only Godzilla 98 as even today FX companies cannot do the job if they are under VERY strict timelines. Just because it's 2019 as of this review doesn't mean the FX will be good, however unlike Godzilla 98 they have the ability to be good, they just need to put in the time. Godzilla 98 should be a completely forgotten film. Robocop looks better than this and it had stop motion animation and it easily considered a classic. That had absolutely NO cgi yet the Reboot did have CGI and no one talks about it. It came and went.... dead in the water. I gave it a 1 because once I saw the design on Godzilla I turned it off and to me that's called \"unwatchable\". I've watched better movies that cost 5 million. It follows is one of them."

They make attempts to make since of how and where the creature cames to be. As usual the American soppy storyline romance is added. Nothing unusual about that. The CGI effects are welcomed and many years later, they still holds it's own here and there.\n\nSo chill out & enjoy the adventure, humor, heartfelt saga and stop complaining."

Not in my opinion. I found it only slightly less entertaining than \"The Lost World- Jurassic Park\", but for the most part it has the same chills as that movie and there's a couple of scenes that would be too intense for children under 12. I thought the special effects were pretty good- not great, though. As far as Matthew Broderick's acting, I think he did as much as he could with the script he had to work with, or maybe comedy is more his style (i.e. \"Ferris Bueller\"). But, here again, I didn't feel his lack of charisma in this role was enough to detract from the film. One other point about this flick I haven't seen mentioned was that Jean Reno's performance was quite good. So, I would recommend this film to rent without hesitation if you're a fan of the Jurassic Park films. It's really not a bad film, although not exactly a classic. I can imagine seeing it on the big screen would do it a lot more justice."

It seems if you hype something up long enough, people feel compelled to see it. And to top it off, Maria Pitillo and Hank Azaria(who was terrific in The Birdcage) give what have to be the worst performances I've seen. The saddest thing about it is that a few weeks after watching it, I saw a British Godzilla go through the Mystery Science treatment, and it was a much better film."

So considering it will be a long time until I watch the new version (I'm broke after Endgame, John Wick, and Aladdin hit the theatre, I don't even have a penny to watch Detective Pikachu) I'll do an update review of this movie.\n\nWhen you are a grown up and watch something that was so hyped in the past you get a chance to have two points of view, the old one, and the new one. On before, I watched MIB like this and was amazed that the new point of view of MIB was even better than the last time I watched it. In fact, I remember having a really good time seeing it when I was a kid, so it's pretty brilliant to top that. And now it's time for 1998 Godzilla. Well, I'm giving it to you straight, Godzilla did the exact opposite effect of MIB.\n\nSo I was wondering, what would 1998 top notch visual effect look like in 2019. I have to admit, very very bad! I would like to elaborate two sides of that very very bad aspect: 1. the good side: 120 million dollars as to be said of the budget of Godzilla (that would be a Godzilla size budget for 1998) shows its worth. I was amazed how all the cars in a new york street jumped simultanously each time godzilla thumped a step, neatly done 2. the bad side: Every godzilla moment in the city from CGI aspect is awfull, so you can say, god-awfull. It's like your not even trying to become an all time legendary movie with this effort. Whereas I can remember, the soundtrack of this movie was super, and every movie trying to be the best must have a super list of soundtrack, so why the bad cgi? as for the animatronix were basically awesome, so I think it should've done better. and probably that's my one most problem with this movie.\n\nI don't really care about the silly cast every body is talking about, they work on their own way as far as I'm concerned. The plot is also not that bad. Worm scientist? French Agents? Bad old girlfriend journalist stealing tape? None of them is a problem for me, it's actually quite a good twist. Jean Reno was a powerhouse in that time, so putting in the french country intervension plot was probably the best Idea.\n\nAs for every aspects needed for a Godzilla movie? I think the movie checks out all the important points: 1. wrecking cities: check (the most important city in this case) 2. emerging from the ocean: check (with great memorable visual effects). 3. great footprints in the earth: check. And then, one more: spitting fire, It took so long for godzilla to spit some fire so I'm quite disappointed in that too.\n\nAlso, baby godzillas pretending to be raptors? bad jurassic park rip-off! Steven Spielberg and all his fans and crew should be mad! and also they move silly so there's not much tension in that part of the movie either.\n\nI'm starting to wonder what Roland Emmerich is doing these days because He's probably surprised how rich he is from repeatingly tricking everyone into watching all his movies.\n\n1998 Godzilla you are not more than a good memory with a bad taste, now I should probably fill in the bad parts with, what, the good dinosaur?"

The hailed 1982 version of \"Conan the Barbarian\" deviated a lot from (creator) Robert E. Howard's version but that didn't stop people from loving it. Or how about \"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan\" (1984), how faithful was that to Burrough's book? \"Godzilla 1998\" is an American re-interpretation, what's the big deal? Besides, the behemoth as depicted in the 1954 original \"Godzilla\" was actually cute. The last time I saw that film it was impossible for me to take Godzilla's attack seriously -- he was too cute! In other words, the filmmakers HAD to change the monster's look to make him more threatening-looking. As for the second point, this is a film about a giant lizard attacking a city, why would anyone expect \"Gandhi\"?\n\nMy title blurb calls this the \"king of the monster movies\", and so it is! However, the tone is more akin to Indiana Jones than the ultra-serious vibe of, say, \"Aliens\" or \"War of the Worlds\". Remember the scene in \"Jurassic Park\" where the T-Rex chases the vehicle? \"Godzilla\" has a similar scene except that the monster is 200-feet high rather than 20-feet. Remember the great velociraptor scenes? \"Godzilla\" has similar scenes except that there are a couple hundred creatures rather than just a few. In short, \"Godzilla\" is like \"Jurassic Park\" on total overdrive. This may make it less realistic, but it's arguably more entertaining. In my opinion it is: although the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" are great, the story isn't that compelling and the characters are weak. \"Godzilla\" by contrast has more drive and a better cast.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, Matthew Broderick plays the likable protagonist, Maria Pitillo his wannabe-reporter girlfiend, Hank Azaria a photographer, Jean Reno a French military officer intent on destroying the monster, Kevin Dunn the American colonel in charge of the New York operations, Michael Lerner the mayor of New York and Lorry Goldman his aide. The latter two amusingly spoof Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel evidently because these critics trashed Emmerich's previous two films (and I agree that \"Independence Day\" was lame).\n\nSpeaking of Roger Ebert, he of course gave \"Godzilla\" a very low rating (1.5 Stars) and criticized it like so: \"Going to see \"Godzilla\" at the Palais of the Cannes Film Festival is like attending a satanic ritual in St. Peter's Basilica. It's a rebuke to the faith that the building represents.\" But isn't this the same same guy who gave 2005's \"King Kong\" a perfect rating? What's strange with this is, as cartoony and unrealistic as \"Godzilla\" is, \"King Kong\" is at least three times worse in this regard; in fact, it's like a live-action Road Runner cartoon (Remember that moronic brontosaurus stampede sequence? Or how about the scene where one guy shoots the big bugs off another guy with a machine gun? You can't get any more stoo-pid). And yet Ebert praises \"King Kong\", but \"Godzilla\" is supposedly a terrible film. Not only is this absurd, since \"Godzilla\" is the better film, but it reveals a double standard. Maybe Ebert is good buddies with Peter Jackson, who knows?\n\nBroderick and Reno shine here and the rest of the cast are effective. The weak point is the women. Maria Pitillo is a quality female protagonist, very cute, but the filmmakers don't do enough with her. Vicki Lewis plays a scientist but her role is very minor. And Arabella Field's role is even smaller (although that's not necessarily a bad thing since her character is so annoying). Needless to say, weak job on this front.\n\nThe film also has an entertaining soundtrack, including some \"Kashmir.\"\n\nFINAL SAY: \"Godzilla\" is just a great turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast flick. It has the fun air of Indiana Jones and The Mummy films. It takes the concept of a giant monster attacking a city and goes totally over-the-top, but not to the ridiculous extent of Jackson's \"King Kong\" cartoon. Lastly, if you think the only menace to the city is the 200-foot tall creature, you're wrong!\n\nThe film runs 139 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A-"

Now that may be the reason I like this movie more than others. Believe me, if you are a fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, I can totally understand why you would hate this movie. And even if you don't, it has flaws, I can see hating it even if you don't like the original. But despite it's flaws, it's many, many flaws, I do enjoy this movie.\n\nThe CGI on Godzilla did not age well, at all. I mean at night he looks OK, at times. But whenever he appears during the day, and even at certain parts at night he just looks so fake. Maria Pitillo, the actress who played Audrey is horrible. I haven't seen her in anything else so I won't say she is a bad actress, but she certainly couldn't act in this movie. The Pacing is a little off, it doesn't get interesting until Godzilla hits New York. Before that it's very boring. And yes it has quite a few plot holes and errors in logic and continuity, and even geography.\n\nYet despite all those flaws, it's a pretty fun movie to watch. Sure the CG on Godzilla isn't good, but the rest of the effects aren't bad. A lot of practical effects for the destruction of New York city. I actually really like Matthew Broderick in this movie, he's a likable enough protagonist. It does have enough action to keep you interested. From helicopter chases to running through Madison Square Garden while being chased by dinosaurs. There are some fun characters and it can be pretty funny at times.\n\nIs it a pretty bad remake, yes it is. Is it a rip off of Jurassic Park, yes it is. Does it have flaws, oh it sure as hell does. But is it fun to watch. For me it was. Yes I can totally see people not liking this movie, I understand. But I enjoy it. Take it for what it is, and it's a fun movie to watch."

The relatively weak story, limited comic relief, and flat out lack of suspense killed the otherwise superior special effects work. OK, we know that Matthew Broderick was in it, so we knew it wasn't going to be \"Places in the Heart\" but we were expecting some thrills. The single biggest problem was the over exposure of Godzilla to early. For example in \"Jurassic Park\" sure, you saw dinosaurs right away, but not the raptors or the T-Rex, they were given a frightful build up that slowly made your heart race with anticipation. Once you had seen a full screen shot of Godzilla it was like the cat was out of the bag. As you watch you know what is going to happen at every turn, nothing was unexpected. It was worth the price of the video rental, but at the box office you got ripped off. I felt like I was. The end threatens a sequel, so be weary and wait for the video. If Hollywood is smart they will market it direct to video. I don't think we will see any more huge objects painted green."

The story is mediocre and the characters are choppy at best, but if you sit back and relax, you could find yourself enjoying the movie as I did. Being that it's from the 90s and right after the massive success of Jurassic park and the lost world, it's not surprise why this movie fell through the cracks at the time. However I would suggest going into this movie with low expectations and you'll learn to love the strange story and style."

Well, he was, but the special effects were great, too. I was more entertained that I thought I would be because I'd heard about how much of a steaming pile of Godzilla poopie this movie was. Sure, it was mindless entertainment where you need to check your brain at the door. But so are the old Japanese guy-in-a-rubber-suit Godzilla movies where you not only have to suffer through prolonged battles of ridiculous monsters stomping on models, but you also have to suffer through mind-bendingly bad dubbed dialogue. I can only watch Godzilla movies when accompanied by MST3K's Joel and the 'bots. On my own, I become a blubbering mass of jelly.\n\nThis movie was easier to get through and I didn't really feel like it was long. I certainly enjoyed it better than Independence Day, what with all that rah-rah patriotism which has become part of our lives since Sept. 11th and which has worn extremely thin. This story was expensive, yes, but it did deliver on the thrills, and having Madison Square Garden filled with little Godzillas was pretty neat. Kind of an Alien/Jurassic Park type of thing combined.\n\nThe acting did leave much to be desired, mainly Maria Pitello who has a perpetual \"Man, I'm so bummed!\" expression on her face. She was awful, and Matthew Broderick isn't exactly the studly action hero. But in today's action movies, bio-scientists aren't normally the heroes anyway. And it was kind of a nice change to not have Chunk Studmeat blasting his way across the screen. Hank Azaria was good, too, for what we saw of him. And I thought the Godzilla creature FX rocked. And so did Jean Reno. :P\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now I saw the original classic 1954 movie \"Godzilla;\" \"Godzilla: Final Wars;\" the 2014 \"Godzilla\" reboot; and now I have to see this. How was it? It was not the Godzilla that everyone remembers. This is not Godzilla. Today, many people that talk about this movie will refer to the monster as \"Zilla\" instead of Godzilla. The monster does appears in \"Godzilla: Final Wars,\" which it is now being part of the Godzilla universe. With that said, the movie was produced and co-written by Dean Devlin along side co-writer and director Roland Emmerich who has directed movies such as \"Universal Soldiers;\" \"Stargate;\" \"The Patriot;\" \"The Day After Tomorrow;\" \"10,000 B.C.;\" \"2012;\" and the classic popcorn entertainment \"Independence Day.\" Emmerich has done a horrible job and he should never had directed this movie because he was not fan of any the Godzilla movies. Also, the look of the Godzilla looks nothing like the King of the Monsters that everyone loves and remembers. Oh, the CGI of God...oh, I'm sorry \"Zilla\" looks pretty much awful because it looks like that you would see on the Syfy channel. Although, there may be some practical effects but the CGI looks by far the worst. The story itself is horribly written, and some of the jokes don't work for example where Matthew Broderick's character looks at all fishes being putted together in a big pile, and turns to one of the soldiers and said \"That's a lot of fish.\" How is that funny? Its not! Oh, even most of the cast that I feel sorry for are very much given a bunch of bad dialogues which makes most of the characters look stupid. I am not counting Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno because they are like the only two characters that I like, but at times might be given a bad direction. Same goes to Maria Pitillo, who is not only given a bad direction but a bad performance. However, I do feel bad for the actress, and I don't think she was that bad. Despite on what I say about giving most of the cast a bunch of bad dialogues and making characters look stupid I do say that the acting in this movie is not bad. I also don't mind the song that played during the movie's end credits \"Come with Me\" sung by Puff Daddy featuring Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Oh, I also thought spoofing Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert was very unnecessary because Emmerich did that intentionally because Siskel and Ebert never gave their movies a positive review. I know that many directors don't make movies for the critics, but they could at least just respect their opinion on a movie that they criticize on. Also, maybe just deal with criticism that whether he or she accepts it or not. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but everything else that many fans of Godzilla had already pointed out this movie on why this movie sucks. Overall, this is not Godzilla and it is not a fun popcorn entertainment as \"Independence Day\" was; but it is not the absolute worst movie of 1998 because I think the \"Psycho\" remake is the absolute worst movie of 1998, which I will review it for another time. For right now, stick with the original classic 1954 movie, and some of the other \"Godzilla\" movies. Even the 2014 reboot. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. Oh, and by the way, how dare they rip things off from an awesome classic Steven Spielberg movie of the 90s \"Jurassic Park.\""

Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich succeded in botching one of the most successful movie formulas of all time. These two jokers claimed to be fans of the original movies but you wouldn't be able to tell it from this movie. It's bad enough that their monster doesn't act like the real deal but he doesn't even look like him either! Godzilla is one of the single most recognizable movie characters in the world but the filmmakers decided to use the tired old \"we are Americans, we can do it better\" argument. Well they're Americans all right and they gave us just about the lamest exscuse for a movie monster ever to be seen on the silver screen. The powerful Godzilla who plows through anything and everything in the real series is replaced with a goofy looking CGI beast who runs away from a fight like a coward. And don't get me started on Mathew Broderick. I can't think of anything more insulting to the collective intelligence of the human race that to cast this pathetic exscuse in movies. Bottom line is this, the Japanese and the Japanese alone make good giant monster movies. It's something no one else can do and the American movie proved it. Devlin and Emmerich finally got the critical and box office beating they deserved for Independence Day with their giant monster con job. At least one good thing came of this. Toho realized their mistake and decided to start making the films again themselves. Thank God for small miracles."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off I would like to point out that I have only seen the original Godzilla movie and therefore would not really call myself a fan of the whole Godzilla franchise. Also this movie has so much more wrong with it than just the fact that it is GINO (Godzilla in name only), and the lizard creature featured in the film is missing all of the original Godzilla's trademarked powers/personality/etc.\n\nThis movie really sucks for one reason and one reason only. Roland Emmerich. Now I have to admit first, that I did enjoy Patriot and it does not follow the exact same formula that Emmerich does with all of his movies, so don't apply the following to the Patriot. Stargate, Indepedence Day, Godzilla, and probably Day after Tomorrow (haven't seen it yet but from the trailers looks the same) all follow the same action/adventure/sci-fi formula created by Mr. Steven Spielberg. Clear sense of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; storyline centers around action that needs lots of special effects; corny, campy (and in Emmerich's case not funny) jokes; action sequences that are exciting but not too intense, so that young kids can watch; and a light-hearted fun adventure movie that is supposed to leave you with a good warm feeling by the end.\n\nUnfortunately for Emmerich, he fails in every aspect of this formula that Spielberg created. And his attempts come off as very superficial. The characters have no depth. The story lines are EXTREMELY predictable, overly simplistic, and because everything feels like a rip-off (unless you have never seen a Spielberg film), leaves you feeling bored, your intelligence insulted, and just wanting to leave, turn it off and go and rent Indiana Jones.\n\nThis was my all-time worst movie I had ever seen, until I saw Battlefield Earth. Please avoid at all costs!"

The 'storyline' is down there with the worst of the Japanese series, the characters are all just cardboard cutouts of the kind usually found in bottom-of-movie-barrel Friday the 13th-type slasher films, the plot is ridden with holes and there is a stunning lack of originality, the producers having lifted ideas out of everything from Jurassic Park to Aliens. The big monster itself is hardly visible through the rain and grey skies, but maybe that's for the best seeing as it looks so ridiculous with its gangly arms and legs and Desperate Dan chin. The baby monsters are just laughable, obvious CGI creations. There's no sense of awe or danger in the film, it's all just one long vehicle for CGI effects which often fail to seem real. Tedious, uninspiring and forgettable. Commercialism at its most sickeningly blatant.\n\nSize does matter? Strange statement from a film which requires the viewer to have an IQ of less than 10 to capable of fully appreciating it."

This one is the first one that feels modern enough to really enjoy it. You should watch at least a few of the Toho ones to see what Godzilla was, and then watch this one. It's better, despite its rainy flaws. The effects are worth watching, the monster behaves in the way you would expect Godzilla to behave. There wasn't enough mention of its nuclear origins and warnings, but the destruction is what you probably expected to see in at least one of the Toho films and did not get to see. The Toho films are like going to a museum, watching this movie is like going on a mildly outdated roller-coaster ride."

I mantain that the stupidest idea in recent filmaking history is the decision to try to pass this off as a Godzilla movie. It's not. Just because it has a monster named \"Godzilla\" Tramping around a major city doesn't make it a Godzilla movie. The impossibly stupide (with the exception of the French guys and the two military officers) human actors are given the front stage, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) is in barly half the scenes and doen't hold it's own (I'm not going to honor it with a gender) at all. But I think it does look like a Rhedosaur quit a bit, plus the similar plot lines (Returning to it's nesting/breeding grounds and tramping NYC). If they had done this as a remake of TBFTTF, it might have been watchable. But, seeing them try to pass of a plump, light-blue, camera-shy, personality-less, over-grown-bipedal-iguana-komodo-dragon-hybread as the beloved Kaiju, is just WRONG! It's enough to make any G-fan sick!\n\nI'll end this saying that if they do go through with their plan to release a sequal to this abomination in 2004, Godzilla's 50th birthday, then I think we should add that as the 8th deadly sin."

My feelings then were: the film was murky, anytime the creature made an appearance it was dark, or raining, or very grey. There was never a ray of sunshine. I felt this is what may have turned people off about it. In the theater it was very hard to follow because of the lack of color. I was also distracted by the sound, it did not enhance the movie for us one bit. My wife and kids felt pretty much the same way. But now nearly 2 years later, I picked up a widescreen videotape, and to my surprise, it was much easier to sit through on a smaller scale. I was able to control the sound so that distraction was easily remedied. The film itself seems so much more entertaining as TV fare, then it did on the big screen. What little color there was to the film seemed to stand out better on the TV, probably because everything was condensed. Although this updating of a classic is not one for the books, it does seem to stand up when viewed on a smaller scale. I think people who saw it in 98 should find a tape and view it again, but, remember to put aside your thoughts about the old Godzilla,and enjoy for what it is-a 2 hour time waster. One more thing, try to get a widescreen version, it does help."

Had he been bent on total destruction there would have been a total annihilation of New York in a few minutes. Of course, his motivations lie elsewhere. He certainly is better than a guy in a Godzilla suit, but eventually get to the humans. I'm not quite sure what to think of Matthew Broderick. He is one of the most bland people I have every seen. Even on Letterman he comes off as the dull guy next door. He also still looks like he's about sixteen. Instead of building really great suspense and waiting for the lizard to make its movie, we have these scientific ramblings. There is humor injected here and there. The newspaper people are ridiculous. The French guys are so out of place that all they do is confuse everyone. Just because you are French, doesn't mean you are stupid. It is a Western country and the people know what's going on in the world. French Roast coffee, indeed! A lame excuse for an on screen commercial.

Tour-de-force of special effects, some of which were good (although none were original), but surprisingly, some of which were embarrassingly bad (e.g. the helicopter chases and F-18 jets...). The plot is so thin that it shouldn't even be mentioned. It almost seems like the whole point of this movie was to do some kind of we-can-do-jurassic-park-too technological masturbation. I just don't get it. This movie has already (even with same english title) been done some dozens of times in Japan (and Jurassic Park II wasn't too far from it either), so why bother? It's not like we have run out of ORIGINAL ideas and REAL plots... It takes just a little courage to do something different, so just do it and stop giving us this rubbish, thank you. 3/10."

Remember the previews, one entire year early, at Men in Black? The commercials at midnight on New Years Eve? The \"Size Does Matter\" billboards that appeared anywhere and everywhere when Summer 98 approached? What kind of movie could possibly live up to that hype? The backlash was pretty bad. Just as soon as the movie opened, there were people who were dying to see it, just so they could say 'guess what? Godzilla sucked!' Well, guess what? Godzilla didn't really suck. It wasn't the summer's biggest or best, just like Hollywood hoped, but it was still a decent monster movie. Godzilla wrecked New York City, and that's exactly what I paid my money to see, so I was pretty happy. It seems silly to include a love story, and yes, we do get Matthew Broderick as a scientist trying to re-hook-up with his ex-girlfriend, virtually the same time as he's trying to stop Godzilla. But it never slows the movie down, there's still plenty of Godzilla smashing buildings and stepping on cars and swatting helicopters. It's a good thing Devlin and Emmerich left all that stuff in. The movie ends with a shameless opening for Godzilla 2, although now there's talk of cancelling the sequel because the backlash was so loud. Well, I hope Sony does go ahead with it, because there's definitely room for improvement."

The creature itself has so many differences to the original that it's not right to call it that (Gojira was over 400 feet tall and would tower over the world trade centre). So it's not the actual creature, let alone a remake (it has nothing to do with the plot of the original film either). Just plain fail from Emmerich and co.

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't mind some Roland Emmerich films. I tend to be more interested though in the ones that don't focus on disasters and monsters. Godzilla has both. It's a big budget sci-fi action film full of so-called spectacle, but at its heart it's terribly empty and lacking in any genuine dramatic content.\n\nThere's no sense of mystery nor surprise. Godzilla is rolled out in the first minute of the movie, after which we get this confusing global whip around, where we find characters such as Dr. Niko \"Nick\" Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) an NRC scientist, who is in the Ukraine researching the effects of radiation on wildlife. Within a couple of minutes, he's summoned to Tahiti, then Panama, then Jamaica. All I could think was that he must be experiencing a hell of a jet lag. But no, this is the way Emmerich unfurls the little narrative that we get. I don't think it was ever actually confirmed in the movie, but I think we're expected to believe that Godzilla is a mutated marine iguana, who has been affected by French (LOL!) atomic testing (rather than American).\n\nAnyway the big guy finds his way to New York, where unsurprisingly again, he/she (don't ask) causes a hell of a lot of trouble around the Manhattan area and we later find that he/she is capable of giving birth to 200 (what looked to me like) tyrannosaurus rexes. Yep! All of a sudden there are all these dinosaurs running around. Shades of Jurassic Park! The story is just weird, but one can easily see that Emmerich was clearly intent on moving into Steven Spielberg's dinosaur domain under any illogical circumstances.\n\nThis movie is all about visual effects, borrowed ideas from better films (especially those from Spielberg) clich\u00e9d dialogue, flimsy and formulaic narratives, illogical plot developments, and lack of character depth. Broderick is a nerdy Sam Neill without the required gravitas, but with a ridiculous beret for goodness sake. He has a love interest played by someone by the name of Maria Pitillo, of whom I've never heard anything about, before or since. She's cute but ... ! Jean Reno turns up looking guilty ... for turning up in a movie like this.\n\nInteresting things: 1 Why is it raining in so many scenes? Is rain a Godzilla thing? It gets seriously tiresome. In Blade Runner there was a reason, but Godzilla? 2 Godzilla seems to change in size depending on the circumstances required of a given \"action\" scene. Is it possible for instance, that the US forces with all their advanced technology are incapable of finding a 120 m creature hiding in the Hudson River? 3 How many times in movies now has Roland Emmerich supervised the destruction of New York? Does he ever get sick of it?\n\nI've given this movie a 3/10. It's not really worth that, but I figure that with a production this big, at least a lot of people got a lot of work out of it and that's got to be surely worth something."

This also has the best sense of scale for a Godzilla so far, he actually looks huge. Shame they changed the design of Godzilla so much and it's just ugly now. I didn't like the whole plot of baby Godzilla, it felt like a bad Jurassic Park movie. At least the city smashing and finale was very exciting making up for the many shortfalls."

        "review_detailed_main": "A slick, Hollywood-ized version of a beloved Japanese monster, made to sell to a dumb American audience. Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla serves as a specimen of 90s Hollywood excess. Big, loud, and brain dead. But Zilla (the nickname for this reimagined monster) also represents the fun, excitement, and spectacle of the summer blockbuster events of the pre-superhero era. I wouldn't call it smart, or even good, but Godzilla '98 is a great big ball of cheesy entertainment, and I kind of love it.\n\nGodzilla preserves the 1954 original Godzilla's nuclear backstory, but introduces a mostly original story and characters. Chief among the newcomers is Matthew Broderick as a scientist called on to investigate the strange threat from the sea. Also hanging around are Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, and Hank Azaria. All are enthusiastically up to the task of running with the mountains of special effects thrown around them. Now calling this story original is generous. At best it plays like a cheap rehash of Jurassic Park. At worst, it's just another monster movie. The kind of set-em-up knock-em-down script by machine that requires no thought and little engagement.\n\nAnd yet, I was engaged by Godzilla. Not by its ideas (of which there are none), but by its spectacle and its eagerness to thrill. What the \"all effects, no story\" complaints miss is the impact of truly exciting special effects. Godzilla has those. Emmerich and his technicians conjure some real awesome displays of scale, as well as complex CGI that still makes it point. The action scenes are carefully considered. Storyboarded, framed, and shot to be spectacular. It's an approach to action that is closer to that of the masters like Spielberg or Cameron than to the modern hacks who ship action off to the VFX team. There is a degree of showmanship found here that is nowhere to be seen in something like Kong: Skull Island or Pacific Rim: Uprising.\n\nEmmerich, along with Independence Day writer Dean Devlin, thankfully understand their audience (if not the OG Godzilla fans, then at least me). What I want from Godzilla is not heady sociopolitical philosophy. Nor is it half-assed attempts at human drama at the expense of the main show. What I want from Roland Emmerich's Godzilla is a roller coaster ride. A slam-bang fireworks show of hearty monster destruction. And this is what Emmerich has given us. The characters work. They are likable, sturdy human interests among the chaos. The effects work. The monster has a palpable presence onscreen. The action works. It's staged thoughtfully, and it's variety of locations and scenarios keep it from going stale (shout out to the Madison Square Garden section of the film. Running through the labyrinth of a basketball stadium while being chased by mini-Godzillas is one of the more exciting extended sequences of verisimilitude I can remember). All in all, the thing works as intended. It screams summer, popcorn, blockbuster, and all of the other words we associate with fun at the movies. I'm not supposed to like the American Godzilla, but damn-it-all, I do. I like the rainy, steamy New York atmosphere, I like Broderick's nerdy charm, I like the earnestness of its ultimate message, and I like watching a bunch of buildings get blown up real good. So sue me.\n\n75/100"

        "review_detailed_main": "That's the only reason. The French save the world. That's the only reason almost all people - in USA, I must say - hate this movie.\n\nIn despite of the people searching for sci-fi in a movie named \"Godzilla\", of the fans of the Japanese movies (Heavens!), of all the past times the duo Emmerich-Devlin had ruined a not-bad-but-remake-of-an-old-idea (i.e. almost all their past movies) this one it's not so bad, guys. But that is not the point. It's about the \"masterpiece\" of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich.\n\nThe aforementioned duo have spent last years delighting us with some remakes and the like of sci-fi films or ideas (Years ago a young jury at a Cinema Festival for the young here in my country voted \"Joey\" as best movie, while the real jury voted, more accordingly, \"My Life as a Dog\". If you want to know for sure Emmerich's opinion about his favorite film, pay attention to the Star Wars DVD Trilogy extras(1)).\n\nThe first real \"success\" of the duo was \"Stargate\", which is nothing but \"Flash Gordon\" with the Army around. An almost decent movie, not much expensive (by Hollywood standards) and with a script capable of solve the whole crisis in a hurry that would make George Lucas face turn red in envy. We arrive, we discover this Egyptian demigod (Ra!), we killed him and destroy his superior technology and his powerful pyramid-vessel, thanks for everything, next time will stay a bit longer. Pathetic (the TV series is terribly boring. Sorry).\n\nAnd then came the martians (whatever). And this, my friends, is your idea of a good spectacle. In that time was fun to see the White House blowing up in a zillion fragments, and your sympathetic army saving the entire world by destroying a whole technologically superior civilization (I'm sorry, not too advanced after all; 50 years and they use the same fighters-computers, as we see in the 51 area sequence), I repeat, an entire civilization (as the president reads in the mind of the \"martian\", remember? They traveled all at once as friends, like the Indians in an old Spanish joke :D) destroyed in 2 days, at time for the 4th of July. You know, here in Europe we laughed deeply at cinemas with the speech of the president. And cheered, too.\n\nAnd then came this Godzilla flick, which is, I'm sorry again, the best movie this German-americanized-in-more-than-one-way duo has ever made.\n\nI can remember that in that time, France was really doing nuclear tests in Moruroa (or was Mururoa?). This was the perfect starting point. Given the love this two, Devlin & Emmerich, feel for their land of adoption, USA couldn't at all be responsible for the needed nuclear explosion that, traditionally, unleashed the beast, oh, no. Not the only country who has ever used the bomb against civilian targets, making later the role of victims in \"The Day After\".\n\n\"But \u00bfwhat the politics have to do with a movie like this?\". Since ALL the cinema is politics, everything. And in this very case, the most. This is a film in the \"tradition\" which gave fame and fortune to Emmerich-Devlin: an old idea modernized, for all audiences (meaning this you can save the dog but not the woman in certain situations, I suppose), a constant rip of classics (it was \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in Stargate), like the galactic trench run of the helicopters after the lizard in the middle of NY among other \"homages\" (not to mention \"Jurassic Park\", another \"masterpiece\") and with nerd-but-nice scientist and too-much-nice army men (not to forget the real heroes, the french secret service) who save the day and everything.\n\nAt this point I want to call your attention to the other duo, with much more artistic sense than the first one, responsible of the script; I mean the Ted Elliot-Terry Rossio tandem, writers of some very good blockbuster movies like \"The Mask of Zorro\", \"Aladdin\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean - Episode I :D\" and others. I bet my neck about the fact that, having in mind what the first team can do, the best ideas in this movie are the second's: the french not only creating the monster (only an animal hungry for fish!) but in the end destroying it (while the army destroys the luckily evacuated city; luckily for the MPAA and the rating of the film), the origin of the name of the creature and the joke about the Americanization of the original name-film, from \"Gojira\" to \"Godzilla\", and fortunately, the US army dying as idiots and destroying NY (is a right-wing classic topic to despise the media, so that's another very different thing, more to the likes of Emmerich-Devlin). About the fact that the french agent's names are \"Jean-Claude\", \"Jean Patrick\" and \"Jean-Philippe\", the \"bad\" news chief is \"Caiman\" and the \"good\" cameraman is \"Animal\", I can't possibly imagine who had the idea.\n\nThe real thing is that the French save the world, man. The Army almost destroy New York. That is no good, right?\n\nLike another American hero would say, I have nothing more to say about this. And sorry for my mad engrish.\n\n(1) In Roland Emmerich's own words \"My friends in school liked Fassbinder, and I liked Star Wars\", or something like that."

The final hour is satisfying though.\n\nRated PG-13\n\nI have to admit that back when I was a kid, I really loved watching \"Godzilla\", mainly because I'm a sucker for monster movies, especially dinosaur films. Another reason is that film criticism does not apply to me yet. Now that it applies, I began to see the real colors of \"Godzilla\", a weak and flawed film the relies too heavily on effects than plot, pacing and interest. The second half is somehow exciting, but it's the overlong and boring first half that's the problem. If you have it on DVD, you can just fast-forward it to the good parts, but trust me, the first half is darn long. So long (and boring) it almost chews up the entire running time of the film.\n\nThe problem of \"special-effects vs. good story\" is not something new to director Roland Emmerich and co-writer/producer Dean Devlin, who made INDEPENDENCE DAY. But ID4 didn't bore me because it was fun as it is, GODZILLA on the other hand spent too much time showing us the giant lizard's feet than forming much action or human characters among them.\n\nAnother thing about this film, is that it tries so hard to be another \"Jurassic Park\", adding, of course, the rampage of the baby Godzillas and an enjoyable final chase scene. interesting thing about the film. Obviously, it's no \"Jurassic Park\", and even not \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\". It is, mainly, a large lizard movie that focuses more in \"destroying\" New York than giving audiences what they came for.\n\nI'd be lying if a say I didn't enjoy this film. It somewhat takes off on the second half, but getting there is just far too long, even for someone (or something) as big as the big \"G\".\n\nRating: **1/2 out of 5."

I don't deny any of this.\n\nBut in my opinion, Godzilla (1998) is very fun to watch (and kinda funny). The action is great, the pacing is good, Reno and Azaria are very likable and even the CGI is decent, if you compare it to today standards (back in the '90s, it was amazing)\n\nFinal rating: 8,3/10 (highly underrated action movie)"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you're a fan of the old Godzilla flicks, with lousy special effects, obvious cheap lizard suits and poorly detailed miniatures, you're apparently not going to like this movie, because the special effects are pretty good, despite a rather patent disregard for some basic laws of physics and moments of absolute abandonment of logic.\n\nHowever, if you're not a dedicated fan of the old, bad Godzilla movies, you might just enjoy this new, bad Godzilla movie. This ain't Shakespeare, folks, but it's entertaining nevertheless. It's a crazy, campy, rampage through New York, where the \"good guys\" do almost as much damage as the real hero of the flick, Godzilla himself. The dialog is over the top, but often witty, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Matthew Broderick turns in an entertaining performance as the nerdy anti-hero, aided by the enigmatic \"insurance guy\" played by Jean Reno, and an assortment of variously goofy lesser characters.\n\nDon't expect a great plot, but if you give it a chance you might just be entertained."

        "review_detailed_main": "After scoring a huge hit with ID4 everyone expected Roland Emmerich to really impress us with this movie. Godzilla had a lot to live up to. It disappointed on every level imaginable. The only way to enjoy this is as purely brain-dead nonsense. Think about it and you'll realize how bad it is. So seriously, switch your brain off.\n\nThe problems mainly lie with the fact that Godzilla himself is very unremarkable. He's just a giant lizard. Hardly threatening. And like Matthew Broderick's character says, he's not evil-he just wants food. It's hard to consider him a baddie when all he does is accidentally trash New York. Plus he moves and looks too much like the Jurassic Park T-Rex to be particularly impressive.\n\nNone of the characters are interesting either. Which makes the 'character building' scenes completely useless. That time could have been put to much better use in this 140 minute long film. Only Jean Reno comes away with his dignity intact (can you believe he turned down playing Agent Smith to be in this?). Though it is cool to see Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria (Principal Skinner/Kent Brockman and Moe/Apu) in a movie together but they don't get much screen time.\n\nIn comparison to ID4, Emmerich's direction kind of falls flat. Remember the public reactions as huge spaceships descended upon New York and LA and how everyone kind of watched in hypnotical awe as panic arose around them. The same could have been used in Godzilla but far too much of the movie has New Yorkers acting completely indifferently to a 1000 foot reptile hopping through the city. And I know those Apache helicopter scenes featuring the 'miniature' buildings are supposed to be an homage to the Japanese Godzilla flicks but here they look completely stupid and seem like they belong in a different movie. They just don't fit in with the rest of the film and it's very distracting. That could have been handled a lot better.\n\nThe ending sets up story for two sequels which never happened because of massive audience disappointment. A shame kind of since Emmerich could have learned from his mistakes in this movie and made a sequel that is much better.\n\nI own the Superbit DVD of Godzilla (only available in Region 2 at the moment) and the DTS 5.1 sound is awesome. With every pounding footstep of the big lizard the living room booms and shakes. Plus the 2.40:1 anamorphic picture is flawless."

        "review_detailed_main": "How could Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin create films such as Stargate and Independence day, and then somewhat fail with Godzilla. Watching it the third time last night I tried to analyze what I felt was wrong with the film. Everything is done to perfection when it comes to the technology behind making films. Godzilla looks great and all surroundings are professionally done (excluding the scene where three helicopters follow Godzilla between skyscrapers, which was too much like a computer game, with fake looking buildings). The story is not that badly written either. It is somewhat believable in the sense that the army is quick to respond, and work systematically to eliminate the problem. And the dialogs and character building is pretty good as well. So where is it that this film fails, because no one that I've spoken to has much good to say about Godzilla? I think it is the actors. If you think about Independence day we have Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum which carry the film through, complimenting all the CGI work and professionalism that went into that film. Same with Stargate where we have heavy weights like Kurt Russell and James Spader really making the film what it was. In Godzilla we lack that, as Matthew Broderick, while undoubtedly being a good actor, just isn't that larger-then-live character which was required for this sort of a film. He seems to kind a flounder from one scene to the next, never pulling of being the hero of the day. Same with Maria Pitillo, while being both beautiful and good actress, she seemed just as lost as Matthew in this part. And this can be seen when we have Jean Reno on the screen; the film pulls itself up and becomes interesting. He has that magic and is both believable and interesting. I also liked Hank Azaria, as the camera man trying to film the great story, while being more afraid of his wife then Godzilla. Godzilla is one of the best examples of how important casting is. Because without a doubt Godzilla had everything else working in its advance, while just lacking the thrust which powerful lead actors can give a film. 7/10"

But the original Godzilla was just so good, why can't it ever stick true to the original 1954 version? This film was not what Godzilla was meant to be. A total disaster on most levels of quality. This truly is the Godzilla film that was never supposed to be made. Why the film was remade was beyond me, but it was just straight up bad.\n\nThere was no plot to the remake of the classic film we all know. It was basically meant to be based around the \"new\" design of the beast. There was nothing alike from the original Japanese version to the American remake. Godzilla was the beast, okay that's one thing but what else was there? If you are going to base a film off of another at least give a few names related to the first one. No names of characters were mentioned from the original. Nothing stuck true to the great original.\n\nGodzilla in 1998 was strictly dedicated towards the use of CGI. The effects were impressive but the way Gojira was designed was nothing at all like the 1954 Gojira. Knowing Emmerich I knew there would be a tremendous amount of CGI involved, but there was so much that the plot became unbearable, well that is from what plot there ever was initially. Little to no plot was explained along with the origins of Godzilla like there was in the original.\n\nThe final thing that was poor about this film was the acting. Maria Pitillo was awful in this film. From her so called \"crying\" to, well everything else was just so bad. I don't know if it was just bad directing or if she was just naturally horrible. Either way, she was a bad choice for the role. Speaking of bad choices, why is Matthew Broderick in this? From his famous role as Ferris Bueller I never suspected he would be a scientist that is trying to stop a giant reptile.\n\nThe movie was just overall bad. It was a bit entertaining to say the most of it and there were impressive effects. But that isn't all a film needs to be good. Emmerich doesn't care about a film being good or bad. This film could be shot in red and yellow colouring and he still wouldn't care because he just wants to get money. Do NOT see this atrocious, plot less piece of garbage Emmerich considers a movie, even if the title draws your attention.\n\nJust to sum it up, there was horrible acting and Godzilla didn't look anything alike what he did in 1954. Not to mention there is no plot whatsoever, kind of basing itself off of all the other ones and letting those story lines take its place. But the film is supposed to be a remake so it just throws a curve ball and if you haven't seen the original, well then you don't really have much of a chance when it comes to understanding what's going on half of the time."

Maria Pitillo is also finding it tough but performs a little better. Hank Azaria is enticing and actually very good. Jean Reno can do no wrong but his character is underwritten.\n\nThe overall direction is a mixed bag.

Sometime later a fishing vessel is attacked by a large reptilian creature whose sole survivor only says \"Gojira\". Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), a biologist working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission specializing in radioactive mutations in animals, is reassigned from his current position to examine the wreckage of the fishing vessel in Panama and the near by claw marks. The creature heads to New York City where Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), Nick's ex and an aspiring reporter is hoping to move up from assistant to journalist and be free of her sexist boss Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer). Nick and his military team try to find a way of stopping the creature and stop its swath of destruction.\n\nGodzilla is a well-known property with its films being a staple of video rental stores and TV airings for a number of years. Attempts had been made to create a Hollywood adaptation of the Japanese kaiju staple since the 80s with Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3 director Steve Miner's pitch for Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 3D getting some interest but Miner's lack of experience beyond low budget but very successful slashers made financiers weary of such a project. The next iteration happened in the early 90s which almost became the directorial debut of cinematographer Jan de Bont of Die Hard and Basic instinct and would've featured Godzilla as a relic of Atlantean engineering who was destined to protect humanity from a shapeshifting creature called the Gryphon. Sony refused to approve the $100-120 million production budget which caused the project to fall apart. Sony then approached Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich prior to the release of Independence Day and agreed on the condition that it would be on their terms and Sony agreed giving them a $150 million budget. Emmerich and Devlin taking control is where the project was pretty much doomed because interviews between the two with various sources have them saying things like Godzilla was a \"dopey idea\", they weren't interested in \"two monsters going at it\", or \"We forgot everything about the original Godzilla right there\" just to name a few stand out lines of how much \"passion\" the two had for the project down to the fact the two wanted to do away with Godzilla's iconic fire breath only for fan outrage to force them at the 11th hour to add the barely noticeable flames in two sequences in the film. Godzilla is not a good Godzilla movie, and that can be traced to the fact it's made by two guys who don't like Godzilla as a concept. But taking out the \"Godzilla\" factor, Godzilla 1998 is simply a middle of the road 90s creature feature trying to capture the feeling of Jurassic Park.\n\nMuch like Devlin and Emmerich's previous films Stargate and Independence Day, their tropes are in full force here. Awkward nerd protagonist? Check! Clandestine military operation? Check? Conspiracy/cover-up? Check! Broad caricatures filling out the ensemble cast? Well, three voice actors from The Simpsons are in the movie so what do you think? Unlike Independence Day however, there are no big names in the cast so Godzilla can't bank off the credibility and charisma of its actors like Independence Day did. While Mathew Broderick was a staple throughout 80s pop culture, he was considerably less so in the 90s with his voice work in the back half of The Lion King probably his best work until he'd do the Alexander Payne adaptation of Election in 1999 (along with Inspector Gadget, but that's neither here nor there). Outside of Broderick, French actor Jean Reno was probably the most well known figure in the cast having appeared in the great Luc Besson thriller Leon: The Professional, but hardly a household name to sell the movie on. That's probably why the marketing for Godzilla tended to keep its cast close to the vest with marketing materials on buses, billboards, and Taco-Bell ads focusing mostly on the size of Godzilla's foot rather than any kind of story because the name does most of the work with a property like this. But of course when your movie fails to deliver what people want from a Godzilla movie, the goodwill of the franchise only carries so far.\n\nEmmerich and Devlin's biggest mistake is in straying so far from the original interpretation. Even in the worst Godzilla movies Godzilla is still shown as an unstoppable force who only moves forward, in Godzilla 1998 the Godzilla runs away from military hardware instead of acting like its unphased by it. The design of Godzilla would be fine if this were a remake of Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but with this large headed flat topped lizard with tiny eyes supposed to be Godzilla it's pretty underwhelming and looks and feels more like a deformed T-Rex model from Jurassic Park. Even the tone of the movie isn't quite sure how to approach Godzilla because at one point during the \"fish bait\" scene where they lure Godzilla with fish, Broderick's character is face to face with Godzilla and the music by David Arnold seems like it's almost going for wonder like the scene in Jurassic Park where we first see a dinosaur, this confusion over how to handle Godzilla goes right to the climax where it seems like it's trying to be as somber as the ending of King Kong from 1933 while also having the rousing \"victory\" feelings of Independence Day. I'd also be remised if I didn't mention the half hearted Siskel and Ebert satire where a character named Mayor Ebert and his sniveling yes-man Gene prat about the movie doing nothing but invoking the \"Thumbs Up\" imagery from their syndicated review series. Siskel and Ebert panned Stargate and Independence Day and I guess this is Devlin and Emmerich's idea of \"so there!\".\n\nIn terms of Box Office Garbage, Godzilla isn't offensively awful or anything. It does give monster rampages that you can see and follow. Granted it's not all the great but it's still head and shoulders above 1998's top grossing film Armageddon by virtue of being A) Shorter and B) watchable without getting motion sickness. It's pretty much a reskin of Independence Day only with a giant lizard in place of flying saucers, and the same tropes you saw in Stargate and Independence Day."

It shows Godzilla as a creature, not a monster bent on creating havoc. As with all creature-features it's only natural to root for the decline of humanity at the claws of nature's creation. But here we're shown two creatures, humans and Godzilla, how are striving to survive. Humans attack Godzilla because he's (or she's) destroying our homes and businesses. Godzilla only attacks out of self defense, and later out of revenge over the death of its young. Aside from the National Geographic aspects, the special effects deserve an Oscar nomination, if not Oscar himself. Godzilla looked and behaved in a believable manner. Not since Jurassic Park has this occurred. One final note, for a 'pitiful, weak story' GODZILLA is in the top-five take of 1998's summer grosses. Roland and Dean, if you do a sequel as planned, really reconsider casting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now. I will first off admit I'm biased. I've been watching this film since I was a toddler and that makes me biased. But I will admit it's got issues. IMO it's main issue is with the titular character of course. I'm a huge Godzilla fan. Always have been, and I've seen every film. So the biggest issue is that Godzilla is too vulnerable and ran away too much at times. If that were changed at least half the criticism would go away but I digress. Other then that I think it's a great monster film/disaster film. I think it has a good cast and good story. Good action and effects and all. The human cast was one of the more memorable and well done ones in the Godzilla franchise IMO.\n\nOverall I find this to be a film that despite it's issues with Godzilla's characterization is a fun film to watch. It has a good story and cast of characters. Alongside plenty of good monster action and all! I especially love watching it on a rainy day."

It had such great marketing too, I remember the Taco Bell dog quipping off the giant gecko, I remember getting a drink holder shaped like the lizard's claw, the toys were everywhere...

The lizard looks ridiculous now, the performances are awful almost all around, save for Reno and Azaria. The comedy is just stupid and the movie makes no sense as it desperately claws for every bit of low hanging fruit it can get at. The movie is flat out stupid at numerous points, but it takes itself so seriously.\n\nAzaria is enjoyable and Reno is doing the best he can to turn garbage into gold. They are the only positives here beyond the occasional dumb joke that does manage to hit that \"so bad it's good\" spot but they are free and far between.\n\nCan't really recommend this for anyone. Fans of actual Godzilla movies seem to universally hate it. It's not a good action movie, there's no real drama, no performance worth seeing, no technical achievement. It's aged horribly in every possible way. Steer clear."

I know a lot of people, namely Godzilla fans, always daydreamed or imagined Godzilla chasing a cab around the Big Apple, and that's what we got, in a very satisfying way. I felt Godzilla did everything I would have wanted him to do. The movie was a bit more satisfying than \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\". Although the movie does have it's faults: the characters aren't interesting, and the cab chase, although very enjoyable, seems out of place. When Godzilla first arrives in New York, it's interesting how Emmerich uses the camera to film his arrival. Only showing his legs. It's a great touch. In the end, I was satisfied with the action and the special effects (way better than Independence Day's, although ID4 was a bit more enjoyable), but not with the characters. *** out of ****."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't like discussing Roland Emmerich films for the most part. It's very easy to describe why he's bad in a way that millions have already done. I'll get into how I would describe his sort of style or schtick later, but I definitely dislike it, and this movie detracts for those reasons. But it's not just those Emmerich-isms that make this movie not work.\n\nThis movie is interestingly quite different from the other stuff he does. I think it's for that reason that this movie gets such a bad wrap even among people who are more forgiving of, say, Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow. The people who like this movies like the sort of simplicity and spectacle of all this destruction. But there's key differences that ruin what those people might want, for example;\n\n\nThe thing about this is, it amplifies a lot of the stupid in Roland Emmerich movies. In Independence Day, for example, I find a lot of the characters paper thin as they are here. But there are fifty million of them in that movie, and you don't really need them to be fleshed out. Here you just have a handful, and you spend a lot of time with them. In a lot of RE movies he picks one quirk for a character which is okay when the character only appears a few times. But when its the French character who just complains about coffee it becomes frustrating when we get so much from a character who has so little behind him. And then we get so much military plans and discussions and planning, which is so stupid and uninteresting. And like, I'm never particularly interested, because the way the movie feels a giant lizard occupying a city of 20 million never feels that big a threat.\n\nIt's all so odd that they've made these mistakes because you have a really easy movie for him. Godzilla seems like the perfect fit for RE's sort of movies, just have him go out and destroy all these cities and have the US try to find a way to blow him up. Easy. The thing is though, RE actually hates Godzilla movies, from what I have read. He thinks they are stupid and silly, which, I don't know, have a bit of self awareness mate? He didn't like the design of the original Godzilla, calling him \"fat\", wanting this reptile thing in the movie. I don't despise the redesign, excluding the gigachad chin. The thing is for me is that Godzilla should be terrifying, the sort of thing where you look out your window and you see this hulking menace and you know you're screwed. For whatever reason he just has Godzilla burrow underground and lay eggs, he barely hurts anyone. Everyone he kills is either by accident, or after they attacked him first. So we have this threat who, honestly isn't that threatening. Am I supposed to be frightened?\n\nGodzilla in this movie is just like a lizard thing that only cares about eating and laying eggs. There is something you can do with that, and I don't mean to say that being different is inherently bad. I like the idea that he's not particularly evil or dangerous but as a giant animal has the potential to cause great harm at any point. Except, they barely delve into that, so they didn't even replace it for an interesting replacement. Same goes for the audio design - they removed the iconic roar and replaced it with what I think is elephant sounds, which once I figured that out couldn't imagine this movie with any level of seriousness. But even if it wasn't a bad audio design, why change it? You have a perfectly good audio cue, if you're going to replace it, you should find a good sound at the very least. I can imagine a better version of this movie, where they focus on Godzilla who comes up every now and then to tear down factories of meat or stores and stuff. He's not a walking tank like the Japanese movies, but he is genuinely terrifying, and there is this fear that every so often he could just jump back out and cause damage so the military really need to find him.\n\nI can't say that I would expect that from Roland Emmerich. He has this reputation as making dumb movies, but they aren't just dumb. I mean you can call a movie dumb because their aren't themes or interesting plot points, but that doesn't mean the movie can't be great. You need a filmmaker who is able to direct a scene in a way in which we feel the impact and excitement of an action set piece. When Godzilla springs out and five hundred helicopters come out to chasing him, I'm not just thinking how stupid it all is. I'm thinking, why is there no weight to this, why does this all just feel like noise? This is how I feel about a lot of his movies, especially in 2012, where you see all this destruction, which has great VFX. But there's no real threat, no feeling that anyone's in danger. I don't see the scene with helicopters running past and cross my fingers hoping they'll blast Godzilla. Instead it's just like, visual noise. It looks okay. But it's not engaging.\n\nAnd it also is so strange that Roland Emmerich makes these dumb movies because not only can he never direct it with any engaging set pieces, he has no creativity. You have the free reign to create whatever set piece, environment you want, and it's all in drab rainy New York. You can have Godzilla do whatever he wants, but all he does is go after fish and lay some eggs, he has no interesting powers beyond fire breathing which was literally added last minute to address fans criticising the lack of atomic breath. And my god, somebody really liked Jurassic Park. While I don't think Godzilla's design is aping Spielberg, a lot of the shots are. The whole, keep it dark and rainy for better shots, and especially a lot of the shots early on remind me of the end of Lost World. I think it's fine to be inspired by Spielberg. But you should have something original and cool happen."

The movie was so stupid and boring, what I can't find enough words to describe it. The plot was incredible lame, love story between Dr. Tatoupolos and Audrey so weak! But, more importantly, whole cast team looks incredibly poor. I really wonder, how Rolland Emmerich, who directed Stargate, Independence Day and The Patriot (not a great movies but highly entertained and well shot) could make so bad movie. Watch Jurassic Park movies (second and third of course not so good as first but they are at least watchable) or original King-Kong instead. Not recommend to anyone, except huge fans of monster's movies. Maybe they can find something interesting in this true disappointment. Personally I suppose that Godzilla is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year and excellent example that visual effects without good story and acting mean only waste of money and nothing more.\n\nMy vote: plot 3, cast 3, sound 5, visual effects 6, stupidity 9 - overall 3,5/10 Thanks for reading."

As in \"Independence Day\", the producers start off with the attack, so that there's nothing really to climax. The Japanese Godzilla and his ilk and all those wonderful 1950s monster mashes always had the delirious rampages in the final acts. The film has an annoying rainstorm in New York City during most of the proceedings, and is almost always at night. Is this to cover up inadequate CGI effects? The trailer seen months before had the famous Godzilla roar, but here he looks or sounds NOTHING like the Japanese classic dragon/tyrannosaurus/stegosaurus. The creature breathes no fire, makes little sounds or even tramples buildings. He even disappears half-way through the film! The climax is assinine since a taxi can not outrun a 200-foot animal.

        "review_detailed_main": "So back in the days when Matthew Broderick was still cute and before CGI took over completely, they made this film which wasn't entirely done in front of a blue screen and I think it's a relative success. It's a \"Type\" of film that up until now I have only ever seen bits of, but enough to cobble together what was going on. That's what makes it work for me, the fact that you don't need to pay a huge amount of attention, but you are rewarded with some great scenes of a monster terrorising New York when you do look at the screen or come back from the kitchen. Would we call him a monster? I think that's a bit harsh actually and according to this film he is, what we as a people, have made him. I don't think he does it deliberately.\n\nHaving now watched it all the way through, it makes even more sense and I would be happy to tune in again. It is a much more accessible 'Godzilla' than the 2014 version, even though my husband Aaron Taylor Johnson is in that one.\n\nThe only thing that I think really complicates issues here is that there are so many characters involved. I think that they could have made the same film without at least the Mayor, Harry Shearer's news anchor and Hank Azaria (A severely underrated actor), the cameraman's wife and still achieved the same results.\n\nIt's not that it's overly long because of it, but it does get very busy on the screen at times.\n\nThe CGI and the animatronics work well together. I'm actually more of a fan of models and people in rubber masks or make up than I am of CGI anyway, but I understand how much better films are because of it now.\n\nIt's not an offensive film and it doesn't raise political questions and it's not trying to get a message across, but it's fun and simple to follow."

It's hard to figure out how this went wrong. You have a huge dinosaur wreaking havoc in New York City! That, by the way, caused me confusion. Why did Godzilla make this trek from the Pacific, through the Panama Canal and to New York City? Was that ever explained? If it was, I missed it. But at the very least, Godzilla in New York City alone should be fun. But it wasn't. This turned out to be the sort of movie I'd glance at every few minutes to see if I had missed anything - and I'd immediately realize that I hadn't missed a thing. It was just an all round poor production. Based on the look of Godzilla and some of the effects I'd guess this was kind of inspired by the success of Jurassic Park a few years earlier, but it was lacking in spark. I'd really be tempted to give this a 1/10, but given that there have been other remakes of \"Godzilla\" since that I haven't seen, I'll give this a 2 and leave the 1 available, just in case one of the more recent remakes is even worse - although it's hard to believe that would be possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, you'll read lots of critiques ranging from people who are purists of the Gojira franchise to those with less expectations for a monster movie. I've read some reviews here that sound frustrated about purists not being satisfied. They want them to accept the movie for what it was. A special effects laden movie and nothing more.\n\nWell.. I'm going to say one word followed by reason. \"NO\"\n\nGojira fans deserve much better for a movie that claimed itself to be the revolution of Godzilla just because of its use of amazing CGI.\n\nThis movie bombed. Pure and simple. It sucked and you will have more agree to that than the otherwise. The film director took a beloved creature which was created in Japan based off of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Radioactive residue turning a lizard into a mutant giant monster.\n\nThe sole idea here, was that the monster was basically created by our stupidity with warfare activities that took place a long time ago. Something that emerged from our wrong doings. A giant monster karma of a problem to put it in short words. This monster wasn't evil. But it had the instincts of an enraged creature seeking exploration of its surroundings and clashing with humans for the second time.\n\nThe film, Godzilla 1985 (Gojira 1984 in japans aka Gojira Returns), pretty much successfully set that idea and created a very respected, inspiring and intense movie that was ahead of its own time. The 80s.\n\nThis new American Godzilla film however, changed and denied 80% of the original creator's intention and turned our beloved monster into gargantuan mush.\n\nAnd for those who are saying \"who cares, its just a monster movie\", you're a disgrace to the G-fan base whether you care so or not. Therefore your sub-standard ideals about movie quality no longer hold weight to me.\n\nI'm the kind of person that pushes a job until it cant be pushed no more. I'm all about top notch quality. Not just visual quality, but EVERYTHING quality. Story had to be much better than this nonsense. It could have been good. Really good. But it really wasn't. It just wasn't. The special effects, amazing in its own respect to the artists behind them, did not aid the movies direction. The major disrespectful approach to change an iconic monster into a chicken legged giant iguana, really let a lot of fans down and with good reason as that thing just wasn't God'fricken'zilla.\n\nHowever... had the film been renamed to its actual now fan labeled name \"Zilla\", I would have not had been received as badly. Dropping any expectations and possibly even appreciating this movie only as a second rate monster movie. Which would probably have helped it in terms of reputation.\n\nAnd yes, I do understand that this monster is no longer called Godzilla in Japan either. It is now known ONLY as \"Zilla\" by the Japanese. It was so iffy, they couldn't take in what the American bought license did to their beloved monster. I mean, let's be honest. When the news first leaked out about an American release of Godzilla, we were all hyped up expecting that same powerful iconic nostalgic feeling we got in the 80's when Godzilla first hit Hollywood theaters. IT WAS HUGE NEWS!\n\nThats why many including I, feel this movie was a let down. Quality is everything. As a creator myself, I live by those words. If you adapt to low quality or moderate quality and tell yourself \"it was good\"... then you will never taste the fruit of a truly great quality production. And Im not going to discuss the Japanese G movies as those were understandably being made on low budgets. What do you expect with little money. :/ But for an American film, I really expected something that would have embedded itself in my memories as well as the memories of our kids today. Sort of like what Godzilla 1985 was back then.\n\nAlas, not this time. My chime. And Im sticking to it."

To this day I cannot believe that Matthew Broderick is the same actor who gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This guy hasn't done anything worth watching since then.\n\nLet me just state for the record, that hollywood couldn't have made a dumber looking godzilla than what they put in this one. And the mickey mouse plot was about enough to make me want to vomit for actually willingly giving away $6.25 of my money to see this worthless piece of work. I haven't seen a more predictable, overly dramatic plot using overly dramatic theme music (which was oh so annoying) since I saw Twister.\n\nI thought that Godzilla was supposed to have a cult following. I respect movies or actors that have earned those followers, hence the reason I wanted to see Godzilla. I had never really watched a godzilla flick from beginning to end before, so I figured I'd go to this one to see what the hype was about. I have rarely been as disappointed in my movie going life as I was on this day. Other movies that are comparable to this in terms of how poor and disappointing the movie was are in my mind Twister, Armegeddon, Scream 2 and 3, and Jurassic Park 3.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't sit through this movie again even if Hollywood offered to double my money back. Just horrible."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gojirah, or Godzilla as he is known in the west, has always been a bit of an embarrassment to the rest of us Lizards. He likes to brag about how popular and well-loved he is in Japan but the evidence in the west is far from conclusive. Let's face it, Godzilla films are what you watch after 14 pints of lager and a chicken vindaloo, late on a Friday night on channel 4. If you hadn't drunk 14 pints of lager there wouldn't be any conceivable reason for watching a Godzilla film. Ever since I heard that Roland Emmerich was going to remake Godzilla my question has been \u2013 why? Now I've seen the film and I still want my question answered \u2013 why make a new, very expensive film about some has-been reptilian for whom we lost all respect many years ago? We'll probably never know.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, finds Godzilla munching his way through Manhattan whilst Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and assorted military types try to hunt him down and kill him. There are two types of military involved \u2013 the usual Americans and the French secret service (guess who). Broderick is pretty good and Reno is too, though he only seems to ever play variations on his Leon character these days. Broderick's love interest, played by Maria Pitillo, (don't ask me, never heard of her) is very very irritating and sets back the cause of women's liberation by several decades. It's noticeable in this film that the women are all idiots. Mind you, so are all the men. A couple of the military guys are quite well portrayed but in general the characterisation is abysmal throughout.\n\nThe film, like many these days, is too long. The first half hour in particular is so dreadful that I really thought about leaving. But then it picks up, at least in terms of action. The effects are pretty good though not the best I've ever seen. Godzilla being pursued by choppers through the Manhattan skyscrapers works well though when you stop to think about it you can see that they really are models and not skyscrapers. Godzilla chasing various folks through Manhattan is also good, especially the final chase. But I have to concur with the chap I overheard talking to his mate in the Gents after the film \u2013 \"I liked the bits with the little 'uns in best.\" Yes, not content with one Godzilla, Emmerich also serves us up with several hundred freshly hatched Godzillaettes for our brave heroes to battle it out with.\n\nThe egg scenes are pinched from the first Alien film, no question. (Godzilla's head is surprisingly like the Alien head too.) The flashlights used in these scenes even simulate the strobe effects in Alien. The little Godzillas are basically Spielberg's raptors but lots of them. Actually I think Emmerich does it better than Spielberg and the raptors, sorry small Godzillas, are the highlight of the film. As you might expect, Reno, Broderick and co walk unscathed through the raptors whilst minor French secret service types get eaten, even though they are not wearing red jerseys.\n\nAnyway, it was nice to see uncle Godzilla back on form. Don't bother turning up until the film has been running for 30 minutes, don't expect too much but enjoy the effects and the mini-Godzillas. Oh, and I bet you 50p that you can guess what the very last scene in the film is before it ever arrives.\n\nPS Please resist drinking Pepsi, buying a Swatch watch or renting a video from Blockbuster on your way home from the cinema. This film has the most blatant product placements I have ever seen and they really intrude in several key scenes."

        "review_title": "My Personal Review of \"GODZILLA (1998).\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "OK, let me just start of by saying this: I am NOT going to try to force others to feel the same way about this film as I do, NO. But I do have to be honest here and just come out and say it: I am seriously SICK AND TIRED of all of the negative hardcore Godzilla purist BULL HONKY that \"Godzilla 1998\" keeps getting! I mean, to simply say \"I don't like this movie,\" state your valid reasons why (in a NICE and RESPECTABLE manner), and just leave it at that, I can honestly accept viewpoints like that. But what I can't accept are many hardcore Godzilla fans taking the TriStar film WAY to seriously, OVER-BLOWING their negative opinions on it to RIDICULOUS levels, and treating the movie like it shouldn't have existed. THAT I CANNOT except, and trashing a movie like this in that exact manner SERIOUSLY CANNOT BE.\n\nOK, with that said, I just want to say that I am a true fan of \"Godzilla 1998\" and I always will be. NOBODY is going to force me to think of this film differently, NOBODY. Now do not get me wrong, I WAS familiar with the classic Toho Godzilla and I truly LOVE the original Big G and everything that has made him a cultural icon. I like to think of Roland Emmerich's 100% American take on Godzilla (which is what it's SUPPOSED to be in the first place)as a very fun, entertaining movie that has a well-executed plot/story that actually makes sense (for me at least), very well-developed human characters that are relate-able as real people and move the narrative along, and a creature that IS a very realistic depiction of Godzilla.\n\nNow I've heard about the scientific inaccuracies related to this film, and I say that conventional scientific thinking DOES NOT APPLY AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO APPLY. You see, in this movie, even though Godzilla (or \"Zilla\" as the film's creature is now called) is a mutated marine iguana, that's just what he is, a MUTANT. He's MUTATED. Conventional scientific knowledge and facts about real-life marine iguanas honestly DOESN'T APPLY because Godzilla (a.k.a. Zilla) is a MUTANT. His entire anatomy and body structure has adjusted to suit a very different lifestyle & diet. His reproductive system has also developed in a way it which it's SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT from how most other reptiles reproduce. Plus, \"Zilla\" has to have SOME WAY of spreading his species, so the way the movie handles it makes sense. And by the way, about the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park?\" If you remember from that film, SOME of the dinosaurs TRANSFORMED THEIR GENDER AND BECAME MALES. In \"Godzilla 1998,\" he has the ability to REPRODUCE ASEXUALLY, there's a difference between the two. Finally, the Baby Godzillas (a.k.a. Baby-Zillas) are NOT rip-offs of the \"Jurassic Park\" Velociraptors! They look EXACTLY like their parent, only in baby form, people! SHEESH!\n\nNow I don't know about anyone else out there, but I believe the main reason for the negative bashing from both the hardcore Godzilla fans and the critics is that people keep comparing this to the Toho Godzilla series when really, \"Godzilla 1998\" SHOULDN'T be compared with the latter and I don't think it's supposed to be compared with the Toho films at all. This, to me, is a 100% American, alternate universe version of the same character of Godzilla. I repeat: A 100% American, ALTERNATE UNIVERSE VERSION OF THE SAME CHARACTER OF GODZILLA. That's how I see it, and there may be folks out there who see this in a similar fashion. It's NOT supposed to be compared to the Toho films at all because when Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin set out to make \"Godzilla 1998,\" they had it in their minds to give America IT'S OWN GODZILLA while keeping their version true to the original in some ways.\n\nFor example, \"Zilla (I personally call him Godzilla, but that's just me)\" does have a breath weapon. I really DON'T CARE NOR SHOULD IT REALLY MATTER what exactly comes out of his mouth. In my mind, as long as something deadly comes out of his mouth, then Godzilla USA has a breath weapon just like his Toho counterpart. Also, most conventional military weapons really DON'T do any thing to stop him; they just leave tiny scratches on his body. Not even submarine torpedoes could kill him! And even though \"Zilla\" didn't completely destroy all of New York, he truly DID DESTROY stuff in general (vehicles, villages, boats and a fishing ship). Finally, there are plates on \"Zilla's\" back just like his Japanese counterpart. Should it really matter what exact shape the plates are? I say 'NO, NOT REALLY' to that. Bottom line, if this film's creature has a breath weapon, is near-invincible, and has plates on his back, then he's good enough for me as GODZILLA.\n\nMost others will disagree with me on this review, but that's truly OK. I really do respect other people's opinions on \"Godzilla 1998\" even though I don't agree with them. All I wanted to do here is put in my own personal two cents about this film. And while it's fan-base isn't nearly as big as the one surrounding the Toho series, TriStar's film IS loved & supported by a good number of people (myself included). And really, that makes me smile!\n\nSo in conclusion, I personally give \"Godzilla 1998\" 5 out of 5 stars in all conventional areas of film-making, cinematic storytelling, character & relationship development, and action & creature design/animation.\n\nSo this is me, signing off. Enjoy!"

If read many books, played many games, collected many cards or little figures or whatever and watched many Japanese movies about this legacy...\n\nAnd then, I watched this American remake.

The few characters are kind of superficial, the most important scenes are entirely created on the computer and Godzilla doesn't look like the original one, but rather like a silly rip-off from the \"Alien\" movies. Everything that made the Japanese movies special and interesting is missing in this movie. That's why, even though most of the actors had signed for two sequels, there has not been a second American movie about Godzilla - thanks! The only thing this movie was good for was the fact that it brought the legendary Japanese monster to a larger public. And it was good to see an entertaining action movie (if we forget about the Japanese context) with some ice effects in the cinema - but nothing more."

This movie, on the other hand, is a dog in any language.\n\nThe first Japanese Godzilla film is an exploration of the atomic threat; Godzilla is not so much a monster as he is a walking symbol of the nuclear bomb. In this film, radiation does play a part in mutating Godzilla into a giant, stooped-over and ludicrous-looking iguana, but the \"cautionary tale\" aspect of the original concept is lost. Godzilla is supposed to be a condemnation of America's use of the bomb, but in this film, we pawn off the blame for Godzilla's creation on the French - how lame is that?\n\nRidiculous attempts have been made to make the creature more \"realistic.\" It reproduces (just so we can have a \"Jurassic Park\" ripoff sequence involving raptor-like babies), it doesn't breathe radioactive fire (arguably the coolest thing about the old Godzilla - why change a thing like that?), and it's not indestructible (again, another cool trait of the original creature is lost). The old Godzilla waded through buildings, fire, missiles, lasers, EVERYTHING, on a mission of total destruction; the American Godzilla runs around New York, squawking and burrowing underground like a camera-shy mole. Pathetic.\n\nGodzilla is one of the greatest science fiction icons out there, despite the negative (and poorly informed) opinions of his American viewers. This movie, however, is a poor tribute to the big G, and an astounding waste of money as well. The original films are full of great imagery, ranging from poetic to just downright funky. There are no compelling visuals here to equal the sight of Mothra hatching and spreading its wings in \"GMK,\" or Godzilla squaring off against a three-headed gold dragon in the \"Ghidorah\" films, etc. With all of the imaginative imagery removed, along with the Japanese culture, social commentary, and mysticism, the Godzilla concept is stale and ludicrous.\n\nAs the closing credits for this movie began to roll, I groaned. Audibly. That's the only time I've ever done something like that in a movie. I mean, how hard is it to get this concept right? All I wanted was a radiation-shooting, indestructible dinosaur smashing through a city. I didn't even expect the subtexts to survive. But my modest expectations were not met. Godzilla is not only an inaccurate adaptation, it's also boring, and that's just plain unforgivable."

I really love the scene with the old guy fishing and running for his life! The sound is also pretty awesome, it's a great demo movie to test your sound equipment. The pace/speed in this movie is good, overall it's just a light hearted action movie and one of the better ones! I really don't understand why you can call this a bad movie, probably because you don't like this kind of movies? Go watch something else!! Go buy this one! I always expected a Godzilla 2 btw. just filling up the rest of the 10 lines here"

Seemingly, everyone should have considered the famous Japanese movies about the eponymous monster leveling Tokyo to be sacrosanct. But the people behind \"Independence Day\" obviously didn't. They turned the big guy into an overgrown iguana. And the plot? The \"plot\", if we can call it that, involves two hours of destruction. The major problem with movies like this is that we want to see more of the title character and less of the people trying to figure out what to do; but that's what makes it a formula movie. Can't they just make something with a real plot?! Oh, I forgot to mention the characters. They're the types whom you want to see get crushed by the monster. The movie wastes Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria (I don't recall Maria Pitillo from anything else; \"Godzilla\" may have ruined her chances). Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner and Harry Shearer also star. They're probably embarrassed about this.\n\nSo, avoid it at all costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even with my expectations set at a very low level, this American 'interpretation' of Godzilla was genuinely painful to watch.\n\nYes, I knew it would not be the same as the good ol' Japanese Goji films I'm familiar with. It's drastically different, in fact. The American Godzilla is a good deal smaller than the oriental original, and also a bit more polite. Whereas any kaiju monster worth it's salt would go ploughing right -through- the buildings of whatever city it'd find in it's way, Ameri-Goji has been brought up well and politely walks along the streets, merely scratching one or two buildings. Heck, with the way the buildings actually tower over the monster instead of vice-versa, it's not surprising that the military end up doing more damage than the monster does. Seeing a skinny lizard taking a walk along some American buildings I've never heard of is not my idea of a fierce monster turning a giant metropole (preferably Tokyo) into a sea of fire and debris. Compared to the Asian example, the American Goji is a monster-wimp.\n\nWhile initially disappointing to anyone who likes proper giant monster flicks, this different approach is not the problem. If they had done a different-style monster movie that was actually any good, the whole world would not be spitting vomit all over this film. Alas, they screwed up very royally. As soon as any of the characters opens his mouth to utter a sentence from the hopeless script, the whole thing falls to pieces.\n\n\"But it's a giant monster movie, so of course the plot is a bit daft and the characters aren't fascinatingly deep! It's what you should expect!\", is the standard rebuttal to anyone pointing out this film's multiple flaws. Only it doesn't work so easily. You can aim for a light-plot, silly 'fun' movie and get that wrong too, after all. And that's just what happened here; you can tell whenever the writers thought they were being terribly witty, exciting or even thoughtful with a certain line. And you can also immediately tell how wrong they were. When the characters make an attempt at being funny, likeable or showing some kind of personality (maybe even -shock!- character development), they fall flat on their faces with a loud thwack and only appear... well, stupid, really. They look stupid, sound stupid and behave in an incredibly stupid fashion. And when they're not being dopey, they're downright detestable. Matthew Broderick plays a whiny git who's face you'll want to smack in, \"Animal\" is the biggest cretin to have ever walked the earth, and then... there's Maria Pitillo. Oh, the sheer horror of it. If there is a silver lining to the cloud of this movie, it's that we can rest assured that she has forever killed off her \"acting career\" with her downright ridiculous under-performance in this film. It says a lot when one person manages to stand out as the absolute worst spot in an overall extremely bad movie.\n\nEven the monster itself isn't safe from the bad script. Here and there, attempts are made to evoke sympathy for the creature as being just an animal trying to survive. It doesn't work, though, and ends up looking like everything else in this movie - an embarrassingly failed attempt at being clever and cool. But then again, it's difficult to get really excited about a monster that's really just a big load of computer pixels on the screen.\n\nThere are so many other things terribly wrong with this film that one could fill an entire book with it (actually, that has already been done with the novelisation of this movie). Honorable mention goes out to the ludicrously ill-timed cuts from scene to scene which show especially painfully in the beginning of the film, and look utterly dreadful. Other examples; the monster is a wuss, for the aforementioned reasons - far too small and tame, hardly destructive, and possible to kill by puny helicopters. And that calls itself a kaiju? Or some typical American arrogance in an attempt to make the French look like a nation of evil psychopathic snobs - but even that goes wrong, as Jean Reno turns the joke around by being the only one in this film who seems to be somewhat in his right mind, lost in a sea of idiotic Americans. And the list goes on. It's just all depressingly dumb and all too obvious that this film fails hopelessly at anything it attempts. Maria Pitillo may not be able to act out a crying scene to save her life, but even she probably cried real, convincing tears before the finished product.\n\nUnless you're looking for good documentation on how -not- to do a movie, stay well away. Any of the 1970's kiddie-oriented Godzilla movies, with their ridiculous special effects and daft plots floor this sad attempt hand-down (the 1990's and 2000's Goji films blow this into orbit by just breathing at it). Quite simply because the staff knew what they were doing and had put some effort into delivering films that, while not deep or intelligent were plain good fun. There's a right way and a wrong way of doing everything, after all."

Next, onto the real star, the lizard. It was one of the least frightening things I've ever seen, and nothing more than a stripped down version of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. The only device in the movie that appeared to take more than ten minutes to come up with, Godzilla the creature was one big yawn. Nothing in this movie was original in the least. I saw scenes straight out of Jaws, Jurassic Park, previous Godzilla movies, King Kong, and many others."
