The part where the Englishman from the erstwhile East India company rants about India being a nation of snake charmers and the answer that Akshay politely gives him would gladden any person's heart. Katarina looks ravishing and communicates very well with her eyes. Her Hindi has also improved tremendously. Rishi Kapoor brings in a whiff of fresh air from his yesteryear's. Watch it with your better half. It'll make you both fell good about yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "Akshay Kumar! Akshay Kumar does such an incredible work in this movie, he becomes the heart and soul of it. A simple yet loving character played by him is so sensational couldn't describe in more words. Anybody would be in love with the character he is in the movie. Rishi Kapoor was amazing, magnificent. From the best of the cities to the simplest of the villages, the culture, the beauty, the nature, you'd learn it all in this movie. You learn how much impact the culture has on a person growing up. You learn the simplicity. You learn acceptance. You learn you haven't got the best, but you and your loved ones are the best. You see two different kinds of humans getting along with each other so beautifully but the modest one with his simplicity making sure he goes through the tough times, has patience and stays positive without losing the hope till the end. You will be in love not only with the plot, the characters and the whole story but more with the culture of the society. I loved even the songs in this movie, Rafta Rafta tera Afsana tera huaaa, rafta rafta, it suits the moment so much. It's not only gripping but made me cry like I was the last person watching this incredible work of art. We're obliged a team was able to create such a wonderful peace of work with enormous brilliance and magnificence. I loved Katrina's role too. I'd watch it with my kids sometime, tell them this is Akshay Kumar for you sons. Although he's the meme king of India, he's always in our hearts for the wonderful work he has committed to over the years with proper discipline. Thank you for reading it this long, you must've got to know I'm an Akshay Kumar fan, if not I'm drunk. Only the former is correct, but what I love is such work performed with absolute brilliance, be it comedy, be it action, but it's my hat off to this perfection. Talking about perfection, Welcome is a perfection in Comedy genre. I have my review over there too folks. Take care and enjoy every moment of life. No go don't waste much time, I'm a Writer I just wanted to pen down my thoughts. Thanks."

        "review_detailed_main": "Namastey London, tells the tale of British-Indian young lady, named Jasmeet (Katrina Kaif), who is taken to India by her parents to marry a nice, Indian man, Arjun (Akshay Kumar). However, this marriage is in trouble from the get-go, due to the fact that Jasmeet (or Jazz as she likes to be called), is in love with another man. The movie is a mixture of mainly two other films, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,and Purab Aur Pachhim. However, despite the fact that this movie carries similarities to these other films, it has the ability to hold its own ground, and this is primarily due to four factors: the acting, the cinematography, the Indian patriotism, and the humor.\n\nThe majority of actors have done their jobs well. Akshay is relaxed and comfortable in his role, as usual. Rishi Kapoor, is a stand-out in his role of a very loving, yet traditional father. However, it is Katrina Kaif's acting which is the problem. Katrina looks beautiful, and her physical acting is well-done, but her voice and diction still need serious work. In this movie, she was allowed to do her own voice-over, despite the fact that her Hindi is poor. The director thought that since she plays a British girl, this would be fine. I disagree. Even NRI's can speak Hindi well to a certain extent, but Katrina's Hindi is horrendous, and after a couple minutes of the movie, becomes very annoying."

Girl doesn't but so much happens in between that you cant just help laughing. Rishi kapoor is very funny in his role of a worried Punjabi father.Katrina is gorgeous she and Akshay make a good couple. The acting makes this movie good although the first half was a bit boring before Akshay's entry.. I think this film should do well.... All in all a fun film.. watch it .. enjoy it..then forget it..."

Apart from being badly made and failing cinematically, it is full of the nastiest, most vicious little stereotypes which leave a bad taste in the mouth and the toes curling. Whilst a satirical look at behaviour can be done successfully, this film failed to achieve it and came out looking like a piece of undisguised racism and sexism. It wasn't only the Brits who came in for a lashing either, but also younger NRIs. Whilst cinema does not have to carry a moral message, it should at least be entertaining in a way which does not demean its audience. Shame on you Vipul Amrutlal Shah, I only hope your next film will not be so unpleasant."

One of the best movie of entertainment and relation. Every time a parent is born in India,they always wish that even if they go far,they always be closer to Homeland.To me,they are special creations of Vipul Shah. The father of heroine is none other than Rishi Kapoor.Really he is a very good father. The soulful melodies and the hip hop is evergreen.OLove is blind but true love is when u let the other be happy. It would be bad if i did not tell about Katrina.She was too cute as she was at that time.At the same time ,she is witty to marry and not let them sign official documents.She is also courageous to decide and run the last minute for Akshay."

I have always thought Akshay Kumar to be one of the most entertaining actors in the industry and he proves it here again, though he very weird with his auburn hair. There are no surprises in the movie and the script religiously follows the standard formula. The only surprise for me was how much I enjoyed it even though I knew exactly what was going to happen.\n\nThe supporting cast is a lot of fun too. Rishi Kapoor should definitely be tapped more often for comedic roles. All in all by the end, when Akshay Kumar sets the world right and all Indians are proud of their heritage, you are happy you came to the movie."

Katrina Kaif plays Jazz, a British born white-wannabe. Her voice is dubbed and the Hindi is spoken with a strange Martian accent, the English in a FOB faux American accent. Neither language is enunciated clearly and I was left with the feeling that maybe she was deaf person who had just learnt to speak - kind of like Marlee Matlin in Children of a Lesser God! Akshay Kumar was his usual annoying self, here through no fault of his own but rather due to very poor writing he ends up as a pretend Punjabi from Hicksville. When he laughs he is OK, but when he cries you want to cry in pain from the hideous acting job. His behavior is irrational - if he wants Jazz to love him for himself then why does he speak to her in English as he is leaving? And that is what makes her change her mind? So this is yet another vilification of the NRIs as ridiculous, vain, self-centered, shallow people! Upen Patel was most pathetic, Rishi Kapoor did a decent job, rest of the cast kind of muddled along. Music was strangely unappealing to me. And the members of the cast that played the Britishers were atrocious - ruling the heap was the Charlie Brown fellow. If the NRIs were somewhat spared the Brits were soundly vilified and slammed as religious bigots and racists. 1947 is long gone guys, it is time to move along!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The truth is I never really wanted to see this film, my friend probably called me when I was preoccupied with some work, and since the tickets had already been purchased I ended up going for this film.\n\nThe first thing that occurs to you in this movie is that this movie gives lots of importance to Katrina Kaif , Neither HER ACTING NOR HER DANCING HAS IMPROVED BUT THANKS TO SALMAN HER STOCK HAS SOARED AND THE FILM-MAKERS HAVE CASHED IN ON THE NEW FOUND STAR STATUS, besides that I'm sure Katrina's Diary had much more time that Akshays.\n\nThe fact is though that she looks absolutely stunning in the movie and is THE MOST PERFECT EXAMPLE OF CASTING FOR THE PART OF THE SPOILT British DESI (probably because she is one), people may complain that she cant act (dubbing was perfect because she actually cant speak Hindi well and fit the part perfectly) or cant dance but WEAKNESSES APART I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AND AT THE RISK OF BEING BEATEN UP BY SALMAN I SAY THAT I AM WILLING TO MARRY HER.\n\nThe story line is as filmy as it gets and is inspired from classics such as Purab aur Paschim mainly with lots of influence from others such as Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam Etc.\n\nThis movie clearly has the hangover from the films of yesteryear's with overacting from the entire cast especially from the side characters a particular scene is the one where Upen is thrown from the house.\n\nThe entire film is filled with stereotypes, the most annoying one was that all foreigners are bad and all Indians are good, and obviously THE Indian NARI CAN DO NO WRONG SHE MAY STRAY BUT IN THE END DESI SABHYATA WINS.\n\nSome really annoying scenes were the monologues about the greatness of Indians and India, and the scenes where Katrinas foreign boyfriend was shown with enough flaws to the point of making him a criminal really we get the point to add to that we have scenes were a foreigner asks a Pakistani to change his religion etc etc. TALK ABOUT FILMY.\n\nOveracting was decent all around no one really overacted enough to really get on your nerves.\n\nThis film has lots of moments though such as the Rugby match, Akshays entry and Katrinas awkwardness in rural Punjab, ALSO MY FAVOURITE SCENE WHERE KATRINA GOES TO SEE THE BOYS WHOM A MARRIAGE AGENT HAS CHOSEN THE TAKE ON SAAS BAHU SERIALS HAD ME FALLING OUT OF MY SEAT IN LAUGHTER.\n\nBesides this movie has lots of feel good and fun moments and almost each one is as filmy as it gets.\n\nThe lesser that is said about the songs is better though the Song Chakana was brilliantly edited for the screen and the sound effects really made an otherwise unbearable 5th song tolerable.\n\nTHE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE EVER IS THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THE Filmmakers HAD THE DECENCY TO HAVE STUFF WRITTEN IN Hindi AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF SUBTITLES TO EXPLAIN THE English DIALOGUES EXTRA CREDIT FOR THE SUBTITLES MAKING SENSE TO AND NOT USING HIFI Hindi.\n\nTechnically this movie was good with lots of experimenting with different types of colours and maybe even cameras. Again the beauty of India is too great for much credit to go to shots of India.\n\nFor a movie that is so filmy there is surprisingly less melodrama with only a couple of really melodramatic scenes.\n\nAt the cost of sounding Gay I must say that Akshays hair looks hideous.\n\nEven though this is the most filmy movie to come out in recent times its actually a welcome change from the DIFFERENT FORMULA FLICKS this movie is filmy and it never tries to act otherwise.\n\nNot for those who like their cinema serious or expect a high standard of acting, direction etc. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS ORDINARY BUT MANAGES TO RISE BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF GOOD SCENES AND FOCUS ON Hindi ,but those who are sure they can enjoy a super filmy Hindi flick will definitely come out satisfied.\n\nGood for family as well as friends viewing.\n\n-s overacting all around, some really annoying and slightly melodramatic scenes, pathetic songs (god save me from Himmace).\n\n+/-s super filmy, Katrina (is she the perfect Desi blonde MARRY ME PLEASE).\n\n+s lots of feel good and some really funny scenes ,SUBITITLES AND Hindi CREDITS FINALLY, filmy but not overly melodramatic, good technically superb sound editing, never tries to be anything else.\n\ntotal 5+2=7/10 (not factoring in the fact that it was above expectations the 2 extra points are for the focus on Hindi and the absolutely hilarious matchmaking scene and the take on the Saas Bahu serial I just cracked up some time back when I saw my mom watching the Mega Event of the merger of the big K serials)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jasmeet (Katrina Kaif) was raised in London and has turned into a wild young woman, rejecting her Indian roots and going by the appropriate name of \"Jazz\". Her father (Rishi Kapoor) takes her on a trip through India, ending in his hometown in Punjab. While there, he marries her (not willingly) to his best friend's son, Arjun (Ashkay Kumar). When the couple returns to London, Jazz announces that she doesn't recognize the Indian marriage, and proceeds with her plans of becoming the fourth wife of her boss (Clive Standen). Arjun, must either give in gracefully and lose his wife, or find a way to fight for his marriage by showing Jazz that true love can win.\n\nThe plot is cute and fun, and I enjoyed it. Kumar is a good actor and played both comedy and serious well. I'm not fond of Kaif, and don't feel that she is a particularly good actress, but she was well suited for this role. The supporting cast (especially Nina Wadia) are excellent. The locations and cinematography were great. However, I actively disliked the club music/dancing, and for me that lowered the movie from four stars to three."

The film stars Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Late Rishi Kapoor, Nina Wadia, Javed Sheikh, Upen Patel and Clive Standen.\n\nA man takes his thoroughly-British daughter to his home country, India. There, he arranges her marriage to someone she considers a fool. The daughter attempts to outwit them, but the groom quietly and patiently hatches his own plan.\n\nA good light hearted film which could've been better but still the film entertains. The credit should be given to Akshay Kumar as he almost single handedly carries the film on his shoulders.\n\nPlot of the film is good and execution is also good. The film has some good comedy scenes and will tickle your funny bone.\n\nScreenplay of the film is good and could've been better and more gripping. Acting is superb by almost all the actors be it Rishi Kapoor, Javed Sheikh, Nina Wadia and Clive Standen. Akshay Kumar was the best amongst them. Katrina kaif looked beautiful in the film but her acting in the film is terrible.\n\nMusic is nice and the film has some great songs, BGM is nice and climax is also good. This film can be watched once and will not disappoint."

I am half Indian, born and raised in the USA and i know a British accent when i hear one. I think Katrina usually has an American accent when she speaks English but that doesn't explain why she didn't act in a British accent! But anyways, she was beautiful in this movie and i loved it!

Salim-Suliaman did a good job. Songs are okay but not too impressive.\n\nAkshay Kumar did well in his role as the 'Funjabi' boy. Katrina Kaif surprisingly delivered a good performance. She suited her role well. She had the British-Indian look and it is there in speech as well. She did have her moments. The movie actually belonged to Rishi Kapoor with his excellent performance.

        "review_title": "Wow, Surprisingly Wonderful!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "I've been wanting to review this movie since I saw it a few months ago, mainly because I think it's so underrated. I only got it for my sister who was on an Akshay Kumar trip. I've seen dozens of typical Bollywood romances and while I usually find them entertaining in one way or another, they generally fail as \"romantic comedies\". They might be a bit funny here and there, but as for being really romantic? Hardly. I can only think of a few films like DDLJ and KKHH that made my heart skip a beat with their love story. Hence I was surprised to find myself completely drawn in and moved by the romance in this film. There are some wonderful moments, such as the \"ishq di mere mitra pehchaan ki\",the Veeraniya song, the ballroom dance lesson.\n\nThere are too many \"pros\" for this movie, so hopefully I don't run out of space listing them. Katrina Kaif: regardless of what people say, she's utterly charming, adorable, and in this film at least her acting's spot on. Akshay Kumar is the only older actor that can convincingly play a youngish guy opposite a young actress without making me uncomfortable or indignant. He oozes coolness and sexiness in this film, and gives a wonderful performance. The basic plot of this movie was unique, to me at least, and I loved it. I love the fact that Jazz's family are not super rich -- no false images of fame and glory in a foreign country for the Indians watching this. The conflict between traditional values and a comfortable material life is portrayed wonderfully through the characters of Jazz's parents and Kumar's character, and the issues that immigrants face are discussed in a way I haven't seen in other Indian films. The soundtrack is unique, and one of the best. I love it more every time I listen. And the musical numbers fit the film perfectly, with excellent choreography. It doesn't try to be a comedy, but the funny moments come at the right moments and really made me laugh. The general production -- directing, acting, editing, etc. -- is far above what you tend to see in Bollywood movies. It's VERY well made, which surprised me.\n\nThere is one big drawback to this film, and as you might suspect it's the treatment of Anglo-British people. As is routine in patriotic Indian movies, they are portrayed as morally loose, culturally insensitive douchebags. I understand the need to contrast \"pure\" Indian values with \"corrupt\" Western ones, but they really go overboard in at least two scenes. Some scenes, such as Jazz's fianc\u00e9 making fun of Akshay during the rugby match, portray racism against Indians in a more accurate and less anachronistic way -- they should have retained such lower-key moments and scratched the exaggerated stuff. Another aspect of this movie that Western viewers might not love is the sense of moral superiority in the characters of Jazz's father and Akshay, and the suggestion that the only thing that can save her from the corruption of the West is a good Indian husband. To me, though, this suggestion was couched in such a convincing love story that I really didn't see it that way. It also helps that Akshay's character isn't self satisfied throughout the film, but actually gets his heart broken. One more thing: some of the music numbers sound like they were recorded in a fish tank. It's a shame since they're all so good."

Moreover, no self-respecting hot-blooded desi Punjabi is going to hang around London watching his 'wife' paint the town red with her fianc\u00e9- a spoilt and thrice-divorced heir of a British tycoon- in the hope that she will eventually come running back into his arms. As things turn out, that is exactly what happens.\n\nOnly two sequences stand out: first, the family's hilarious interviewing of suitable matches for their daughter, including a lap-top yielding software-analyst from Hyderabad who demands to have a premarital 'physical compatibility' test with the prospective bride-to-be, and another loony from Delhi who thinks he is a character in an Ekta Kapoor soap-opera; secondly, a family scene at the dinner table, which stands out for Rishi Kapoor's efforts at suppressing his laughter. Apart from this, there is nothing else to the film.\n\nWatch it only if you haven't got anything better to do. Or, as in the case of Mohit Singhania, if your world begins and ends with Ms. Kaif! AJ"

It has good quantity and quality of humor, romance, music, emotions\u0085 almost everything you would spend your money for.\n\nAkshay Kumar is as charming as ever. He is probably the most under rated actor of this generation. He has an amazing comic timing, he carries emotional sequences quite comfortably, and he can dance and looks great. He easily carries the whole film on his shoulders. Rishi Kapoor has not lost the innocence since his \"Bobby\" days even a single bit. In ever improving Upen Patel, we seem to have found someone to step into Pran's shoes, a character artiste who, with his style and screen presence can match, sometimes even overshadow, the lead actor. But the real stunner is Katrina Kaif. She looks ravishing in entire film. She looks good in whatever she wears, whatever she does. Sometimes you cannot stop wondering, where this beauty was hidden in all her previous films. She has never looked better. And with improved acting abilities and cutest of voices, she's all equipped to kill. You can easily watch this one only for her\u0085 whatever other good this film has to offer would be a bonus.\n\nStory is simple, sweet and predictable. In fact you would know the climax from the very first shot. But it's the treatment that keeps you hooked. One never feels dragged. And if you are an Indian, this is a real feel good film. You cannot stop your Goosebumps when Akshay Kumar delivers speech describing India to a British. And there is finely blended India-Pakistan friendship. Don't be surprised if while laughing all the way, sometimes in between you find your eyes moist.\n\nDirector Vipul Amrutlal Shah scores a hat trick\u0085!! After Aankhein and Waqt, this is his third consecutive good product. His next would be worth waiting for.\n\nBut don't wait for this one. Go and watch it. Right away."

Completely commercial movie, about love, about India, about culture and still...refreshing.\n\nAkshay is great...he really has carried the movie on his shoulder. He is stylish and have given a natural and yet perfect performance. Katrina is beautiful and still, is not just an eye-candy. Rishi Kapoor was the perfect choice for a helpless father of a brat. He expresses \"what-to-do\" attitude superbly. Javed Sheikh...not a very big role though, I have always admired his acting. He and Rishi had a terrific chemistry. Upen Patel...I don't know if its his looks or acting..I don't like him much. However, the movie carried it away and he did not bother me much. Clive Standon is good....not a typical bad guy....but did his job properly.\n\nAllover, the movie travels slowly from London to India and then back to London. The story shows, how \"cool\" it is to break own cultures and adopt to others, while the \"others\" might not even accept you. How easy it is to say, that I am grown up and how tough it is to act like one. How easy it is to say, that nobody can take my freedom away..and how hard it is to accept the responsibilities of freedom.\n\nAgain, as last words, with all due respect to the British people, there are still some group of individuals, who like to think India as a backdated area and wants to show us down. Again, the vice versa of this applies to us Indians too. So, please follow Akshay's word and do not to try to show anybody that we are better than you. If we are, everybody will come to know that. History does not forget anything.\n\nPlease watch the movie...u will like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being an European girl married to an Indian man, i was deeply consonant with Jazz's role. I am intrigued by some facts such as: why the British dude comes from a rich family, is selfish and unstable, why presenting the Europeans as ignorant about India and Indian culture, why picturing European girls as easy girls, addicted to nightclub life and indecent clothing, why keeping such high barriers between Indian values and European ones.\n\nWe live in a world where inter-cultural relationships are becoming more and more present. Globalization, advanced technology and communication means, migration of people to more developed countries are prime criteria for this.\n\nFor me, this movie presents the pattern thinking of a generation of people that cant accept these changes, with a defensive attitude, a fear from losing native values and beliefs.\n\nIt is more comfortable to stick to these stereotypes than to try a real and open communication.\n\nI Love India, I admire and I respect Indian culture, Indian people, and I am proud to be a Hindi patni."

        "review_title": "Namastey London is too long for a story that's too familiar to begin with.",
        "review_detailed_main": "In director Vipul Shah's Namastey London, Katrina Kaif plays an Indian girl born and raised in the UK, who's turned out to be something of an infant terrible who guzzles vodka like it's water, dresses in micro-minis under her salwar-kameez, and frightens away prospective grooms by telling them false stories about her promiscuity. But worse than all of this, and the reason her dad's having sleepless nights actually, is because she's seriously considering a marriage proposal from her white boyfriend, a cad who's already been married thrice in the past.No wonder daddy dearest Rishi Kapoor whisks her off to good ol' Bharat where after several failed attempts to find a suitable groom for his daughter, he finally coaxes her to tie the knot with the son of an old friend, a sort of small-town bumpkin Akshay Kumar, who's already fallen head over heels in love with his peaches-and-cream complexioned wife. Promising to consummate their marriage back in London, Katrina brings Akshay home, but only to reveal to him and to her parents that this shaadi was all a sham, and her heart still beats only for her gora boyfriend. Shaken, but not entirely defeated, Akshay decides he's going to stay on and win her back with love. I can bet my last pay-cheque that the one thought that came to your head while you heard me narrate the film's plot is: 'Hey, haven't I heard this story before?' Well, yes, you have and several times over actually. It's clear, straight off the bat, that Namastey London is a been-there-seen-that story inspired from a variety of films including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam to name just two. Look, the one thing that a film must have in order to hold your interest, is unpredictability. It's very unlikely that you're going to enjoy a film if you know exactly how it's going to turn out in the end. But let's face it, unpredictability of plot is something that very few Hindi films can boast of. In which case, when you do know what direction a film is going in, when you do know what's going to happen at the end of the film, the only thing that is likely to keep you entertained, is the manner in which the filmmaker or the writers arrive at that ending.You know the beginning, you know the end - now can they make the middle so interesting and so unique that you're willing to stay with the film even though you know where it's all leading upto? The same is true of Namastey London. It's a Hindi film, you know Akshay Kumar is going to melt Katrina's heart in the end, now we just need to know how he does it.Vipul Shah and his writers use the old-fashioned approach - true love conquers all. Some of you may find that archaic and outdated, but once in a while I think earnestness, sincerity and some old-fashioned simplicity can do the trick. Namastey London certainly has its heart in the right place. But sadly it goes about making its point in the stupidest manner. Why is it essential to portray every white person as a racist bigot in order to convey what a desh-bhakt our hero is? That party scene in which a white man makes Indian jokes only to be put in his place by Akshay is so over-the-top and so blatantly manipulative, it makes you cringe. Ditto for that scene at the mosque where Akshay drives sense into Upen Patel's head by explaining to him why nothing and no one's worth changing one's name and religion for - it's a scene that's screaming out for a pat on the back - \"Look at all the good values we're trying to propagate.\" Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a cynic, I'm just saying this film is so caught up being self-congratulatory that it doesn't even realize where its slipping up. Like the humour for example, which is so juvenile at most times. Or all the stereotypes that the film tends to reinforce.By the time the lights finally come on and the end credits begin to roll, you feel like you've been in that hall for what seems like an eternity. Namastey London is too long for a story that's too familiar to begin with. It's not a bad film, but it's often dull and you can pretty much predict its every next step. Of the actors Upen Patel turns in a surprisingly decent piece as a British-Asian boy confronted with cultural dilemmas. Now if only he'd work on his dialogue delivery and accent, they wouldn't have to dub his voice. And someone please ask him to keep his shirt on, we've seen enough of his shaved torso already. As the patient and hopeful romantic, Akshay Kumar plays his most restrained role yet, and he's not bad at all, it's just that his character seems so ludicrous; you're unable to take him too seriously. For Katrina Kaif, playing the rebellious protagonist of this film, it's a part that fits her like a glove. Her acting's also considerably improved since the last time she was on screen.But for me, the only actor really worth mentioning in this film is Rishi Kapoor. Both in his comic scenes and his dramatic portions, he brings a degree of naturalness that none of the other actors can serve up. He is easily the emotional anchor of this film and his performance; it's only real strength.In many ways it's modeled after those well-meaning 70s films - one part Dev Anand romance, one part Manoj Kumar patriotic saga. It's sweet and it's simple but that's just the question - do we still have an appetite for steamed rice when everyone else is eating biryani?"

I would recommend that you watch it if you were in love, are in love or ever want to be in love. Its a special understanding for someone who lives abroad like me,and if you do too, you will appreciate it! The movie takes you on a journey that you perhaps have been on before, and this one you will still want to take. Needless to say its a Hindi film with the usual goof ups and slapstick humor,but if you have understood the emotion behind it, the director's task is accomplished. Watch it with family, friends, your love, and it will make more sense."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story begins with Jazz's parents tricking her into a trip to India, where they hope to marry her off to a suitable Indian boy. Enter Arjun, a charming farmer from Punjab, who is as traditional as Jazz is modern. Despite their immediate cultural clash, Arjun falls in love with Jazz and is determined to win her heart and respect. The film then takes us on a journey back to London, where Jazz must confront her feelings and the expectations of her Westernized life.\n\nStrengths:\n\nPerformances: Akshay Kumar shines as the earnest and endearing Arjun, bringing warmth and sincerity to his role. Katrina Kaif, though initially appearing a bit stiff, grows into her character and convincingly portrays Jazz's internal conflict. The supporting cast, including Rishi Kapoor and Upen Patel, add depth and humor to the narrative.\n\nCultural Exploration: The film does a commendable job of exploring the cultural tensions between Indian traditions and Western modernity. It highlights the identity struggles faced by the Indian diaspora and the generational differences in perceptions of love and marriage.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack by Himesh Reshammiya is catchy and memorable, with songs like \"Chakna Chakna\" and \"Rafta Rafta\" adding to the film's charm and appeal.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPredictable Plot: While the film's premise is engaging, the plot unfolds predictably. The cultural clashes and romantic developments follow a familiar trajectory, offering few surprises.\n\nCharacter Development: Some characters, particularly Jazz's friends and her Western suitor Charlie, are stereotypical and lack depth. More nuanced portrayals could have added complexity to the story.\n\nPacing: At times, the film's pacing feels uneven, with certain scenes dragging while others rush through key moments.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"Namastey London\" is a heartwarming and entertaining film that successfully blends humor and emotion. Its exploration of cultural identity and love's transformative power resonates well, even if the storyline remains somewhat predictable. Akshay Kumar's stellar performance and the film's musical score elevate it, making it a worthwhile watch for those who enjoy cross-cultural romantic comedies. Despite its flaws, \"Namastey London\" charms its way into the audience's hearts, offering a pleasant cinematic experience."
