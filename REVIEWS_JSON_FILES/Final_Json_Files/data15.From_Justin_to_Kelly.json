This is not a bad movie - it's a war crime. Somehow the producers actually managed to cast supporting players bad enough to make Kelly Clarkson and even the talent free Justin Guarini seem good by comparsion.\n\nThe alleged \"choreography\" ammounts to nothing more than frantic flailing of limbs. Accents come and go with wild abandon. The songs are, to put it charitably, forgettable. I'm surprised \"American Idol\" judge Randy Jackson isn't credited as a writer, because the dialouge is that witless and badly phrased.\n\nThis is the worst thing humanity has ever done."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, it finally came on cable. And, in order to keep up my credentials as an expert on badfilm, I had to deal with this monstrosity sooner or later. So, without further ado...\n\nOh...my...God...\n\nWho thought this was a good idea? Trying to make a quick buck off of a flavor-of-the-week TV show I can understand, but who thought this had any chance of success? Too retarded for anyone over 14; too campy and too much like a \"Gidget\" remake for the 9-14 set; too much skin for the \"Barney the Dinosaur\" crowd. Not enough plot for a 30 minute sitcom, and every teensploiter movie clich\u00e9 ever, without either the humor (the saving grace for the good ones) or the nudity (sometimes, the saving grace for the bad ones). Anyway, a few random notes:\n\n1. One of the first songs was Kelly Clarkson's remake of \"Vacation\" by the Go-Go's. I always considered this to be a light, bouncy pop song. That was, of course, until Kelly and her overproduction team sucked the life out of it. Now as bouncy as a Complin Service, this one made me wish for a brief return of the early, punk, Go-Go's, who probably would have roughed up anyone who did one of their songs this badly.\n\n2. Justin, teen heartthrob? He is so thin I might be able to tie a string to him and fly him on a high wind day! With that 'fro, he looks a little like a pipe cleaner. Note to the Director: having Justin wear a black shirt when all the other guys in a song set are shirtless is not hiding anything; he sticks out like, well like a black pipe cleaner in a sea of artificial tan.\n\n3. Aw, look: the obvious backstabbing friend/ nemesis slut girl with the hee-haw southern accent is trying to steal Kelly's scenes away from her by overacting in contrast to Kelly's underacting! Sorry, young lady obviously chosen for your ability to pack a small swimsuit: nobody who cares is watching.\n\n4. Justin's \"nerd\" friend/ sidekick: you can almost see the lineage trace lines, going back through far superior nerd/ sidekicks (\"Better off Dead,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day off\"), all the way back to the early \"Beach Party\" movies and Rebel Without a Cause. In fact, his clothes seem to be lifted from the outfits from the early \"Beach Party\" movies' nerd/sidekick wardrobes; if they actually date from the early 1960's, they might be considered retro/cool in some circles and thus worth more than the rest of this film.\n\n5. Oh, the intense chemistry between Justin and Kelly... Really, I am serious. Oh, yes. Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet, in Sense and Sensibility, were an overflowing cauldron of unrestrained sexual passion compared to these two. If Justin was trying to dispel those \"man's man\" rumors, this did nothing to help.\n\nHow to get the movie to go from sluggish to dead in the water: Justin and Kelly, alone, in a scene for more than five seconds.\n\n6. Kelly's nice black friend is being taken to a ritzy Latin nightclub, which is located in...an abandoned corrugated metal shack??? I need to check that abandoned building on the next block; the Cotton Club might have started a branch there. Mitigating factor: the Latin dancers were way more talented than the blandly white beach dancers in the other scenes.\n\n7. OK, Kelly, so you admire Bjork. I can see you appreciate her independence, willingness to go her own way, and most of all given your situation, her career longevity. If you want to do a homage to Bjork, altering your bland, middle-of-the-road song delivery would be a good place to start. Your hairdo was, in fact, not a good place to start.\n\n8. Hee-haw girl does a bad impersonation of Madonna's \"Material Girl\" video. Which means, of course, she is doing an even worse second-derivative impersonation of Marilyn Monroe. This has no purpose other than to satisfy some requirement in her contract that she got to be the lead in one song number.\n\n9. Telepathic singing? Oh, no- \"Glitter\" flashbacks!\n\n10. Justin in a game of hovercraft dodge-ball? The stunt double must be a girl to get the sizes right. Oh, look, the danger: he has lost control of a motorized inflatable hovercraft in three feet of warm water!\n\n11. Hee-haw evil girl is proud of notching up various studs, and now she is hitting on- Justin???\n\n12. THAT was how evil hee-haw girl's plots were discovered? Did the budget get pulled, and they needed a way of wrapping up the plot faster than you could say \"Deus Ex Machina?\"\n\n13. The final massive musical number: a K.C. and the Sunshine Band cover! While deeply painful on so many levels (including watching nerd-boy dance), at least they mangled an already bad song, rather than torture a once respectable song.\n\nAnyway, yes, this movie is just as bad as you have heard."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Kelly Clarkson actually started producing some decent pop, this was pretty much the only product of American Idol for a bit. And what an product it was. The sheer lack of enthusiasm put forward in this movie is, to say the least, daunting.\n\nSet during a spring break, Kelly, the clich\u00e9d Texan girl who wants to be a big singer but is stuck in a lowly bar, runs into Justin, who smiles an abnormally large amount and has a really, seriously ridiculous perm. I mean, come on. It looks like cotton candy. They both go to Florida, and watch loads of \"babes\" and do a bunch of PG-13 related spring break hi-jinks, of which there aren't many. Hence why they're college hi-jinks. Doi.\n\nAnyway, after a rather dumb meet cute between Justin and Kelly, the plot, which would have difficulty filling up a 22 minute sitcom let alone this 90 minute trash fest, begins to unfold. Basically, Kelly's blonde friend wants Justin, and he wants Kelly, so to get revenge on him, she gives him her phone number, and then makes it look like Kelly doesn't care about him. I'm sure you can imagine the complex and thought provoking scenarios that this could spin out into, but don't hurt yourself.\n\nA quick note on the musical numbers: you have a mute button. Employ it LIBERALLY. Thank you.\n\nObviously, From Justin to Kelly is meant for twelve year old girls, who have seen the same plot a couple of dozen times before, only this time it doesn't involve Barbie and/or Fairies (insert joke here). If you are a twelve year old girl, go rent Sleepover. It's much better than this, and it has cute boys. If you're not a twelve year old girl (which is a good thing), stay, stay away from this factory made piece of crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike some of the entries in the endless parade of crap reviewed on this site, you might actually have heard of \"From Justin to Kelly: The Tale of Two American Idols\". This name recognition could potentially raise two problems. First is the prospect that you might already be familiar with the movie and thus take issue with something incorrect I might write. This differs from a review of \"Idiot Vampire Movie #277\" or whatever other nonsense I write about, where only four people on the planet have seen the movie in its entirety and I could have written the entire thing using a Ouija board without anyone knowing better. The second problem might be that you have actually seen the movie and so this review is redundant. Of course, anyone who watched this movie probably had enough pent up self loathing that they have already ridden the vein pain train in a lukewarm bathtub. In which case, congratulations on being dead! It is obvious you didn't quite make it into Heaven, which has a standing gag order against anything related to \"American Idol\". Better luck next time.\n\nWhat do you get when you take two flash-in-the-pan celebrities from a reality TV show and fling them in front of a camera without any lessons in screen acting, line reading, or simulating basic human emotion? \"From Justin to Kelly\" decided to find out. I suppose it's fitting that one of the worst shows on television today would have managed to spawn a Hollywood film that manages to raid the lint traps of sheer ineptitude so severely that it makes \"Battlefield Earth\" look like a sci-fi epic for the ages. Not only could neither Justin nor Kelly act their way out of a paper bag, but they wouldn't be qualified to deliver bag lunches to the other soap actors on set. Thankfully, one half of the dynamic duo has already returned to blissful obscurity. We can only hope this movie will soon follow. I am not sure if this movie is taking place in an alternate timeframe where Kelly was never discovered and instead was forced to perform to audiences numbering in the single digits, or if it's supposed to take place in 2007 when the same will probably be true.\n\nI suppose I can't fault the producers of \"American Idol\" for wanting to make another quick buck off their inexplicably popular TV show. Nor can I really fault two okayish singers lucky enough to land a starring role in a movie out of the blue because they weren't as horrible as everyone else. Someone has to be responsible for this mess, though, and I guess the most obvious blame falls on the people who voted Justin and Kelly into their positions as the final two American Idols: namely, the American public. This is all your fault, jerks. You should be ashamed."

The transitions into these musical numbers were so awkward. And the songs themselves were not remotely entertaining. Kelly comes off as likable in the movie but I grew to despise every other character in the space of 15 minutes. I don't see this becoming a cult classic. It also made me feel relieved that I never went to Florida for Spring Break. Kelly Clarkson is a sweet girl but she should stick to singing and get a new agent."

Don't pop this into your DVD player expecting something amazing. Cause you're not gonna get it. But it's a wonderfully terrible bubblegum movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading many a statement online that From Justin To Kelly even surpasses the demonpsawn show that spawned it for being devoid of talent, I just had to see the horror for myself. Sadly, obtaining the DVD outside of America is quite a feat in itself. In point of fact, the film has never seen so much as the light of day outside of the States, which is a very bad sign in itself. Released at a time when the American Idol program had just gotten started with saturating us in its contestants' sameness, From Justin To Kelly is elegant proof that the smaller the budget, the bigger the fallout when your film fails to make it back. Produced on a mere twelve million dollars, FJTK presented us with an endless array of stupid dance sequences, stupid songs, and an incredibly stupid plot to string it all together. I guess they wanted to prove that William Hung was not the worst possible thing that could come out of the herd conformist display that is Idol. In order to spare you some agony, I will now try to recount the plot.\n\nFJTK begins with Kelly performing a number in a Texan bar, to the delight of what appears to be the only audience member. When finished, she is approached by friends to go on a trip with them to Florida for Spring break. Characterisation is not exactly a strong suit for this film. Kelly's accomplices consist of Bland Black Girl and Anorexic White Girl Who Feels Compelled To Steal Any Guy Whom Kelly Develops An Interest In. With friends like those, who needs a personality? Anyway, things take a turn for the worst when Justin, accompanied by slightly less bland but even more daft friends, arrive at the same beach. The first of many mass song and dance numbers ensues, and thus we get the first of many strange face-pulling contests. At one point in this beach musical number, Kelly looks as if she is going to distend her jaw and devour Justin whole. Professional actors these ain't. Of course, even an eighty-minute film cannot keep going without some semblance of a plot, and what a doozy FJTK offers.\n\nMuch of the plot in FJTK concerns itself with the fact that Justin wants Kelly, Kelly wants Justin, and Kelly's anorexic friend wants to keep them apart for some reason. Well-scripted this ain't. Coming off as an extended episode of one of those family sitcoms that enjoyed a brief revival in the 1990s, FJTK barely has enough plot to sustain twenty-three minutes. So a lot of padding with musical numbers takes place. The thing with musical numbers in film is that there needs to be a logical progression from the dialogue into the music. When characters burst into song at the drop of a hat, it is jarring, and generally lessens the impact. And that is probably the biggest of the problems FJTK faces. Not only are the musical numbers insipid and bland, they also have no logical flow from the rest of the film. The plot literally comes to a standstill whilst the characters sing, dance, and pull the kind of faces people usually make in order to deliberately ruin shots. The words \"cash in\" spring to mind.\n\nFortunately, FJTK did accomplish one task. It sorted out the genuine talent from the hangers-on where American Idiot was concerned. With the film all but buried, Kelly Clarkson put it all behind her and concentrated on a recording career. Not that I would go out of my way to listen to her recordings, but she at least seems to be branching out and exploring a wider variety of material. Justin Guarini, on the other hand, seems to have disappeared off the face of the Earth, which is probably just as well after the demon yawn face he pulls during one classic(ally bad) number during FJTK. About the only other individual to survive association with the project was Anika Noni Rose, and I think that was mainly because she hung around in the background, not really standing out in any fashion. Brian Dietzen, however, takes out the prize for the most insipid, irritating character of the piece. Every time this man opens his mouth, I feel like I want to punch him. Although that might inspire another pathetic song and dance number.\n\nSo FJTK occupies a place of pride in my DVD collection. I drag it out whenever someone tries to tell me they know what a bad film is. I have even sat through the extended version, and listened to the audio commentary. It is just too bad that we no longer have MST3K, as a riffing of FJTK would probably be worth front-row seating. Most people would not dare admit having seen this film to another human being, but I am different. I am proud of the fact that I have seen the lowest that Hollywood can possibly sink, and believe me, FJTK is exactly that. Other films might come out that are worse, or more entertaining in a bad way, but FJTK is literally the lowest point. It was conceived for no other purpose than to wring more money out of a lowest-common-denominator-rules \"talent\" quest, and its makers did not even deem it worthy of an effort commensurate with such an atrocious goal. If nothing else, it serves as a great lesson in the duality of art: for every renaissance, there is a time of stagnation.\n\nNeedless to say, I gave From Justin To Kelly a one out of ten. Easily the most insipid film you will see in your lifetime, it is even a disgrace to bad cinema."

Our friend had said that he thought \"Troll 2\" was \"OK,\" so we switched that DVD out for \"From Justin to Kelly,\" just for a giggle. I mean, how were we to know?\n\nAnd then he watched it while we were all in the next room.\n\nThe first 2 minutes were OK, and then it happened. He suddenly jumped out of his chair, running around the room, tore of his shorts and chewed off his own nuts! Then, screaming wildly, he ran across the room, right through the plate glass French windows, and made his way across the road, dripping blood and yelling wildly. He then rubbed his face rapidly across the barbed wire fence and was whacking himself on the back of the head with a medium-sized rock, screaming, \"Take it away! No more, no more! Please, no more!\"\n\nImagine our surprise when he then ran into the road and mooned an oncoming 18-wheeler - which flattened him. When we reached him, he was on the ground, oozing blood, bones sticking out from everywhere but he seemed happy. He was whispering, \"Thank you God, thank you.\" Apart from the irreversible brain damage, severe tic and desire to eat possum vomit laced with razor blades (he says it helps the pain), doctors are hopeful that he will live out his life in mediocrity. The morphine and thorazine is helping.\n\nFunny thing is, when we crush his fingers with pliers 'just for fun', he thinks he's on Miami Beach and breaks into the most God-awful songs about someone called Kelly! Weird.\n\nSWAT arrived minutes after what we now refer to as, 'the incident', cordoned the neighborhood and after a few hours, managed to remove \"From Justin to Kelly\" from the DVD player with only a few casualties and four suicides when one of the team accidentally hit the 'Play' button on the DVD. Last we heard, the disk is under heavy guard by the DoD and is being called, \"\u0085the most devastating weapon known to Mankind.\"\n\nDid you know the average IQ of planet Earth is a mere 34? When the US ripped off the British TV show \"Stars In Their Eyes\" and relabeled it, 'American Idol', the IQ dropped another 5 points. When they tried grubbing a few more greenbacks by making \"From Justin to Kelly\" it dropped another 10 points.\n\nMy take is this; any moron who not only watches 'American Idol', but then deliberately goes out and watches a movie made about American Idol, deserves exactly what they get. This is Proof Positive that there is no limit to human stupidity."

But of course, Robert Iscove was too heartless to listen to our pleas and distributed this disaster to US theatres.\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly is, yes thats right, another graduate from the pop stars film project university. Like fellows Mariah, Usher and J'lo; Justin and Kelly have mastered the art of bad film making. Terrible acting, predictable plot, shameful lip syncing, poor direction and vapid sugar coated soundtrack, marketed for imbeciles and twits.\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly is a bad bad movie. It sucked. It's not top ten bad but it's not far outside."

        "review_detailed_main": "Backing my courageous assertion that I must watch everything and anything I come across, here is From Justin to Kelly. This 2003 \"musical\" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Penned by Kim Fuller, the brother of American Idol creator Simon Fuller, From Justin to Kelly features Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini partying it up during one of the lamest spring breaks on record.\n\nIs this some sort of elaborate joke? Can a movie actually be this bad? What the hell is Clarkson wearing? Why, dear Jesus, why?\n\nClarkson stars in this catastrophe as some sort of downhome Texas waitress named Kelly. She's the most conservative of her three friends. The other two are flat stereotypes: one is a shifty and confusingly manipulative blonde girl (Katherine Bailess) and the other is the token black friend (Anika Noni Rose). The two girls convince Kelly that she needs to take some time off from singing and waiting tables in this bar, so they head to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, Guarini is the inventively-named Justin. See? Justin and Kelly, just like on TV! Justin is some sort of party promoter and he also hangs out with two stereotypes: a nerd (Brian Dietzen) meeting a girl from the enchanted and apparently still profound internet and some buff loser (Greg Siff). Justin and Kelly \"meet\" in a stupid dance number and fall in love, but the confusingly manipulative blonde \"friend\" of Kelly's gets in the way. Will Justin and Kelly overcome the befuddling text messages and strange overtures?\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly plays out like a teen movie written and produced by people who were teens about 78 years ago. There's this preposterous attempt to \"understand\" teen culture, but this drivel makes High School Musical look like Gone with the Wind. There are \"dance\" numbers, \"songs\" and \"song-and-dance\" numbers. The stereotypes fit in the right places and the movie's obligatory scoundrel turns out to be a Machiavellian curiosity that still leaves as one of Kelly's best friends.\n\nThe \"songs\" in From Justin to Kelly are bad. The \"dancing\" is bad. The \"acting\" is bad. The \"screenplay\" is bad. The \"characters\" are bad. The \"scenery\" is bad. The \"camerawork\" is bad. The \"direction\" is bad. The \"titles\" are bad. The \"end credits\" are bad. Any \"animal actors\" are bad. The \"food\" is bad. Everything, and I mean everything, is bad.\n\nBrandon, the aforementioned buff loser, raps. The nerd meets a strange- looking girl from the internet. Kelly and Justin sing on a boat. Kelly sings a song holding her purse walking down the beach after leaving a bar without her purse. There's a bald steroid freak, apparently, and a dude that looks to be about 45 hanging around moaning about losing his girlfriend to somebody he never lost his girlfriend to. There's a whipped cream bikini contest that isn't the least bit interesting. Seriously.\n\nThis is spring break zaniness for the Disney set, an imagined and hopeful view of what people in their twenties are up to when all bets are off and the night can cover the sins of the day. Hannah Montana is more hedonistic. Or so I've heard.\n\nAt the end of the day, I found myself somewhat proud of the grand achievement of having made it through From Justin to Kelly. I felt like I had accomplished something spectacular, like I had really done the world some sort of service. Any of my other failings were quickly glossed over by the realization that I made it. Any sense of inadequacy was gone. I made it. I lived to tell."

I sat with a dull glazed look in my eyes,cemented there out of boredom and just utter disbelief!\n\nThis movie put me in mind of when they tried to do a Village People movie (\"Can't Stop The Music\"),just Hollywood once again jumping down the throat of the latest \"big thing\" before it gets old. I can see all the kids & teens who more than likely pestered their parents to give them $$ to see this waste of celluloid! At least \"Can't Stop\".. etc. had better songs and choreography,heck,even better humor! Any young person who \"liked\" this film,check back in a few years and tell me you''ll still feel the same!\n\nI also could compare this to the \"Beach Blanket\" movies of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funnicello but that would be an insult to them and their films. \"Justin and Kelly\" makes Frankie and Annette's outings look like \"Dead Poet's Society\"! I'd go on about what happens in this movie but nothing does or...if it did,I have completely forgotten it!\n\nLastly,I recently saw a copy of this film at my local \"used\" music (records/tapes/CD's) & movie store and it was a mere 99 cents! Tune in not too far from now,you wont be able to \"give\" this movie away! Of course,the fact that it starred non-actors should have gave away that it was fiasco-bound! (Oh,by the way,I only saw this because I was at a neighbor's and their kids were watching it,like it was an Orson Wells work of genius!)"

And it wasn't helped by watching this movie, which I actually saw to see whether Clarkson was any good as an actress. My conclusion is that she is a talented singer, but an actress, oh well. Her chemistry with her co-star is rather bland, and Justin Guarini has an acting style that feels forced and unnatural. The characters are never that likable either, they seem clich\u00e9d and artificial at best. The scenery is nice enough but the cinematography goes at odd angles and the editing is haphazard. The dialogue is terrible, I haven't seen such inept directing and choreography in a long time and as for story, forget it. The best asset is the soundtrack but even that felt as though it was there for the sake of it. Overall, an awful film but I have seen worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

At least all 3 girls didn't fall for all 3 guys. Afraid I kept wishing the Kaya character would have been played by Tamyra Gray, but the gal who did was fine. My friends dogged the clothes Kelly wore - said she made Texans look like they had bad taste. Thought they were kinda cute myself.\n\nIdol fans - go and enjoy - but hurry. I bet it's not around long.

        "review_detailed_main": "May contain spoilers!\n\nOkay, the reason this got a 4 (which normally would have been lower) is because of a few things that make this movie not AS bad as some of these reviews say. Most are for nostalgic reasons.\n\nI saw this in probably 2004-05 when I was in middle school, and decided to pick it up from Blockbuster, just because. At this time in my life, it was this fun spring break movie that was entertaining to watch with my friends. This was mostly due to the simple plot, all the fun going on and the allure of being in Miami ( which IS fun, I had already been). Back then, I didn't really see anything wrong with it, but I wasn't the best judge of acting.\n\nNow that I've watched it in my early 20's, for the first time in ages, I feel like I can give it a proper review. Yikes, it's pretty cringe-y. So first you have the acting. Kelly's actually starts out okay to me, and is decent despite no acting roles, but then it kind of goes from bad to worse after that. Everyone else is not too too bad, Justin is slightly better than Kelly, but Katherine Bailess's accent is OVERWHELMINGLY annoying. And I'm from Alabama! I just wanted her to stop. Besides that, you will want to punch her character a thousand times, and then you wonder how Kelly and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) are even friends with someone like that. Another downside is the musical numbers, the only one that's kind of fun/funny is the beginning number on the beach, and all the others are hard to watch- the lip syncing, the actual songs themselves... everything.\n\nA few of the things I like, still, are the vacation atmosphere, and, well.. that's pretty much all. Honorable mentions are Anika Noni Rose's acting as Kaya ( she gives the best performance out of everyone, IMO) especially given her material to work with and her choice of guys is the most believable/ most worth investing in; also, Brian Dietzen (pre-NCIS) with his sunburn and woman troubles is somewhat funny.\n\nGuys are going to hate this no matter what because it's already bad, they tend to hate musicals (like mine does) and it's about crushes and love. The only thing they might watch this for is the women on the beach.\n\nIf you want to relive childhood a little because you remember watching it then, that's the only reason why you might want to continue watching it later in life, seeing as that's my only reason. A lot of times we can watch things that aren't good because they bring back some sort of sentimental value, even though they kind of suck.\n\nOther than the few things I mentioned, it's a waste of time if none of these themes appeal to you at all."

Still, that does not mean I wouldn't enjoy it. I have liked a lot of \"feel good, girly\" films that many hate such as Gigli, Glitter and Crossroads and I always clear my mind and give any film a chance at impressing me, and sometimes people are just way too harsh on films that are merely a cute, fun time. This film, however, is not the case. It is as bad as it's made out to be, and I'll tell you why.\n\nThe acting is stale from every cast member. No one puts on a believable or even cheesy likable performance, including the main two \"stars\", which you think they would be able to muster some acting talent being the finalists of American Idol's first season... (joking). Whose idea was it to make a film off singers from a reality TV contest? The plot? There isn't one. A bunch of party thirsty teens that do nothing more than consume space on the screen and run around insipidly throwing outdated teenage slang here and there, not putting on a show attention-grabbing enough to interest children, teenagers, or adults. Don't even get me started on the songs and dance scenes. Oh my sweet Jesus, all every song does is occupy time, nothing more. They are all nowhere near catchy, and the choreography is some of the worst I have seen in any movie, ever. Even the sets are dull and completely opposite of breathtaking, and the direction is honestly home-video worthy at times.\n\nSo basically, there were no redeeming qualities about this film. I am lighthearted, and like lots of movies people consider bad, and can usually laugh at films that I myself find bad. Not one chuckle, or smile, or any emotion ran across my face while watching this movie. It really is that bland and uninspiring, I felt robbed of the runtime after watching it and felt I could have done something more useful with my time like watch leaves fall. I don't plan on ever watching it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been curious about this movie for 20 years. I worked in a local video store when it was released; its infamy was immediate. I never had any intention of watching, but as a cinephile there comes a certain point where inquisitiveness overcomes good judgment. 'Ishtar,' 'North,' 'Showgirls' - sometimes you just have to see cinematic notoriety for yourself. Yes, it's a transparent cash grab; yes, Kelly Clarkson has apparently said in retrospect that she knew it was awful, but she was contractually obligated to participate. Yes, the very premise, scenario, and setting scream \"vapid\": a \"musical\" romantic comedy, set during \"spring break,\" which even as a real-life cultural concept is a black hole of intelligence, meaning, value for which anyone should be embarrassed to even live on the same planet, let alone be involved in. Did 'From Justin to Kelly' ever actually have a chance of being any good? Almost surely not. Should anyone ever watch it? Maybe if you're masochistic, or prone to lapses in judgment. Otherwise, no.\n\nIn kindness, occasionally there might be a scattered line or two that's mildly clever, and one might say that some of the singing is easy on the ears. Some of the choreography, and hair and makeup work, are easy on the eyes - though some of it also plainly inspires a skeptical \"what?\" Beyond these, one must necessarily either pity those who had a hand in this, or despise them. From the ground up Kim Fuller's screenplay is absolute tripe almost wholly bereft of any substance or heart; his work on 'Spice World' was masterful by comparison. Whether one wishes to blame Fuller, editors Tirsa Hackshaw and Casey O. Rohrs, director Robert Iscove, the producers, or someone else or some combination thereof, the pacing is forced and unnatural. The cast are coerced into small, inane, empty corners. The dialogue is rancid and hokey, the characters are obnoxious and hollow, and the scene writing and narrative alike are excruciatingly insipid, inauthentic, and ham-handed, 100% flimsy fluff. Too much of the music is just bland, sterile, soulless refuse. I suppose Iscove's direction is technically sound, and this is otherwise well made from a technical standpoint, but what does that matter?\n\nRomantic comedies aren't my favorite genre, but even if they're not perfect they can be earnestly worthwhile: fun, funny, heart-warming, charming. 'From Justin to Kelly' is none of this. It is the opposite of any of this. There was no sincerity in the endeavor from the start, and there is none in the feature as it presents. Whatever value it could possibly claim can be found elsewhere, in far greater quantities, without having to suffer through the vacant, pointless, fruitless, idle nothings. I suppose there are folks out there who might find some kernel of entertainment in this - presumably diehard fans of 'American Idol' or Clarkson - yet given how this is nothing but a cash-in, and how to hear Clarkson sing we have to endure everything else this represents, I have to believe that the feature is altogether insulting even for such fans. Please take the advice of someone who caved in to curiosity and watched a movie she knew would be awful: you don't need to see this. No one does. 'From Justin to Kelly' sits squarely at the bottom of the barrel, and seems to actively try to find its way below even that.\n\nAvoid."

It was simply a fun spring break movie. I will give you this much that I only saw it because I love Kelly Clarkson so much, but when I actually sat down and watched it, it had some alright moments. These moments were mainly between Justin and Kelly, a lot of the other characters were a bit lame such as trying to make Eddie the comic relief, \"why would you have a coffee in the shower\" not funny, but I guess that's the nature of the film.\n\nEven though it wasn't made by Disney, it did have a very Disney feel to it, and yes I will concede that the acting is not that of Meryl Streep, however, unlike HSM the cast ranged from good voices (Brian Dietzen) to extraordinary (Justin Guarini and especially Kelly). and I have to say I even enjoyed a couple, such as \"timeless\" and \"anytime\".\n\nIn conclusion, while the movie may seem a little lame and corny, that's what it is, and it knows it, unlike films like repo : the genetic opera, which try to be serious and are just lame.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's one thing for a film to fail after an honest effort was put into it. Plenty of movies every year sound like good idea have blood sweat and tears put into them, only to tank. From Justin to Kelly is not one of these movies.\n\nThis movie has \"screw it\" written all over it. Not one aspect of the movie looked professional, or had a hint of effort in it. When a movie starts with a screenplay as inept this one, the production usually reflects the writers lack of effort. And so we get From Justin to Kelly, a movie so bad I actually recommend fans of bad movies see it. It's that bad.\n\nAn example of the unforgivable badness is a scene in which Kelly's ex-boyfriend shows up for no reported reason on spring break from Texas. This upsets Justin, and results in one of the worst scenes ever put to celluloid. The two have a sort of a a hovercraft race on the water with laundry baskets attached to the back of the hover-crafts. It is implied they may be playing a form of basketball in the ocean, with the laundry baskets being the rims. This sort of plot development is intellectually insulting and appalling. And it's not even the worst scene, that's how unremittingly bad this movie is.\n\nSurely this was the end of careers and families for people involved. I can't see how an unestablished movie maker could survive their name being connected to this movie. Kim Fuller got the writing credit on this, and already had \"Spice World\" under her belt, along with a string of TV series no one has ever heard of. That's probably the caliber of talent involved with this from top to bottom.\n\nMovies like this really are an insult to moviegoers. If you're not insulted, you're either stupid or you're laughing to hard too care (or you're asleep). Either way, there is no excuse for this film. I hope everyone involved with this travesty is proud, or at least got paid."

Compared to this, the makers of Grease, Grease 2, the Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, and heck, even that musical episode of Xena: Warrior Princess, should be shining up their Oscars and smiling for the camera. This movie is a perfect example of why things like American Idol need to stop. I can't tell you how sick I am of how these largely uncreative people get record deals, then crap out even more bad pop music and turds like this movie. At least when I see a Shaq movie, I know he had to work years to get to the NBA, be a superstar, and make s**tty movies while recording even worse rap albums. When I see singers like Mariah, Mick Jagger, etc, I know they struggled to the top to have the opportunities to fail miserably on screen. These people just showed up at American Idol auditions, sang (often badly) some songs, and had it handed to them. What say we all band together, get American Idol canceled, and make them work for it. Cuz then they'll never be famous, they'll never get a record deal cuz they can't write their own songs, and we will be spared all the bad movies and records they will no doubt produce and release."

Concocted as a \"beach party\" film like the old 50s movies... this film never gets off the ground.. The story (from the writer of \"Spice World\" no less) has something to do with spring break (though a sanitized \"G\" rated version of spring break).... but I never did make much sense of it.. the song choreography was dreadful and the direction atrocious, the worst possible framing of every shot... to hamper any enjoyment you might get out of the film.. the singing sequences should have been the thrust of the film but with the choreography bad and the lip-synching just plain terrible if anything it's laughable. Kelly Clarkson has least has some minuscule amount of screen presence, though her lack of acting experience is certainly noticeable.. Justin Guarini however is just plain awful. from the moment he walks on screen you want to hurl stuff at him... This is one guy whose 15 minutes are way way done. I'm sure that by now I have explained just how dreadfully bad this movie is.. take every bad film you've seen and watch them over and over again and you still won't experience the agony that is sitting through even five minutes of this movie.

I'm not joking. I have rarely seen a movie which bored me to tears, but this takes the cake.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm not a big fan of the movie type where every one breaks into song for no apparent reason, but I've seen Grease and that didn't put me to sleep. It probably wouldn't help the movie's cause any way, as it has a clich\u00e9 plot, uninteresting characters, and acting that makes pre-school make-believe sessions seem like Shakespeare in comparison.\n\nThe only thing that could have saved this movie is Simon Cowell showing up after every song and berating the cast and crew for such a dreadful number.

They could barely sing on a reality TV show, so how does that qualify them to act in a Hollywood motion picture?? Although in their \"defense\", Justin & Kelly have been given some of the worst dialogue in the history of cinema. I cannot believe I just saw a scene where after just getting to know Kelly, Justin said, without irony, that there was really \"something between us\". What guy says something that cheesy...and gets away with it??? Are you kidding me? And these scenes where the \"actors\" just break into song? They are the most unintentionally stupid scenes I've seen in some time. Justin just started singing to Kelly while on a boat and I literally fell out of my seat in uncontrollable laughter. Unfortunately, this was supposed to be a dramatic scene. This movie is simply a total train wreck. I never thought I would see something worse than either Battlefield Earth or Kangaroo Jack...but I was wrong. \"From Justin to Kelly\" is as bad as it gets. It is the worst movie in the history of movies. This truly deserves the #1 spot on the Bottom 100 list here on IMDb.

But sending it the bottom 100 is extreme because there are a couple of good aspects.\n\nThe Worst: I think what ultimately led to this movie's horrible reputation is the directing. I have NEVER seen a movie with such disjointed, meaningless scenes. It's almost a bunch of random scenes stuck together without any cohesive plot. No transitions, no connecting purpose, just a collage of campy snippets. Also, not even the traditional pause before going into an inappropriate musical number.\n\nThe Bad: The Screenplay is horrific. Albeit maybe not quite as bad as the directing, the dialogue was SO stereotypical and shallow that it didn't even have an unintentional humorous effect.\n\nThe Good: These people can sing. I don't see a lot about this in other reviews, but unless you look at something topnotch like Dreamgirls, you won't find many musicals with singers as good as From Justin to Kelly has. If you watched a movie made exclusively for American Idol winners, and expected something OTHER than an excuse for some singing, then I think you have bigger problems than this movie. I mean really, what did you expect? I watched this expecting to hear some singing, and that's what I got. Granted, I got absolutely nothing else, but I think the movie basically met what can be expected of it. Quality singing in a musical is, for me, what saves this from being bottom of the barrel."

(Over here it was never released at all, and seems to have gone straight to cable.) This sadly does live up to all the things people have said about it - it would qualify as the worst musical I've ever seen, but I still haven't managed to repress every detail of Cliff Richard's \"Take Me High.\"\n\nTo Kelly Clarkson's credit, she has since confessed to hating this movie; and since the round-rumped one is just about the only good thing to ever come from reality-TV-generated music - some would say she is to America what Girls Aloud are to Britain, but Kelly can actually sing and there's only one of her (and at least I can tell her apart from Justin Guarini, whereas I keep getting the Girls confused) - she's also the closest thing to something tolerable in this movie. The story's not worth bothering with, the acting makes \"Saved By The Bell\" look like \"Angels In America,\" and the music... shudder. Call me old-fashioned, but there's something seriously wrong with a musical where all the original songs, all the singing, and all the dancing is synthetic and soulless. And embarrassing. It's like you're watching a spoof of musicals, except this isn't.\n\nThe worst thing is that you may be begging for them to stop torturing you with setpieces lamer than Ironside out of a wheelchair, but when they return to the who-cares storyline (not helped by Kelly and Justin having all the romantic chemistry of Dick Dastardly and Yankee Doodle Pigeon) you're begging for the music to start again. And as Kelly's version of \"Vacation\" and the running \"gag\" of the token nerd trying to meet his Internet girlfriend and failing... spare me.\n\nKelly Clarkson has managed to put this behind her, but Justin Guarini and nearly everyone else in this movie has never been heard of again. Sometimes justice isn't blind."

He has such presence, I found myself wishing him to be in every scene. I look forward to the DVD where they will hopefully put in deleted scenes.

The rest of the cast were at best models for a discount store magazine and were not actors, mistake #2. With the money and clout that American Idol has, they should have waited a year or two, got quality writers and \"a\" director and it would then at least been a B movie.

All of the dance/song numbers, included the exact same dance moves, and pretty much the exact same song.

Cinema is supposed to value and accept death, pain, and exploitation-BUT BULL CRAP like this does not. All it does is tell a stupid love story for the sake one's investment career. I would also like to say that American Idol is crap and no one should really care about it, it turns young people with talent into changed snobby posers who have an anti-different, social attitude none-other than Ryan Seacrest. The writing in this film is horribly unrealistic and atrocious, so terrible it made me vomit. By the time it reached the directing and acting (the directing was actually invisible compared to the acting) I was defecating through my own eyes. This film also caused me to urinate acid.

The plotholes are so deep, one could bury the entire cast in them, and the constant use of text-messaging felt like an endless barrage of Nokia commercials. That being said, the opening dance number \"Bounce\" and the closing number \"That's the Way\" were a lot of fun, and more than made up for the ooey gooey not so satisfying middle. Katherine Bailess who played Alexa was divine. If there were ever tryouts for \"Dallas: The Teen Years\", she would definitely be a forerunner. Girls in skimpy outfits and pretty shirtless boys round out the positives of a movie that promises nothing and gives nothing, but an hour and a half of fun fluff which provides you and your friends with countless hours of cheezy quoting material :)"

This is a movie that will wake up all you romantically inclined people to take a good hard look at yourselves. Life isn't some romantic pipedream and love doesn't always work out the way it does in the movies.

Kelly Clarkson will remind everyone of their everyday lives as this true-to-life movie slowly unfolds into the elaborate universal question: are men and women compatible? Men and women alike will be blown away by this great musical spectacle that makes \"popular\" films like Grease or Saturday Night Fever fade to grey in comparison.\n\nRent it, buy it, give it to your loved one for valentine's day.

Kelly and Justin aren't the greatest actors in the world, but they're still several notches above Mariah Carey in \"Glitter.\" Their willingness to get through the plot with a straight face earns them major points, and, as everyone who voted for either of them on \"American Idol\" can attest, they're just darn likable, and that comes through here as well.\n\nThe supporting players, to one degree or another, are terrific as well, particularly Katherine Bailess as the witchy spoiled Texas girl and Brian Dietzen as the hot-guy-with-glasses-and-a-hat who we're supposed to believe is a nerd. Dietzen is no Eddie Deezen, but it will be interesting to see him in something where they're not hiding his light under a bushel.\n\nIf you liked the out-of-nowhere dance numbers that director Robert Iscove tossed into \"She's All That\" and \"Boys and Girls,\" you can get with the goofy vibe here.

Frankie and Annette having been replaced now by Justin Guarini (who?) and Kelly Clarkson. Guarini, the runner-up from the first season of American Idol that Clarkson won, has the worst hair and smiles nonstop. His acting is awful but, to be fair, so is everybody else's. Including Kelly, I'm sad to say. The two leads have no chemistry and their romance is about as forced as you can imagine a movie built around the two finalists from a singing competition would be. The music is terrible pre-packaged generic pop crap. Not a single song is worth remembering. It's a terrible movie made with poor intentions and not the slightest bit of artistry. Crass commercialism at its lowest. Avoid unless you want to see one of the worst mainstream movies of all time."

Not too long after that, I heard on the radio (I believe from Paul Harvey) an item about a man in the southwest, who had applied at his City Hall, for a marriage license to wed his horse. Like that occurrence, this movie also proves that someone, somewhere - even in the film business - will do \"anything.\" This presentation is so AWFUL, it is fascinating (ala \"Reefer Madness,\" or \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\"). Even the singing, which would only be the most remote reason for even contemplating this ludicrous movie, is AWFUL. I'm sure Justin is probably a very nice young man, in \"real life;\" and that is where he should remain, off-stage and away from the camera. And I know the Clarkson girl has gone on to a degree of prominence in her singing, but her supposed charms and talents are lost on me, even now. Again, like other \"worst of all-time,\" this flick is so low on the scale, you can almost bump it a notch backwards to a \"10\" - for the fascination it provides in its AWFULNESS."

Film starts out in Texas where Kelly (Kelly Clarkson) is a waitress in a bar and her friends Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) talk her into going to spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. When they get there they bump into three boys who are there to set up contests on the beach for a profit. Justin (Justin Guarini) meets Kelly and the two are instantly attracted to one another but Alexa is jealous of her and gives Justin her own cell phone number instead of Kelly's so that she can sabotage their dates. Meanwhile, Kaya meets a dishwasher named Carlo (Jason Yribar) and they go out dancing one night but the next day she yells at his boss and gets Carlo fired.\n\nThis film was directed by Robert Iscove and he's actually a pretty competent television director which is appropriate because this film plays like a badly written sitcom. The story is more or less an updated version of the beach comedies starring Frankie and Annette but in those films they at least tried to do some things differently. This film plays it extremely safe to the point where everything you think will happen does. There is absolutely no surprises that take place. Clarkson and Guarini do they're own singing and Clarkson actually has a good voice so I do give them credit for that but unfortunately the songs are of the \"American Idol\" variety. They don't sound contemporary and are very cheesy but so is everything about this film. If you hate the songs then you'll despise the dancing. Justin and Kelly are decent singers but they are just not dancers by anyones definition. The numbers appear clumsily choreographed and many of the performers do not dance in the same step or rhythm. Very lightweight script makes \"Fraternity Vacation\" seem like \"The Caine Mutiny\" and its evident that this was written very quickly to try and cash in on the success of \"American Idol\". One of the producers is the one and only Simon Fuller who created the television series and he underestimated the intelligence of the people who actually pay money to view something."

Even you if absolutely were OBSESSED with the show, DO NOT see this! I'm warning you! Use the money to buy the ticket and purchase a seat to see \"The Hulk\" instead. Hopefully, these \"idols'\" 15 minutes are about up.\n\nFinal Score: 0.0 out of 10 (They should show this to classes on how NOT to make a movie. Probably used as a form of torture to P.O.W.s)"

It will leave any audience member moved and at the edge of their seats, waiting for more."

        "review_detailed_main": "All these ultra-low reviews are ridiculous. What were these people expecting? A serious drama with superb acting? An action film? Actually \"From Justin to KellY\" (2003) is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the movie poster and it's obvious.\n\nWhen viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn off your brain and have a good time. On this level \"From Justin to Kelly\" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.\n\nAnother highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than most movies out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).\n\nTo be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties ('modern' as in the early 2000s, which hasn't changed much today). I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.\n\nI'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I did enjoy the show when I occasionally viewed it with my wife. And Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, were two of the more likable \"idols.\". (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken, lol). To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either, particularly as the story proceeds; the quality of the acting certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the flick. They did a fine job all things considered.\n\nOne can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End\" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true, literally.\n\nThe DVD features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas as well as the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a few extra dance numbers.\n\nIf you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!\n\nGRADE: B/B-"

        "review_detailed_main": "In the IMDB neighborhood, positive hype can help drive some films to a lofty place at the top of the charts. Negative hype can quickly deposit films such as From Justin To Kelly to the bottom of the IMDB trash heap known as the worst films of all time. The question remains how much of the negativity surrounding it is deserved, and how much of it can be attributed to the usual mass hysteria where IMDB voters and reviewers alike take some kind of malevolent pleasure in the demise of a film slapped together as hastily as a Big Mac in order to cash in on the popularity of a hit television show. What is obvious is that many of the comments written in regards to this film, are by people who have never seen the film. Some of them are bold enough to admit to this fact. What's funny is that those who take the time to write comments about a film they haven't seen because they get a kick out of it's demise, are as culpable of as much idiocy as Executive Producer Simon Fuller(not to be confused with American Idol Judge Simon Cowell) is for giving us this film in the first place.\n\nThere is no mistaking the fact that From Justin To Kelly is not a very good film. Its sole purpose of existence is simply because Simon Fuller was intent on finding another way to rake in a few more dollars from the popularity of his cash cow known as American Idol. I have nothing against a man filling up his bank account, but not when you do it at the cost of putting young talented performers on the screen to be scorned and ridiculed by critics and the movie going public. The plot of From Justin To Kelly is as flimsy as a see through nightie. Three friends from Texas, Kelly (Kelly Clarkson, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), and Kay (Anika Noni Rose)head down to the Florida beaches for boys, sand, surf, and fun in the sun. On the other side of the continent, three Pennsylvania guys Justin (Justin Guarini), Brandon (Greg Siff), and Eddie (Brian Dietzen) head to Florida for spring break in order to rake in some cash by sponsoring such activities as a whipped cream bikini contest or anything else they can come up with to exploit the female form. You already know from the title that Justin and Kelly are going to meet and fall in love. As if that weren't enough we are also mistreated to sub plots of Brandon continually being ticketed by a female cop, Eddie looking for his internet soul mate, Kay trying to make the moves on a restaurant worker, Alexa setting her eyes on Justin herself,and then conniving to get Justin for herself. It's the sort of plot that I thought had worn out it's welcome by the late sixties when the Bikini Beach films finally faded into the obscurity they so richly deserved.\n\nSince this is billed as a romantic/comedy/musical I suppose we should start by commenting on the musical aspect first. I would almost swear to the fact that there is truly no more than a couple of musical melodies in this film. The first one is where everybody breaks out on the beach in a big dance number. The other song is when Justin and Kelly are singing an ode of love about one another. All the songs sound the same, and only the lyrics change. That would be OK if at least the lyrics were memorable, but they're not even audible much of the time. Most of it sounds as if someone wrote dialog on a notepad, handed it to the cast and said, \"go out and sing it\". As for the dance numbers, it's hard to say if they are truly as bad as they seem on the screen. They are so horrendously directed and photographed that it's difficult to offer any criticism beyond that. For instance, in the big opening number, we get shots of everybody dancing for a few seconds, interspersed with the activities of skateboarders doing stunts in a half pipe. It's as if whoever choreographed the film couldn't come up with more than a few dance moves at a time and the director (Robert Iscove) cuts away because it's easier than editing them into a cohesive framework. Every single big musical number in this film is done with the same effect when the cast breaks out into song and dance. We get numerous cut shots of boats sailing, people swimming, people surfing etc. etc. etc. It's a mess. Worst of all, when much of this should be centering on the two stars, they are given short thrift and blandly blended into the proceedings. As for the romantic numbers which don't require any dancing, the orchestra is so intent on overwhelming the singing of Justin and Kelly, it is difficult to find fault with their vocal ability.\n\nJudging the acting ability of some of the cast is equally difficult. This is not a film that requires acting. More or less it's show up, step in front of the camera, recite the lame lines screenwriter Kim Fuller(Simon Fuller's brother) typed out for you, sing when necessary and then move on to the next scene. Justin Guarini, pretty much does what is required of him in that respect and I'm sure that greatly pleased the Fuller brothers. Unfortunately, it did little for his fast and fading career as a pop singer, and does nothing for an acting career that was going to be nonexistent anyway. Clarkson is a different story. It's as if she's aware of the mess surrounding her, but gives it the good old American Idol try anyway. She does seem to have a certain amount of charisma surrounding her, but cinematographer Francis Kenny does his best to destroy it. In one scene when Clarkson and Guarini are out on the ocean in a yacht singing one of the generic love songs, Kenny does one of the most horrendous close-ups of Clarkson imaginable. It is so bad, that one would think they forgot to send her to the makeup room before the scene was filmed. This happens at least twice more in the picture. This is yet another example where the makers of this film care so little about their cast, as long as they are making their percentage. It becomes even more disgusting when you realize that indeed, Clarkson has terrific singing ability and a natural screen presence. In the opening of moments of this film, when Kelly is working at a bar, someone must have told her to try a Texas accent. It's a horrendous accent but she uses it only until we see her in the next scene and then we never hear it again. It's as if Clarkson said, \" to hell with that nonsense\" and ditched it. Good for her if she did. Given a decent vehicle, a half-way decent script, and some dramatic coaching, Miss Clarkson may have eventually been able to make a few worthwhile films. After From Justin To Kelly though, the chances of that are nil. It's not as if Simon Fuller truly cares about the viability of a long term career in regards to his stars. As for the rest of the cast, I can only extend my deepest sympathy to them, and suggest they have a few words with their agents about getting them stuck in this disaster.\n\nSo is From Justin To Kelly one of the worst films of all time? That's debatable I suppose, but it is certainly not the fourth worst film of all time (it's ranking as of this writing). I have no quarrels with some of the comments written about this film, as it is truly bad. I do believe one should place the blame where it belongs the most: Executive Producer: Simon Fuller Director: Robert Iscove Screenwriter: Kim Fuller Cinematography: Francis Kenny Choreography: Travis Payne Costume Design: Bobbie Read Original Music: Herbie Tribino & Michael Wandmacher.\n\nIt is useless to continue to blame Kelly Clarkson or Justin Guarini. They have the excuse that they are signed to an iron clad contract by Fuller. All the above mentioned, have no such excuse, and ladies and gentleman, when you have no excuse you certainly get my grade: F"

Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guardini play themselves, and that's too bad, they aren't interesting enough to have a movie based on their own characters.

I must have dozed off after the \"officer Cutter\" scene. Though I liked \"Harley Davidson & the Marlboro Man\"; seen it many times on satellite in 25 years as a matter of fact. Furthermore Tom Sizemore, Alec, Billy, and Daniel's big brother were actually plausible villains in that Don Johnson / Mickey Rourke likewise plausible \"reluctant, but worthy tandem heroes\" flick. Moreover HD & the MM is a hell of a lot better movie than this J to K stinker; I seen enough of the latter to rate it a 3 rather than 1 because to be fair I failed at staying awake; so that much I can tell you. Otherwise i'll have to ask my wife, and get back to you for a \"Justin to Kelly\" review. Better yet don't even waist your time just checkout the aforementioned Johnson, Rourke, Sizemore, and Baldwin flick instead. Or porn; heck any porn rates at least a 5 by default.

Although, I must say that Kelly's acting was a notch better than I expected. I mean, it would be really challenging not to just barf having to read those cheesy lines, and she read them moderately well.\n\nHer singing is, as usual, fantastic. Also, her black friend is quite good--both at singing and acting.\n\nI gave this movie a 4/10 not because it was good, but because you couldn't have expected and Academy Award contender and it was a palatable way to pass the summer time."

In fact I would like to start a campaign to officially change the name of this movie to FROM VOMIT TO TOILET! I think you can imagine what the acting was like. And the singing, and oh yes lets not forget the script, direction and the key grips. Don't get me started on those jerks. Needless to say this movie couldn't be worse. How is that possible you might ask. Well when it was on HBO the cable went out for about 12 minutes and the screen went black. Now if I were honestly asked what was my favorite part of this movie I would have to say the cable outage. My favorite line of dialog was.psssssssssssssssssssss. And the best direction was done by the normally horrible people at Comcast cable who actually got something right by mistake. Oh by the way, in case you weren't clear. The movie sucked. The End"

I don't understand everyone who thinks that in order for a movie to be enjoyable it must have some deep plot line. Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini are very likable and fun. And the supporting cast is surprisingly good. This movie is in the spirit of Anchors Aweigh and Summerstock. If you enjoy happy, carefree movies, you will most likely enjoy this movie."

The movie must've been written by someone who must be mentally handicapped, cause it well... it sucked. No real plot. The music was poorly dubbed or something. Lip-synching was horrible too, and the acting was pretty bad. Kelly should've stuck to dancing.\n\nI hope they don't make a movie with Clay and Ruben, cause, that'll just be sick.

What apparently makes this one special, are the two leads, the winner and runner up of American Idol.\n\nAs a European (with it's own 'Idol' contest, quite an enjoyable show I must say), I'm not too familiar with Kelly Clarkson, and I hadn't heard from Justin Guarini (or, as someone says in the movie, Sideshow Bob, best joke of the movie) yet. So that's not a reason to watch the movie. As there are other things that were so predictable, the movie was disappointing even by it's own low standards (as the IMDB score would suggest).\n\nThe two leads both bring their friends to the beach during 'Spring Break', and these friends are about the flattest characters you will ever see in a movie. It includes a computer nerd, a cocky womanizer and a party girl. Only substance among the supporting cast comes from Anika Noni Rose, who plays a girl named Kaya, who falls in love with a local bartender/dishwasher. Rest of the cast are just a bunch of highly attractive extra's... I actually didn't see ONE fat or unattractive person during the entire movie... but lets not get into that. I know, I know, it's just a movie.\n\nBiggest part among the supporters is for Katherine Bailess, who plays Alexa, who also takes a liking in Justin. She tries to push the two lovers away from each other, by pretending that SHE is Kelly, not answering text messages from Justin. Now, Justin, it's not forbidden to actually CALL somebody on your phone! Terrible scene when Kelly finds out about Alexa's evil plan, with Alexa explaining: 'I've always been jealous of you, I wish I was more like you!'. Really convincing, guys...\n\nAlso, there's definately an overuse of songs in this one, and they're not even that good. Worst part comes when Justin and Kelly take a boatride, with him suddenly starting to sing this horrible, so called romantic song. Yuck.\n\nAlthough the movie only runs for about 80 minutes, it's a drag in the last 30 or so minutes, with the songs getting even worse and the story just looking for it's ending. Which eventually comes with yet another annoying party, with the whole cast singing 'That's the way I like it' for about 10 minutes.\n\nBad and annoying, this one. 2/10."

Boring, based off of a crappy television series, put in spring break of all places, the acting was crap, their English was crap, this entire movie was just a disgrace and is one of many things destroying western society.

I figured, \"I'm a teenager, even if it's lame, it'll still probably be geared to my demographic, and I might enjoy it.\"\n\nSurprising, though, I found myself adoring the film. (It truly was \"Grease on the beach,\" as my friend descrived it.) Of course, with its PG rating, it is geared toward younger audiences, as it should be. While the plot is very contrived, it's not completely outlandish. The ensemble cast was also a plus, as everyone gave believable performances.\n\nIn short, the music was poppy/fun, the setting (supposedly Florida) was beautiful, and the cast was adorable. It's a nice flick to catch on a summer day, but don't expect anything too serious from this one."

But then again, I wasn't really expecting too much.\n\nWhile this movie was supposed to be a musical, I felt like I was watching multiple music videos. But they were entertaining ones nonetheless. The dancing was well choreographed (especially the 'Wish Upon A Star'segment) and the singing was above average (of course Kelly Clarkson is the true star in this department). Every one of the six main characters shows remarkable talent.\n\nAs far as acting goes, the best performance comes from Justin Guarini, who gives his character a certain realistic quality whereas Kelly comes off a bit dramatic and everyone else appears too caricatured. Even so, the acting never gets any worse than what you might find in an episode of Saved By The Bell, so it won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie.\n\nThe story is simple but it works. Too much drama and plot would not work for the Spring Break setting, where everyone is just looking for some lovin'.\n\nIf you're still unsure about this movie, just take the risk and rent it. You might find yourself watching it several times before taking it back. Just keep that on the downlow :-)"

The most incredible aspect of the film is that the writers managed to do a worse job than the actors. This movie is just a way for the American Idol producers to cash in on brace-faced 13yr old girls who will giggle and gaw at the screen after spending their ten dollars in mall-money. The producers just wanted a way to make some cash so they hired a low-budget half-retarded monkey to chew up some paper and ink and crap out a script. This movie had the humor, depth, and quality of a bad episode of \"Hey Dude\". Had I not been on a cruise on which this movie played on one channel, non-stop for three days, and had i not been with my girlfriend, i would have never subjected myself to this trash."

If they would have took two other people who have never been on American Idol to play in this movie, then this wouldn't have been voted the worst movie of all times. If it was From Rueben to Tamyra, or From Clay to Kimberley, this movie wouldn't even made the bottom 100 list! Everyone who gave this movie a 1 is just mad that Kelly (one octave voice) was voted the American Idol!"

This is not someone who should be shown in a bathing suit. Legs like tree trunks.\n\nAnd the idea of Justin being attracted to any of the women in the movie is a little far-fetched. He has not a shred of masculinity.\n\nThis movie could have been made from rejected scenes from \"Revenge of the Nerds 2\" and \"Grease 2\". The lead guys are total dorks; the girls are brainless twits. Music just breaks out at inopportune times.

Kelly is certain the whole affair is just going to be a love-em-and-leave-em type of experience. Boy, is she right. These young people are after quick sex and seem unconcerned about real love. Three young men, including Justin (Justin Guarini) are trying to earn money to pay for their vacation. They do this by holding bikini contests and other tawdry happenings. However, from the moment Justin meets Kelly, he likes what he sees and she has eyes for him, too. But, Kelly's friend Alexa creates havoc for their connections, by text messaging Justin with false information, from time to time. Justin and Kelly do spend one beautiful day, out on the ocean in a boat. Is it true love? This is definitely the \"hip-hop\" version of where the boys are. Everyone is half-dressed and talking about sex, sex, sex, most of the time. Yes, the stars are all very attractive and young, with great singing voices. They break into song and dance at a moment's notice and perform well. But, WHOA. Is this truly enough to result in a successful movie? Just barely. If you love stories of boy meets girl, you may want to try this film. At its core, there is a romance story to enjoy. But, be warned. There is a lot of material here that may give older viewers some raised eyebrows and gasps. Although nothing is explicit, this film has sex on the brain and it shows."

There is no comment whatsoever in the movie on anything that is of any value at all. The people don't even seem to be having fun making the movie. The writing is atrocious, the directing could have been done by setting a camera up in the sand and turning it on, and don't get me started on the acting. Okay, since I mentioned it, the acting makes Shaquille O'Neal's performance in Kazaam seem Oscar-worthy. Think of the money that went into making this movie, and how many hungry people in India it could have fed. They should of just given it to me and let me make a movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"From Justin to Kelly\" is the worst kind of bad movie; the kind that's so uninspired and dull you can't even make fun of it. It's spring break in Florida. Kelly Taylor (Kelly Clarkson) needs a break from her waiting and entertaining job and although she's not super anxious to go, she's convinced by her friends Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) that a little vacation is just what she needs. In Fort Lauderdale, Justin Bell (Justin Guarini) and his friend Carlos (Jason Yribar) are reaping the benefits of the crowds of teenagers by setting up competitions and parties while their friend Eddie (Brian Dietzen) is trying to meet up with his internet crush. When they all meet up on the beach, Justin is very interested in Kelly, but she suspects he's too party-crazy and wouldn't be interested in a real relationship. Alexa however, thinks he's just the kind of guy she wants and she won't let him get away. She repeatedly jumps between them with text messages and leads Justin to believe that Kelly is not interested despite the fact that the more time they spend together, the more the two leads start to fall for each other. During these misunderstandings, Kaya is starting a relationship with a sexy busboy named Carlos and although he hasn't had any luck with the ladies, Brandon keeps bumping into a sexy beach patrol woman and he's convinced it's only a matter of time before she falls for him. If you're expecting a whole lot of singing, spontaneously choreographed dance numbers and predictable love plots, then you've come to the right place.\n\nIt's just a by-the-books beach romance story that's been padded out to 1hr 21 minutes by throwing in a bunch of songs, one dimensional characters and light-as-air romance plots. It's clear that Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini have talent, but the songs they're given aren't memorable and weren't made for them so it just feels like a waste of time. The acting is spotty at best, you can tell by the fact that both Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini's characters' first names are the same as theirs. In the actors' defense though, it's blatantly obvious that this film was made due to contractual obligation. Why else would you have the winner and runner-up of a competition act together in a romantic movie when neither of them have any acting experience, and limited professional singing experience too? I suspect the whole thing was dug up from a dusty box of \"quick, cheap teenage plots\", rewritten a little bit and then shipped out to a crew that wasn't passionate at all about the project to capitalize on the immediate popularity of the stars. Even aside from the technical standpoint of the writing, the movie isn't put together very competently. It's poorly edited and looks more like a music video than a movie when there's singing and dancing and poorly acted when there isn't. If you're a fan of either Kelly Clarkson or Justin Guarini, or even of \"American Idol\", skip \"From Justin to Kelly\" and just listen to one of their albums instead.

I also like the completely random hovercraft competitions that, as we all know, always take place on beaches during spring break. Or the cop. Man, someone was on acid when they cast her as the \"beautiful\" police officer. And I just loved that anorexic, evil blonde, who spilled her guts (whats little of them) to Kelly at the end. Or maybe it was the acting. I mean, even half-retarded babies with no arms couldn't act better than half of these guys. And that clever blonde. After all, she was pretty smart to manipulate Justin like that. As we all know, if you really like a girl, everybody knows you can't call her. That's lame. No, no, you have to text message her on a number that her suspicious friend gave you. And, man, Justin's friend who kept throwing those parties. Where does he come up with such good ideas, because he throws the most original parties, too. After all, who hasn't heard of a whipped cream bikini contest. Or a pool party. Really, where does he get those ideas? And Carlos. Man, the emotion on your face convinced me, especially when you said you should have quit your job a while ago. Yup, that emotion sure did the trick. To best sum it up, the emotion you possessed was only outmatched by the emotion of a dead seal. Yes, I loved this movie.

However to their defense, Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini are the least to blame. After all they emerged from complete obscurity to become instant overnight celebrities while most entertainers usually take years to get so far so quickly. They were thanking their lucky stars to get to be in ANY film. As disastrous as this film was, they were actually the least annoying elements compared to the 35 year old supporting actors playing college age kids, numerous establishing shots to deliberately distract the audience from the godawful acting, dialogue, and musical numbers, and pointless, ludicrous subplots that dragged out the excruciating 81 minutes of torture. All those who were involved with the making of this pile of s#*@t should be banned from Hollywood especially the man ultimately responsible - Simon Cowell! It was bad enough we have him to thank for the Spice girls but this was beyond heinous! As godawful as a lot of the singers are who try out for his show, at least they weren't the cause of toxic waste like this polluting modern day multiplexes!"

I'm actually a 20 year old college student who dislikes Justin very much and was dragged to this while babysitting.\n\nI was a fan of the first AI, loving Kelly and hating Justin, so I was semi-curious to see how the movie was. I expected it to be horrible. I wouldn't call it that. It WAS a predictable fluffy musical, if you're expecting anything more, you won't get it. If you don't like musicals, you won't like it. If you want something 'deeper,' you won't get it. I must say Kelly was the highlight of the movie. Her acting is decent and her singing is above average as always. Justin is a better actor than a singer, but that's not saying much. They play characters very close to who they actually are, so I don't think it was much of a stretch for them.\n\nYes, it was silly and predictable, but it's not the worst movie ever. I wasn't looking at my watch ever few minutes to see when I was going to get out like I have with other movies. I can think of numerous movies that are worse than this. I probably won't see it again, but I'm not begging for my $5.25 back.\n\n5/10"

Hopefully the persons in charge at American Idol have learned their lesson with this flop and will not try to promote things like this in the future. Maybe they did, as Season 5 just ended and there haven't been anything since this. Way to go Taylor Hicks."

Anyhow, I managed to catch it once before here on cable and despite what I had heard so much about the movie, I still watch it because I do like Kelly and her music.\n\nSo it all started out as two group of youngsters (Justin's and Kelly's friends) were heading to the beach for some fun time. But never did Kelly realised that Justin do like her. But, one of Kelly's friends, being the jealous one tries to separate the two of them. Well, what happens in the end is just about as predictable as anyone can think.\n\nI do like the songs being used in the movie. Very fun and light-hearted, you know. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nI am aware when this movie was released, it had never made its way here. I don't know, maybe given the general reaction back in the States.

Hello Kiddies your pal the Cupid Critic with two old famous teenage American idols who look like MTV rejects. Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson are in a romantic musical jut by the idea of that it sounds like a terrible film. A lonely, sexually repressed man. A depressed woman. A summer camp. On this fateful night, they will meet... and their hearts will become one. The films goal was probably to make some money and make their careers hot on the press, maybe at the time it may have succeeded but this is one lame romantic musical, with the music looking like a music video instead of a heartfelt Hollywood production. The acting is downright awful and I had to check periodically to find out if I had gone death just by listening to their dialogue. The story is no interesting its the same things you see in any teen romance but with unlike-able characters and your not rooting for the two main leads to be together. The direction is horrendous this time around from Robert Iscove who directed She's All That which I have plans on seeing in this time of love as we're closing in on Valentines Day. None of the elements of a good film are present during this picture it has horrible script with horrendous acting and just a really boring premise and love story.

Then there are movies that are so bad they're funny (ie. The Core, Blue Lagoon), and then there is From Justin to Kelly. It is in a league of it's own. The absolute pits of Hollywood flops. If I didn't feel the need to warn humanity of this movie, I would not be writing this review right now.\n\nKelly and Justin (aptly named) are two college-age partiers who are not your typical college-age partiers. They are looking for true love, not just promiscuous sex. Kelly is a non-aspiring singer from Texas, and Justin is a frat boy/dancer/heartthrob with two truly obnoxious friends. They're made for each other, right? Erm, sort of.\n\nThe problem is, Kelly's blonde friend is secretly in love with Justin, and engages in a covert sabotage of their relationship by giving Justin her phone number as Kelly's. Justin thinks, then, that he's sending Kelly text messages. But really, he's sending them to the jealous blonde friend, who does everything in her power to nip the relationship at the bud. (Interestingly, Justin never tries to call the cell phone, and he and Kelly never discuss the text messages. Convenient, huh?) But, as could be predicted, true love finds a way to prevail.\n\nSometimes musicals become awkward when put on screen. Rent, for example, or West Side Story. Other times, they become travesties. All of the songs, save for the first one, are awkward sorts of mental reflections. They are sung out loud, but only sort of. Quite often, in fact, Kelly and Justin have duets that they are both singing inside their heads, yet synchronized. Get it? Me neither.\n\nI think my brain will bleed if I force myself to try to dissect this movie further. This movie is not like a train wreck. You literally have to force yourself to watch it. Don't be a hero and take a hit for humanity. It's not worth it."

Yes, it is that bad. Bad southern accents, stereotype characters, lame dialogues and of course, unintelligible melancholia. The music,well, don't expect any Pink Floyd or Queen. Even Tiffany would sound here as Janis Joplin (and that's a lot to tell) To sum up,I really hate myself for wasting half and hour watching this horrible, pathetic, lame excuse for a movie. Everyone involved in this movie should be trailed and imprisoned (if not executed). As Marlon Brando said : the horror, the horror."

Through some awful acting and timing, there is still a glimmer or two of feeling between the characters. Justin and Kelly still manage to sing clearly in their average songs so as not to make the movie a total loss. If you are really bored, and want to relax while doing something else while also having a movie in the background, then this is a good movie for that."

HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SAY THIS, PEOPLE? Just because you can sing does NOT mean that you can act. Did we really have to see this sort of Spice Girls repeat? They only made money on that movie because they were big and already famous. You hear that? ALREADY FAMOUS! So by making this movie they were dangerously close to ruining Kelly's career before it even started. On behalf of the idiots behind this movie, I apologize Kelly.\n\nAnd that music! What was with that? It was like they were stopping the movie every time there was a song and would have a music video. The songs had barely anything to do with the plot at the time they sang them.\n\nIn an interview, Kelly and Justin both said that this movie was like Grease, except on a beach, which is an insult in itself. Enough said."

I'm not exaggerating, its sick. I am quite opinionated but everything else (even Uwe Boll who i hate with a passion) looks good compared to this. The only reason to watch this movie is to be able to say the world without crossing your fingers that you have seen the worst movie of all time. it wasn't even a good laugh it just makes you cringe. In summary i really hate this movie and am thankful for it, because i could film a fat man falling down some stairs and get an Oscar for it as long as the judges watch from Justin to Kelly right before it."

It was probably one of the worst decisions of Kelly's life to act. I don't believe I waisted my time watching this movie. In 2003 I was kind of excited to see this movie. If the genre was comedy why wasn't their anything funny in it. The script was so unwell written. My recommendation is to never in your life watch this movie because you will regret it. There no doubt that Kelly can sing that's why she won American Idol but she is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. It wasn't entirely her fault, her lines weren't creative at all. I thought every actor in this movie did a terrible job, same with the directors and everyone else. I just thought this was a disgrace."

How many actual winners can you name and are still recording? And in at least one case, it was a runner up that actually managed to gain stardom not the person that actually won. But I can say the series was massively popular so what did the producers decide to do? Rush out a movie using the winner and runner up of the first season into a terrible movie.\n\nThe story is pretty basic. Young man meets young woman, both of them sing, they dance badly, other people sing and dance badly, there's a plot shoehorned in there and in the end the two wind up together. You've seen this whole plot before. Honestly there is absolutely nothing new here. But what separates a good version of this story from a bad version is the plot. Well, that and the musical numbers of course. And as somebody who has seen their fair share of musicals I can tell you that this has \"marketing machine\" pasted all over it. This was made to sell a product, namely the whole American Idol thing.\n\nCertain things can be forgiven. Justin and Kelly can't act. Neither could Elvis for that matter but he at least had charisma and there's none of that on screen. There's no real chemistry between the leads. Their whole getting together in the end just doesn't feel organic and the rest of the movie feels lazy and rushed.\n\nThankfully this movie didn't do well with the critics or the audience or we'd be getting a slew of these things after each season."

If not, why would anyone even bother to watch this, in the first place, & expect something substantial!?! If a movie was going to be made with the inexperienced Kelly Clarkson & Justin Guarini (to cash in on their \"A.I.\" popularity) this type of film was a perfect vehicle for their \"talents\". This genre of film is not known for great acting or substantial storylines & that's why they're the perfect leads. I think Justin & Kelly deserve a lot more credit than they have received. One minute they walked in off the street to audition for a TV show & the next minute a huge spotlight is on them. And then they are thrust onto a movie set to star in a film!! For two young virtual nobodies I think they handled themselves pretty well considering the pressure, & overwhelming excitement they must have felt. Yes, they wanted it & they GOT IT FAST!!!!!!!! The movie has it's flaws. Kelly Clarkson is no great beauty, so special attention should have been made to make her appear as pretty as possible. She looks downright homely in some scenes with little or no makeup, unflattering photography, & horrible clothes. She could have looked so much better. Justin is photographed in an unflattering fashion in some scenes too. They also have absolutely no romantic screen chemistry at all. The movie's flaws can be overlooked because it achieves what it strived for: FUN! The music is lively, the dancing is pretty good, there's romance, hot bodies, beautiful Florida scenery & festive colors. This movie is no worse than any other film in this mediocre genre (\"Where The Boys Are '84\", \"Spring Break\", \"Girl Happy\", \"Lauderdale\", etc.) & that's why it should be cut some major slack."

You would think being on a TV show together would make both Justin and Kelly comfortable being in the presence of both a camera and each other, but they look lost without Simon around to berate them. At least the dismal failure of the movie insured that we wouldn't be subjected to \"From Jordin to Sanjaya.\" I have to admit on a personal level that I loathe anything American Idol / Canadian Idol / Australian Idol / Greenland Idol / North Korean Idol, etc."

They actually released this into the cinema. We do not watch a lot of TV, and hardly (never) watch shows like American Idol.

The script, the acting, plot, the clich\u00e9s, set production are all of the lowest quality. It's unbelievably bad.\n\nI'd like to make some comments on the rating it receives here. It has a 1.7 rating (1.0 being the absolute worst on a scale of 1-10). ~76% of the people rate it 1.0 (aweful). ~6% of the people rate is a 2 or 3. ~3% of the people rate it between 9 and 4. ~12% of the people rate it a perfect 10. OK, here's where I am convinced that the rating system is uncontrolled for people who are 1) out of their minds, 2) pranksters, or 3) think that a 10 is a 1 and visa versa.\n\nThis movie conforms to the lowest standards; don't waste your time on it."

It was confusing to have \"wholesome\" dialogue juxtaposed with girls in string bikinis or whipped cream bikinis even. Justin and Kelly did have a decent chemistry, but they weren't on screen together enough to develop it and give them a reason to be together besides love at first sight. The absolute worst scene was where Justin and a guy from Kelly's home town (Luke?) go against each other in hovercrafts. Hovercrafts sound kind of cool, right? Well, not when the fight over Kelly consists of throwing what they called \"beanbags\" (which looked like regular inflated balls to me) into each others laundry baskets in the crafts while racing past each other. It was ridiculous, much like the rest of the movie. Let's hope Justin or Kelly can get a decent script next time."

O my god I have to go rent Gigli to forget how awful this movie was!"

Anywhere. Ever.\n\nMorbid fascination gripped me. Like how I imagine it would be if spectating at an autopsy.

Please God Almighty, Allah, Buddha, Jesus, Superman, Mr T, anyone, for the love of humanity, MAKE IT STOP!!! OH!!! MAKE IT STOP!!! Very, very sadly, it didn't. Wave after wave of unctuous dialogue, vapid plot line, cringeworthy musical numbers and nauseating primary-color-drenched camera work.\n\nAnd the humor!! Oh, sweet merciful universe, the lifeless jokes and retarded setups. Somebody shoot me, I might laugh or even just feel less sorrow for the state of our civilisation.\n\nAnd, believe me, even these damning words are not even 10% of the proper justice deserved by this film's tragically awful wrongness.\n\nThe recommendation \"AVOID\" should be shrieked with the same heartfelt terror as though you were a contagious Ebola carrier dropped in a meadow full of the last remaining humans in existence."

Maybe there's a slight charm to it because it's now more than two decades old, and that's generally how long it takes for a period of time to feel nostalgic.\n\n10 years ago, the 2000s didn't have as distinct a flavor; they weren't super long ago. But now, the 2000s have a distinct feel the same way the 1990s and 1980s and so on have had a feel for a while, and maybe there's an element of nostalgia to be felt from watching this stupid movie. Also, it's only 81 minutes long, and it has enough uncanny/weird moments that make it entertaining enough to sit through.\n\nYes, the acting's not very good, it's cynically made, and I understand people dumping on it because it's connected to American Idol, but judged just as its own thing, I don't really think it deserves to be considered an all-time bad movie. Neither is it great, of course, but there's a difference between something that's a little bit bad and something that's genuinely reprehensible, and even if it's a hot take, I only think From Justin to Kelly is a little bit bad."

She didn't even want to do it. I didn't like Grease and it's a musical. I loved Hairspray (2007) High School Musical (2006) High School Musical 2 (2007) and Enchanted (though it's not really a musical) but other than that I don't like Musicals. I refuse to watch them if they're like FJTK it's awful. It sucked. It only stayed in theatres for two weeks at least if not more than that. In a way they broke the rules, competitors aren't allowed to fratenize until a few months after the finale. And Simon Fuller who created American Idol was the writer and producer. All in all, I give it 1/100000000000000th of a star (if that even exists) or less."

The songs were horrible, boring, and awkwardly timed. The film work was pitiful. Anyone that knows anything about cinema knows what will happen next in the movie before it happens. It is predictable, and I cant believe what passes for entertainment today. Anyone that gave this movie over a 1 star needs to be beaten silly with a piece of lumber. This movie might be entertaining for young kids, However, there are a lot of provocative dancing sequences, mature dialog, and more wannabe party teen plot parts. So this movie isn't for kids, and it isn't for anyone with an Iq over 25. Please I implore you to avoid this movie, even if there is only one station working on your TV - please don't watch this... bang your head into the wall, it will make more sense, be more fun, leave you with less of a headache, and you will feel like you accomplished more doing that than watching this useless piece of Hollywood trash trying to make money off of those poor souls that watch Idol.

The music is my favorite and Justin Guadalcanal and Carol Kellyson are very good actors that are seriously the best! And they can dance! My son died and went to heaven when the oil tanker blew up at the end and Justin and Kelly fought the terrorists in a mind-numbing space battle over Mars. If I found one fault in this masterpiece of science-fiction it was that TV's \"Fish,\" also known as Abe Vigoda, did not make an appearance. If Abe was there to give his catchphrase, \"That's a lotta pie,\" I think that the film-going audience would have found love for a film that offered so much pain, suffering, and bone-crunching action!\n\nI want a sequel now! It should be called Storming of the Gates: Justin to Kelly 2: the Deep End. I think that in these troubled times we need two American heroes to save the day and fight back the terror that is Alaska. Justin and Kelly are those heroes, so watch out Alaskan-terrorists!"

But FOX decided to cut most of his best scenes...guess they didn't want him to steal the show from Kelly (who looked crappy and was not so light on her feet either).\n\nIf you love Justin like I do...go see the movie. Then wait for the DVD and hope that all of his cut scenes are included there."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, to be fair, you have to have seen this movie at least 3 times to give an honest review.\n\nThe first time I seen this movie was in the theater. I had to beg my sister and best friend to come with me. Though they say that they hated the movie, it didn't take me too long to convince them to see it in the first place. They are probably closet J2K fans. But they arent review this, I am, so who cares what THEY thought?\n\nOkay so the second time I seen this movie was about three weeks ago. I rented it because I was bored and needed to make fun of something. It was between J2K and Gigli. I am not a strong enough person to watch Gigli for the first time alone. Especially not when there are sharp, blunt objects around that I could hurt myself or the tv with.\n\nBut back to the movie. I rented it and was home alone and put it on. I was shocked to say the least. I actually didn't HATE IT. It was better than I remembered it being in theaters.\n\nI had to do a project for my Post Production class and was going to do a music video tribute to the three worst musicals ever made that I actually LIKED. Those three: Grease 2, J2K, and Crybaby.\n\nIn order to do this I needed to rewatch J2K again to see what parts I wanted to use. I must say that after the third viewing, I love this movie.\n\nIt was so stupid. The dialogue is pretty bad, most of it is VERY unlikely to EVER happen and a lot of the acting is just plain bad. But the music is good and it doesnt really drag. In other words, I've seen A LOT worse movies. (cough) SCOOBY DOO (cough).\n\nThe thing that I really didnt consider the first time I seen this was, Justin and Kelly are NOT actors. They werent on \"Acting Idol\". I can't really say anything bad about their acting because they are NOT actors and this movie proves that.\n\nSo, for those of you who gave this a ONE STAR, I suggest you rewatch it again. This is the type of movie you CAN'T take seriously. Overall I gave this movie an 8. It was interesting and I certainly wasn't bored while I was watching it.\n\nI didn't take any points off for acting because like I said they are NO actors.\n\nI took off 1 point for the fact that this would NEVER happen, ever.\n\nI took off 1 more point for the fact that this is a musical, yet there is no cd soundtrack. Bad move Fox.\n\nFinal thoughts: LIGHTEN UP, PEOPLE! This isn't like Gigli where they were honestly trying to make a good movie and it failed. This is NOT a serious movie. Give it another chance!"

I just saw it for the first time the other day and was completely overtook by it. The music (most of it, at least) was great, so was the acting, and even though the plot was a bit shaky, I think it was an awesome movie.\n\nBefore I looked up the reviews and ratings for this movie, I knew that it couldn't have done very well. Critics today are very picky and I know wouldn't like a movie like this. But when I saw that it was the number 1 WORST romance movie, that got me a little upset. I think this movie deserves at least better than that. I doubt that Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson even new how to act when they won American Idol, so it had to have taken a lot of work to get them to be able to act as well as they did."

I really didnt think it was all that bad.. i mean the soundtrack is great.. none of the songs felt boring to me.. their acting wasnt all that bad i mean please do compare there acting with britney spears and mariah carey i mean WHOA!! atleast their facial expressions change throughout the movie.. i watched crossroads and glitter and i forced myself to complete them believe me.. this one actually i watched more than once and i downloaded it off the net.. so whoever didnt watch this movie and is very much hesitating to watch it because of the horrible reviews i suggest u go and see it for urself.. its less then 2 hours anyway i dont think ud have too much to do in that time...\n\nFrom justin to kelly is a light (very light) chick flick.. its story is very small no twists.. it just revolves around 4 to 6 people.. but it really doesnt get u thinking anywhere through its not a comedy either it wont get u laughing.. itll just add a smile to ur face by the end of it BUT alot of u would think its a waste of time.. so dont watch it if u didnt like my description!!\n\nOverall not all movies satisfy all audiences.. so give it a try and see for urself.."

Maybe they should have chose, someone from Pop Idol (the Idol that started it all) like Will Young, or Gareth Gates?? But oh well too late now... leave it to the Americans to screw up what could have been a better film.... and thus somewhat disgracing the Musical Genre in general."

And yes it was very bad but the fact that they hammed it up so knowingly leads me to believe it was intentional to make an all out camp fest. the acting is droll of course and shows no emotion at all, the singing is pretty good, the choreography laughable and the story, well the story needs to be seen to be believed. the most important thing when watching this film as the same with showgirls is leave all inhibitions at the door. It's a rockin retread of bad film cliches and even worse plot twists all adding of to a perfectly outlined piece of hollywood fluff."

It won't change your life, it won't even make you think hard, but it's still enjoyable.\n\nMy husband, my kids, and I enjoyed it because it was like a 2000s version of a Frankie & Annette beach movie. Almost no violence, bad language, or sex and even the dancing didn't have many sexually provocative moves.\n\nHeck, it was worth buying just to see my 4 yo try to dance and sing every song."

The directing and way the camera moves really shows the confidence and compassion of the lead characters, wile at the same time showing the anguish of the minor or walk on roles. The almost all natural lighting also adds to the dark lurid and very cheery feel of the whole thing. After seeing this in theaters with my friends *who also loved it* all I could think about was watching it again. Lucky for me it was on DVD about a month later! We all bought a copy and went home, sat down with some sodas, popped popcorn and sat through it 5 times until we were all asleep. I wish I could have that wonderful night back. So if you are looking for a really great and under rated movie, From Justin to Kelly is the thing for you."

The dancing also was awesome. This movie has opened me up to Justin's voice and I am now going to purchase his album, because he has an awesome voice and he sings good music. If you don't like this movie because it's clean, need to readjust their morals. I watch movies that aren't always decent, but I appreciate and respect actors that play in movies that a whole family can watch."

I love Kelly's voice, and Justin's... not to mention Anika Noni Rose, who played Kaya, and was also in Dreamgirls. This was by no means a theatrical feat of any kind. However, I think you know exactly what you're going to get if you watch this movie. I watched it for the music and the light-heartedness, and that's what I got. I was entirely entertained, even though this movie IS 5 years old and Justin Guarini has apparently disappeared. The plot gets a zero; a five year old could almost write the script. But I loved \"Anytime\", and give Justin's and Kelly's voices a 10 together."

I mean come on, the makers of the film could easily have added more language or sexual situations, buy instead what we have is a love story set on a beach like those old 60's Annette Funicello movies our parents use to watch. Taken like that, I'm sure you'll agree, it's not only Not Bad, it's kinda cool."

I reckon everyone should watch the movie first before they make any judgments on whether to see it or not , because it is your choice. i really did not watch the show American idol but from what i saw just then they are bloody good and anyone out there who thinks there as good as those two then go out and give it ago. bloody hell Justin ask her out all ready you two belong together."

Also people, i've read some of your comments about this movie and i think the people that are making fun of the way Justin or Kelly look, or the way they act, than that is seriously stupid because first of all let them care about the way they look and second of all it was their first time acting in an actual movie. I'm sure most of you guys that made a bad comment like that aren't good at acting. Since that was Justin and Kelly's first time acting, they did pretty good, because i LOVED this movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is the most amazing movie i've probably ever seen for the last 15 years i've been living. I love musical movies! & having two amazing singers in it that are very talented in acting, dancing, & in singing made the movie even better. They made this movie in my state FLORDIA! & the shooting was an hour away from where i leave i think thats really cool. All of the dances were AMAZING! & very entertaining i watch them over & over again & all of the outfits Kelly were were beautiful the movie was so good! i watch it at least 5 times every night! i hear a lot of people don't like it but thats because they don't understand it. If you like the beach, singing, dancing, drama, Justin & Kelly then you will for sure like this movie with out a doubt! its a great movie even though it came out 4 years ago i still believe that its the greatest movie yet! & i wish they could make another one! i love it its my all time favorite movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know that because it has 2 singers in (well 1 and don't know what happened to Justin!!?) every1 will expect that its gonna be crap but : the spice girls movie sold millions! and the s club movie well thats a classic! but the songs are actually OK, some are a lot better than others like anytime is brilliant... i would advise any true Kelly fan to see this !! the supporting cast are nobody's though, with the token LOSER and the joker .. then there's the slut and the one who finds love. so its pretty much similar to any other chick flick!! unfortunately i have not yet found myself a copy so if anyone does find anyway to get hold of it let me know I'm sure any other fan would much appericiate it"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was actually pretty good. I was kinda surprised. But then again.. Justin and Kelly are good actors.! Some of us don't really like American Idol but if i were to watch it... I would like it... Part of the reason is music.. ya know the movie. \"From Justin To Kelly\" is more of a musical.. and music rocks.. Justin and Kelly are great actors in this movie.. And i wish they would make a Sequel to this movie.. I know that i'd buy it if they did. Well i know that probably didn't help at all.. laugh out loud. Thank you.. I hope that they do make a sequel because i'd have a party at my house for the new movie. From Justin To Kelly 2 the sequel.. ya.. great things happen if you wish.. ya know.. i love the movie because i love music and i wish that sooner or later the will make the sequel. Thank you\n\nSincerely, bombergraduate2008"
