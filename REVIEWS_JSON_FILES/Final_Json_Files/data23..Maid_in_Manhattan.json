It's never going to change your life but not bad for whiling away a boring afternoon if you've nothing better to do."

I don't know why I wanted to see this movie, just I figured I needed a romantic comedy in my selection, so I just grabbed it and even after that rating I thought this was going to be a bad movie. But as it turns out this really wasn't a bad movie at all. Yeah, it has minor flaws here and there, this isn't movie of the year, but over all I would say that it was pretty cute.\n\nMarisa is a single mom in Manhattan who is a working maid in one of the top hotels. She is also up for a big promotion as a manager and is hoping to help her fellow employees. When she and a co-worker are just fooling around and wondering what it's like to try on over 5,000 dollars worth of clothes, Marisa gets caught by a politician who her son is excited to meet. She has to convince him that nothing can happen between them without letting him know what she did and who she really is, but it might be too strong of a connection for both of them to let go so easily.\n\nMaid in Manhattan is predictable and I think Marisa's character wasn't really as developed as I would like her to be because she came off as kinda rude and judgmental. But over all, I wouldn't say this is a 4.5 rated movie, I think people were probably just jumping on the movie because it is Jennifer Lopez, I would agree, I'm not into her either, but I can't resist if I do like a movie or not and I wanna be honest if I like a movie. So please just give the movie a shot if you're looking for a sweet romantic comedy.\n\n5/10"

Ralph Finnes for heaven's sake, a very particular actor, very choosy or so I hear and Jennifer Lopez in the hands of a good director can deliver, remember \"Out of Sight\"? No. The movie seems written by people who've never seen a Preston Sturges or a Billy Wilder movie. It is a sub TV movie of the week. Even Bob Hoskins playing the Hector Elizondo part of \"Pretty Woman\" can't save the day. Only Natasha Richardson in an all out performance managed to make me smile. There was a time in Hollywood, not so long ago, when you could get a film made if you had Steve Guttenberg in it. Jennifer Lopez is the Steve Guttenberg of the new millennium. I don't understand how something so thoughtless, tasteless and utterly un-redeeming could get made in Manhattan, Hollywood or anywhere else. Somebody should tell Jennifer Lopez that she's not Audrey Hepburn or Jean Arthur. There is a sort of hardness about her that makes her anti-romantic. Her wardrobe as the Maid of the title is utterly insane. As is every attempt at sincerity. I'm sure Jennifer Lopez has talent but not certainly for romantic comedies. She keeps making them though. I bet she would be great in steamy melodramas. I would cast Miss. Lopez in the Bette Davis part in a remake of \"Beyond the Forest\""

Its characters also experience transformation thanks to several easily-overlooked defining moments. So watch and enjoy the film for entertainment. Then watch it again, and again, for the pleasure of discovering the tapestry of truths it contains.\n\nThis is every bit as good a film as \"The Wedding Planner\" and Fiennes portrays a politico who learns the world doesn't revolve around himself. To some that might seem like fantasy, but it doesn't detract from the story. The supporting cast is a delightful menagerie. And perhaps the best role is that of Lionel Bloch, played by Bob Hoskins, who portrayed Smee in \"Hook.\"\n\nThis isn't just another chick flick. And guys may need a few Kleenex. They will definitely be glad that Jennifer Lopez didn't wear another dress."

I found Jennifer Lopez a bit stiff in places, but overall she handled the role well. I do not understand why so many people had problems with Ralph Finnes in this movie, I found him not only believable but incredibly sexy, and I hope he gets the opportunity to do more romantic comedies! Bob Hoskins stole every scene he was in. Stanley Tucci chewed scenery. Natasha Richardson was suitably selfish and blonde. New York was lovely. The dog overacted shamelessly. The movie was not perfect, but it was delightful. The only wrong note was the series of magazine covers at the end, showing what happened to the characters; it was much too \"cute\" and rather unbelievable (all three of her maid friends become hotel managers?) And I was rather disappointed that - for all the film's brave talk of crossing social barriers - the movie ends with nothing more than a magazine cover with the headline \"A year later, they are still together\". I felt cheated."

Jennifer Lopez's turn as Cinderella/Sabrina proves she does not remotely belong to \"rags-to-Princess\" roles; she is galaxies away from Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly (or even \"Pretty Woman\" Julia Roberts), no matter how expensive the jewelry or costumes she wears. Ralph Fiennes seems to be on an O.D. of Prozac, with a perennial foolish smile on his face, wishing he were Cary (or even Hugh!) Grant -- shame to see a talented actor in such a puffy role. Natasha Richardson is wasted in the obligatory dumb blonde part, Stanley Tucci hams it up irritatingly, Bob Hoskins knows and shows his role is an embarrassment. On a less negative note, kid Tyler Posey is a real charmer, and manages to survive his \"cutie\" part. The direction? Well, no doubt Wayne Wang is a professional and I hope he was paid a LOT of money to lend his prestigious name to this fluffy cake - I only wish the word \"professionalism\" were taken more seriously, as in \"professional integrity\"...Where is the Wayne Wang that directed the surrealistic \"Life is Cheap...But Toilet Paper is Expensive\" and the cool \"Smoke\"?\n\nSit through this only if you are in a hypoglycemic fit; otherwise watch \"Sabrina\" once again and marvel at real star power, witty dialog and charm to spare!"

Saw 'Maid in Manhattan' because the cast are so talented, but it more often than not was very disappointing.\n\n'Maid in Manhattan' does have some beautiful scenery and it is very nicely shot. It is also a case where the supporting cast are better than the leads, though all the characters are uninteresting genre archetypes. Particularly good is the adorable and very likable Tyler Garcia Posey, while Natasha Richardson is amusing and Bob Hoskins (with a speech that is the one script highlight of the film) makes much of a role that could have easily have wasted him completely, it's beneath him but as said he does much with what he has.\n\nUnfortunately neither Jennifer Lopez or Ralph Fiennes are convincing. Lopez handles the cutesy moments well, but often looks stiff, does not convince as a maid and possesses leaden comic timing and the emotion parts feel forced. Fiennes is also stiff and charmless, he is a brilliant actor but honestly looks like he wants to be somewhere else. Chemistry is severely lacking between them, almost like they disliked each other. Then there is Stanley Tucci, who chews the scenery to pieces in a very irritating fashion.\n\nThe film's soundtrack is ham-fisted and heavy-handed and the direction is bland. Like 'The Wedding Planner', if not quite as bad, 'Maid in Manhattan is lacking in both comedy and romance. For romantic comedies to work, the comedy should sparkle and the romantic elements should touch. Sadly, the comedy is chock full of clunky and witless dialogue, while even for a story loosely based on the oft-adapted 'Cinderella' story the story is predictable and contrived with improbable comic mishaps and over-sugary schmaltz that it's nauseating, with no genuine emotional impact or wit.\n\nOn the whole, has nice production values and a few good supporting turns but badly let down by unconvincing leads and poor execution of the comedic and romantic elements. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

But realism, which seems to be the stylistic fad these days, especially among snobby \"high-art\" movie ... ahem ... FILM goers, is not really the point here. To criticize the movie on those aspects would be silly (just as silly as it would be criticize Cinderella on those grounds ... and it isn't pumpkin carriages that I'm talking about).\n\nWhile the story has been told many times before, it's not alone in that respect.

He plays a GREAT scary/creepy guy but I don't think he should ever do a romantic comedy again. Yes he had some really sweet lines, but they would have been so much sweeter if delivered from a heart breaker like Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Jackman, or Johnny Dep. Everytime he smiled I thought he looked like he was about to slash her thoat (not saying that would have been a bad thing) The sweetest part of the movie was the stuffed penguin.\n\nThey didn't have a drop of chemistry. But all in all it wasn't TOO bad. It was still a sweet story.\n\nI did like Stanley Tucci in this and the maid that put in JLo's application (not sure what her name is) I thought they were at least believable.\n\nI gave it a 6/10 for enjoyment value."

Unjust I feel, when you go to see this movie or rent it, I assume you know that it's a romantic movie? By the title of the movie you could very much assume that it's a feel good movie. So when you bring these 2 together you pretty much know what's gonna happen if you read the back of the movie box. Why rent it then? For it's purpose, it makes you feel good. Two people falling in love is always a nice thing and seeing how they cross boundary's for that love is even nicer. Thus I think that the movie succeeded in what he was made for. To give people the romance and the good feeling. Go see this movie with your girl/boyfriend if he or she doesn't dislike this kind of movies and sure you will feel happier about your own relationship as well. Because there is nothing heavy about this movie. That's what makes it so good in his genre. Do not watch this movie for super acting skills (although I do not dislike the acting). Do not go and see him for the directors special thricks to tell you things. Go see this movie for the romance and positive note and for sure you will not be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maid in Manhatten is a tragic film, and I don't mean it has a tragic story. No instead what I am saying is its so bad its tragic. Maid in Manhatten is about a maid who works at a nice big hotel were everything is fine but she yearns for more. In the midst of all this a suitably gorgeous politician moves into the hotel. A case of mistaken identity mean that they go for a sunny walk and he falls in love with her but cant find her. Its basically a poorly judged and woefully acted take on Cinderella only this time with a far sexier Cinderella. Sexy she may be but a gifted actress she is not, Jennifer Lopez puts in a dire performance and one that had me cringe at times. Ralph Fiennes star of such great films as Schindlers List and The constant Gardner should avoid Rom-Coms because based on his performance here they are'nt his thing. The jokes are either sickeningly predictable or just plain plain rubbish in the end I think I laughed once and it was a minor giggle. The Romantic Comedy genre is full of atrocious films so when I report this is possiobly the worst ever you know its seriously bad. So to conclude Maid in Manhatten fails on all counts and its home will always be a DVD bargain bin"

Jennifer Lopez fares pretty well but I wish she would broaden her range of roles and play something else than gorgeous but feisty Latino women.\n\nThe message that the high and mighty usually ignores maids, butlers, waiters or servants got lost somewhere and in the end the spunky maid wasn't a maid at all but management material. But what can you expect from a romantic comedy?"

The storyline follows a hotel maid who catches the attention of a political figure. He doesn't know she works at the hotel and the two start dating and eventually fall in love. The maid tries to keep many of the details of her life a mystery but as he discovers more and more about the intricacies of her life will it lead to the demise of the budding relationship?\n\nThis movie is directed by Wayne Wang (Smoke) and stars Jennifer Lopez (Money Train), Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardner), Natasha Richardson (Parent Trap), Stanley Tucci (The Lovely Bones), Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf).\n\nThis is a very relatable movie, at least in the goals and ambitions aspects of the storyline. The family dynamics of being both a daughter and mother simultaneously are well depicted. The acting is excellent and everyone delivers solid performances. I really enjoyed both the primary storyline and various subplots tied to each character and circumstance. The relationship was well depicted and the ending press conference was great.\n\nOverall, this movie has more depth and is better than it gets credit for. I would score this a solid 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it."

I've seen a lot of very talented (childless) actresses really blow it when they try to do motherhood. J. Lo was perfectly natural interacting with her \"son\".

Top English actors are used in all the roles requiring \"class\", which is amusing; no doubt they were chuckling all the way to the bank. Note also that pretty much all of the other lead actors are about 10 years older than J-Lo, the purpose of which is probably to make her seem younger than she actually is (about 32 at time of filming). As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a \"romantic comedy\" which contains no romance or comedy - unless you count the lame \"oops I almost sat on your face\" line - yuk yuk yuk. There is about as much chemistry between J-Lo and Fiennes as between Minnie Mouse and Donald Duck. Its not the worst film that Fiennes has done (think \"Avengers\") but its close!"

It's a comedy, so storylines are allowed to be preposterous, but be warned, although I loved every minute of it, most people seem to have found it trite. I found the script great \u0096 but maybe I just laugh easily. Lopez acts well, so much better in this role than the stereotype Bullock (who was also considered for the part) might have brought to it, and Bob Hoskins and Ralph Fiennes \u0096 two actors I usually can't abide \u0096 gave great performances. Hoskins has a few great speeches and Ralph Fiennes has lost much of the simpering edginess he's had in so many films that I've found annoying. If nothing else, those of you who like to see beautiful clothes worn well can do no better than admire real-life Bronx-girl-made good Lopez, though we don't unfortunately get to see her dance very much or sing \u0096 two other things she also does rather well."

Anyway, the film was never made in the 50s, and the script got forgotten in some hidden drawer, until one day it fell in the hands of the director, or producer of this flop.\n\nSorry, but this is how it looks. Story, music, directing are so fiftish, like the film has been made in some time capsule. JLo succeeds to be less attractive than in any of her other movies, not to speak of the video clips. Everything is damned boring and predictable. I rated this film 4/10 on my personal scale, and it would have been scored even worse, without the great performance of Bob Hoskins. Where did this fabulous actor hide lately? Why did he not become the great star everybody hoped he will be when he did 'Mona Lisa'?

This movie is lame at best, and there is no drama, humor, suspense, and worse, no chemistry with JLO and Finnes (He even has more in common with the kid). It is basically a fairy tale along the lines of \"Ever After\" (Which is a better film, because there is some action (Drew Barrymore with a sword), and shockingly Barrymore is hotter in that film than Lopez is here which with the notable exception of \"Bad Girls\" is not true).

There is a good example of class segregation in the movie. Bob Hoskins plays an excellent, subdued role worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is a fun, entertaining movie that guys really should consider taking their dates regardless of what they feel. 6 out of 10 stars. (7 or 8 stars during the holiday season)."

A more than decent script is present and serious and humorous moments are well balanced; both the leading and supporting characters (esp. Tyler Posey, Natasha Richardson, Stanley Tucci, and Marissa Matrone)are well written and well presented by the actors playing them.\n\nI must recommend this film to anyone who is tired of seeing overrated movies deliver little in the way of enjoyment.

Is there any blood or violenece in this film? No, but there should have been, I HATED all these characters, if they all started to stab each other with sharp object it would have been a much better movie. Every stupid character and every stupid piece of dialog and every stupid plot device that has ever been in a movie is in this one. This should have been a horror film, it would have been much better - for example I would have loved JLo to get a big metal pole shot through her face, or have that kid eaten by zombies or something.

And then the resolution is that Jennifer Lopez is just that hot. I hope that wasn't a spoiler for someone, because it's really not.\n\nI honestly wish we had gotten a little bit more out of the pursuit of a woman he didn't know and more action out of the bad guy, but for the stereotypical elite, \"I'm going to have you fired, do you know who I am?\" seems appropriate enough, right?\n\nWhile I do think it is worth a watch, there are a lot of other things out there to watch, just not \"Gigli\" or \"The Wedding Planner\"."

I always thought these types of movies are always a bad rip-off of Pretty Woman, but Maid in Manhattan is even worse. I mean, everything in the movie is bad; the acting, directing, plot, music, costume-design, cinematography, even make-up (anybody notice Jennifer Lopez's sweaty armpits?). Let's start with the acting...the movies best actor was that little kid, and he stinks! After this I don't want to watch any other movie containing any of these actors (including good movies like The English Patient with Ralph Fiennes). The plot is even worse! The screenwriter must be really proud of being able to cram in all the clich\u00e9s imaginable in less than 2 hours. When writing this cra-, the guy surely had the Romantic Comedy for Dummies guidebook by him...and what's the deal with that stupid speech-clips thing? C'mon, the guy used the first office material he could find for that! And plot-holes anyone? Jennifer's character complains about maid stereotypes but the movies presents her as the very same stereotype! Go figure! The soundtrack is just as bad since the same spanish theme repeats every half-hour and most of the movies music is from Nora Jones' new album. They bought the cd and used as much music from it as possible. I guess I could be glad J-Lo doesn't sing. How many times did the cinematographer choose the New York skyline for transition scenes? I counted at least 6 times..but then again, I might've dosed off a few times. In summary, this movie suc-s; it suc-s bad! I mean, unless you're a suicidal depressive maniac who doesn't treasure life a bit (although I guess this movies is even too bad for these types), you will detest this movie and will want to die a horrible, horrible death! The tagline alone should be reason enough to stay away from this: This Christmas...love checks in! I can't even start saying what's wrong with this. I hated this movie and everyone who liked it and was in it! 0$ out of $$$$!"

The two feel connected with each other when they take Marissa's 10-year-old son, Ty, played by Tyler Posey, to the Zoo.\n\nNatahsa Richardson is terrific as Caroline Lane, the woman who's clothes Marissa tried on. She herself is attracted to Christopher Marshall, and is constantly flirting with him.\n\nThe floor butler, Lionel, is excellently played by Bob Hoskins, is your typical mentor. He has several nice lines such as, \"What we do does not define who we are.\" And his character adds common ground to the film.\n\nMaid in Manhattan is not overly comedic, but does have several humorous sequences such as when Marissa doesn't realize she has a magazine stuck to her butt. It does not have the most extensive dialouge, but it is very charming and is the movie equivalent of comfort food. 7 stars out of 10"

They both pose as upper class woman, wearing someone else's designer clothes (in the $5,000.00 price range), as they set their sights on a handsome man whose out of their league. They both have a wisecracking friend to confide in & co-workers to cheer them on.

Both films have happy, fairy tale outcomes where they get their men, & advance in their careers. The only thing is \"Working Girl\" (with Melanie Griffth) did this much better. The premise is tired & stale at this point. It all seems to make \"Maid In Manhattan\" look like a very long mediocre sitcom, & you can't help but compare it to all the other films it spawned from, which is very distracting."

The supporting cast is spotty, though. Hoskins shines the brightest -- I'd really like to see him lead some more films. His Iago in the BBC production of Othello, co-starring with Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal. Stanley Tucci is very good but the rest of the cast varies from good to weak.\n\nMaid in Manhattan is enjoyable enough as long as you don't expect anything more than a by-the-book fairy tale romance without a shred of originality."

She tries on a guest's clothes, and just that moment she's interrupted by Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes). He's from a political dynasty running for office and he mistakes her for a guest. What comes after is a class identity switch.\n\nThe whole concept just seems dated. Did John Hughes copy it from a 50's movie? The first problem I had was why Jennifer Lopez wouldn't try to better herself? At first I thought it was something interesting like trouble with the INS. But no it's mommy issues. The problem is that Lopez is completely miscast. No one would believe that she would be so meek. Her persona doesn't fit at all.\n\nI am willing to buy into the fairy tale being pushed here. I am even willing to buy that she couldn't tell him the truth. She's a maid after all. They're untouchables..... Duh!!! But if Ralph Fiennes plays the Prince Charming, he's got to be much more heroic. He needs to go in there like 'An Officer and A Gentleman'. He can't be dragged there by a little kid. Where's the chivalry? When it was revealed, he starts berating her about lying. There are so many things that are off in this movie."

These Waspy types don't have it in them to mingle with the help, or exotic types, as certainly Marisa Ventura might have appeared to this Chris Marshall.\n\nMiss Lopez is a better actress than some of her vehicles. She can act, as she has proven already, and certainly deserve better than what the team behind the film have given her to do here.\n\nIt's funny how some life and reality mix as they do in this film. JayLo comes from the Bronx originally and she's back on the No. 6 train again for most of the movie.\n\nRalph Fiennes is suave as the would be senator. His scenes with JayLo reveal the right amount of chemistry between them. Natasha Richardson is on target as the society bitch with the right clothes staying at the hotel. Bo Hoskins is excellent as usual. Also Marissa Matrone, as Stephanie, JayLo's best friend and fairy god mother, is very effective, as is Tyler Posey as the cute little boy afraid to speak in public."

I've always preferred J-Lo's singing career rather than her acting career, as she has starred in some of the worst stinkers I've ever seen.\n\nRalph Fiennes's character Christopher is completely unbelievable, as he appears to have more chemistry with his assistant Jerry (Stanley Tucci) than he does with J-Lo's character. They literally have nothing in common and the only reason Christopher is interested in her is because her son has an interest in politics. The script pushes for this unconventional romance in the blandest most uninspiring way possible.\n\nI will admit I found myself laughing at certain points, as well as mildly entertained. But I can see why Fiennes regretted making this film, as his character is extremely thinned down in terms of depth. He has the perfect partner in the form of Jerry, who will do anything and everything for him no matter what. But he's like:\n\n\"Nah, I wanna bang the pop star!\"\n\nlol."

I had an all day ticket and not once during the day could I actually sit down and watch this thing from start to finish. No, I'm not some ADD child that can't sit still. This movie was just so damn boring it just wasn't worth wasting 2 hours of my life watching it. Now it's been on Starz for a very long time and FINALLY I promised myself I would sit down and actually watch this thing from start to finish no matter how much I wanted to run away.\n\nThe absolute only thing that caught my attention was Jennifer Lopez's character. For once in her life she took on a role that makes the audience feel somewhat sympathetic for her, which is rare considering SHE always seems to consider herself as the world's biggest diva. Yes, she's made a lot of money thus far in her career, but for once she actually appears to take on a role that doesn't reinstate in everyone's mind that the only reason she's so famous is because she has a nice ass. Besides Selena, this is the only time I've seen her take on a role as a modest, minimum-wage woman whose only concern in life is the well-being of her young son.\n\nShe meets a POORLY cast Ralph Fiennes, who plays Assemblyman Chris Marshall.\n\nAs much as I can't stand J-Lo, I can't help but say it was only when he stepped into the movie I truly had to force myself from changing the channel.\n\nAs for J-Lo's son, played by Tyler Posey, he's almost believable as a normal child until he starts talking about politics. I'm sorry but any 10 year-old that is able to carry on a conversation with an assemblyman and comes off as smarter than him is most definitely NOT BELIEVABLE!!!\n\nOverall, I really wish I had just stuck with my gut and just left it at the pay-per-view I never wanted to watch. I miss the two hours I gave up watching this. 4 out of 10."

But the Cinderella shoe fits so perfectly with the Disney-US dream of self-realisation and capitalist exceptionalism. Add the ethnic angle here with Lopez and hey, we're on overdrive. Pleasant enough drivel, the chemistry between Lopez and Fiennes required by the viewing mob is lacking, but who cares. Money is key, wealth. And of course the soppy angelino kid without a sour thought in his head. Fact is, in the US you can lose your job at the click of a finger and fall on seriously bad times, and if you're an invisible Hispanic maid you remain invisible, even if you pay all your taxes (unlike the monied classes). Despite all these hard realities, we're still here 100 years later with the fake American dream: you too can get rich! That is, happiness equals wealth and vice versa. Another good reason for not setting foot again in the land of the free, where \"real\" lives revolve around fame celebrity and money, even if you're below the breadline: which is why cable TV is cheap, to keep you on your sofa dreaming and not rioting in the streets against the iniquities and your rights."

It must be escapism for my wife like James Bond films are an escape for guys, but the difference is the Bond films are well made and interesting. You do not have to watch this movie to know what will happen, not even the trailer it's just that predictable. As a matter of fact the first thing I said when the film ended in a smart ass tone was \"That was the most unpredictable movie I've ever watched!\". I just got \"the look\" from my wife. It is utterly unrealistic, and for any guys reading this, J Lo only dresses really hot in one scene at a dinner party that lasts about 5 minutes, the rest of the 1 hour and 50 minutes she's wearing a maid's uniform.

In lesser hands, actor-wise, this could have been a dud, but it's got such a talented troupe populating it that it comes out a winner on all fronts. Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes play the two lucky lovers, and as soon as one sees those two names attached to a title, one knows that we're in for something nice. Throw in Bob Hoskins, Stanley Tucci and the late Natasha Richardson and you've got yourself a stable full of actors who could be saddled with the worst script written and still be compelling. Thankfully they are given a wonderful little script here, and all own it. Lopez plays a maid at a swanky NYC hotel, and Fiennes is the carefree politician who drops in for a campaign stay. The two hit it off in a rumpus of accidentally mistaken identity, blossoming love from both sides of the tracks and the kind of slight, laid back charm that makes these flicks what they are. Lopez is a fierce and feminine presence in any film and I've always thought she should have focused primarily on acting, she's terrific at it. Fiennes is.. well he's superb in anything and the chemistry between the two isn't a pairing you'd expect, but works pretty well. Stanley Tucci could play a tree and still steal every moment, and is pure magic as Fiennes's harried assistant. Bob Hoskins is usually a pissy tornado, but seems incredibly reserved here, as the hotel's head butler who has a lesson of nobility and humility to teach Lopez. Natasha Richardson is the ditzy British blonde and plays it in pure 1960's mode, delightful and a reminder of the pure anguish that is still felt upon losing her presence in film. The film has just enough fluff and romance, and just enough solidly grounded writing to hold you through til the end, whilst Lopez and Fiennes, an unlikely pair, keep it real."

The scenes of dancing black maids and the fairy tale of a pretty Latina rising from the (literally) depths to the upper floors of the accepted world looked disturbing. Recently, I had the chance to watch it for free, and I decided to see just how bad it could be, so that next time I critiqued it, I could do so from a firm foundation of actually having seen it....\n\nIt was as problematic as I thought. Firstly, it was as bad as any other formulaic standard romantic comedy. It was predictable, mediocre writing, mediocre casting (though the boy was cute). Secondly, while I realize it's a fluff film, I would've appreciated more than just a token nod at the fact that most of the \"servants\" are minorities and the people being served (the ones with all the power & money) are Caucasian. Aside from all it's other problems - the thing I most had trouble with was why on earth did they make his character a Republican? Are we really supposed to believe a Latina working class single mom is really going to find happiness with a rich Caucasian REPUBLICAN? Give me a break. Their party line is pretty much hating everything she stood for and making sure she stays down (with only this token exception for a \"hottie\"). They tried to imply that she might stand up to her views, by a single comment she makes about the projects to him, but to me that only reinforced the problem.\n\nI also had a problem with the ending it seemed to happen only because of chance which doesn't argue for strong feelings on his part. The butler's actions at the end also didn't seem realistic. Without spoiling it, let me just say I doubt anyone in that job can afford to just act the way he did. Nice gesture, but totally unrealistic!"

Jerry...typical politician nanny Wang manages to capture the discriminative and impressionist urban community towards minority races. this is conveyed through Caroline's friend and a little bit in Jerry...successful expression. There are several flaws in the well-developed story. Observe them yourself if you have the chance: The whole fantasy is based on a lie, and though Marissa tries to end her relationship and adoration towards Christ, she finds it more and more difficult to be separated from him, until, at last, the truth unveils... The party scene seemed too brief, more elaboration needed.

It's even co-written by a writer of \"Working Girl\" that it resembles weakly and has a similar moderately feminist conclusion.\n\nBut it could have been better, after all, it's directed by Wayne Wang, whose early indie Chinese-American romantic comedies were so sweet.\n\nThere's wincible plot points for a New Yorker, though the rest of the world won't notice. The rich guy is supposed to be a Republican NY State Assemblyman (not the usual source for playboy paparazzi-magnets, unlike J. Lo herself) running for the family business of the US Senate - why not just make him a mogul? It took me most of the movie to come up with an even close-to-sensible back story that he's probably from Dutchess County or north, like the Hamilton Fishes or the Houghtons of Corning (though their money originally came from the glass works).\n\nThe opening use of \"Me and Julio\" while the camera zooms in on J. Lo's native Bronx will doubtless lead the rest of the world to assume that Corona is in the Bronx. That's as close to any Latin sounds in the movie (J. Lo is called \"Mediteranean-looking\" by her beau, though she does use Spanglish endearments to her son and once mutters under her breath in Spanish.) Oddly, there's no original songs used, and when Norah Jones's voice floods the screen we get more warm love from her \"Come Away With Me\" than any heat generated on the screen.\n\nAll the British actors are completely mis-cast. Ralph Fiennes simply doesn't have the touch for such a light, romantic role, and his American accent doesn't even work as an allegedly upper crust one (I couldn't stay around for the credits to see if he had a dialog coach.) Bob Hoskins has spent an entire career as a Working Class Hero and here we're supposed to believe he's a snobby butler in the John Gielgud in \"Arthur\" mode, or even like Hector Elizondo's manager in \"Pretty Woman,\" so his sympathy for J. Lo is less of a grudgingly earned turnabout. Natasha Richardson has a thankless role in what is usually the snotty fianc\u00e9e; worse is that her nasty, snobby, best friend, played by Amy Sedaris, is needlessly several times emphasized to be Jewish. Absolutely no point seeing this in a theater, or on DVD, or even cable.\n\nIt will be perfectly enjoyable cut up with commercials for its eventual showing on network television.\n\n(originally written 12/15/2002)"

I was lucky enough to fall in love at first sight 36 years ago and have been in love with the same person ever since, so I believe that fairytale romances can happen. To me, watching \"Maid In Manhatten\" was a like reliving the thrill of a great romance all over again.\n\nJennifer Lopez's 10 year old son in the movie helped to make the story all the more believable and increased the viewers sympathy for his hard working mother. Some people did not like this movie because the end seemed predictable. So what! The journey to the end was a very enjoyable ride. 8 out of 10."

Get over it. MIM wasn't great, but wasn't bad either--I gave it a 7, not a 1--fer Christ's sake, get real: it's a Columbia release with all of the trappings, admittedly not their best effort. At least not THAT bad. And who cares how cute you think Ralph Fiennes is--Jennifer Lopez's Latin looks are arguably better than Fiennes's vanilla looks. As was the point in this script, lady: you watch when Jennifer walks up and accepts her first Oscar a few years from now (she is that good).

So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending. Sure does have production values though, and some of the scenes look great but this does not make a movie.\n\nWow. Does anyone remember how great John Hughes wrote scripts? The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone? What went wrong here? Wang, director of The Joy Luck Club, loses his spark here too.\n\nThere's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny.

Boring, trite, clich\u00e9d, so chock full of cheese and cringe-inducing moments that I got a tension headache from scowling at the screen too much.\n\nJ-Lo.....How can one woman go through a whole film with only one hairstyle. Not just only one, but an unglamorous one at that. Shame that, despite this attempt to make J-Lo look homely and normal, her make-up looked flawless every day she turned up for work.\n\nMr Fiennes.....oozes all the sex appeal of a dead seal. Really makes me wonder what women see in men. In his character's case, money, obviously.\n\nBob Hoskins.... Oh Bob! What have you sunk to? You are completely wasted in this film. And by the way, I don't blame you for the awfully cheesy speech at the end, Bob. I know it was the writers fault. Just don't do another stinker like this again! OK?\n\nNatasha Richardson.... I feel pity for you. How to make yourself look ridiculous and not get any laughs out of it. So sad.\n\nSundry other unimportant actors that played maids....Awful overacting, just awful. Go back to daytime soaps. Please!\n\nAs for the story. Bland and insipid. Full of hideously bad dialogue and scenes so contrived you could see them coming before you even got out of your car in the cinema parking lot.\n\nBut the most awful scene of the movie? The one where the maids stage an impromptu dance of victory in the bowels of the hotel, accompanied by music from nowhere in an attempt to hide their comically bad gyrations. Actually, thinking about it, that's really the best scene in the movie.\n\nEverything is so predictable and dull. The only vaguely interesting moment comes when J-Lo's character is \"found out\" and the ensuing firing scene. But even this is marred by the \"resignation\" of Bob Hoskin's butler character, apparently as a show of solidarity with J-Lo's, and the direly awful speech which ensues, which is on a schmaltz level similar with Sam Gamgee's speech at the end of the LOTR movies.\n\nSomeone recommended seeing this with your girlfriend. I really don't think that's a good idea. All you're gonna do is p*** her off by snickering at inappropriate moments, or snoring during the love scene.\n\nOh, and whilst I mention the love scene, which was mercifully brief and thankfully didn't feature J-Lo's rotund posterior, I have to say that the song they chose to accompany the scene has to rate as the most depressing I've heard in a long while. I half expected the obligatory \"next morning\" shot to feature them both dead on the bed with slashed wrists.\n\nAnyhow, it just goes on and on until the tedious and entirely expected conclusion where the two get together. Resist the urge to leave early to avoid the rush to the car park - the final \"newspaper-and-magazine-front-page-montage\" is so terribly, terribly bad its almost worth watching the film for that scene alone. Almost.\n\nOK, so its a chick-flick, and I'm a guy so I don't get it. But why can't Hollywood take a leaf out of Disney's book? When they make a film for kids, they put in adult humour to keep the parents amused. Why can't chick-flick film-makers put in something for guys to enjoy? Would it be so hard? Maybe an explosion here, a monster there. That sort of thing.\n\nOK, so I'm being flippant here. But it really grates on my nerves that we get served the same pap over and over again, with different actors repeating almost identical lines and doing almost identical, retarded scenes to countless films that have gone before.\n\nI weep for modern cinema."

I would hardly call this movie an enlightened version of the class struggle. (Oddly enough the only film that really dealt with race in a progressive way in J-Lo's 'cannon' would be Anaconda. I'm not kidding, either.)\n\nFilled with more 'feel good' moments than a treacly Sandra Bullock trailer, this movie may entertain the 9 year olds who rushed out to see Glitter, but if you're an adult, just wait for the coverage of her next wedding, it's bound to be more entertaining."

While trying on designer clothes belonging to one of the hotel guests during one of her shifts, Marisa meets American politician Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), who mistakes her for the guest staying in the room. As a result of the mutual attraction and fear that he will no longer be interested in her if he finds out that she is only a maid, Marisa fails to correct Christopher's assumption and keeps up the pretence.\n\nAs far as romantic comedies go, the \u0091poor girl and successful wealthy man fall for each other' theme in \u0091Maid in Manhattan' is an unoriginal one which has been presented more effectively with more charm and humour elsewhere (eg \u0091Pretty Woman' and \u0091American President'). An additional flaw is that for a romantic comedy, there are too few laughs. Attempts at humour lie predominantly with the supporting cast which includes Natasha Richardson giving an over-the top performance as the wealthy guest Marisa is mistaken for.\n\nEarly scenes of Marisa with her young son serve to convey the affection within their relationship. Unfortunately, my inability to warm to Jennifer Lopez as an actress is an obstacle and the overall effect is far too cutesy to be affecting. I have to say, the selling point of this film for me was the idea of Ralph Fiennes in a romantic leading role but unfortunately, there is uneasiness in his performance here and I actually find him far more appealing in more dramatic roles where he has been presented with a high quality script."

But then Christopher falls in love with her and sooner or later, Marisa is going to have to tell him the truth, will he or will he not, stay with her after he finds out who she really is? Well, i think you can guess that. The whole movie was very boring and predictable. Well, what can you expect from a Jennifer Lopez movie anyways? I would give Maid In Manhattan 4/10"

Enough was too run of the mill, and blood and wine was alright but i know there is more lurking in there...here's hoping she picks a role soon that has nothing to do with box office and salary, and maybe something that will take her to the oscars not just to present. 6 out of 10"

The chemistry between the two leads while not being weak isn't TERRIBLY strong. Also there is not a shred of originality through any of it. And lastly, and perhaps most problematic is JLO as the maid. Did anyone really buy her in this role? It was a bit laughable.\n\nStill, this is a good movie to watch if there isn't anything else on because it is mildly entertaining and sweet. Absolutely no thought is needed when viewing it so if one is coming off a tough week and just wants to relax-why not? But there are TONS of better, more kooky romantic comedies out there and I just did a review on one of them(two weeks notice).This(maid in Manhattan) does have glamor(show me a JLO movie that doesn't) so THAT'S a plus. Because the movie manages to at least entertain I'd give it a 6. Can't hold a candle to pretty woman though."

I would recommend seeing That Funny Feeling if you can it is available to buy and may be also available to rent. I am not a fan of remakes especially when the remake is recent as yes they made remakes in the 1950's but those remakes were at least as good as or better than the original.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, starring the usually rigid, placid Ralph Fiennes with a jazzy, hip Jennifer Lopez seems like these two may need sometime to warm up to their very polar opposite personalities. Yet, in \"Maid in Manhattan,\" the chemistry between the two was very subtle, touching, and nearly believable. Very much like the film \"Notting Hill\" with Julia Roberts playing the famous one and Hugh Grant playing the normal, streetguy; the same subtleness worked. So, in romantic comedies like these, they seem to pull off a very predictable plot with unrealistic circumstances very well because of the two (or three) characters warmth, which brings the whole film back down to earth.\n\nAlso, with good acting, it helps, too. And though these aren't Oscar worthy performances by Lopez and Fiennes, they certaintly are not unbearable to watch in any way. Remember the film \"It Could Happen To You,\" from 1994? Very similiar fluff, but the very warm chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Brigitte Fonda was undeniably likable and admiring. And how about \"America's Sweethearts\" from 2000, which some people are comparing \"Maid in Manhattan,\" to, as well? Hardly a good film, as nearly every character was selfish, using gags to get back at eachother and hopelessly stupid (Julia Roberts is the only one worth watching in the movie). A very bad comparison to this film. And what is missing from \"America's Sweethearts\"? A true romance, something to learn from, and comedy and melodrama we have already experienced enough.\n\nSo, enjoy this film as it is all that I have said above."

Lopez keeps trying the same role over and over, nor giving a chance to movies or genres that would suit her better.\n\nThe problem with any failed Cinderella story is that, the story being well known and part of our cultural baggage, needs of reinvention and talent to pass the test. That's why Maid in Manhattan is a failure , as there nothing new or original, just a different setting.\n\nThe acting is dreadful, the movie is not funny or entertaining, actually it takes itself too seriously, and it is not engaging at all.\n\nIt sounds shocking, but this is a Wayne Wang's movie! A waste of money.\n\nNo talent wasted whatsoever, though! :D"

Every actor gives a good performance (seeing Natasha Richardson be hilarious made me a bit wistful, since she passed away years ago). However unbelievable the plot, this movie works. Only negative point is how Fiennes' character more than once says some pretty creepy sexist things dressed up as acceptable romcom clich\u00e9s. And the ending could have been less abrupt.

If I'm going to spend time watching fluff, it needs to be fluff with nice eyes. 2) I'd rather be a maid than a pro. Part two of what romcoms are about is being able to see oneself in the femme role. Hollywood needs to realize working the streets is not romantic or comedic. Okay, neither is changing sheets and cleaning toilets, however at least it's something people can respect at the end of the day. If I were going to try to emulate a movie, I'd be more inclined to get a job as a maid and hope Ralph walks in than work the streets and hope Richard picks me up."

        "review_title": "a holiday delight",
        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), Marissa Ventura (Jennifer Lopez) and her son, Ty (Tyler Posey), scale a Central Park rock formation surrounded by lush trees as they gaze over the horizon lined with Manhattan's skyscrapers in director Wayne Wang's Maid in Manhattan. One of the characters states the obvious: `It's like two different worlds.' Later in the film, Ventura's best friend, Stephanie Kehoe (Marissa Matrone), uses the same line to convince Ventura that efforts to pursue a relationship with Marshall will be in vain.\n\nScreenwriter Kevin Wade resisted subtlety in this modern Cinderella story, and the entire film is predictably predictable and laden with flat characters. Marshall is the smooth Republican senatorial candidate with captivating blue eyes and the perfect smile. Ventura is the beautiful and intelligent maid who deserves a more luxurious life than the one she lives in the Bronx. Ty is the ideal son who serves as Marshall and his mother's love catalyst. Jerry Siegel (Stanley Tucci), Marshall's campaign manager, suffers from constant anxiety and stress due to Marshall's public behavior and inability to concentrate on the senatorial race. Ultimately, the final credits roll an unending list of prototype characters.\n\nBut Maid in Manhattan surprisingly emerges as a simple but enjoyable cinematic delight. The lessons of the film are simple but poignant and important in the tradition of many holiday classics. Ventura reminds Marshall that societal problems are daily realities rather than matters of political debate for large populations that, on many levels, understand political issues more viscerally than governmental candidates who use the issues to secure votes and a desirable public reputation. The butler, Lionel Bloch (Bob Hoskins) tells Ventura, `What we do does not define who we are.' Ventura's friends support the unfortunate truism that it's not about what you have or what you know but about who you know. Finally, Ventura gives people hope that any dream-as impossible as it may seem-is truly attainable.\n\nAudience members will recognize the many lessons of the film do little but to reinforce common knowledge, and they will also recognize that Maid in Manhattan enjoys success because of the well delivered performances by Fiennes, Lopez, Posey and the supporting cast. Fiennes and Posey share the first satisfying moment long after the opening scene of the film with their engaging conversation in the hotel elevator. The three main characters-those played by Fiennes, Lopez and Posey-share the next entirely pleasurable scene with two French women in the same elevator, and at this point the film finally reaches its tolerable pace. Fiennes did not have much material to create an extremely compelling and dynamic character, but he achieves in portraying a charming and self-admittedly less-than-perfect politician.\n\nLopez struggles onscreen until her onscreen chemistry with Fiennes rescues her from a rigid performance. Once she relaxes, however, she delivers an endearing performance. She is sweet but capable of dishonesty. Vulnerable but aggressive. Common but inexplicably highly extraordinary. She is human. Lopez is not an accomplished screen veteran, but she does not always make the obvious acting choice, which sets her apart from other actresses with similar screen experience. She carries an embodied knowledge of the truth that minorities are often `stereotypes or invisible,' and this understanding makes her shine in scenes that deal with this difficult issue.\n\nTucci illustrates the point that memorable performances are a product of quality rather than quantity in terms of screen time. His character not only must deal with the fact that Marshall is a campaign manager's public nightmare, but he also must endure professional humiliation when Marshall gives him extra duties as his beloved dog's caretaker. He is not subtle, he pushes the panicked and anal campaign manager caricature to an extreme, his character's personality is entirely unlikable and yet audience members walk away loving the unlovable Jerry Siegel.\n\nMaid in Manhattan does not deserve a Best Picture nomination or any award nomination for that matter, but one must doubt that Wayne Wang or any member of the creative team set out to create an Oscar-winning sensation. In one respect, this is a sad commentary on the entertainment industry and general artistic integrity. In an ideal world, artists would only sign on to pictures that they believed would achieve the highest expectations of the industry. As every person knows, however, this is not an ideal world, and sometimes the only goal is to create an entertaining blockbuster hit. In these terms, the film is a definite success, and to criticize it for lack of artistic merit or originality is asinine as it never claimed to be anything more than an updated version of the Cinderella story."

Jennifer lopez didnt really sell the performance as a maid, and the movie seemed to be holding on to the cinderella concept too tight, and should've let go and let it breathe a little.

MAID IN MANHATTAN is one of those films! What more could you dare to say about the director who has brought us LIFE IS CHEAP... BUT TOILET PAPER IS EXPENSIVE ? As a twenty plus year admirer of Wayne Wang, no, 'admirer' does not properly express my exultation, perhaps 'cult-like devotee' serves it more justice...I am left shell-shocked at the tour de force that is this film. MAID IN MANHATTAN is truly, utterly, and understandably Wayne Wang's magnum opus. One can plainly see many a night was spent pouring over its stunning script and casting decisions. And with good reason! Those sleepless nights paid off in many fold. J. Lo plays a brooding domestic care professional in a NYC lodging facility, oftenly slipping into philosophical musings on her humble station in life. Her intelligence and Shakespearean wit carry the screenplay to a place where no other screenplay, I have seen at least, has ever been carried. For the lower brow audience (whom I daresay you'll probably not catch dead renting this), J. Lo reduces herself to some clich\u00e9d one-liners and skimpy outfits, but any accomplished person of the brain will know she is doing it to make a social statement. We all know she is the Katharine Hepburn of the 21st century. The chemistry between she and Ralph Fiennes is nothing short of magical. After you watch his mind-blowing performance in this movie, you'll wonder how anybody can ever sit through SCHINDLER'S LIST again without doubling over in laughter."

These were things she should have been doing herself to show that she and the politician really did have something in common other than a sexual attraction.\n\nAlso I don't know why but all of JLo's movies leave me with an uncomfortable blank feeling. This one did too, but it wasn't as bad as the Wedding Planner which the thought of still gives me the creeps. Ugh...remember the M&M's in the park where they were throwing away all the red m&m's? Yeck that was just soooo stupid.\n\nSo anywho, it's a feel-good movie with a little to be desired but it WILL make you feel good.

As I watched the movie, that song \"Jenny from the block\" kept going over and over in my head. I didn't buy Ralph as an American Senator,either; he would have been better suited to play a Prime Minister, Royalty,member of Parliament, etc.\n\nNatasha Richardson was great though, in her role, and provided much-needed comic relief to the script. The movie is pleasant enough, but not nearly as clever or emoting as \"Pretty Woman\", which it seems to loosely imitate at times."

With his feet on the ground and his hand in the mix, he manages to create one of the most likable characters in the film, and certainly the most complex. As for Fiennes, his worth as an actor is impossible to ignore, even when he is improbably paired with Jennifer Lopez, and burdened with an insipid script. If you can suspend disbelief and censoriousness, and if you're suffering from a head cold anyway, you could do far worse for a film to fill a rainy day."

I am not saying all romantic comedies are bad but I have never had the burning desire to see one. Todays Romantic Comedies are conventional, formulaic films. If they are well made they can be a joy, if not they can be painful. Unfortunately, its the latter statement that fits here.\n\nMaid In Manhattan is a truly unoriginal and formulaic movie. But that usually comes with today's romantic comedies. All that needs to be done is for the film to be well-made. Maid In Manhattan fails.\n\nI have always belived Jennifer Lopez to be hugely overrated. Shes a good looking woman with an atrocious ass but exhibits very little acting talent in anything I have seen her in. To be fair, She was good in Out of Sight but that was six years ago. Now, she is just flat out awful. I was like her, \"Someone shoot her.\" Did I mention I hate her ass.\n\nRalph Fiennes does not fare better, but he outacts J.Lo (something that is clearly not hard to do). He has a funny moment but appears to be uncomfortable in the film(I do not blame him). Natasha Richardson is irritating and she needs to shut up. Bob Hoskins is underused but outacts most of the cast. Stanley Tucci does a solid job and provides some of the only comic relief in this bad film. The kid in this film is such a lousy actor. \"Tell him hes fired\" (A line from Diamonds are Forever, an underwhelming film but its a masterpiece compared to this drivel).\n\nThe best thing I can say about this film is that as unbearable as it is, it could have been a little worse. J.Lo maybe good looking except for her ass. I really hate her ass, I would love to pop it. I do not see what is attractive about it. On that note I conclude this review. This is drivel from Hollywood and drivel from J.Lo's ass."

The acting is superb. the moments are touching. the sentiments are silky and sweet. for me, this is the best romance movie of 2002. my ratings for other 2002 romance movies i have seen are \"life or something like it\" 7/10, \"sweet home alabama\" 6/10 and \"Two Weeks Notice\" 5/10. highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Maid In Manhattan the day it opened and loved it. With its transparent Cinderella storyline in the background, this movie rocked. I found it more of a romance then a comedy. I think Jennifer Lopez did an excellent job. I wasn't impressed at all with her performance in The Wedding Planner. I think it was the aspect of the romantic comedy which was all new to her, which reflected on her performace. In Maid In Manhattan, I think she learned from her mistakes and did a much better job. Her character was perfect for her and she played it well. I never once found myself saying \"That's phony\" or \"cheesy\" or \"corny\" or whatever. Ralph Fiennes I felt was mediocre in this movie. His character was sort of boring and I think Ralph was poorly casted. However, I don't feel he was horrible. Many times I actually felt chemistry between him and Lopez. He's a good actor, but I believe he needs more experience at romantic comedies. As for the movie itself, I thought it was great. Natasha Richardson's character was hilariously funny to me (though I don't think it was meant to be) and I thought the little Tyler Posey did a job well done. The only part I did not like was outside the Met when Jennifer's character, Marisa was trying to tell Ralph's character Chris about her true identity. Chris kisses Marisa and I'm like \"What the hell? She's obviously trying to tell you something important I think you better let her talk.\" But I think that was just the best excuse they could come up with to introduce a love scene between Chris and Marisa. But aside from that, I loved it. Yes, it was predictable but who cares? No one goes to see a romantic comedy to be surprised anyway."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jennifer Lopez is a young single mother and hardworking maid for one of Manhattan's fanciest hotels which tends to attract some of the biggest celebrities and power players. One of these famous guests is Ralph Fiennes, a young upstart Republican politician whose Senate campaign is picking up steam. Their chance encounter blossoms into an improbable romance that defies the odds.\n\nI found this film charming, unpretentious and carefree, a welcome straightforward love story that takes place smack in the middle of New York's political arena and stark class differences, which even in 2002 were quite stark. The film's quiet emotional power overcomes a relative lack of realism. Anyone watching this film long after it came out would know that it was made during a more innocent period in American politics, before we as a country became inexorably and undeniably divided. My only complaint is the overblown depiction of mass media frenzy, with crowds of reporters seemingly present every waking moment.... sort of the anti-Slumdog Millionaire, a whole other kind of unrealistic.\n\nDespite these occasional flaws, a film like this is not an anachronism but actually a reminder that love and hope can overcome all types of barriers, including economic and political. It may have been made during a happier, more prosperous era but I still believe in a love story that reaches for the sky when it comes to our better nature as human beings. For that reason, this film gets my warmest and happiest recommendation."

Jennifer Lopez's character is almost morally unblemished; she's meek, humble, and has a good head on her shoulders. Her relationship as a single mother with her son is true-to-life, even though there are very few child genuises in real life.\n\nRalph Fiennes is a great addition as well. He's a politician coming to terms with the balance of bureaucracy and humanity in making laws. Lopez assists him in this process in a way that fits nicely into the story. Even though the movie isn't about anything on a deep level, there's a good message beyond the chemistry.\n\nBasically, this movie was worth the $5, and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this chick flick. It's the best since \"A Walk to Remember,\" and a good date film as well. Plus, you just don't feel as slimed or dirty when the lead actress doesn't walk around dressed like a slut all the time, especially when she has a kid."

This one kept my interest because of the actors, from Jennifer to Ralph Fiennes and all the supporting cast, they were all funny. I didn't think that Mr. Fiennes could pull it off, but he did.

Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theater. I shook my head in disbelief even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls, little Rosalina, spoke about this movie. \"It was so great,\" she said. \"You really felt like you were a maid in NYC falling in love with this rich dude.\" \"Nonsense,\" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, \"you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about really being a maid. The movie must have done something right to get Rosalina so interested.\" \"Well, maybe,\" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. \"OK,\" I thought, \"I'll give it a look see.\" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.\n\nWhere to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. Wayne Wang does a superb job of creating an almost \"you are there\" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life inside the most elegant city in the world. The nonchalance of having to clean hotel rooms; then the rising sense of panic when she first meets Ralph Fiennes. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Jennifer Lopez (as Marisa) and Ralph Fiennes (as the hot Christopher Marshall) are excellent - Lopez's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their poor girl/rich boy characters down to a perfect \"t\" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Jayne Howdyshell as Carmen.\n\nProblems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Marisa could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class by stealing the gentleman's heart. (I know she was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when Marisa and Christopher kissed for the first time.\n\nA minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theater, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.\n\n9/10"

You may know how it will end, but if you give it a decent try, your heart will be thumping with joy after the film ends. \"Maid in Manhattan\" is the \"Pretty Woman\" of today.

Even though as a \"romantic comedy\" you know there will be a happy ending (that's what the term \"romantic comedy\" traditionally means, it doesn't mean jokes per se), many times throughout the flick reactions, developments, and events were unexpected, and thus pleasant surprises.\n\nThis was as good as Meg Ryan's best work, with Ralph Fiennes adding a unique dimension.

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't believe I didn't get to watch this until 2016, but there it is! So I am waaaay after the event, which is good, because I had no preconceptions and hype to go upon before viewing. As such, I started watching not expecting that much and was happily surprised. I initially only knew the leading lady was J Lo, so to find Ralph Fiennes as leading man, Natasha Richardson as the (beautiful) ugly sister and Bob Hoskins as the (male) fairy godmother, let alone Stanley Tucci running interference and a cute Tyler Posey acting their butts off was a great joy.\n\nSo many viewers will watch this film, regard it superficially as a chick flick type of film and therefore will be unlikely to ever bother watching it a second time or appreciate the amazing talent that went into making it - it is there to see if you bother to look, but so many are blind to much... and just want a quick watch, in which case this film will get a lower rating from them which is undeserved.\n\nOK, the script could have been less predictable, but, as I said above, it IS Cinderella so you know what is coming anyway, whatever twists there are going to be... if any. As we all know the general plot so well and so many before me have already cited it ad nauseam, I'm going to pass right over that side of things and concentrate on what to me in this film really shines out - what to me makes it a very good film, rather than a nondescript one as with other cast choices would have so easily been the result... THE ACTING.\n\nJ Lo doesn't do her best performance ever, but is fine. However, Ralph Fiennes brings loads of little nuances to a pretty straightforward and what could very easily be a boring and one-dimensional part. Keep your eagle eyes on his facial expressions and his eyes, oh those eyes, those eyes.... the sign of a truly great actor is to act with their eyes. Considering it is a genre in which we rarely see him perform, all I can say is, what a shame it doesn't happen more often. All those male actors out there wanting to be a romantic lead, you would do well to watch Ralph's subtle performance and learn!\n\nNatasha Richardson is brilliant, shamelessly hamming it up as the confused blonde. Heck, she reminds me in this film SO much of her mother. What a tragedy her loss is to all. And Bob Hoskins at his best - superb! Sadly, another huge loss.\n\nStanley Tucci, where would we be without you? I adore your contribution to this film and so many others! That scene with Rufus (the dog) outside the hotel is priceless! LOL! Watch his face, too... Many films otherwise without Stanley Tucci would be like bread without enough salt - you can eat it, but there is something missing... And a tiny Tyler Posey! He must have been about ten when this was filmed and did a great job with some pretty difficult lines at times. Very engaging and a great cast choice.\n\nSo, yes, if you just like straight up chick flicks, go and watch a chick flick. If you want to watch a (mostly) really well acted sweet romance and enjoy and want to watch it again, then watch Maid in Manhattan - I shall."

I don't know, it just didn't interest me at all even though it's always brought up in the romantic comedy/romance film chatter. Kind of like Two Weeks Notice, I'd see it was on tv, probably on a Saturday afternoon on TBS or USA Network or something, I'd try to watch it for 10 minutes, hated it, and gave up (and probably went to rewatch The Holiday). But 2024 is the year I fill in romcom gaps so I decided to see it and guys I gotta say for a non-Italian JLo role, it's not half bad lol. I like her Italian roles more, namely The Wedding Planner, as she's fittingly playing herself instead of some characatured \"brown\" woman. Look up Juliet Hooker. Anyway, back to the film, politically it didn't age well, like at all, AT ALL, but romanceically it actually hit?? Like their chemistry was really believable and palpable. The eye acting alone was really lovely lol and there was spicy banter which is so romance novel!! Of course, Teen Wolf baby boy was 50 percent of the charm of the movie and also all the side characters. Like Stanley Tucci's dry humor alone was more interesting than anything Voldemort's ass had to say. Overall a nice time, and a classic. It's such a great time capsule of the early aughts."
