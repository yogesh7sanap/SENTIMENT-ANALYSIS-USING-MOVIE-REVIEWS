Read at the end of this review those 12-13 incidents of Samrat Prithviraj.\n\nThey have altered some key incidents like Swaymwar and last dwell scene.. huge let down Akshay should have done some look test. He was not looking like a king. His last climax look he should have kept in whole movie.\n\nDirector and bad Actor choices are to blame here. There is a huge responsibility while choosing to make a historic movie. If you can't commit, dont do it.\n\nHats off to SLB. He really nailed it and have set the standards high."

        "review_detailed_main": "Samrat Prithviraj (2022) : Movie Review -\n\nHistorical grandeur in Bollywood is always recognised by Mughal-E-Azam, and deservingly so. K Asif's historical epic isn't just the biggest historical drama ever made in India, but also the best one. Tamil and Telugu cinema got their best with \"Maya Bazaar\" (1957), and Malayalam cinema got their best with \"Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha\" (1989). Hollywood began too early with Biblicals, but then William Wyler's \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) put an end to imagination with its unthinkable grandeur. Interestingly, these three grandeur came in the same period, and the bar was set forever. All they left for others was to match half of their legacy or somewhat more, but never to come close. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has been making historical films on a grand scale, but is unable to find an answer. Recently, Om Raut came up with \"Tanhaji\" and showed the power of cinematic vision just like what SS Rajamouli did with the fictional tales of Bahubali. But aren't we going somewhere with this? Or are we finding anything legendary? The answer is no. Perhaps it's hard for today's filmmakers to put so much effort into the project and have an extraordinary vision like DW Griffith, William Wyler, Cecile De Mille, K Asif, Mehboob Khan and KV Reddy. All they could do is present a good, watchable film with the help of technical and VFX brilliance. Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi, who gave us the hard-hitting Chanakya, has come up with a Hindu Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan's story, but the writer in him has fared better than the director. Samrat Prithviraj has an excellent story that can pump you up any day. It's even better than Bahubali, but just the writing isn't enough. You need to showcase the great writing in great storytelling. Then only will it fit the bill. Samrat Prithviraj has failed to find that template to fit into. The glorious tale of Samrat Prithviraj has got the grandeur, thanks to YRF's production value, but hasn't fared well with storytelling.\n\nThe film is based on the life of Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan (Akshay Kumar), his life, love story with Sanyogita (Manushi Chhillar), his kingdom, and his valour. He has a friend, Chand Bardai (Sonu Sood), who can see the future and is always by his side. His uncle, Kaka Kanha (Sanjay Dutt), is one of his most loyal commanders out of his hundreds of brave samants. As we know from history, Muhammad Ghori (Manav Vij) lost the Battle of Tarain (1191) and then tried to regain the lost glory in 1192. Based on Chand Bardai's \"Prithviraj Raso\", the writing of Samrat Prithviraj is truly fantastic. There are so many scenes that would make you feel proud, teach you about respecting women, and about undying patriotism. The screenplay too has some great scenes involved, but it isn't flawless. There are literally glitches that you notice with just one eye, while the dramatic errors take away all the fun of filmy elements.\n\nTalking about acting, Akshay Kumar has done a decent job in the lead role of Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan. His voice doesn't come out as he or the director wanted in some scenes, but the rest of the time his dialogue delivery and expressions seem fine. Manushi Chillar looks promising in her debut, but the big impact is missing. Her dancing skills, expressions, and beauty are commendable and can be explored in better ways in the future. One of the most impactful performances in the film comes from Sonu Sood. He is very good as Chand Bardai, be it looks, accent, expressions, or confident body language. Then comes Sanjay Dutt to spoil things in his immaturely loud and irritating role of Kaka Kanha. He has such a bad dialogue delivery. In the supporting roles, Manav Vij, Ashutosh Rana, Sakshi Tanwar, Lalit Tiwari and Ajay Chakraborty are average to decent.\n\nThe music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy will take you back to the 12th Century. The tones are such, but is it timely for 2022's viewing? Theoretically, it is right because the film is set in a certain period, but cinematically it loses its novelty to outdated compositions. Aarif Sheikh's editing lacks the crisp factor, and the VFX are terrible in a few scenes. However, the action scenes are well shot and the visual effects in those scenes are very good. The background score is massy, jingoistic, and lovable; it's just the editing that fails to analyse the right places for it. The biggest letdown in Samrat Prithviraj is director Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi. It seems that he hasn't come out of his TV serial vision. The film seems so episodic, repetitive and scattered into pieces that you feel like you are watching an 80s drama in 2022. I had the same complaint when I saw his Pinjar (2003) - such a great story but so stretched like a daily soap. His writing skills are unquestionable, but his direction skills are definitely questionable. Mohalla Assi was so dragged. So is Samrat Prithviraj. The masses may not catch the cinematic mistakes while they are busy enjoying the grandeur and glory of Prithviraj, but on repeat viewing they will find out the loops for sure.\n\nSamrat Prithviraj Chauhan's story is so big, so massive, but Dwivedi failed to understand the potential of his own writing when he was in that director's chair. This story could have been taken to such a level that even Bahubali would feel humiliated, but all it offers is strictly an average viewing experience. As a whole, team Samrat Prithviraj puts a lot of effort into filmmaking, but unfortunately at the wrong place. Watch it only to know the glorious story of Hindu Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan, not for the cinematic experience.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply giving 1 star doesnt justify the film. Those who do that havent even watched the film and are basically haters. It's basically a 5 or 6 star film. Why? Read on.\n\n1. WAR SEQUENCES - weakest point in the film. The first war SEQUENCE was just okayish with some good moments but the second one inside the fort is terribly shot. The third one is just shown in montages like seriously why?? War sequences went from bad to worst. There is no build up at all to any war sequence. Its just like \"ok i declare war\" and war begins. The director could have made a bigger film by investing more time in the war sequences but instead he chose to move ahead with the story and give little importance to the war.\n\n2. SET PIECES - Grand scale! Here, the film scores brownie points. Atleast the makers did a good job in getting good set pieces.\n\n3. VFX - the lions shown in the Ring sequence at the start do look authentic and if you still call that looking fake, then i would say RRR's tigers looked even faker. Other than that the VFX used at other places are strictly average.\n\n4. RING SEQUENCES - one at the start and the final one at the climax. Again, this is the highlight point of the film. It is well shot especially the climax was pretty good. Further points here.\n\n5. LOVE ANGLE - there is no chemistry between Akshay and Manushi solely because one is of uncle age and other is of his daughters age. Theres even one awkward sequence during the song Makhmali when from the marriage sequence the scene abruptly shifts to a desert where Akshay and Manushi are romancing and why it looks awkward because it reminds you of a typical romantic film sequence where suddenly for a song the sequence and actors would transition from some place to some place. Also the romance tends to slow down the film.\n\n6. PERFORMANCE- Akshay is just Akshay with no change in voice or looks. He doesn't even have a real moustache. Look at Ranveer man how he transformed himself into Bajirao but Akshay could not. Performance wise he's decent but not extraordinary like a Ranveer Singh from Bajirao. Sanjay Dutt has a pretty good and slight comical role regarding his blind fold. Sonu Sood is just too preachy in this film . Manushi is very average. Manav Vij carries this one stern expression throughout the film where makers may have done that to try making him look menacing but boy! He fails. If you talk about a menacing role, see Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji.\n\n7. DIRECTION - Dr. Chandra does a very average job. He had a terrific story in hand but failed to execute it properly without maintaining a balance between the romance and war sequence. This film should have been made by Mr. Bhansali and it would have been an outstanding film.\n\n8. SONGS - not one to remember.\n\nOverall, strictly average film with 5.5 rating. Don't watch it with expectations as high as some Bajirao or Padmaavat else it would dissapoint you. Here's a small thing - Panipat had a much better war sequence plus build up than thus film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I feel historic biopics should be left to Sanjay Leela Bhansali. He is the only filmmaker (today), who can pull it off across all departments. Gowariker started out well but Mohenjo Daro & Panipat were bad. Prithviraj has apparently been made after 18 years of research (which is believable) but everything else just doesn't have the intended impact.\n\nSamrat Prithviraj is the story of Prithviraj Chauhan from the time he defeats Muhammad Ghori until his death.\n\nThe core issue with Prithviraj is the casting. I felt the same when the trailer came out; Akshay Kumar is not apt for the role. The only scenes from the film that I liked were the ones in which he is being held captive. Manushi Chhillar is pretty decent as Prithviraj's wife; Sanyogita. Manav Vij is soulless as Muhammad Ghori. He looks bored for most part. Sonu Sood & Sanjay Dutt don't have much to do and are wasted. Ashutosh Rana does a good job though.\n\nIf Prithviraj had released 10 years ago (reduced the research by 8 years), it would have been something to marvel upon. But after watching films like Bajirao & Padmaavat, most historic films fall flat.\n\nI appreciate the effort gone into making this film; but it is 10 years too late. A better solution would have been to hand Bhansali these historic projects."

Lying to themselves, making a mockery and eroding the trust of their own people."

When you watch movie there were so many flaws in movie. Story and directions could have been better and they haven't justified the real glory,you can feel that lack of dedications. Actrees is new so no expression on her face while acting and how can we expect chemistry between 25 year young actress with 55 years old actor."

First of all neither any background stories of any of the characters, nor the chapters of history was shown in the movie. It was more like a crammed version of prithviraj's life. While watching the movie, i was feeling like i am doing a quick last minute revision of prithviraj chauhan's chapter before giving my history exam. And the sad part was you wanted to connect yourself with the characters, but the very moment scene use to end. Same situation was with the war scenes, shots were amazing but the length was small. So unfortunately movie is a hit and miss, not leaving any impact in the end."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching the movie I had read mixed reviews and decided to watch with an open mind.\n\nSo many things gone wrong with movie, it is surprising to see Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi saying he can't understand why did movie fail.\n\nAlthough AK was not a good choice for the role but most responsible people for the failure is Director and Producers. Below are the issues I could observe in the movie. Might contain spoilers!!\n\n1. Except for the costumes and few sets, the said 300cr. Cost hardly visible. Looks like lion share of the budget went to AK and VFX 2. Quality of VFX is somewhat okay, while VFX for landscape looked stale and tacky. VFX for animals looks okay.\n\n3. Director completely ignored the character development completely, viewers may not be able to connect with the characters before movie finishes.\n\n4. Everyone looks in a hurry to wrap-up the movie, probably covid-19 impacted the movie even-though they don't admit this.\n\n5. War scenes looked just okay but too small, in the second half there is hardly and scene which thrills.\n\n6. Crappy screenplay, since story is already known to people it was expected that screenplay should have been able to keep the viewer engaged. Also, mixed use of Urdu and Hindi words didn't sound natural with a period drama. At times Kaka (Sanjay Dutt) and other Samants keep joking with each other but you still feel like stupid wondering what is happening.\n\n7. Cinematography is okay but editing lacks ornamentation, poor cinematic experience made me feel like I am watching some TV serial from 90's. Clearly Director lacks the understanding of modern filming techniques.\n\n8. Short in length. A lot could have been shown and said, but last war scene ends abruptly and I felt like a fool asking for more and more especially after movies like Bahubali, viewer would certainly higher expectation. You don't need to show over the top slow motion action sequences but still people have already tasted the blood after watching GOT, Troy, Bahubali etc.\n\n9. Acting is okay, nothing phenomenal.\n\n10. To me it seems, by looking at the capabilities of the director and combining the effect of Covid, at later stage YRF tried to cut budget and kept things in small scale. All in all, you can feel their efforts were half hearted."

Salam by prithviraj to mahammad ghori is not acceptable. Sanyogita look Bar bala more like a princess.\n\nThe valour, courage, war strategy of Rajput's were missing.

Yet, my curiosity arose because of all the pessimistic stances surrounding the film. Discerning the barrage of unfavorable feedbacks, I began to wonder, \"what might have gone wrong here?\".\n\nThus, I decided to witness it for myself, and I must say I'm quite surprised. Yes, it's neither perfect nor a extraordinary presentation but it's certainly not dreadful either! I have seen much worse portrayals before. Compare to those abominations, it undoubtedly qualifies to be deemed as a serviceable affair at the very least.\n\nIt's got marvelous set designs, a great score, some considerable conversations; in no shape or form this could come off as a despicable affair. Now, some viewers may argue whether the casting of Akshay Kumar in the lead role was a misjudgment! Well, I agree there were much better options (bearing in mind the fact that Akshay Kumar is way too old to play the role of such a young emperor); but he did not do as terrible as some section of the audience and a handful of reviewers otherwise suggest.\n\nAs far as the verifying and validating all the historical preciseness is concerned; I humbly refrain myself from passing any statement. The sole reason being my clear lack of knowledge and expertise on the subject, hence, it would only seem fair If I keep my mouth shut in this specific aspect."

Only fight with Ghori is shown.\n\nMoreover, this movie is full of unnecessary songs which could have been replaced with Prithviraj's life history.\n\nSome points.\n\n1. As I had heard, Muhammad Ghori had begged to prithviraj for sparing his life and prithviraj had forgiven him, but instead in this movie it is shown that Muhammad ghori wanted death. This is completely wrong.\n\n2. As per my knowledge, Chandbardai did not have any power for seeing future events in advance. That is shown completely wrong.\n\n3. First war of Tarrain was done after Prithviraj's coronation on Delhi, but in movie it is shown that when First war with Ghori took place, prithviraj was king of only Ajmer state.\n\nSo historically speaking, I was expecting movie to be more historically correct."

        "review_detailed_main": "Samrat Prithviraj was one of the most revered historical figures of Indian history and making a movie on the subject is no doubt a difficult task. Unfortunately in movie parlance the movie which has a successful run and which brings in profits is considered a good film. Conversely, as per this skewed logic, a commercial failure or a disaster is not considered a good film because it has been rejected by the audience. ( This movie reportedly had some cancelled shows due to no audience). Hence a poor quality movie having loads of masala entertainment gets the branding of a good film and vice versa. This is the background available in public domain against which this movie is getting reviewed by me. As I viewed the movie, I tried to find out the likely reasons for the audience rejecting the movie. One, the genre of the movie made it difficult for the director to make it a masala film. Two, given his present image, Akshay Kumar may not have been the best choice for the lead character. Three, the heroine Manushi Chhillar was new and her best may not have been good enough. Four, the dialogue and songs were naturally in chaste Hindi, and though they were excellent they may not have appealed to the average audiences who are used to escapist entertainment like RRR, KGF, Bhool Bulayya 2. In fact the last named movie which was running concurrently was the main competitor and was reported to have taken all the audiences away.\n\nDirector Chandra Prakash Dwivedi has not been able to give the narrative a smart pace though the movie itself was well made, had passable performances, the action was matching the storyline and technical qualities were reasonably good. However despite having similar characters and storyline, it definitely lacked the captivating atmosphere, enchanting music, exquisite choreography and forceful performances of a Sanjay Bhansali movie like Bajirao Mastani or Padmavat. Akshay Kumar, Sonu Sood and Sanjay Dutt just could not put up impactful performances needed. Sonu Sood was comparatively better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Samrat Prithviraj is an underwhelming, dreary historical drama that can only be compared to a substandard Sanjay Leela Bhansali production. The insipid grandeur, along with the insubstantial plot that it presents to peddle a convenient narrative about India's past, results in an extremely tedious experience. Despite the political overtones, Samrat Prithviraj comes across as a tepid and unremarkable period piece that fails to do justice to its source material or theme.\n\nThe filmmaker has spent 18 years researching and creating this documentary, but the passion for the subject is not visible on the screen. The events are depicted in such a monotonous manner that it's impossible to become emotionally invested in the story. Furthermore, not a single performance in the film is compelling enough to captivate the audience. The film simply rushes from one scene to the next, as if it's in a hurry to reach the conclusion.\n\nAkshay Kumar fails to impress in the major part. Despite his attempts to tone down his body language and Punjabi accent, he lacks the necessary gravity to portray the legendary emperor. His growls lack the bite of a lion, and he hardly resembles the youngster who became a Samrat in his twenties despite the airbrushing. The presence of seasoned supporting performers like Rajendra Gupta, Manoj Joshi, Lalit Tiwari, and Ashutosh Rana only highlights his inadequacies.\n\nThe film, to put it bluntly, never aims for anything close to the truth. It takes what works for its epic plot, distorts it to fit its requirements, and swerves around it until it's no longer required before moving on to the next piece of history it thinks is ripe for tampering with. While Samrat Prithviraj has a clearly stated goal, it's a film that deserves to be judged on its technical achievements.\n\nSamrat Prithviraj is a let-down when it comes to writing and characterizations. The screenplay is full of meaningless bombast, and the historical figures that inhabit it are cardboard cutouts who move and talk but have little impact. Manav Vij and Sonu Sood are the only performers who create a lasting impression, but they, too, are crippled by the film's empty shell."

In whole movie it feels like they glorifying the role of Mohammad Gazni. The movie was set in the era, when we didn't had any Urdu touch in our language but the whole movie is full of urdu words from the mouth of Bharatiya.\n\nIn 1100-1200 year, womens was not suppressed as shown in movie, some thime it feels like they are trying to insult our culture.\n\nEven the facts which is available on Google as well is not told in movie. They had good cast but it feels like they are not doing justice with their role. Akshay Kumar is not even 0.1% in his role.

I admit that the choice of Akshay Kumar as the great Prithviraj Chauhan might have been out of necessity.\n\nBut the remaining cast, background music, grand sets, screenplay & direction, amazing war sequences are the highlights of the movie. Even Akshay has done better than his average movies, for which I think the credit goes to Dr. Dwivedi again. The director has ensured the best comes out of an experienced actor in a periodic & historical drama, whose forte is otherwise majorly action and comedy. Sanjay Dutt, Ashutosh Rana, Sonu Sood, Manav Vij, and other supporting actors shine in their roles, as usual. They are all talent powerhouses, proven time and again, & do justice to their roles. The debutant Manushi has actually surprised me, I was not expecting a mature performance from a newcomer to the industry. The supporting cast has done great as well.\n\nThe dialogues,, again from the director, are lovely.\n\nThe only area of improvement was the songs: everything from the lyrics, to music and the length of songs hampers the pace of the movie.\n\nShankar, Ehsaan and Loy surprisingly disappointed with the music department this time.\n\nLyrics are sub-standard. Varun Grover is not a seasoned lyricist. He has had success only on a few occasions and needs to do much, kuch better.\n\nThe music, songs and lyrics could have been immensely impactful, but fail to deliver.\n\nThe only standout song is the title song, and truly sets the tone of the movie."

Marwari is not all about \"KHAMMA GANNI\" Costumes - Rajasthan represents Royalty and Land of colors, both were missing.. in the first the female lead didn't even looked like she was someone from Rajasthan 1st part mistake - For marriage he and Chand had disguised themselves and later they take Raanisa with them and in the way while returning jaichand attacked them and many brave main fighters lost their life to protect Pruthvirajji but what did showed us?\n\nClimax - the most disappointing part, the whole had happened in Gauri's Darbar and not in arena and during that part Chand was right beside Samrat with dagger to kill each other and to not die by the hands of Mughals and other prisoners were killed by Mughals and their bodies never returned India\n\nBOLLYWOOD just know to glorify Mughals who destroyed our land but will brainwash the youth will fake stories of real heroes.\n\nBOLLYWOOD should just make movies like Student of the year, heropanti, golmaal 69 and so on.. they should be banned from making biopics on real legends, the real gems of India.."

The screenplay, the music, the acting all lack any interest. Akshay is so unworthy in his role. His acting was like that in 'Baby' or 'Airlift'. He lacked any aggression or facial expressions. I am so disappointed by Dr. Chandra Prakash Dwivedi. I am still in awe of Chanakya (the TV serial) but this is unforgiveable. He did better in that Housefull bald headed role as Bala (or something). I did love the weightage given to mantras all around the film but nothing else works here. Manav Vij as Mohd Ghazni & Ashutosh rana were quite ok. But they are not the ones who carry this film. I couldn't decide if I should laugh or cry at Manushi's climax scene. It was pathetic & over dramatic. Dwivedi apart from reading history should have (re)watched 'Jodha Akbar', 'Bajirao Mastani' & 'Padmavat' as a film. Look at the Afghans in Padmavat. Brilliant. Here Afghans are speaking hindi & Prthviraj uses urdu words. Shameful. This half baked story & a half hearted film doesn't deserve to be remembered let alone rated."

Film tries to become a placeholder for feminism instead of showing Brave Hindu warriors protecting Bharat from Radical Islamic Invasion. Almost revers a Bloody Invader Ghazni.

        "review_detailed_main": "Samrat Prithviraj review :\n\nThis was one film I was looking forward to catch in theatre but unfortunately, had to stay home in Covid quarantine and by the time I recovered, the movie had already exited cinemas after bombing badly. Anyway, Samrat Prithviraj premiered online last weekend on Amazon Prime and I caught up quickly on what I missed...\n\nA review stating it is good or bad may appear futile now as the paying audience has already taken that call. I will try to delve more on what went wrong for Prithviraj the movie considering it was the much touted magnum opus after 83 (2021) which Bollywood was heavily banking upon..\n\nBased on Chand Vardai's epic poem Prithviraj Raso, the film showcases the heroic and righteous Samrat Prithviraj (Akshay Kumar) who wins over the heart of his close relative but sworn rival Raja Jaichand's daughter Sanyogita (beauty queen Manushi Chillar). Enraged, the wily Jaichand (Ashutosh Rana) seeks the help of Sultan of Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori (Manav Vij) to attack Prithviraj's kingdom. Prior to this, Prithviraj had captured Ghori in a battle but let him free as Rajputs never killed unarmed enemy as a principle!!\n\nDr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi's direction style belongs to the '90s. He concentrates more on Prithviraj's love story rather than on the then prevailing political situation which lead to him getting crowned the emperor of Delhi over the senior Jaichand. Secondly, the screenplay is laden with historical inaccuracies. Sultan Ghori is shown asking Prithviraj to only bow down to him after his capture whereas it is well known that the order was for much sinister religious conversion which the defeated but self respecting Samrat flatly refused. Raso talks of 'Jauhar' (self immolation) committed by Queen Sanyogita whereas there are multiple contradictions in other history books of her embracing 'Sati' later or of getting killed by Sultan after suffering immense humiliation. Similarly, whether the blind Prithviraj killed Ghori or the Sultan died a natural death ten years later is another matter of debate. These conflicting theories loom large in mind of the viewers making them doubt as to how much of this movie is actually true!!\n\nThe acting is again a mixed bag. Manav Vij disappoints big time as Sultan Ghori. He appears wooden in most scenes. Sanjay Dutt as Kaka Kanha, is strictly okey dokey. Sonu Sood does better as the Raso author and Prithviraj's right hand man Chand Vardai. Ashutosh Rana is woefully wasted. As for Akshay Kumar, he is neither too great nor too awful in the titular role. The ever busy star seems to have completed the movie hurriedly as just another quickie project... trust me, he was far better in Kesari (2019). His demeanor and mannerisms here appear too casual to befit the great emperor he is portraying on screen. The surprise good act comes from debutant Miss World Manushi Chillar who not only looks wow but also leaves a mighty impression in the dance sequences and the sad finale her character goes through...\n\nTo sum up, Samrat Prithviraj is not a bad film at all. Under a Rajamouli or an Ashutosh Gowariker, this could have been a masterpiece. Nevertheless, it certainly qualifies for a wholesome family watch on OTT. Make it one!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Even by looks Akshay resembled more like Bala from Houseful 4. Ghouri was found lacking and Samyukta didn't impress much. Historically many facts shown were incorrect. In short, I wouldn't watch it even it is telecast on TV out of respect for my time and sensibility."

How can the writer even think of writing a scene where Samrat prthviraj is dancing and a scene where princess sanyogita is dancing like a regular bollywood dancer, where the hell is ghoomar.... Prithviraj chauhan was undoubtedly of Rajput clan but not even once the word rajput is uttered in whole movie because the producer where in a hell of greed and were aware of the matter that the Gujjars who claim Prithviraj chauhan to be a Gurjjar king will boycott the movie.... What a disrespected of the Hindu Warrier of rajput Clan... The scene where Rani Sanyogita Performs Agni Johar was made completely unrealistic as before doing so she danced with other ladies which spoiled the whole thrill and goosebumpness of that brave act.... \"Char baans chaubis gaj angul ashth praman...\" the epic lines which chandrabardai chanted to guide prithviraj when prithviraj killed ghori with an arrow were not there .... Its unbelievable... How can they dare to claim this movie to be based on prithviraj raso...

Please do not do that, you are just messing with history, and movies does a lot of impact to our young generation, please do not distort history.\n\nDuring 11th 12th century, India was not a unified country, it was a landmass of Kingdoms, hence there was nothing like today's Nationalism, but Akhsay tried to show it buy saying \"Hindustan\" again and again, whereas in reality Prithviraj belonged to Chahmana dynasty and he had nothig to do with other kingdoms, during this , every kingdoms wanted to assert their power over another, there was rivalries. Chauhan belongs to Rajput clan , nad one of the Rajput kingdoms .\n\nHe won against Ghori in 1911 but got badly defeated during secon battle of Tarain. His kingdom was badly usurped.

He growls like a lion who has lost his bite and despite all the air-brushing, doesn't look like the boy who became a Samrat in his 20s. Must be Much Worked on it\n\nThere are no references to 22 battles Prithviraj with Mohammad Ghori because Bollywood has promote secularism and pseudo secularism. History is meddling as bollywood did.\n\nBut sonu sud , ashutosh rana n sakshi tanwar did well.\n\nOverall disappointed by the movie. Don't waste your money on it."

First is woman power issue; it showed how old is this issue and how fight continues from the times of Krishna. This nuances of the fight of gender in our history is captured beautifully. Second, the architecture and settings are best and looked 'Bhaaratiya' and of course Dwivediji is known for this. Thank god he didn't made them extravagant like Bhansali. Yes, somehow it missed to create the mood of that time and era as he had done in Upanishad Ganga.\n\nAll the characters are good and have made it worth watching. We can see a glimpse of pressure of lead role in Akki. His character was treated with too much caution and so agreeably ended up stiff.\n\nIf you are going to compare this with Hollywood finishing and making then it's your mistake. Even Bahuballi and RRR were not perfect, in fact they have have stretched every scene towards a laughable perfect..\n\nIf you see good you will get good."

Akshay and sanjay did a good job but overall pretty boring movie. With so much songs and more romance they made it worse. It could have been alot better if Bhansali would have done it.

Akshay's Samrat Prithviraj is less Chauhan and more kumaar...Can Akshay Kumar, who only gives 40-50 days to a movie do justice to this role? Definitely not,sir... he as prithviraj doesn't suit.the cast of the movie didn't express the courage that the rajputs possess since the ages...the valour, courage,war strategy of rajputs were missing...In 12th century in India, main language was sanskrit, hindi and marwadi,In this movie a lot of farsi & Arabic words were used by samrat and queen... In Rajputana's era Queen or Princess didn't dance. Salaam and hugs by prithviraj to mahammad ghori is not acceptable,WTF...he was samrat not a regular guy...History has been distorted badly... Jauhar and unnecessary songs have been added... main content and story hasn't been focused on... Everyone is aware of how great CHAUHAN'S were but the movie failed to justify his greatness. Samrat Prithviraj is worshipped as our God and this picture has disrupted his valour and sacrifice.\n\nGreat life of Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan needed a screenplay that celebrated his journey, pride and valour, but this movie failed in every department... The brave Indian warrior deserved a better film... Jai bhawani."

I'm gonna consider this movie a motion picture based on historical facts. It seems like the film lack of proper writing which caused the overall crafting of the film to be bad as well. Majority of the artist involved in the film have done really good in terms of their part. But the film does not keep you engaged even after you see a good stunning visuals.

The role of Kannauj Pati is bad too , developed immaturedly in the form of a father , as a husband , as a king , as an worthy enemy and so on. The lead actress is well chosen but didn't have the gripping flavour. And the song ? No No dear , Our hindu king doesn't do all the masala things in the desert. Lastly the Indian heritage issue didn't touch the intention ie the national sentiment.\n\nThe set design is impressive , have spent a good amount of money in designing the architecture , costume. Also the film explicitly shows the weakness of Indian rulers despite strong traditional roots. But the movie misses the character development highly , which makes it bore. Nowadays Bollywood needs a master flavour in history re-telling esp the characters , in order to connect to the people. It deserves an average rating of 5/10 but rating it 3/10 to balance the total rating. A 53/100."
