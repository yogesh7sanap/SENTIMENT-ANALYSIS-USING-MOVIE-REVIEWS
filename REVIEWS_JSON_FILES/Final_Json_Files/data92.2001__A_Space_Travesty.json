After the success of the \"Naked Gun\" series, he has been restricted to a career of playing the same character over...and over...and over....\n\nThis time, he is US Marshall \"Dick\" Dix (the first of many human anatomy puns/so-called \"jokes\"). I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one in the writing room.\n\n\"How about Agent Butt K. Isser?\" \"How about Agent T. Itz?\" \"No, wait guys! I've got it! Dick Dix! Haha we're comedic geniuses!\" The budget is very obviously on the low end. Special effects are terrible. The film tries to lampoon the space travel segments of Kubrick's \"2001\" and fails miserably. Nielsen sucks food through a straw and can't manage to get it up the straw the whole way. Hahaha I chuckled all night thinking of that one! Or how about the woman in the back of the space shuttle who has huge breasts and manages to accidentally shed out of her clothes, which float around and slap Nielsen in the face? No, it couldn't have been the ugly fat woman whose clothes magically disappear...it's the busty blonde...I love Hollywood."

It seems that nowadays all the writers or director of a movie need to do is tell Nielsen: Hey we're gonna make fun of some other movies, interested? And Nielsen would just sit there like, 'yeah'!\n\nInstead of what the title would assume, 2001's main victim isn't A Space Odyssey but the more recent Men In Black. But, having said that, I cannot think of one decent joke relating to that movie. Nor can I tell here what the story is all about... it's got something to do with the president being swapped with a clone, or not, or whatever.\n\nBy lack of anything good to offer director Goldstein just throws some lusty women into it, but perhaps it says all that no well-known woman apparently would like to take up the job, so we have to do with an unknown French woman and an unknown German one...\n\nIn fact, I don't know of any reason why I should recommend this movie. Some lame jokes are just about OK, but nothing more than a 2/10 if you'd ask me."

Leslie Nielsen plays a guy called Dick Dix in this movie, and guess what, that's one of the better jokes. It's absolutely painful to see Leslie Nielsen in this movie, desperately looking for one bit of material that he could make work. The script centers mostly around slapstick that doesn't go over at all, but sometimes it takes a break from that and goes for some terrible political satire. This is a movie that gets a Clinton impersonator, and focuses on how he plays the saxophone. That's hard-hitting satire right there. Remember how Clinton always played the saxophone? I do, kinda. Later Nielsen narrates about a woman's finesse while she's beating everyone up. Comedy. Pavarotti also threatens to castrate a guy, the pope swears, the three tenors sing \"In The Navy\", did Germans write this or something? The type of comedy isn't even consistent, one time it's the aforementioned slapstick, then it's \"satire\", then suddenly the writers remembered they didn't have any in-jokes yet. So they put in like ten in a row. This thing sucks like you wouldn't believe."

Well, it turned into something pretty bad, I really couldn't find myself laughing at any of the situations, which is sad, because I find the stupidest situations very funny and I am easily amused. But I was curious if maybe it was my bad mood that killed the comedy for me, but I looked on IMDb before watching it again and it's not just me apparently.\n\nWell, a some what take off of the Naked Gun series, only in outer space situations, Leslie is now Dick Dix, a clumsy detective that is sent to a planet called Vegan where he learns that President Clinton has been kidnapped and cloned and that the clone is on Earth with bad intentions for the world. Or as it seems, Dick actually plants the clone by accident and well... it just wasn't funny.\n\nThe jokes tried too hard and the story was just weak, it could have been something special, but unfortunately they took too much advantage of the Naked Gun series, which was pretty sad. I know Leslie can do much better and he has, so I forgive him. For those users who are looking for a recommendation here, I'm not going to give you one because like I said, I thought it was just me that didn't like the film, but I think the rating is enough warning in itself.\n\n3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now I do like spoof movies, when they are funny and done right. There are some funny spoofs around, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety and Loaded Weapon 1 for example, but the spoof genre has also had some excrement such as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie. 2001: A Space Travesty is not as bad as any of the worst of Friedberg and Seltzer. However, that is not saying much, 2001:A Space Travesty is still a terrible movie, being contrived, embarrassing and unfunny and it makes you think what possessed Leslie Nielson to take on this project.\n\nAs I said in the review title, the irony in the word \"travesty\" is correct. To be honest, while hardly clever or original the title is the best asset of this movie, as well as the end credits which was the only time in the entire movie when I cracked a smile, you know immediately there is something wrong when that is the case. The production values are cheap, with the costumes more reminiscent of fancy dress, shoddy camera work, dismal special effects and wobbly sets. The soundtrack is poorly thought out, In the Navy by The Three Tenors especially felt as though it was shoe horned in.\n\nThe story is predictable and almost a non-event, the pace didn't draw me in in any way and the direction was decidedly patchy. Also the characters are little more than stereotypes and caricatures and really bad ones at that with names that felt like poor Carry On lampoons. The acting is terrible, yes including from the talented Leslie Nielson. Nielson shows he can be funny as with Naked Gun and Airplane, which are comedy classics in my opinion, but he overacts and mugs shamelessly here which saddened me hugely. Everyone else either overplay, are bland or seem to be playing themselves. Worse is the humour, the film just isn't funny and is filled with the crude and vulgar kind of humour that doesn't come close to the inspired zaniness of the best of the spoof genre. The homages and references to sci-fis such as 2001:A Space Odyssey(one of my favourite films) are obvious and poorly thought out and the script is abysmal and didn't make me laugh one time.\n\nIn conclusion, not the worst of the genre but a mess all the same. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

Even the sight gags--which are the easiest part of comedy to pull off, were lame and uninspired. Leslie Nielsen has really embarrassed himself here. In his successful Zucker Brothers spoofs, he's a master at playing ridiculous scenes completely straight, and thereby making the funny stuff work. Here he acts desperate. He mugs just to inject some life into the dreariness of it all, and, as other reviewers have mentioned, embarrasses himself mightily. If you want to see him in a movie devoid of intentional laughs, check out the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE. At least that flick has some inadvertent giggles."

You could watch the same scene in Mr. Neilson's earlier films 3 and 4 times and find a new joke every time.\n\nThis waste of celluloid wants to be risqu\u00e9, but is not willing to deal with adult humor at an honest level. This 'suggestive' humor is not all that funny since the whole point of a dirty joke is to be dirty. The rest of the humor is not complex enough to warrent more than five minutes of attention.\n\nOn the positive side- production value is adequate. The film does not appear to be a bargain budget piece that one would see as a Sci-Fi channel original's series.\n\nBottom line:\n\nUnless you have an unnatural obsession for Leslie Neilson films- skip this one."

I bet that those who have the most negative criticism on this one , haven't noticed for 50% how many and silly stupid jokes are made in it. OK, it's hilarious, but it should be. I enjoyed watching it and even watched it twice, noticing new 'jokes'and 'stupidity' the second time. I'm sure if I see it again I will still notice new 'jokes' e.d.

Leslie Nielsen may not be regarded as a comedic genius by anyone's standards, but he has made some stupid, but enjoyable films in his career. In contrast, his latest, \"2001: A Space Travesty\", is just stupid, a very poor rehash of Leslie Nielsen's \"Naked Gun\" series and character with dated attempts of humor that just aren't funny.\n\nLeslie Nielsen is Richard Dick Dix, a total rip-off of his Lt. Frank Drebin, his most well-known role from \"Police Squad!\" and the \"Naked Gun\" series. As his name and the film's R rating already tell, instead of going for light-hearted stupid slapstick comedy a la most of Nielsen's other films, \"2001: AST\" attempts light-hearted stupid sexual comedy. This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't fail so miserably at it. There is a ton of crude toilet and sexual humor, and none of it is funny to anyone over the age of 10 (and the majority of it wouldn't be funny to anyone under that age either). Nielsen's trademark straight delivery of absurd lines and situations is still present, but the material isn't by any means even remotely funny so it doesn't work.\n\nA good portion of the material is not only unfunny, but dated as well. A Bill Clinton impersonator playing the President is OK considering production of the film began in 2000 and probably before the new election, but scenes near the end featuring \"celebrities\" include impersonations of the Three Tenors, Madonna, Prince, and Hulk Hogan. This dated nature can also apply to the jokes; in reality they are no different than those in \"Naked Gun\", except that the last film in that series was made almost ten years ago, and sex-based humor has moved on, which would explain why it's just not funny. Director Allan Goldstein and writer Alan Shearman have no expertise in comedy to notice or help matters much. Shearman in particular hasn't written a comedy since 1990, which further explains the dated feel of the film.\n\nPerhaps if this film had been released 10-15 years ago it would be funny. I would still be a child who would appreciate the attempts at toilet humor, and lewd sexual comedy was still on this level. The dated \"celebrity\" in-jokes may have even made sense. Even then, however, this film would still be known as the worst \"Naked Gun\" film. Released today, my ideas of comedy have matured much past this simple childish toilet humor, the dated jokes make no sense, and it's just terrible, by far one of the worst films I have ever seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "A yet another Leslie Nielsen movie. I've always enjoyed his movies since they had an ability to make one laugh... hard. But, lately something has started to go wrong. His last movies were not funny at all. It may be because of Nielsen's age or because of directors presumption that having Leslie in his movie will guarantee a success. Although he tries to make the movie work it fails completely. Moments where you will catch yourself smiling (not laughing) can be counted with one hand and the whole plot fails in the middle of the movie where it is being turned into a boring and long theater scene. The whole idea about having Nielsen play a Magoo like character has failed miserably because it's not funny anymore - this time dear old Leslie doesn't have to play, he simply is old!\n\nAlso the FX in this movie don't seem to work well. Although you might think they don't have to for a comedy. But in the case of this movie it's different. The authors tried to use CG but 90% of the time it simply looks fake and stupid, not funny.\n\nSo, for me the movie is a complete failure. They would have done better hiring some good script writers instead of trying to use the same old tricks with the same OLD guy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leslie Nielsen got a new lease on his long career with the \"Airplane\" movies...which led to \"Police Squad\" and the \"Police Squad\" movies. All of these had a few things in common...excellent writing as well as the Abrams/Zucker alliance. In other words, Nielsen alone was NOT the reason these projects were so funny. This is sadly apparent in a string of films he made with hack writers/directors...resulting in crap films like \"Repossessed\", \"Scary Movie IV\" and this one, \"2001: A Space Travesty\". Watch it if you'd like....but don't expect it to be funny nor worth your time. And remember...it's not just my opinion...the film is #73 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list!\n\nSo why didn't I enjoy this film? Well, to put it bluntly, the film was cheap and unfunny. Many of the special effects and costumes were dreadfully bad...especially at the beginning with the \"2001\" intro parody. Additionally, too often the movie went for cheap childish laughs instead of clever ones...relying too often on things such as farts, rip-away dresses and crude character names (such as Dick Dix and Miss Menage). By comparison, Mel Brooks' worst films seem like works of genius by comparison. Overall, a tedious and mostly unfunny film seemingly written by untalented chimps....very untalented ones."

        "review_title": "An unfortunate display of bad comedy writing",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is another spoof movie starring Leslie Nielsen, and I first heard of it a while ago, and knew it was obviously a sci-fi spoof. The title is derived from Stanley Kubrick's groundbreaking 1968 film, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", though this film is certainly not entirely a parody of that one. I've seen that particular Kubrick movie several times, but was not as impressed with it during my last viewing, in January 2008. Still, the title of this 2000 comedy, \"2001: A Space Travesty\", was what brought it to my attention, since I obviously know where this title came from. I could see that this was not one of Nielsen's popular spoofs, but after a while, and only about 24 hours after first watching \"Airplane!\", an earlier parody film with Nielsen (and a MUCH better one) this week, I watched this despised sci-fi comedy. While I didn't find it to be QUITE as bad as many others have (maybe most other people who have seen in at some point in the past decade think it's worse than I do), I still thought it was a lousy attempt at comedy, so I can't defend it.\n\nMarshall \"Dick\" Dix is a clumsy detective who is informed that the President of the United States (a nameless character, but obviously based on Bill Clinton) is being held captive on a moon base called Vegan and has been replaced by a clone! The detective is sent out of Earth's atmosphere to this moon base, on a mission to rescue the real president and find out who's responsible for the crime. He is accompanied on this mission by an officer named Cassandra Menage. Together, the two of them make it to Vegan, where they see that there are many beings around, both human and alien. Dix and Menage begin their inspection, which will obviously not be helped by Dix's clumsiness. After defeating the evil Dr. Griffin Pratt and his hoodlums in a fight, thanks largely to Menage's martial arts skills, the two inspectors escape from the moon and take the president with them. Back on Earth, Dix puts who he thinks is the real president back in the White House, but it turns out he has just replaced the real president with the clone! Even though the detective has messed up, it's still up to him to save his home planet, so the mission which started with a trip to the moon now continues on Earth!\n\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is obviously too slow paced for some viewers, and it did seem too slow to me the last time I watched it, but with only one viewing of \"2001: A Space TRAVESTY\", it seemed to me that it had the opposite problem, it was too fast! The direction seems so rushed and unfocused, and so does Leslie Nielsen's narration. Unfortunately, the problems certainly don't end here. The movie is full of very juvenile and unfunny humour, and since it's a comedy, that's its main problem. This already shows during the opening sequence and is featured in many other scenes, including the penis jokes about the main protagonist's name, Dix trying to use a spaceship toilet on the way to the moon just as the artificial gravity is turned off, a human on the moon coming out of the bathroom covered in alien waste, condoms which are found later in the film, etc. There are so many gags here which obviously took no comedic talent whatsoever to come up with! Not only does the toilet humour fail, so does the slapstick, with such occurrences as Dix accidentally making a huge mess during his inspection on Vegan. The gags generally seem like they were just thrown in with very little or no thought put into them. In addition to that, the film also seemed too noisy to me.\n\nUnfortunately, with all this movie's flaws, it's most certainly a misfire. Leslie Nielsen's character here is like Lieutenant Frank Drebin, his character in the \"Naked Gun\" series (they're both clumsy detectives), but if you're a fan of any or all of those movies, that certainly doesn't mean you're guaranteed to like this later spoof. I remember one time when I was in high school, a student was banned from my school bus route after playing with a dildo during the ride home and giving the bus driver attitude when he told him to get off the bus. \"2001: A Space Travesty\" seems like it was written by hyperactive high school students like that guy! I'll admit, I did smile at times while watching this film, but this was VERY rare, and I never actually laughed. Not only did it not make me laugh, I may have had a slight headache while watching it, which the film didn't help. Yes, my rating for this sci-fi spoof is 4/10, which is higher than what seems to be the most popular rating for it, but I still don't like it. I even feel like 4/10 just might be too generous, and know that many people would believe that saying this rating is too generous is an understatement! If you've never watched this unpopular 2000 comedy, I strongly suggest you don't, whether you like Nielsen's comedy roles in general or not."

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this movie in a bin of bargain-basement, second-hand videos. I seem to have a weakness for \"spoofs.\" I liked the first Naked Gun (even though the cop sidekicks were better cast on TV's Police Squad), and rode out the two disappointing sequels. I tried but never got into the Airplane movies. I stuck with the increasingly thin, sophomoric Austin Powers films. I made it through Loaded Weapon, Scream, three Scary Movies, Not Another Teen Movie, and a series of Leslie Nielsen clunkers so lame that I did not think it could sink any lower - Repossessed; Dracula: Dead and Loving It; Spy Hard; Wrongfully Accused; and Mr. Magoo (by then, all a well-known film critic who had once praised Nielsen's comic talents had to say about him was that he was the \"bozo du jour\"). But Spy Hard is a masterpiece compared to \"Travesty.\"\n\n\"Travesty\" has enough budget and production values to not quite give away by its looks alone how bad a film it really is. The name of Nielsen's character -- Dick Dix -- is catchy (certainly better than Spy Hard's weak \"Dick Steele, Agent WD-40\"). Early on, there are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments: Dix being snapped back and forth from front to back of a space shuttle by the suspenders of his pants snagged on a seat, sending him flying head-first into a levitating anvil; and Dix crushed on top of someone and undergoing various contortions during a gravity-defying drop in a high-speed space elevator.\n\nBut the movie is a thin, slow-paced, forced, brain-dead mess. It does not even get Dix into space until it runs through an infantile \"history of the universe\" sequence (featuring the constellation \"stifficus\" and takeoffs on a \"white dwarf,\" a \"moon,\" and \"aliens\" (shots of Michael Jackson and Dennis Rodman)) and scenes that play like rejects from a bad Naked Gun movie. Dix is a \"Marshal\" with the \"International Security Force\" (whatever that is). His car radio is conveniently tuned to the local police frequency, and he butts in on a hostage situation at a fast-food joint. He goes from there to more unfunny, chaotic scenes at the \"bull pen\" of his D.C.-area headquarters.\n\nYou expect things to pick up when Dix is sent to a moonbase for humans and aliens to investigate a report that an evil doctor there is cloning and replacing world leaders. But almost immediately, it becomes clear that the film has nothing interesting to do in space. It sags and drags.\n\nThis is partly because of a cut-rate, no-name supporting cast which has zero rapport with Nielsen. The worst are a laid-back, jive-talking black dude and a hammy, low-rent, Italian-version Inspector Clouseau, neither of whom manage a single funny or even understandable line or action in the entire movie; and two unremarkable novice actresses who go through the motions with little or no apparent acting skill or characters to play (reviews that slobber over them need to get a life -- or take a look at any random actress starring in any major movie).\n\nIt is also because of crude, childish, labored, unfocused, rip-off gags that smother anything remotely funny. For example, Dix chases around after and makes a disgusting mess of the doctor's toupee; Dix tracks ink all over the white carpet and destroys an office; Dix gets hands and feet stuck on a door bearing a note written in glue; and so on. A disco scene is another loud, chaotic waste of time.\n\nThe movie even ruins the elevator scene by having Dix and the woman remain entangled long after the doors open, with him standing up and holding her upside down, facing him, so that she has to peer through his legs and he gets a \"fart\" in the face. The movie also sinks to this kind of \"comedy\" in the space shuttle bathroom; in sloppy mispronunciations by a French security guard (\"backstage p*ss\"; \"no one will get p*ssed\"; to musician, \"you can blow your instrument with confidence knowing I will be here holding the f*rt\"); and in the simple-minded gimmick, after the end credits roll, of disembodied sound effects with captions. None of this has anything to do with satire about space movies or anything else. It is cheap, junk \"humor.\"\n\nBy the time Dix returns to Earth, the film has become unwatchable. What feels like the movie's last half, or more, slogs through desperate, disorganized, clumsy, endlessly drawn-out scenes at a Paris opera house, before a \"world leaders' conference.\" Dix and his cohorts (wearing stupid, unfunny \"disguises\") and the villains take forever to reach and then fight in the control room for the stage, trying to keep their version of the U.S. President in place.\n\nAlong the way are senseless, tasteless jokes (Pavarotti's condoms?!?); quick cuts to bad impersonations of dignitaries or pop stars in the audience (the Pope is the worst); lame, obvious humor about the Clintons (he acts like a good-ol'-boy boor and she rolls her eyes); and frantic, loud, boring antics backstage and on stage. Cutaways to the increasingly embarrassing supporting cast and material, which by now have the movie in near-total meltdown, ruin an already forced bid for laughs with the \"Three Tenors\" singing \"In the Navy.\" The movie limps to an end with a strained, tacked-on scene at a restaurant where one of the young women, who the movie never bothers to develop as a love interest, dines with Dix, who for no reason makes a mess.\n\nMindless, goofy, silly movies can be fun. But calling something a \"parody,\" \"satire,\" or \"spoof\" hardly makes it an automatic laugh riot. And any feeble effort that comes along is not worth recommending with the lazy, sloppy excuse \"come on, this is supposed to be bad.\" It is no fun to watch a stand-up comedian die on stage, much less to watch it for 100 minutes. This pretty much sums up how it feels to watch \"Travesty.\""

Neilsen's OK - he can do this kind of thing with his eyes shut, I imagine - but everything else about this film is bad. The female lead in this just about passes muster, but she only weighs about two stone, and the bad guy used to be Richard Briers' suave neighbour in Ever Decreasing Circles back in the 80s, so its just about impossible to see him as a real baddie.\n\nThe film itself doesn't really have much to do with 2001 - in fact it looks more like a take on the Men in Black flicks, although films of every genre are referenced throughout. It does get marginally better in the last 20 minutes when the three tenors give a spirited rendition of Village People's In the Navy, but by then only the strongest-willed of viewers will still be around.\n\nBottom line: Everyone involved in this should hang their heads in shame..."

You know this movie is awful already before seeing it - and that's because its trailer does not contain a single funny scene. As you probably know, movies of this sort put all their good jokes in their trailers (vide: Mel Brooks's Dracula). The trailer for this one has nothing funny in it, and that is not because the makers kept the good jokes for the movie itself but because they don't even have one funny gag to show - the whole \"film\" consists of some jokes older than the Pacific, plenty of awful \"sex 'n' barf\" kind of \"humor\", and a lot of dreadful, unimaginative, uninspired, boring, inane and inept attempts at a parody (\"SAL! oh, that's Italian, and there's that music from GODFATHER playing, oh how funny!\").

More than what are classically called BAD films, this has to rank among the worst only because of the embarrassment of riches which lay waste within its starving potentialities."

I forced myself to watch the entire movie hoping to reach some point in the movie that would become entertaining. Frankly, the only reason to watch it is for Ophelie Winter's phantabulous physique. Aside from that, don't waste your time.\n\nNaked Gun was funny because the antics were so absurd, even stupid, but they were still funny. 2001 Space Travesty's comedy lived up to the movie's name in full form. Somehow I can't put words to why the slapstick antics in Naked Gun didn't work in this movie, but take my word for it, they didn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite Leslie Nielsen began as a movie actor in the mid-1950s he didn't become widely recognized until when he did the AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN movies. These movies are true classics of the spoof genre, and mostly because they were cleverly written, well acted and with likeable characters all around. Unfortunately this didn't continued as the years passed because Nielsen ended up appearing in wretched movies badly written/acted/directed like REPOSSESSED, DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT and this one. If you watch it do it, but don't expect it to be a masterpiece or a comedy of the level of NAKED GUN. And I am not the only that hated it remember... the movie is currently number #96 on IMDB's everchanging Bottom 100 - the list of the 100 lowest rated major releases of all time.\n\nSo why the movie is easy to hate? Well, first of all, it's unfunny. Many of the jokes are crude and the costumes' design and the sets are incredibly bad. Plus, for most of its time the movie went for cheap and annoying jokes such as farts, revealing dresses and the dumbest characters' names you can find (such as Richard Dick Dix or Miss Menage). And Ezio Greggio, despite SILENCE OF THE HAMS bombed, didn't learned his lesson of leaving acting to real actors!\n\nOverall a dumb and unfunny movie that looks like it was made with a 500$ dollar budget, horrible sets and a director that seemed very clueless."

It really needed to have a Brooks, Zucker or Abrahams to help it through, but it didn't.\n\nI understand that Nielsen (God bless his soul) had been suffering a lull in his career at the time ...as he had gone slapstick, and was not attractive to the big hitter producers. This was a dreadful follow-up to Mr Magoo and wrongfully Accused, and his career had never really recovered. He was posthumously honoured by the Academy for his noteworthy career.\n\nI will probably scrub through this again just to see Nielsen and Greggio again, out of my best regards ...or perhaps not."

I strongly suspect this was an STV (Straight To Video) offering aimed at a specific European audience, and the credits do tend to bear this out - my guess is that most of the other actors are probably well-known outside the States and the UK (I know I've never heard of or seen them before).\n\nHowever, it's not a terrible movie (I've seen very much worse) and if you like the style of acting found in French, German or Italian farces then you'll enjoy this one."

That Frenchman has said fart when he intended to say fort, oh how hilarious\"... are maybe some of the thoughts that will go through your head when you watch this movie or maybe you'll just cringe.

        "review_detailed_main": "Time for another clich\u00e9 to raise its ugly head and that is - Did I see the same movie ? I read a few of the comments on this page just before I sat down to watch 2001 A SPACE TRAVESTY and feared the worst . After spending an hour and a half of my life watching it I feel some people have overreacted to it . Okay it's certainly not a comedy masterwork but neither is it the cinematic atrocity some people are claiming\n\nCertainly the opening sequence is very tough going , so much so I can't help thinking the people pouring vitriolic hatred on the movie actually gave up on it at this point . To say the film could only get better at this point is to state the obvious but 2001 does indeed improve down to the fact that Leslie Neilson may be playing a character called Richard \" Dick \" Dix but is detective Frank Drebin in everything but name and the introductory sequence where Dick ends a hostage crisis in his own unintentional style is fairly amusing and leaves one hoping for more of the same similar to the style of THE NAKED GUN movies\n\nThis sums up the problem with 2001 and that is that is it sustain the laughs and is very patchy . There's a long segment set on a moonbase and it really belongs in another film as the audience anticipates the sort of antics we'd expect from Frank Drebin . Instead of the sharp , witty , snappy one liners we more often than not get jokes that are stretched out beyond their natural length , most blatantly the three tenors having a Village People routine which gives the impression the writers aren't trying too hard\n\nIn summary 2001 A SPACE TRAVESTY isn't a classic Leslie Neilson comedy but contained enough jokes to bring the occasional wry smile to my face . Everyone else on this page seems to hate it but if you genuinely think this is a bad movie starring Neilson I suggest you watch both REPOSSEED and DEAD AND LOVING IT which really were so bad as to be unwatchable"

I can imagine my children would've had a few laughs watching this movie - when they were of pre-school age. Plenty of attempts at slapstick with very few successes. The movie seems to have been made so as to be easily overdubbed with other-language audio tracks, hence meaningless dialogue (I'm sure one could attain the same level of understanding by watching with the volume turned down completely) and a plot barely comparable to the typical Bugs Bunny cartoon.\n\nHaving just now flicked through director Goldstein's other credits, I must say I can comfortably add him to the \"not worth watching under any circumstances\" list; whether it's his inability to bring life to a story (a talented director can breathe life into the most mundane stories) or just poor judgement in choosing what he takes on, is anyone's guess."

Describing like that implies that it was meant to be taken seriously. This one isn't meant to be taken seriously. Like any Leslie Nielsen movie, it's an excuse to be silly. It casts him as a marshal sent to outer space to stop a coup, but the plot of course isn't important. The movie's purpose is to have Leslie Nielsen get into a series of embarrassing situations - that is, embarrassing for him, a hoot for us. Granted, this one doesn't quite reach the standards set by the \"Naked Gun\" movies, but it has its share of laughs (particularly the opening scene)."

It's rather goofy, and a lot of Dix's narrative humor doesn't quite fly. And, most importantly, no I don't think real gorgeous women would find Leslie Nielsen THAT attractive. But let's face it: not all movies should be taken seriously, especially comedies. The pace was quick enough that it kept me watching the whole time, the action was entertaining, the plot was light but still actually made sense, and the lovely ladies featured didn't exactly hurt as well -- the movie is actually better than most I have seen in the attractive woman department. If you like silly slapstick humor, and particularly if you like the Inspector Clouseau Pink Panther movies and Galaxy Quest, I think you should enjoy this one. And if you haven't seen those, it should still be good if you want to watch some lame, non-serious humor to get your mind off all the trouble in the world. I'll give it an 8 out of 10."

And seeing it was a movie with Leslie Nielsen in the lead, and given the movie's title, of course I opted to sit down and watch it.\n\nHowever, I must say that the type of comedies that Leslie Nielsen starred in were actually starting to wear thin here. And this 2000 movie from writers Alan Shearman, Vince Di Clemente and Francesco Lucente just felt like they were beating a dead horse. The storyline wasn't really particularly entertaining, much less actually overly funny. And it sort of felt like a random escapade of jokes and gags made up on the go.\n\nOf course it was enjoyable enough to see Leslie Nielsen on the screen, but I have to say that this particular genre of comedy had been bled dry already, and it was a bit of a struggle to watch him attempt to make the script funny.\n\nIt should be noted that some of the alien creatures in the movie were actually nicely enough made, and definitely were colorful and imaginative. Whereas the CGI in the movie was horrible to look at.\n\nI can now check this movie off of my list of watched movies, though I doubt that I will ever return to watch it a second time, as it was bit of an effort to sit through it the first time around.\n\nMy rating of \"2001 A Space Travesty\", from director Allan A. Goldstein, lands on a four out of ten stars."

I just saw this movie for the first time and I can see why I didn't run out and see it when it first came out 5 years ago. Although the movie had a horrible plot, low budget special effects, and was generally unentertaining, it did have a saving point and her name is Cassandra Manage played by Oph\u00e9lie Winter (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935807/) and that's the reason I chose to rate this film as a nine. Although her filmography isn't that long, mostly containing foreign/international films, her beauty absolutely took my breath away. Oph\u00e9lie Winter is definitely at the top of my list of the most beautiful women in the world and I hope to see that she is recognized soon for it. I sincerely doubt it, but if Oph\u00e9lie Winter actually gets the chance to read this, you are a beautiful woman, talented actress, and I truly hope to see you in future films as you expand your fruitful acting career."

I remember him from the \"Airplane\" movies, and I best know him from all three \"Naked Gun\" movies - \"The Naked Gun: From The Files Of 'Police Squad!',\" \"The Naked Gun 2 and a half,\" and \"The Naked Gun 33 and a third,\" all of which are reminiscent to the \"Airplane\" movies because something funny happens every 10 seconds or so.\n\nI guess this must be Mr. Nielsen's trademark or something, because \"2001: A Space Travesty\" is just as funny as all the other movies mentioned!"
