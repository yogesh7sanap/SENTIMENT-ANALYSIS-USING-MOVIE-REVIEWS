        "review_detailed_main": "\"How do you like those peepers b*tch?!\"\n\nJeepers Creepers Reborn is the latest unheard of entry in the Jeepers Creepers series. Reborn plays more as a remake in a way rather than a sequel to the first three films. It's not necessarily a remake only because it mentions the existence of the films in this film so it basically treats itself as the real deal. Let's put it this way, it's the furthest thing from ever being the real deal. If you thought Jeepers Creepers 3 was bad and didn't think it could sink any lower, somehow this movie does that. This movie is pure trash on every single level imaginable. The cgi is so bad that you would think they just started post production one day before the films release. It's honestly astonishing how awful the cgi is. There's literally a scene the cgi doesn't render and you could literally see the green screen as the car door opens. If the creeper has ever frightened you in any of the first three films then unfortunately get ready to laugh at this one because he's a sniffing old weak b*tch in this outing. I'm seriously baffled at how awful this film was. The only reason it exists is because the writer/director of the first three films did some awful things we don't need to speak of and so they just flat out canceled that storyline and thought this would be an acceptable replacement. The acting is terrible, the plot is Hell Fest meets the Creeper, and somehow the cgi looked worse than it did in the 90s/early 2000s. Normally I'd say stay far away from this, but I also want you all to experience just how bad the Jeepers Creepers movies have gotten. I get movies like Jason X are laughably bad, but this one actually tries to be good which is sad. None of the kills were even good and I'm assuming that's because it was made $25."

The movie was an hour and a half long but it felt like 4 hours. It was bad. So bad. Kept waiting for it to get better but nope. Definitely not worth the watch. I saw five people yawn throughout the movie and i even laughed a couple of times at how stupid the dialogue was.\n\nThe actors do have potential, it was just the script that sucked."

Alas, the glaring lack of budget is still outshined by the embarrassing lack of imagination. Also, there is no evidence to suggest that anyone involved in the making of this horror hound, as in dog, has so much as seen the trailers for the other three installments, let alone the films themselves.

In Reborn they're WAY off, with too many mistakes to mention that make it more and more frustrating, as the whole time I'm thinking, \"Why, why, WHY?\"\n\nCombined with terrible dialog, silly plot premises and sillier assumptions by the characters, this was a real disappointment and probably the end of this movie series' legacy.

Usually I don't mind green screen work but in \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" the fake environments look incredibly bad and it's easily noticable that the characters aren't actually walking on real grass or closing real doors.\n\nThe special effects also look terrible, almost worse than in \"Jeepers Creepers 1\", which was released in 2001.\n\nThe script and story are just as bad, cheesy (not in a good way) and don't make sense in places. I can't and don't want to (fully) blame the actors because at least the main couple looked like they did the best with the script and direction they were given.\n\nThe only positive thing would the decent make-up and prosthetics used for the creeper if there wasn't real, human skin showing through, like in the \"reborn\" scene.\n\nAnd yet there's more to criticize: Apparently the creeper isn't able to count, which you'd think was required for an eternal demon that returns every 23 years. This movie just leaves me wondering why he was \"reborn\" two years early (2001+23=2024, not 2022). I would have really prefered for the creators to take the two additional years to look for proper locations to film at and practice a bit of CGI work to make the movie look less like a low budget student money-grab and more like the sequel/reboot it wants to be but in this state I'm not sure how it even managed to get into theaters.\n\nI've never left a movie theater early but the only thing that kept me in my seat with \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" was the fact that I paid almost $10 for the ticket and there's currently no refund policy at my local cinema.\n\nUnless you're into cheesy, bad B-movies, do yourself a favor and rather rewatch the first one."

This movie does not give any fear or chills like the first 2 films. There's maybe like 2 jump scares but that's about it. This is definitely the last Jeepers Creepers film that's going to be on the big screen and I'll put money on it.

The storyline is just so poorly executed and the script will make you either laugh or cringe. Do not waste your time watching this movie. You will be disappointed. I am astounded it made it to the cinema and I genuinely hope there are no more if this is the standard. If you thought the 3rd one was bad, this is even worse. Injustice to the original.

The acting, the directing, the story , the creeper's makeup and the creeper himself. The problem with this movie is that everyone who worked on it seem to have no clue about the franchise . The general vibe and set of the movie is not related to the franchise by any means this is mixed with how bad the acting was. I dont know are these people even know what acting is . These actors and actresses convinced me that this was a bad youtube parody its not even close to a good youtube parody .\n\nThe creeper: what is that? Really what are you doing ? The guy who played the creeper in that movie deserves the worst actor award and he wont win it because he is so bad that they will exclude him and give it to someone else . The creeper was so goofy and funny . The guy who played the creeper apparently didnt read or watch anything about the creeper to know how to act properly . The make up also is sooooo bad the creeper looks dump at best and the people who were in the cinema with me laughed at how bad his face looked.\n\nThere's alot to say about this movie but im lazy and i wrote enough but the thing is as a true fan of this franchise and as a man who grow up watching the first 2 jeepers creepers and how the 2 movies remind me of parts of my childhood. This movie is a slap to my face and i hope i really hope the franchise can be managed and worked on by better people. No hate but all who worked on this movie need to be removed including the director if they plan to do a future sequels and i hope they let the franchise rest for awhile to get the proper team to make a proper JC . Respect the fans and the creeper because you done both dirty with this one ."

And its so blurry in the background you can tell its a studio.\n\nI wanted to leave the theatre from the very beginning but i kept myself busy watching. People left.\n\nApart from that, the script, the characters dont sell the story.\n\nIf i could make it short for you: this movie is terrible and i could give it 0/10 i would."

I barely could finish the movie . This movie killed the creeper off literally. Makes JC3 an Oscar worthy movie, at least part 3 felt like a creeper movie. This film (if you can call it that) is a big slap in the face to any fan and just disrespectful to the character. So if any of the crew is reading this. Pat yourself on the back, job well done on setting the new standard of how bad a movie can be! Sorry not sorry. Just don't bother watching this at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Visually, this film is the perfect candidate for several nominations for the Golden Raspberry or anti-Oscar awards, although it may be attractive, the reality is that it has too many points against it. From my humble opinion, this director should not make movies again and he should continue directing commercials and advertising whose works are more impeccable than this one. Jeepers Creepers Reborn is packed to the brim with very bad digital effects, if we learned anything from the third film it is that it is a franchise where computer generated effects detract from the quality of the film instead of adding to it, well that is something that Jeepers Creepers Reborn returns to to confirm. The performances are lousy, I'm even surprised that Dee Wallace lately lends his talent to mediocre productions like this one. The entire cast has flaws except for Jarreau Benjamin who could be a good Creeper and replacement for Jonathan Breck but poor production affected the vision of his character. There are story points that are unoriginal and make no sense, the movie is very incoherent and makes its predecessor (Jeepers Creepers 3) look like an enjoyable movie. I give a big shout out to the entire makeup and prop making team who really did a good job but the direction taken by Timo Vuorensuela makes their work sadly unattractive in the film. Mr. Vuorensuela I wish you could answer my questions. Was there a need to make a cemetery in CGI? Was there a need to make the walls of the rooms CGI? Was there a need for so much CGI? He both boasted and described on his blog that the movie was shot on location in London and USA but it really doesn't look like that. I give it the minimum rating because unfortunately there is no 0."

First, the ending of the 3rd one Tresh said she will kill it, she is nowhere to be found in this one. Second, what's their deal with bad actors and actresses? Seriously i don't understand why. Third, the sound effects... we're not in the 90s please stop it. Fourth, the creeper looked better in the FIRST part!!! How could something that was made 20 years ago looks more real and better than NOW! 2022!! And i'm sorry how could you make a cemetery not look scary? A CEMETERY????\n\nAll being said, i knew it would be trash after the 3rd one, but i had little hope and wanted to see whats gonna happen to the creeper, surprisingly it's worst than all of the first parts, it reminded me of low budget YouTube movies. The idea of the monster itself is new and amazing, but the execution is a disaster. It should be illegal to make a fifth part.\n\nLiterally nothing is good, NOTHING."

After watching this new one however it makes those first three look like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's a horror movie that fails in almost every aspect to craft on screen. The story is the most cliched meandering thing that could be put out. The characters are dull and uninteresting with even some more stereotypical than a joke book. The Kills are the most generic & uninventive you could ever think up. The Creeper himself while I never thought was ever anything special has now been downgraded both personality and makeup wise to a cookie cutter overpowered lame slasher. Not to mention they tried throwing in this sadistic cult that worships him and it's never explored further. I was also pretty baffled at just how this movie is not ashamed in showing it's ugliness. There's a great deal of very phoney green screen that almost made me believe this movie was made by full moon pictures. It's obvious this movie wanted to go big but if you can't do it just don't bother. The only little bit of amusement I got from this movie was some costumes and set pieces at a Halloween party.\n\nI know the first three films director Victor Salva is a sick monster. But at least you can say he was a competent filmmaker with solid ideas. The makers of this film supposedly want to do a trilogy but after how this turned out I don't see it happening. With all the horror movie villains getting fresh comebacks lately it doesn't seem like the Creeper will be rising back anytime soon after this atrocity."

Out the gate this movie just rehashes the original almost verbatim but does it like 100x worse. The moment the old man immediately puts together that the license plate says B Eating U is just a prime example of how lazy and rushed this whole movie feels.\n\nIf you have seen Wrong Turn 5 Bloodlines that is exactly what I compare this movie to. It's cheap, poorly written, and caters to the mindless with pointless off screen killings. There is no tension building in this movie, the story is paper thin and hardly progresses, the dialogue is God awful and the acting is not much better. Unlike the original two which I consider some of the best horror to ever hit the big screen, this takes all of what makes those good and completely throws them out.\n\nWho ever wrote and produced this has no right ever making a movie again. It is so rudimentary and stale it is beyond belief. Have they never taken any classes or produced a movie before? Nobody wants to see a creature just running around killing people for no reason for an hour and a half. Especially when the creature looks atrocious compared to the original and all the deaths are off screen! Hell this makes the third look amazing in comparison. Even though that movie was quickly written with a low budget in mind just to get the franchise moving again and did not deliver on any of it's promises. It at least had a story and was worth watching.\n\nFor the love of all things mighty do not even bother watching this. I'm warning you now coming from a huge fan. It even disappointed my super low expectations. Enough of these modern horror tripes and trying to come off as edgy. I had enough of these Halloween festivals gone wrong. Every low budget horror movie that comes out these days is rinse and repeat, you can tell them apart from a mile away and this is no different.\n\nThis is a complete disgrace to the Jeepers Creeper's franchise. I honestly wish people could separate the person from their art and allow Victor Salva to come back with the proper budget so we could get the end to the trilogy we all deserve. Sadly this does not look like it will ever happen. I thought this was going to be bad but I could have never dreamt it would be anywhere near this awful. This doesn't even belong on Syfy! And the CGI at the very end? What in the world was that? I am lost for words. Stay away from this cesspool!"

I'm simply putting down my honest opinion on Jeepers Creepers: Reborn.\n\nEver since watching the first movie about two decades ago, I have had a soft spot for the franchise and have remained a fan for two decades and counting by now. From the start, I was hoping for Jeepers Creepers: Reborn to be atmospheric and entertaining and didn't expect anything more due to the unknown cast and limited budget. This movie has delivered in both regards and even offered some additional quality that was unexpected.\n\nThe film's story is simple but efficient. It tells how young adult Chase desires to attend a niche horror convention known as Horror Hound Festival with his skeptical but supportive girlfriend Laine. Chase nervously prepares to propose to his beloved girlfriend while she learns that she is pregnant. The couple wins a fixed competition at the convention that allows them to participate in an escape room activity connected to a mysterious urban legend. Things take a grisly turn when members of the television team that accompanies them go missing. The couple and its companions soon realize that they are trapped in a gigantic mansion and that something very dangerous is inside with them.\n\nOn the film's positive side, this movie has a creepy atmosphere from the opening scenes with the sympathetic elderly couple to the flick's final showdown involving the titular character. The film doesn't rely on predictable jump scares but instead works with gloomy lighting techniques, sinister locations and ominous soundtrack. This movie is also pleasantly entertaining in its concise length. The opening scenes go by in a heartbeat and reference the franchise's first film charmingly. The introduction to the film's main characters is just long enough to develop them properly without drifting off into boring stereotypes. The scenes at the festival are colourful, eclectic and memorable. The passages at the cemetery are without any lengths and increase the film's vibrant atmosphere a few notches. The concluding finale at the mansion is creative, detailed and intense. The film has a satisfactory conclusion and then the credits already start rolling. I wouldn't have added or cut anything to or from this film as director Timo Vuorensola deserves praise and recognition for an expert job under challenging circumstances. Other elements that deserve praise in my opinion are the two protagonists who complete each other perfectly and make for a believable, charming and sympathetic couple you want to root for. The acting performances might not earn the cast any nominations or awards at film festivals but they are doing surprisingly solid jobs for this kind of movie genre. The plot also deserves some respect as several side elements such as the references to the first entry in the franchise, the male protagonist's objective to get engaged to his girlfriend and the female protagonist's surprising discovery that she is pregnant are diversified, entertaining and sympathetic. As you can read, this movie has enough strengths to warrant a positive rating.\n\nHowever, there are obviously also a few downsides. The story around the titular character is obviously quite predictable. The film itself is lacking scary or even shocking moments and could have been slightly more intense and sinister. The movie's low budget is visible in some special effects and would certainly have benefitted from a more generous production. However, all those flaws are relatively small and won't prevent franchise fans from enjoying this film to the fullest.\n\nAs you can read, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn is a very decent atmospheric horror movie that should certainly please fans of this particular franchise and independent horror cinema of the twenty-first century in general. Ignore the masses of pessimistic reviews and give this film a fair chance. A trailer might actually give you a good idea whether this film lives up to your expectations or not. In my personal case, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn is a positive surprise and while it can't compete with the first entry, it certainly equals and even outclasses parts of the second and third movie in the franchise. I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to read my review until the end and given it a rating."

The acting and CGI were horrible. I do not understand what the vision was for this specific movie. The director spoke at the beginning of the movie and said production was halted due to Covid-19 but then continued later. It is appalling to think they had more time on this movie and this was the end result. This truly was an unnecessary addition to the franchise and pales in comparison to the previous Jeepers Creepers movies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."

Please, please stop taking loved and established characters and ruining them with crazy new twists. \"Prey\" is a perfect example of how to flesh out a well known subject, this debacle is an example of how to glue it to a carpet then run a lawnmower over it. I will warn any fans to avoid this even though I know you won't, because I watched it in the faint hope everyone was wrong, they're not, this is thoroughly crap, a money grab using someone else's original idea and talent."

I am so sorry, but the acting was unbearable. The pretending grunting in pain, the pretend crying, the lack of chemistry, oh boy. My expectations were really not that high, but this was a total surprise and not in a good way. How can a movie be this bad? Don't waste your time!"

Thankfully, no Victor Salva.\n\nVerdict\n\nI was surprised to see another Jeepers Creepers film appear, I'd assumed it was a dead series but when I heard Salva wasn't involved again I pondered whether this would give Jeepers Creepers the renewal it badly needed.\n\nHere we see a return to the formula, it doesn't really deviate, it sticks to the standard cliched'd structure you'd expect and delivers us a very underwhelming, lackluster and forgettable tale while at the same time trying to implement new lore which works about as well as the voodo stuff did with the Halloween franchise.\n\nReborn isn't bad, it's just so uninspired it makes me wonder why they even bothered. A series I've never been a fan of anyway, this fourth installment makes s me think maybe the Creeper should be laid to rest beside his creator.\n\nRants\n\nHow to save the creeper? He's never going to reach infamous horror icon status at this rate. What could save him? Decent writers, a bit of originality, maybe a reboot, or how about a vs film? Creeper vs Voorhees? Creeper vs Chucky? Creeper vs Pinhead? I usually like those types of thing but I'll admit those are terrible ideas. RIP Creeper, I'll be very surprised if he gets a 5th film.\n\nBreakdown\n\nA few entertaining moments Dee Wallace is always great Very generic Plays it very safe New lore is terrible."

The writing is atrocious they couldn't even be bothered to follow the original series how hard is that. Instead they combine haunted house, coven, escape room and whatever else they saw recently into a Jeepers Creepers movie. How hard is it to write something like this. I mean the original films were trash but they look like masterworks compared to this... 99% of movies and shows suck today because the writers suck. They literally do not know how to write anything even in a semi-competent manner. Unwatchable. What a disaster this is."

        "review_detailed_main": "It isn't Jeepers Creepers without Victor Salva at the helm, directing it. Jeepers Creepers is Salva's baby, why someone else is given the director's seat is a mystery. Salva's The Nature Of The Beast 1995 remains his best contribution along with Rites Of Passage 1995 and the cult horror film Clownhouse starring my favorite actor Sam Rockwell(The Green Mile 1999, Moon 2009). He is an accomplished director that can weave wonders onto the screen. He is an A-grade Hollywood director.\n\nBut a sex scandal and conviction and imprisonment cut short his career for a while. Afterwards he was never the same. He fell out of grace when he was at his best. We cannot judge him. We can only appreciate what he gave to the film industry as a whole: some terrific movies.\n\nBack to his film. It is about a creature(or demon or a fallen angel) that reappears during a fixed cycle to feed itself from parts chosen from a select and particular group of people it senses fear from. The first two movies reinforce this idea. The third film tried to get into its origins but failed in my belief. Nothing was explained into the origins of the creeper. We are still shrouded in mystery. The fourth installment goes \"nowhere\".\n\nAn interracial couple Chase(Imran Adams) and Laine(Sydney Craven) are heading to the Horror Hound Festival, when Laine begins to experience unexplained premonitions and disturbing visions associated with the town's past, and in particular, local legend the Creeper. Soon they are joined by the Creeper himself, hell-bent on getting his quota of victims. This then is the premise of Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, a feeble attempt at rebooting a franchise that has a cult following.\n\nVerdict: atrocious acting, direction and bad C. G. I. Will make you want to leave the theater altogether. If Salva saw this mess and I bet he did, he'd want to distance himself as far as possible from this. He is too great a director to associate himself with laughable projects like these.\n\nYou may also like Pumpkinhead 1988 and The Unnamable 1988 if you haven't seen these already."

It had the feeling of having had the crap edited out of it, and at just over 80 minutes long, it probably did. The opening sequence was not explained well, and seemed disjointed from the movie. In fact the whole movie felt disjointed, with half baked ideas not fully realised. Nothing really happens for the first half of the movie, it almost had a made for TV feeling about it. One person disappears just about at the beginning of the film, and apart from a \"Where are you?\" comment, seems to get forgotten for the rest of the film. There are a few deaths early on, but none are shown on camera, just hands grabbing someone then a puddle of blood. I'm not a big gore lover, but in a movie like this it's part of the fun. The ending is predictable, all in all one to avoid."

This one looks more like he belongs in Hellworld. He looks a little worse for wear when he comes out of his 23 year shell. This Creeper is not nice looking like Breck's. This ones kind of spiny. The Creeper cult was a little much but they've done that before. The new Creeper was after a bride, sadly he doesn't get one. Monsters always want a human bride. Usually disappointing when they don't get one. This Creeper was also oddly built, can't quite explain. The people could have cared less about. The ending was quite bad too, could have done that alot better. Hope they make more!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first two Jeepers Creepers films are awesome, especially the superior sequel Jeepers Creepers 2, but the 3rd film was horrendous & now we have an even cheaper looking Jeepers film with the rebooted REBORN.\n\nNow, Jeepers Creepers 2 is still my favourite of the franchise because it's so much fun but Reborn is fun in it's own scrappy way.\n\nI totally understand why they rebooted this Horror franchise in order to get away from the disturbing stigma of the previous sicko director. So I'm fine with a remake but the Creeper he doesn't look as good as the older creeper but still not terrible or anything just a cheaper version. Yes this is definitely a very low-budget film & that's fine, i love B-movies & i think they did fairly well here with it's shoddy making. One thing for sure is it's pretty much straight into the monster action & we see the creeper waking up from it's hibernation & that was very cool. It was nice seeing a little cameo from the great Dee Wallace, she's Horror movie royalty. I liked how the film starts as if it's a complete remake of the first & then it flips to it's an episode of something like it's Unsolved Mysteries or something & we first meet our two leads watching it while traveling to Lousiana for a Horror festival. Our two main characters are lovers Chase & Laine & are both decent characters actually. Chase is obsessed with the Creeper legend & within this universe the first three Jeepers Creepers films are just that, films & not real. I liked how this film is set over Halloween & as said the Creeper is decent looking & moves well but just not as good as he is in the first two original films. Imran Adams who plays Chase is actually pretty good in the role & I've only ever seen him in the silly t.v drama series Hollyoaks. Adams plays Chase as a fun horror fan & a full-on geek about the Creeper legend & that made him such a different character for a Horror flick than the usual boring types.\n\nOne main problem with it's low-budget is it's artificial look that it often has because of it's cheap CGI & blue screen stuff & it's very noticeable. The horror festival scenes are well done & the escape room, which is a huge old decrepit house where the Creeper hunts & eats his victims & is basically fed people by his Cult fan club. I did like the chilly woods scenes with the Creeper in that environment & i liked the nighttime scenes in the graveyard with it's glowing full moon, it all looks very old fashioned gothic but at the same time you can see it's green screen being used. I do think the production team did the best they could with what they had to work with. Probably the lowest budget of the Creeper films but it's definitely better than the terrible part 3 & it's a nice feeling to know that sicko director Victa Salva had nothing to do with this movie & so we don't get the perverse look at young mens bodies lol that littered part 2. Yeah those pointless shirtless scenes were just weird, Victor loves young men without tops on.\n\nAlthough the Creeper isn't as neat as the original creation the art that went into him here is still damn decent. This version of the Creeper is more a mouldy brown colour rather than grubby green & he looks more evil here in a darker, more menacing way. Also there's a side plot about sinister satanic cults & voodoo, that doesn't get fully explained or explored. Lets hope there's a sequel to dig deeper into the mythology more. Reborn is a shoddy film but it's cheap 'n' cheerful in a way & definitely a fun direct-to-video horror. I enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nThe kills are nothing special at all but the new locations are pretty cool & set over Halloween is definitely a bonus as all the other films are set over summertime.\n\nThe two main character are decent & the actors do give it their all but of course we get those that make stupid decisions & stuff that just wouldn't work but all in all Reborn was a fun little horror cheapie & i would actually like to see a sequel."

No Jeepers Creepers movie should be like this. The first, with it's big open roads, made for such a claustrophobic environment despite it's landscape. Here....nothing.\n\nThe opening showcases every beat of the original in five minutes with an appearance by Dee Wallace. And it's all downhill from there.\n\nSuddenly The Creeper is just your standard slasher character and will target anyone, especially pregnant women, because that's a thing now. Clearly A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: Dream Child never taught us anything.\n\nThe less said about special effects, the better. By the end, most people will have checked out. The Creeper suddenly seems to have some sort of cult doing his bidding which is never brought back up again.

The story wasn't set up to take place after the 2nd movie, if so the director didn't watch it, the new creeper is garbage, J. B was way better. Jarreau's movements, acting & new look/makeup don't hold up to what we are used to. This is far worse then the 3rd one, it feels lazy and cheap. The acting is laughable, the casting was dreadful and the story was dumb. I feel bad for Victor Salva, they took his creation and destroyed it. The effort behind it reminds me of the new Texas chainsaw movie but worse.\n\nDon't listen to these clowns who go on about how great it was to offset the low ratings, just because it has horror elements. These guys are what's wrong with the rating system, they don't know what a good movie is. Sure it has blood and weapons and his truck but if that's all you need for a good movie then sure maybe this is for you. Also its not a reboot, its a continuation, this goes to show how knowledgeable some people are. There's a reason its getting a 1 rating across the board, at the end of the day look at the people who took the time to give feedback on how bad it was instead of just rating it, it's a warning.\n\nI would have given this movie 0/10 if I could. I love horror so much but seems like everyone says that these days so take this at face value or don't but at least I can say you've been warned. Maybe you're that one person who will like it and everyone else is crazy. Good luck."

Although part one and two of the title were really great with some real touch of horror and creepy elements. Will never recommend this one!\n\nHorror genre is no more what it used to be! We hardly get a few handful of great horror movies year-round. The basic idea is same and still old-fashioned for all: an evil figure will haunt and terrorise a given group of friends or a creepy home. Originality and creativity is what we are really missing. Horror may contain a mixture of sci-fi, western and other genres which will certainly produce original and fresh content."

The plot made no sense, and the creeper looked so stupid I'd rather if they just never showed his face and kept it a mystery. The beginning was promising but then once it got to the voodoo shop it was just down hill from there. Some actors were okay but most of them were pretty bad. The cgi and film locations were horrible. The movie was so bad I would've preferred if they'd kept it old school and filmed in remote places with a hand held camera Save your money and just leave the franchise alone."

Like, LAUGHABLY bad. Most of the time I doubted a single cast member was ever on set, or even in the same room as anyone else. Sure, some CGI was bad, but check out the hilarious backgrounds.\n\nFor some odd reason, every 23 years there a severe massacre for 23 days and yet no one documents this so no one will believe it whenever the 23 years are up. You MUST get past this huge plot hole to \"enjoy\" this movie.\n\nThe Waving, Smiling Creeper is back. No, not Harvey. Not Kevin. Not even Donald, who incidentally is even more evil that the title character. It's up to a group of Film School Rejects and a First Draft of a Script to take on the villain.\n\nThis entire movie is so amateurishly made, I feel bad for the creators. Someone really needed to tell them to slow down or stop before making such an embarrassment as this. And I haven't even touched on the ending.\n\nThere's another part 4 that mirrors this film's climax. I'll give you a hint: The Shark is seeking Revenge in the Bahamas. While Jeepers Creepers: Reborn's ending CGI is hysterical, you will LAUGH YOUR ARSE OFF with the final blow. I had to rewind it a couple of times since I couldn't believe my eyes or stop laughing.\n\nAdmittedly, there was one fairly decent character (or an actor who didn't know what movie he was in): the aging actor, a couple of jump scares were effective and it's always nice to see Dee Wallace. But, none of these constitute a recommendation. SKIP THIS and let it die for at least another 23 years.\n\n***\n\nFinal Thoughts: Much like the Jaws series, each one of the Jeepers Creepers got progressively worse. Though, honestly, I can't remember a thing about part 3. Still, I think 4 is worse."

The first 2 movies aren't much but they were entertaining while Jeepers Creepers 3 was a complete waste... The problem with JCR, beyond an uninteresting and very elaborate plot, is the fact of the excess and oversaturation of digital effects... Mr. Vuorensuela, we know that it is your first horror project, but if that is the best that your talent can do, this doubt . I have no problems with the new design of the creeper because the JC3 latex suit was much worse, however it is not to the liking of many fans and it was obvious how the appearance of the monster caused laughter in the movie theater instead of terror... I relapse again THE WORST OF THIS MOVIE IS THE ABUSE OF POOR QUALITY CGI! Jeepers Creepers' settings are organic and rural and the fact that the director resorted to creating many of them with CGI ruined everything."

The story was written in 1 month and the movie was recorded and had the \"best parts that made it into the movie\" edited in 1 week max. I've never seen a movie with this much (and bad) cgi. It's amazing how low can you go if you wish to dissapoint the fans. The series will go on, probably, but i realy can't watch another piece of garbage like this one. This was 1.5 hours that i will never recover. Advice for producers: if you can't make something good, please let it go while it is stil good, like JC2."

        "review_detailed_main": "A young couple travel to a horror festival in the area of Louisiana that's infamous for the legendary Creeper. When the actual creature awakens, all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe Jeepers Creepers Intellectual Property (IP) had basically been 'cancelled' due to the sexual crimes of the mastermind of the franchise, which paved the way for this reboot, \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" (2022). It was made by a small studio in England trying to make a quick buck off the IP. This resulted in the production company of the two previous installments filing a property fraud lawsuit.\n\nThe best thing about the franchise is the Creeper, which is reminiscent of the chief gargoyle in \"Gargoyles\" (1972), just mixed with Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. While people praise the first movie from 2001, it was hindered by its limited cast and Gina Philips was only serviceable on the feminine front. The second one from 2003 tried to make up for it with a whole busload of kids (plus three school employees), but it generally dropped the ball in the female department and, worse, focused a little too much on shirtless jocks, which can be explained by the writer/director's issues (get real). There was also zero depth beyond an evil winged creature attacking a busload of youths.\n\nThe third film from 2017 was hampered by an unnecessarily convoluted opening and the Creeper now had an eye-rolling 'Mystery Machine' with built-in weapons and defenses. The latter took away from the sense of genuine horror, but it provided the opportunity for some slasher thrills. In addition, Gabrielle Haugh was the best heroine up to that point.\n\nSo, here we are with this fourth installment, which is almost universally reviled. I agree that the story could be more compelling and the flick relies too much on CGI, but it has several highlights: Sydney Craven is easily the top heroine so far; there's exposition on the demonic creature being reborn as a little Creeper; the Horror Hound Festival is a great milieu in the second act; the idea of occultic people worshipping the creature, as well as supplying victims, is interesting; and the story basically ends up being a cabin-in-the-woods flick.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't take full advantage of its positives. Sydney Craven could've been utilized even better (not tawkin' 'bout nudity or sleaze) and the horror festival setting could've been milked for more entertainment. Still, there's enough good here to make it my favorite of the tetralogy.\n\nIt runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot at Black Hangar Studios in Lasham, which is a little over an hour's drive southwest of London.\n\nGRADE: B-/B."

Save your time by rewatching the first two instalments of the franchise because after watching this one, you really come to terms with the fact that the Jeepers Creepers movies have gone into a downwards spiral, getting worse and worse. Without the original director, I doubt the movies will ever come close to the elite level of the first two."

It would have been better, to write a script about how the creeper got this way. Yeah, a Prequel to Jeepers Creepers. Scenes with cult people, like that of \"Rosemary's Baby\" just wasn't interesting, to me. The main actors were just okay, not great.

Why in the world would you not bring the original Creeper back. The Guy who played the creeper in this movie was horrible! It's like having a 5 foot 4 guy play Jason?? The guy was hunched over most of the movie hiding under what appears to be a palm hat painted black. Such a HUGE waste of film. As soon as I saw that it wasn't the original Creeper I wanted to leave. His wardrobe and make up were just as terrible as his acting. BIG THUMBS DOWN! ALSO whats with not even playing the original music?? I mean I can go on and on.. The guy who made this movie should be banned. Make a movie with the original music and the original actor and I'll go see it, even if he's eating pancakes, I'll go see it.

I think it goes in a new direction, not always successfully, but in a new direction that is at least entertaining. The story is fleshed out some and while the bad guy creeper character is not as charming a bad guy as he was in the first two episodes, he is passable in this one. What makes the difference for me in this particular episode is the lead actress Sydney craven. I think she held her own very well and her boyfriend character was also very good. Several of the supporting characters are quirky enough to be entertaining. All in all not the worst hour and a half I've ever spent and in comparison to the third film, it's a masterpiece! In comparison to the first two, eh, not so bad. Admittedly, they were difficult acts to follow. On it's own, a decent film."

It's a weird mix between I Know What You Did Last Summer and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The worst thing about the movie is the CGI that told this \"director\" that the movie looked good with so many bad effects, but what can you expect from the director of Iron Sky. Screen Media Films is screwing up Jeepers Creepers, what a lousy job and handling of the franchise they're doing. The plot doesn't make sense, it's incoherent and it moves away from what was established in the first movies... This doesn't look like Jeepers Creepers the movie if you change the title and the image of the creeper wouldn't look like cheap slasher work from another creature but the truth is that it is disappointing. Jeepers Creepers Reborn is the best example that sometimes movies made with a mobile camera have even better quality... I don't recommend it\n\nJarreau Benjamin is the only good actor in the film, but perhaps the design that was chosen for The Creeper is not exactly the best, it is understood that the design emulates the art of Kewber Ball from some comic book covers but by bringing that design to the movies Well, it just didn't work and it's a mistake."

IMO the people with one and two \u2b50 even three and four \u2b50 aren't actual Jeepers Creepers fans or they've never seen a Jeepers Creepers movie before.

Thought....they've got rid of the sicko director and all his nasty fiddling crimes, starting fresh. May be good. Right.\n\nWRONG.\n\nPoor Dee Wallace. Admired her work in the 80s. Great actress. And her scene at the start was bearable. Only thing that was.\n\nI'm unsure where to start with this film, there's so much wrong with it.\n\nThe script. Simply poor. Almost no attempt at a real story. Two main characters who seem like strangers to each other, clearly uncomfortable around each other, know nothing about each other at all yet supposedly about to get engaged!? Wth! Zero chemistry between them. Arely tolerable acting chops and a 'plain' female who is clearly intended to be hot and sexy (failed) with a geeky nerd boyfriend.\n\nIt's impossible le to not notice the Incredibly poor green screen environments and backgrounds. So low quality and look straight out of a cheap kids tv show in the 80s. How could they think that was passable as!? Surely when editing it they must have thought.....'we can't release these scenes, they look terrible'.\n\nI've seen far higher quality 'fanfilms' than this mess.\n\nEveryone involved would do well to take their names from the credits.\n\nThink I'm exaggerating? Then by all means fill ya boots but don't say you weren't warned about it.\n\nLuckily I never paid to see this or I'd demand my money back. I did lose 90mins of my time though.\n\nIt's shocking how a film this poor can get a release nowadays when so much is possible and cheaper.\n\nJeepers Creepers deserved so much better. Its a much loved couple of films, (slightly tainted by a sick criminal director) but a fantastic monster ......it deserves a studio putting its money where its mouth is and doing it right with a competent crew on board. Then see the money come in. Not going to fool the fans with dross like this.\n\nEpic fail and the people who made the decisions should be sacked."

Honestly looked like a video game other then the characters.

Maybe one day i will watch it but i digress.\n\nThis movie establish that the first 3 movie are basically \"based on the creeper legend\" and not in continuity with this. Like they exist in this universe. So yes there is change to the lore and the creature but why not? Its meant as a kinda soft reboot in a way.\n\nWatching this close to Halloween as i did definately help because it has a pretty thematic first half. Yes the festival look more like a college party you may say, without much attendees, but the costumes are pretty cool, the atmosphere etc.\n\nWithout going into spoilers the \"killing field\" has some pretty cool yet basic locations. There is a few issues tough. The first one is the color grading and CGI. I am not talking about kills per say or gore but rather the overall tone. Its clear that the sky is CGI, the color grading is way too bright for at night, and yes they do show the moon in the sky but cmon lets be real, no moon shine THAT bright.\n\nWhen it comes to kills, some are off screens but you do see some and like i said the gore and blood was fine. Its nothing super original or insanely great, but its done well enough.\n\nIts hard for me to judge the acting because its one of those VVS terrible french translation, wich i guess is the price to pay to watch a movie in my language when its a low budget. I am pretty sure 2 characters were dubbed by the same actor as well barely changing his voice. And if you are french in Quebec, you will recognize these voices in many many...MANY VVS productions.\n\nOverall its a low budget horror and it show a bit, but its not awfull at all. If you can move over the color grading and questionable \"background cgi\" its actually a solid effort. Won't be a cult classic by any means but was fun to watch at 11pm in Halloween season."

        "review_detailed_main": "Young, wistful, enthusiastic but oh so uneducated in the wiles of delivering, and more importantly understanding, what makes a classic horror film. The \"How to Butcher a Classic 101\" class has just graduated. As other reviewers have already conceded, and most admittedly are likely casual film watchers and appreciators rather than bona fide filmmakers, trying to lay open all the errors, omissions, technical inadequacies, and downright gaffs that were made in the process of bringing this to the screen, could fill a tome the size of Plato's Illiad. A word to the wise - the great villains of original horror remain in the shadows for the best part of 2/3 (ish) of a movie's run time, maybe emerging briefly over the films course to raise the tension, but NEVER in a manner that reveals so much that the fear, anticipation, and downright surprise, is lost. Even when you know who the villain is and what's at stake. Look at Aliens (okay not a horror per se, but was it exciting? Even though you knew who the villains were?). It's all about building to a climax - as in most things. Sequels, prequels, re-imaginings, reworkings, remakes all (and I mean in terms of recent franchises) seem to have forgotten this one, important, nay almost singularly most critical, point of storytelling; never reveal the source of the fear until the audience is so engrossed they cannot help but watch for the outcome. Alien is a classic example of this. The Thing, Halloween (original), The Howling etc etc etc. All classics without peer. Because screenwriters, and filmmakers knew then what made people tick. The fundamental failing of horror franchises today is in capitulating to what they perceive as an audience call for kill-count irregardless of story, plot, or character motivation. But that's not what entertains the majority; that's an unassailable fact. It's story, suspense, fear of the unknown, the unseen, the darkness - core human fears that have existed since the beginning of man's time on earth. That is why today's executives who greenlight these woeful, under-developed, derivative, kill-count focused insults to the classics, will never support anything that seems like it's a 'throw-back' to decades past ie. Good, solid, original, developed, and story-focused that tap into primal fears. They have been fed dross, blood, gore, violence without cause, and now doing what they know through nurture, feed the rest of us the same slop. Somehow, somewhere, someone needs to get a firm hand on all this and go back to the basics, to the historically accepted methods and modes of storytelling that have been in existence since before the time of Aristotle. It isn't about changing the shape of the wheel, only the material the wheel is made of. It's about feeding audience expectation but in an unexpected way. It's so simple. Sadly, the young studio executives of today, and the filmmakers they exalt, seem to think changing the wheel shape makes them an auteur and worthy of admiration. The wakeup they all need is that the opposite is true. Jeepers Creepers: Reborn was bad in sooooo many ways, not least in its awful script. The writer should hang his/her/their head in shame. The executive who read it and thought 'yep, this one's ready to go' needs sacking. Cos he/she/they've just cost the studio/investor a good few quid that they'll never, and yes you know it, never get back. It wasn't worthy of being called a production ready script (and I know, cos I write, and have done for 25 years) - by at least another ten drafts. And that's being optimistic. Lighting, camera, sound, VFX (so much bad greenscreen it made my eyes hurt), production design, direction, and performances - all were dismally woeful and so much less than the original story deserved as a follow up. A director's primary job on set is to get the actors to deliver - to elicit believable, truthful presentation of character. That's a skill not everyone has. Clearly this director doesn't have it either. Dee Wallace, what were you thinking? When the foundation of your movie isn't properly formulated is it any wonder that everything else built upon it is shaky? Whilst they've butchered Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, TCM, Carrie, The Hills Have Eyes, IKWYDLS, with re-imaginings and some with untold numbers of sequels, this one, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn stands out as one of the worst to date IMHO. And I wouldn't be at all amazed if, as a franchise, it is subsequently consigned to the annals of history as a golden opportunity that went wide, oh so very wide, of the classic quality mark. Oh boy, can I get a refund on the time I've lost?!"

And really? A cult plot line? Does every horror franchise need a cult plot at some point? Acting? HA. These \"actors\" are worse than sharknado. No. I'm serious. And what the F is with this white bird? Ooooooo it's scary cause it's not black like the other birds. Give me a break. Crazy thing is it seems they cut alot out of this movie cause behind the scenes video shows alot more at the actual festival. Can't imagine it was worse than what we got but then again this director made iron sky. If you've seen Hallowen: the curse of Michael Myers than this whole baby plot isn't new. It sure is terrible though.\n\nAll in all, don't watch it. Maybe someone with an ounce of talent will make a real Creeper movie one day. Till then looks like it's this cheap knockoff crap.

The creeper was; well creepy and the films had some great actors and moments.\n\nI was looking forward to seeing the new 4th instalment of the franchise.\n\nSadly- this movie was absolutely terrible. I was bored to tears in 20 min- the creeper looks silly and not scary like it's predecessor. The CGI bizarre background effects are so cheesy and awful looking, the story is far more bizarre and totally not in line with the others so it makes zero sense! Ugh! When re-doing a franchise you have to really bring your \"A\" Game- this movie didn't and then some.\n\nRun far away from this movie!"

I'm not even sure where to start. The story line starts off terribly. I mean come on, nor everyone can be original but can you at least have a brain to not try to be something it's not. This kind of movie has me constantly thinking that I could grab my home video camera and do something so much greater than this garbage. Some might think I'm kidding but I'm not.. if any one movie could give me inspiration to direct a movie it would be this cuz anyone with a brain could make a better movie. The director should never ever get a chance to make a movie or have a budget after this garbage. It's sad that people like this director even gets a shot at making a movie for us to watch. I have seen so many bad movies but this by far is worst movie I have ever seen. I saw the imdb rating at 2.5. How is that even possible!?? It means there were a few that rated it over 2.. those people clearly have never seen a movie in their lifetimes. This was bad."

While it isn't as good as the first and second movie in terms of development and plot and and storyline, it is a jeepers creepers movie. I like the angle that they use based on the location being in Louisiana they do stay true to that area and I like the lead characters I like the supporting characters I think it works well. I did like the jeepers creepers with the high school team in the bus and then getting picked off one by one that was cool. This one was kind of in the same vein, but it had a lot of modern elements to it. And included cosplay and included raves I guess and it was kind of you know around the Halloween dress up theme. I think if you're looking for something entertaining to watch and you have a little bit of time to watch it because the movie is not that long. I think the movie could have been another 30 minutes longer but That's not really a big deal. There was something at the end of the movie that I have questions about which wasn't answered and I think that's the only flaw that I really found but you know it has elements of Sex appeal in there which is nice, and the creeper is pretty much the same as he was in the first couple movies. It is definitely better than the third one in my opinion , so don't not watch this movie based on the bad reviews see it for yourself have fun with it because it's better than a bunch of horror movies that are out there on Amazon, prime and Netflix."

The two sequels aren't as good, but still somewhat enjoyable.

I do however, love how the creeper developed new abilities while hibernating over the years, more specifically the dog whistle ability. I scream laughed when he did that. The acting was genuinely terrible, and everything jeepers Creepers did to be scary was actually funny. I've never laughed through a horror movie until now.

I hope I can wake up next morning and forget it that The jeepers creepers has not released new movie. The acting the idea and the graphics are so horrible It makes you wanna leave fast. Even the jeepers creepers himself looks horrible like they order him from AliExpress. I hope nobody will watch this movie and they will remove it once and forever, because it's really a shame to watch such a movie with such a good name.\n\nThanks."

Everything dark and fake. The kills looks tacky. The whole idea of human form of creeper? Not to get me started by the look and act of creeper, he's so dark? His love and classic look of creeper is entirely gone! Obviously not the original cast. Man worst movie of the year. Let's just be happy the original 2 always gonna be here but just no more!

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw the rating for this I thought this can't be right. But it was even worse than the third one. It was so bad that the owners of the original Jeepers song didn't have it on this version. The FX was bad...I mean 1980s bad. You could see some fuzziness at times around the people as they stood in front of the green screen.\n\nLet's start with the cast, first they had to do the traditional white girl dating black guy. In the beginning I used to say people were too whiny about this trope but they have a point, it is used way too much. Second, the woman looked old with makeup to cover it, I looked up her ag and she is only about 30 so she has a rough old age coming. She was not believable as a \"scientist\", which was something they had to remind us of. She was barely able to act. The boyfriend...Well, what can I say except they made him out to be a comic book nerd. There was no compatibility to try and believe they were dating, let alone in love. I am betting if anything they barely got along on the set. The Jeepers creature was bad. It looked like a body suit instead of adding color and other things to the skin. He wouldn't be able to eat anything since I don't think I ever saw his mouth open wide enough to get anything past his fake teeth. The rest of the fillers were just pathetic stereotypes.\n\nThere was no dread or scariness like it was in past movies. It felt more like a stalker killing people then some supernatural demon. There was no scariness to the movie. Remove the blood and you could show this to kids. In previous Jeepers movie there was a feeling of scariness in the film.\n\nThe ending was the worst...Cops pull up to the house because? Who knows why they show up but the green screen really stood out. The cops get out of the car with guns drawn at the survivors, why? But then after 5 seconds they put them away and simply sit them in the seat of the car, why? They went from threat to victim in 5 seconds with not a word said. The worst actor was supposedly the one with the most acting credits. Either the makeup team did her no favors or she is going to look 60 when she hits 40. Oh and just a small irritation...Why do so many wear tiny dress with combat boot looking shoes?\n\nThis is not your original Jeepers Creepers. Usually they try and reverse a bad course after a bad installment (Jeepers 3) but this one looked like they wanted to compete with Jeepers 3 for worst and tadah...they won. Skip it if you do not want to ruin the franchise. You know how bad this reminds me? It remind me of Jaws 4. You know the one...It was the one where the shark checked online to see where its prey had booked a vacation and was able to follow them from the USA to the Bahamas."

After the original keepers creepers I've always wondered if there would be another one just as good. Unfortunately this one failed entirely and considering the budget, if the story line was half decent, this might have actually went somewhere. It's unfortunate I wasted my time and money on this trash, but highly rewarding considering how bad it is that it's worth a watch just to be screaming at the TV."

The exterior backdrop is clearly green screen with no blending between layers. The outside shots were clearly filmed during daylight and color corrected (poorly) to look like night time.\n\nIf the writing had been good, I could have overlooked the effects. But the writing wasn't good.\n\nThey kept trying to push some mystical/psychic/voodoo story line, but couldn't be bothered to explain it or flesh it out enough for it to make sense in the context of the movie.\n\nThe characters have a terrible habit of knowing nothing then knowing everything and sometimes in the same scene.\n\nThis was clearly just an attempt at a cash grab."

But this films biggest crime is the creeper himself, what have they done! The creeper was a horror icon from the first 2 films but they decided to basically change his entire look for this.\n\nTo sum up, don't waste your time or money on this rubbish.

None of the characters have a backstory, so there's no way to relate to them or form any attachment. Random strangers meet more strangers, bad things happen, creepy people are acting creepy, and the Creeper puts on his worst performance to date. JC3 was a masterpiece compared to this. JC: Reborn may have irreparably damaged one of the best, and most unique, horror movie creatures of all time. The story and effects are locked into a downward trend from beginning to end, the film is reminiscent of a 2005 straight-to-DVD movie by the time the credits roll - I've seen Zoom meetings with better virtual backgrounds. I will definitely be avoiding any films that these writers and directors touch moving forward. Maybe this movie can eat a few good movies and be reborn into something worth our time in the future."

Take the people kill them dump them in the shoot and do it again!! Like it was just bad!! Oh let's not talk about the makeup!!!! His fave wasn't even scary like the other one! I remember just by looking at the face I got chills!! It was just bad."

Outlandish decisions are made by characters without any sensible explanation being given as to why they would do something no sane, rational person would do. There are also sections which are atrociously and groan-worthily campy without being self-aware.\n\nThe only silver living in this movie is the actors.

For example, one of their group was killed, and a member of the group, inspecting the corpse, remarks that the wounds were fresh. Well, they had seen their friend less than five minutes ago, so I'm not sure that was a necessary observation.\n\nThere was virtually no exposition, and the characters were remarkably uncurious about this demonic creature chasing them. The Creeper didn't act in a way consistent with prior established patterns. The plot to defeat the Creeper was ridiculous and required the group to know things they couldn't know, and anticipate the behaviors of a creature that they couldn't possibly anticipate, and for a regular girl with no training to pull off moves like a member of Seal Team 6 that also used to be a ninja. And it still required a huge amount of luck.\n\nHonestly it felt like a group of high school students were given a decent budget and told to make a Jeepers Creepers movie. But only one of them had seen any of the prior installments, and he only sort of remembered the basics, but enough to get the gist of it."

And how is it that the first two Jeepers Creepers (2001 & 2003) has much better CGI twenty years ago?! Too bad the Director didn't have the skill, motivation or money to make a movie that wouldn't be only memorable for just how bad it is."

The beginning started off okay. I actually thought that the movie might be redeeming itself from the last jeepers creepers movie until I continued watching this crap!!! The acting sucked, the characters sucked, it just sucked!!! I really hope they don't make another one of these movies for crying out loud!!! I didn't even watch the movie to the end because it sucked that bad!!! Barffff!!!!"

I'm sure with a fraction of talent behind the camera the budget for this movie could have been spent on a tightly scripted movie in the same vein as 'Duel' but instead we're left with something that feels like it's from the early noughties - slow mo, sparsely populated neon 'rave' scene included.

This film has everything a bad movie should have. Bad acting, bad sets, no story.

The original was great, the next one not too bad, third not great and reborn sucks. Plot line was thin and they tried to use the Halloween season to add some spark but this could have worked but again it failed. Bringing voodoo in to the mix, again could have worked with the creeper but as previous poor writing let this idea go to waste. Not a film I will be watching again in a long while if at all and I'm a massive horror fan."

It's like they were given a decent budget, hired actors and directors from low budget independent films, and pocketed what was left.\n\nThis movie should have gone to someone else. Honestly, it would have probably been better in Rob Zombie's hands because this is something I could see in his wheelhouse. (Note: I don't really care for any of Rob Zombie's movies other than Halloween I and II, but I could see him doing better with this than whoever directed it.)\n\nIssues:\nSome parts were okay but there was a lot of garbage and cringey lines that just didn't need to exist. The story was just extremely low quality and lazily written, almost as if the people writing it had never watched the previous ones and had to base it off of what they heard.\n\nHahahaha! From beginning to end, the acting was terrible and felt like they were in their first movie or shooting one of those cheesy films where everyone's reactions to everything are over the top. Something you would see in an old sitcom.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that most of the people in this movie had little to no dialect training or experience with an American accent. You could tell their accents were from somewhere in the UK and doing the worst impressions of American accents I've ever heard. For a movie that is based in Louisiana, even the people that were supposed to be from there had garbage accents. The main characters should have at least been written as visiting the country to go to the horror-con and kept their original accents. Then pull a couple of people from Louisiana over to be in the movie or to at least give some pointers to. It would have made more sense to write it in a way that the Creeper migrated or was somehow moved to the UK and then start in a fresh location.\n\nThey are making a movie based in Louisiana and the characters are all supposed to be American or at least all have American accents. You would probably film the entire thing out in Louisiana with some minor green screen stuff here and there. From what I've read initial \"filming\" was done in Lousiana for THREE DAYS and then moved to the UK. They relied so much on green screen and other garbage that it made Sharknado look like Avatar.\n\nThere's more but this movie made me sick and I'm tired of talking about it. While writing this I changed the rating from a 2 to a 1.\n\n0 out of 10. Will never watch again."

I was miserable & in pain throughout the runtime.\n\nOverall, I suggest that you either watch it or don't watch it for as long as you live, because Jeepers Creepers: Reborn (2022) is easily the worst movie of 2022 & it is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life."

It's all just a waste of time I've never not been able to pay attention to a movie this bad before. Honestly wish I wouldn't have even wasted my time with this movie at all and felt the need to come give it a bad review as well even though I've never reviewed a movie on this app before lol."

        "review_detailed_main": "If I have to be honest as possible, I dont care if this even have a spoiler or not but im going to help you and tell you that you should not waste money on this nor your time. This movie was utter garbage and a huge disappointment. This movie feels and looks like it was made by some middle schooler. Most of the places on the movie looks and prolly is on green screen, the acting was utter caca, the script was terrible as well. There was NOTHING that related to the first movie or the way it was in the comics. This movie took its own turn and went off the cliff just offing its self. Honestly Jeepers creeper 2001 will forever be the best of the best. Top tier. Ahead of its own time for that matter and honestly I'm happy for it, because the fact this movie had to even exist in the first place. And to make things worse, WHY DID THEY MAKE A CULT FOR HIM!? That was never part of the story from the first movie and part of the comics which is also canon to everything. I'm telling you, this movie was and is utter poop, not worth the time and not worth your money. If there is anyone who disagrees with this, I can tell they for sure loved the JC3 by that means and calls it \"great\" even thought they never watched the first or second movie. Or ever read the comics as well. There's a lot of parts where everything is just done bad. The editing was done bad, the acting, the environment looks so fake like if it was done in the green screen, the fact jeepers creepers make up and everything else was done so so bad. The ending was so bad too and well ill let you see for yourself what i mean on how bad it was. All i can say is that the movie was terrible just like JC3 and the movie is not worth your money or time. If you wanna watch it, just watch it online and skip through it because im telling you its BAD alright."

Literally ANY part of that house would break if you kicked it, but still they could not escape, sad. Also incidentally where I stopped watching. I get this is really, really low budget, but taking a good standing franchise and having it ripped a new a-hole was not nice to see. Not Recommended."

The significance of the woman in the shop who was planning for the youngsters to be sacrificed was just lost once she locked the door. The film made you think that she was a part of it in a bigger way.\n\nThis is a prime example of a franchise that has been taken too far and it is now producing the usual horror crap just for the sake of it. The original 'Jeepers Creepers' although not a masterpiece, was original and quite scary.\n\nThis piece of trash isn't worth the time."

Is this girl supposed to have any sexual chemistry with him at all? Is this a festival or a trailer park hayride? Are these southern accents? Who designed this production? The amount of misused American slang is distracting. This festival is undercast and the main cast is overcrowded. There are 15-20 extras that repeatedly shown dancing to no music at all (but I'd be afraid to see what American music these British people would choose, so that's okay). Who are these random voodoo cult people? Jason and Michael Myers taught us that putting cults in a beloved franchise is always a bad idea. Did anyone actually study voodoo before they wrote this?\n\nThey spent the entire budget on flame throwing sideshow performers, bad wigs and identifiably American Halloween costumes. There's even a \"sexy\" costume montage to pretend that our lead actress has any sex appeal or chemistry with her costar. She literally doesn't even look at him in some scenes. He's so weak, annoying and corny that I can't picture him getting anyone pregnant, let alone this girl who treats him like a friend the entire time... She hates all of his ideas and he wants to marry her? Why do British 20 year olds look 30? The bad weather?\n\nWe haven't even gotten to the special effects, yet.\n\nThe fake scenery and sets lack all sense of atmosphere or realism. The Creeper's hands aren't even done when we first see him. They're clean human hands. The worms he eats aren't even placed into the scene realistically. They're literally store-bought fish bait, dumped on the ground and ready to eat in broad daylight. After 25 years, his entire outfit is magically ready on a scarecrow nearby and his truck is still in the same spot. The original lore of this creature is that he hunts people's body parts to replace his own dying body parts, but in this movie he is basically just using people as target practice while a Creeper cult hunts a boring pregnant girl. I'm only about 35 minutes into this movie and I've written more than enough to explain my rating."

The first and second jeepers creepers is one of my all time favorite horror movies this film was a let down and shouldn't have been released or have the name jeerpers creepers horrible it's just plain horrible. I'm so disappointed in this It honestly makes me sad because there probably won't be another one to come for years."

The plot is bad, the effects and make-up are terrible, the acting is mediocre.

She definitely has potential, with a more serious and better film that can shine her abilities as an actress. She has played in A Christmas Carol and I enjoyed that movie all the way through. This film definitely took advantage of her and I hope it does not prevent her from better chances to come.\n\nJarreau Benjamin may be a good actor, but his role as the creeper definitely hurt him here. I have not seen the other film he was in, so I cannot say for sure.\n\nImran Adams's character was basic, lame and downright ruined most of the storyline aside from Jarreau Benjamin's role as the creeper. I have not seen any of the other films he starred in, so maybe they just gave him a poor script. Who knows.\n\nAs for the rest of the case, most of them were over the top for no reason at all, should not of been had or for the case of Georgia Goodman who played Lady Manilla, was not used to full advantage that could of been had if those behind the scripting and production had even tried!\n\nThe writers, production crew, etc are all to blame for this nasty failure of what was once a great franchise. It might be very well time to scrap this entire project and stop trying to deliver new films for this franchise. The first three films were great, in my opinion, even though many hated or disliked the third installment, I know I enjoyed it myself.\n\nThis was a reboot and they tried changing way too much. They lost the original fans and many new ones on this one. They took a risk and lost it all here. It's amazing that this film had a $5 million dollar budget and they delivered us something of such low quality. Makes you wonder what they really wasted the money on. Drugs? Alcohol? Illegal activities..? Who knows, in the end there is almost no love left for this franchise. Time to do better or quit. And if this is the best that can be delivered, it's definitely time to quit for those behind the Jeepers Creepers franchise or hand over the mantle to someone with more skill."

I was really angry and I left it after 50 minutes, cause I was afraid to kill myself. I went into another movie and looked the second half of Smile...they killed this franchise damn..................."

Did the directors/producers of the first two films completely change because these last two films are 360 degrees the other way. Completely different atmosphere from the first two masterpieces. Its more funny than scary- thats the problem. This is a horror franchise. I think an origin story (which was first promised) would have been more appropriate and fitting. The plot makes no sense. And the creeper decided to lose 5 inches btw?? And the makeup isnt even the same. Looke like a completely different creature. You guys put NO EFFORT. 0. No effort was put into finding the right actors, right makeup, wardrobe. Im not disappointed. Im mad. Im mad that movies are going downhill. Production sucks. We need new crew, people with ORIGINALITY, and taste."

The makeup, the story, the special effects, the overall look of the creeper is so far from the original that I would have thought it was someone immitating the creeper and its' story. Someone deserves a big slap in the mouth for putting this garbage on the screen. I got totally cheated by JC3 and Fathom Entertaiment \"events\", and I fell for it again. What a POS this movie is and it is so hard to believe that this story is so far off the mark. It's not reborn it's aborted... and there is not much chance that a true fan of the series will be duped into falling for a fifth installment after this garbage. What a damned shame this movie was made and released the way it was.

Also, the size of the Creeper is noticeable & disappointing smaller. My take is, one's muscles attrify in 23 years of nonuse. The slightest tweek in character makes a difference in the audience's love for the character. The face tweeked a little, but can live with it. Lose that breast plate, please. What's up with the more fashionesta Creeper. Please lose that high collar on his villian coat. That hat never loses it's shape now. Go back to the original guy who looked stronger & orig.

I think I would direct a better film with no experience.\n\nI wish I didn't have this opinion as Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2 are one of my favourite horror films. The first two films did it brilliantly, however with this film it is completely different. This did not feel like a movie but a cheesy film done for a school project.\n\nHowever, I do see where this film was going, some parts of the story from what I skipped through showed us more information about the creeper but I just wish it was depicted in a better way.\n\nMain points: Abuse of CGI - it was laughable, one scene really made me chuckle but besides that it hurt my eyes. The film lacked depth, almost felt two dimensional when watching it. The cinematic dynamics were polar opposites of the original.\n\nThe creeper looked like a Halloween costume, didn't feel authentic from how it was originally depicted, you can clearly tell at the start it's just a guy poorly painted.\n\nActing was off putting, no chemistry between the actors\n\nOverall, for something I've been excited to watch, this film failed to draw and engage me and to be honest it would have been better if this film wasn't made to maintain the franchises integrity of a classic horror monster. But you cant really blame the down fall of the franchise considering the directors past."

If it wasn't for Dee Wallace and Ray Wise turning up in the opening scene you'd be mistaken for thinking you were watching some fan made movie. The first two scenes take place in cars, which were mostly filmed in a studio where they used the worst green screen backgrounds I've seen in 20 years. The backgrounds were at different angles to the cars movements, so it looked like hedges and trees were popping out the back seat. From there things went further down hill. The script, acting, direction and story are so bad that when the Creeper arrived that was the last straw. Very painful to watch. I don't know who they got for the make up effects, but they want to find a new occupation. I gave up at that point, I couldn't take any more."

Sets are uninspired. CGI automatically drops a movie's believability, so you'd better have the money to make it work well for you.\n\nAs a whole, it feels like a fan-made movie and true to form, most fan-made films miss the inspiration that created the original and end up focusing on what they think are the sensational parts. So, the movies are just how to get the characters in line for the kill. Shallow, boring shots, unnecessary dialogue and the creepers 'waking' up sequence? We could definitely have done without that. The mystery of where it goes, hibernates and wakes are a terrifying thought which has been ruined by this movie. Also, to show any creature having a cult and ritualized summoning places it under the control of it's prey=not scary. Especially when the ones summoning are usually lame character types. I cannot think of any movie where they are as scary as the thing called, and if there is one, I'd bet their storylines were done so well that it was deserving. Here, it comes off a lazy and non-creative.\n\nA deep dive into the original should be enough to get a feel for what Salva's original though was for the Creeper. Not even two or 3 were as mind warping as the first.\n\nThis movie literally is like a copy of a copy of a copy making it thin, faded and something given with the understanding \"it's not directly related, but you kinda can see where it came from\"."

This movie felt like a dollar store knock-off of a bunch of amateurs trying to take something original that had a good creepy vibe and turned it into an SNL skit example for what not to do in a reboot. The Jeepers Creepers face also looked like a cheap mask. How does someone take an old 2001 horror movie and mess is up so bad 21 years later? Ouch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The only thing I can really say about this movie is that if this one was the original title today we wouldn't have the Jeepers Creepers franchise. It is sincerely one of the worse movie I ever seen, especially if we take in consideration it belongs to a well established name.\n\nYes, a remake is always a danger, a bigger one than a simple sequel, but here there is so much wrong, it cannot even to aspire to be a trash cult, neither of course a beloved B-Movie.\n\nIf Hollywood is good in making Movies, it excels when is about actors casting and storytelling, which is two of the big reasons we watch and love USA movies almost everywhere in the world, here in Europe like in Asia or Africa. And in order to be appealing to such variety of people and cultures, it means they are really good especially where is needed to be able to relate or at least to be understandable.\n\nThis movie is one of those very few in which those two very important aspects are totally missed. The casting is very poor, acting is not there, you can tell they are people who are pretending to be someone else, which IS acting of course, but the point is doing it while you make the audience forget you are a real person, and give us the total full immersion of the fantasy. Really bad acting no one excluded.\n\nThe cosplay fair scenes, for example, are so bad, with so few extra, basically there is only the performers and almost no crowd, with some scene in which the performers are looking into the camera! Horrific indeed, no pun untended.\n\nI mean, they could copy Rob Zombie imaginary and visual and having something real cool, instead they went for this cheap situation, it feels like they hired some cool performers \"psycho Circus\" and than said to them : ok go and do your things... Maybe because I love that style of things, I am pretty disappointed.\n\nThe story is the other huge problem because it's so basic to result silly and again, not in the right way: It's just lazy, goes nowhere, has many holes leading to nothing, and one of the most un-impressive final scene ever. Which is something considering we are talking about horror.\n\nThe cherry on top is, as everybody say, an utterly bad CGI running during almost all movie, one of the worse we ever had since CGI is massively used in movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "It takes a special kind of talent to call your franchise reboot Jeepers Creepers: Reborn (2022) and promptly kill the series you are trying to resurrect. A young couple go to a horror convention (that is scary enough) and get selected to do an escape room house based around the local legend of The Creeper, the winged man-monster that shows up every 23 years. What they don't know is this is all a set up to make them the creature's latest meal.\n\nFor better or worse, Victor Salva's Jeepers Creepers trilogy was a solid intro for a new \"horror icon\" (\u00a9 every horror news site). It set simple rules and had its monster attack people. This follows that same set up, but tries to up it with some bizarre new plot twists. For example, this one features a cult that worships the Creeper and brings the victims to them. If you are hoping for more info than that, you will be sorely disappointed. The film literally has the cult trap the people in the house, one of them says, \"They're all yours now\" and then they walk away, never to be seen again. There is an interesting new idea where the Creeper can attach dead body parts to its own damaged body to regenerate, but again it is never fully explained. Heck, if it was it wouldn't even matter as the film is so cheaply made. A lot of criticism online has been about how damn cheap the film looks and I can't disagree. From the fake sets to the greenscreen work to the fake CGI, it looks more like a bad Youku movie. Director Timo Vuorensola made those terrible looking Iron Sky films, so it makes sense this looks just as bad. You know you've screwed up when the viewer is wishing for the more subtle style of Salva. I did get a couple of laughs from dumb bits like the phone in the decaying mansion still working (did the Creeper immediately start a phone plan when it was resurrected that morning?) and the bit where the hip Youtube crew (ugh!) following our leads find their cameraman dead minutes after they arrive at the house and one says, \"It's fresh, whatever got him just got here.\" Of course it is fresh! You literally just got there with the man! Sadly, boneheaded stuff like that can only entertain so much."

This over-lighting exposes the creeper far too much, and he is less a stalking menace that is hunting it's prey, rather an quasi-superhero. All of this leaves this feeling like a low budget action film with light horror overtones.\n\nShould I get started with the obvious social engineering and forced diversity and interracial pairing that *every* studio is forcing on us in a totally-not conjoined effort? Well that's there too. So instead of the writers and producers writing characters and casting actors who were appropriate for the story, you get Black Guy, White Woman, Generally Asian, and old white guy to bind them together. They're equally disinteresting and equally disingenuous feeling, so I guess that IS equality.\n\nJust don't waste your time.watch Jeepers Creepers 1 or 2 instead."

The best thing in the movie was the fact that I haven't seen Gary Graham, Detective Matt Sikes from Alien Nation in anything for years.

        "review_detailed_main": "Jeepers Creepers Reborn is undeniably a very flawed film, but it is not nearly as bad as its score and the buzz surrounding it suggests it is. It must be stated before anything else that, yes, it does not hold a candle to the first and second movies. If you too are of the opinion that Jeepers Creepers is a riveting horror cult classic, and that its sequel is an enjoyable-yet-ultimately-mediocre follow up, then it is likely you'll find that Reborn ranks somewhere below the passable second film and leagues above the atrocious third film.\n\nLet's start with the good. Reborn has a a solid atmosphere, with beautiful shots reminiscent of that eerie, long winding road from the intro scene of the first movie, and it features curious locales located somewhere in the deep South that can't be found on any maps. It manages to evoke that feeling of \"maybe we shouldn't be driving through this place,\" and makes it easy to imagine that the places you see in the movie are real locations that you could spot while lost on a road trip.\n\nThe main attraction, the Creeper himself, was also a highlight of the film for me. While I'm sure many would consider his redesign and overall aesthetic to be divisive at best, Reborn's take on the Creeper managed to be true to the original while also feeling fresh. The film also contains many references to classic horror movies, which is sure to get a kick out of long time fans of the genre. The kills, though they tend to lack impact, are generally enjoyable and more than a couple of them made me squirm.\n\nNow for the bad parts. While the atmosphere was great, the reviewers who have brought up the terrible CGI in this film were not kidding. The worst of it is relegated to cheap-looking CGI backgrounds that I personally found easy to ignore, but there was one absolutely abysmal use of CGI at a pivotal point in the film that was impossible for me to overlook. I don't often have trouble suspending my disbelief when watching horror, but this particular scene was horrendous, and I can only hope it is fixed when the film is released on blu-ray and streaming services.\n\nThe plot is mostly nonsensical, and serves only to have our characters eventually find themselves crossing paths with the Creeper, but said characters were likeable and entertaining enough to make me want to see more of them-- namely the main couple, though some of the other side characters were still fun, if one-dimensional. Overall, I am happy that I got to see Reborn in theaters and form my own opinion on it, especially because it is a limited release here in the states. As a fan of the series, I recommend it to anyone who wants to see more of the Creeper, though it is vital to keep an open mind. If you go in expecting a classic, you will undoubtedly be disappointed."

The main characters are horrible. I understand the under acting in certain parts but after a while it gets old and over done. The previous movies or should I say the great ones atleast made sense and had you wanting answers or cliffhangers. This is a complete disgraceful taste in your mouth.

It felt more like a really bad parody than a horror movie. You can tell that when the producers made this movie, they didn't even bother to actually analyse the previous movies & do their research. It looks & feels like a made for tv movie. The script/story was very poorly written. The computer animated cgi backgrounds are very fake looking & are absolutely terrible. The images torture & destroy the viewer. Dee Wallace is such a fantastic actress but unfortunately signing on to this movie was a sad waste of her talent. The other actors/actresses were just awful & had fake American accents that were not convincing at all. The characters are unexplained as well as dull & uninteresting. The Creeper was the most disappointing. He is genuinely a terrifying character with so much potential, yet fell completely short of that in this movie. His face looked unrealistic, & more like a cheap Halloween costume. He looked nothing at all like he did in the previous movies.\n\nThe first three movies were directed by Victor Salva. He's a sick & twisted monster but at least you can say he was a competent filmmaker with solid ideas. Lately with all the horror movie villains getting fresh comebacks it doesn't seem like this \"Creeper\" will be rising back anytime soon after this atrocity."

This movie wasn't part of the initial trilogy and infact sets up for the next set of movies (apparently), however that doesn't excuse the poor quality, especially as the graphics nowadays are so good to live up to and I have to say that this movie did not live up to that. There were many mistakes that I noticed and the accents of the cast kept slipping, ultimately leading to a poor performance. For a low budget movie it is okay and I appreciate the effort however I will not be recommending it to anyone anytime soon."

I personally was More intrigued with the potential this character had for further films if managed correctly. Then came the third instalment..what a overly lit bag of crap. Who in the hell came up with the idea of having the majority of this film set during the day so we see way too much of this character totally neutralising any sense of mystery or fear for him.\n\nThen we get this this fourth instalment and we see the title 'reborn' . Surely hope is not lost.. surely this means reboot ? Back to basics..back to what worked...nope..instead we get to witness the death of a franchise right before our very eyes. Bad acting and unlovable characters is an understatement and some of the worst green screen I've seen in modern cinema.

That's touched on, but also there's just rampant killing for seemingly no reason at all. I won't go into the \"expansion\" of the storyline because it didn't make much sense to me. It might have been better to just start another movie franchise instead of ruining the universe of this one. I would have thought at this point they might have tried to do a prequel, since it's never been explained what it is or where it came from.

        "review_detailed_main": "The creeper left some nice nostalgic horror memories, having seen the first two installments at the age of 9 or 10, and a few times since then. To this day, I believe Jeepers Creepers is the one horror franchise with a villain whose mythology is ripe for expanding, if only creative minds are attached. Even the third part was, although cheap and a lackluster, reasonably fitting the modus operandi of the franchise, but this... This is a sad, or annoyed, or just an emotionless *sigh* on every possible level.\n\n. Timo Vuorensola, director of the pretty fun nazi-moon-base comedy \"Iron Sky\", together with the unknown Sean-Michael Argo of D-grade horror background, has set out to truly disappointment horror movie lovers and piss off franchise fans... After a pretty weak intro, there is still the vague smell of hope in the air, but that is slowly but surely destroyed by a myriad of factors. While the FX team and actors do their best, including my favorite one by Peter Brooke, given \"standout performance\" for, unfortunately, most likely an unintentionally funny character, \"Jeepers Creepers Reborn\" sinks helplessly during the entirety of its 88 minute runtime. I did not like where the plot was going, and it ending nowhere didn't help either. The whole essence here is heavily clich\u00e9d, and through lackluster carnage creates no fear, no suspense, and the characters can hardly be felt for. They even managed to lame down and take away what little character the Creeper had, not a fan of his new design either, although I have to admit it was at least slightly better than I was expecting to see. All the old, more iconic characteristics of the Creeper and the movie universe are rehashed, and any new ones only raise eyebrows. There are overloads of digital effects, obvious green screens - visually, nearing the end, the film feels artificial in a funky, bad way. The atmosphere is full flat, silly or even cringe, besides some unintentionally funny momentums. The night lighting is terrible. The gore is cheap and plain underwhelming. The action is unengaging. The dialogue is boring. The characters cannot be rooted for, or did I already said that? It's just... altogether bad. However, it was a funny kind of watch, for I was relieved too, because I truly expected something awful upon seeing those 2.9 stars (2.7 now as of writing this).\n\n. It's really, not trying to be offensive here, quite a dumb movie. Very likely would be more liked had it not taken a half-decent horror franchise's name and character. It feels like a strong attempt for a very bad horror movie. I even saw it on the big screen, having gotten tickets for next to nothing, and it still most definitely was not worth it. The mom sitting beside me, who thoughtfully took her two ~12 year olds to see this masterpiece, was shaking on every cringe jump scare. Glad she enjoyed it. I can imagine this being a moderately cool film if you have less than 100 horror movies under your belt. My rating: 3/10."

(outside movies as well).\n\nTerrible and illogical characters and their stupid decisions (pull over a car, get out and go to pee so far, that you need GPS to find that car again) or going alone during the night somewhere, of my \"favorite\", fist fight with monsters... that is always \"WOW\" ... etc, of course I hate childish adaptations (like for example for me LoTR in amazing, Hobbit is terrible and Harry potter is disgrace, Punisher is amazing, Batman vs Superman is amazing, Dark Knight is amazing, Logan is amazing etc... but Antman, or new Thor or Wonder woman etc... it is for 9 years old\" You will find every single of these stupid aspects here unfortunately.\n\nCombine these things with almost all the time terrible CGi (to be fair, some scenes looked decent) and \"broken\" bad guy, in this case Creeper (who doesn't simply follow what he was last 300 years or so) and \"incredible\" fighting scenes with ... OMG, I have to stop... Simply... this was bad, terrible and whoever directed, 23 people each day should have peepee poopoo on his hands and society must forbid him to go to the water for the rest of his life!\n\nCreeper is not creepy anymore, because he looks more human than people here, he is not capable of killing anymore because he has become musician and ... damn, I have to stop.\n\nBut good news... it can't be worse, just can't.

Aside from two short appearances by Gary Graham and Dee Wallace, then I was unfamiliar with the cast ensemble in \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\", and I will say that taking the script into consideration, then the cast put on good enough performances.\n\nVisually then \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" was adequate. The design on the creeper was good, and it was nice that you get to see so much of the creature this time around. But at the same time, a lot of the background scene looks horrible fake.\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" is watchable enough for what it turned out to be, just don't get your expectations worked up. And while I managed to sit through the movie, I can honestly say that I am not returning to watch \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" a second time.\n\nMy rating of \"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" lands on a four out of ten stars."

Seen it maybe 7 times.\n\nThe sequals never lived up to the original and there is a 4th in production for many years but never made yet. This is not a sequel. It's sort of a reimagined version. Oddly, they mention the first three movies early in the film.\n\nIt starts off rather promising but soon unravels into abject stupidity that makes no sense. The original had this hook that the creeper cant kill you if you show no fear of him. No more. He's basicaly the predator now in a really really really bad costume.\n\nIt STINKS.\n\nVery disappointing."

What's wrong with filming in a busted old house?!? Get some actual character into the movie not greenscreen the whole thing..\n\nActing was atrocious on the most part.. Story was barely present at all.. like the thought the Halloween fun fair was a cool setting and just strung a few random ideas together to get to a ending.. more plot holes and conveniences than a Convenient Plot Hole Convention.\n\nAnother good franchise ruined. Hate it."

I should have never wasted my money. I would feel better burning my money or giving it to Joe Biden's campaign. The actress in this movie should have just applied for a PPP loan and kept it pushing. The script, the actors, the cinematography everything was bad. How dare they send this not to a straight to TV movie? What happened to the franchise? This was bad, cheap and had nothing to do with the first three. This movie is like that bad essay your English teacher told you to start all over."

No. It does not.\n\nThere wasn't even any comic relief or outrageous death scenes to bring it back from just being a terrible movie. Also, the absurd CGI?! What even was that & why was that necessary???\n\nI'm a fan of the first 2 Jeepers Creepers and was sincerely disappointed that this followed those, let's all just try and forget this exists and move on.\n\nHard Pass."

Pointless, cheap, disjointed, insulting to the original ideas, dubious acting, and worst of all for this one perhaps: ZERO chemistry between the interracial (standard fare) couple. Also, notably distracting was all the fake skies and fake scenery as some kind of painted wall or CGI'd green screen insert. Not convincing at all, and most likely the nail in the coffin for this franchise. The first 2 are pretty good, and even great in some ways. 3 is ok, suffering budgeting issues. This one should have been abandoned or made into something else."

This new installment was clearly rushed and they added the woke generation to it, what a big surprise.\n\nA sort of a failed remake and quit useless in the already tired series.
