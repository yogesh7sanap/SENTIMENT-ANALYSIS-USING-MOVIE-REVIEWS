        "review_detailed_main": "1965's \"The Sound of Music\" is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters. So why is it one of my favorite musicals? OK, go ahead. Shoot me at twenty paces. But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure. I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers & Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much. I seem to play it a lot around tax time.\n\nAnd I'm not alone. Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time? Well, first of all they spared no expense. The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery. From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world. I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway. The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R & H extravaganza \"South Pacific.\") That in itself is an incredible feat.\n\nNow about those songs. Almost every one of them is absolute drivel. So what makes them work? Easy. The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score. It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things. Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in. Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere. Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss. Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed. Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo. The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.\n\nThe script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link. But again, the characters play it straight all the way. Not one actor looks embarrassed. Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect.\n\nAnd as for the characters. Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material. I certainly can't. Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning \"Mary Poppins\" the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead! After all, Andrews did lose out on \"My Fair Lady\" the year before. But now certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role. Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute. She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly. Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun. I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either. As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing, creating their own individual personalities by film's end.\n\nRichard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief. Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor. The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement. Parker developed a devout cult following after this role. Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.\n\nFor those who tear \"The Sound of Music\" apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that. But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking \"Peter Pan\" for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home. It's ludicrous. Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching \"The Sound of Music\" for stark realism. Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending. Nothing more. If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent \"Holocaust\" or \"Schindler's List.\" Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world! Period.\n\nI suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like \"The Sound of Music.\" If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters. It's a tough new world today, sad to say. The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.\n\nAnyway, for what it's worth, \"The Sound of Music\" is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best."

I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music."

Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched."

The mesmerizing European landscapes and Julie Andrews' voice, not to mention the cute performances by the children, especially in their goodbye song, make this film not only the best musical of all time, but one of the best films of all time.\n\nYes, I did say best musical. Singin in the rain is sewer water compared to this. Not that Singin is a bad musical, but not as good. The Wizard of Oz is learning how to make fire, The Sound of music is inventing the Flying car.\n\nThis film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours.\n\nTo simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life."

A fictional movie based off of a Broadway musical. One cannot help but love the amiable and family-oriented film. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice, and portrays the role of Maria as the optimistic nun who become nanny and then mother to the Von Trapp family well. Plummer, is not particularly my favorite character but he also portrays the captain in a decent manner.\n\nWise is a experienced director and his experience is seen through the popularity and wonderful clips and action of the film. The songs of the movie are playful and fun to sing along with, and easily get stuck in your head. Overall I like the film and would definitely consider it well deserving of all is Awards and nominations."

It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes.\n\nI have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like \"Casablanca\", \"The African Queen\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" have originally also been frowned upon.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was \"Carousel\" that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, \"The Sound of Music\" surpasses \"The King and I\", \"Oklahoma!\", \"Carousel\" and \"South Pacific\" in all aspects.\n\nWe all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, \"The Sound of Music\", \"My Favourite Things\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" or \"Edelweiss\". Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.\n\nYes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?\n\nIt was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.\n\n\"Singin' In the Rain\" is the only other contender to the title of \"The greatest movie ever made\". Whatever its flaws, \"The Sound of Music\" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.\n\nRating: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "That 'The Sound of Music' (SOM) is a greatly changed version of the true story of the Trapp Family Singers doesn't really matter much. It does not claim to be an accurate documentary \u0096 what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on!\n\nSOM is a love story and some may find that the falling in love of the Captain and Maria really does not fire particularly well. I realize that this is a family movie (and one made in 1965) so we cannot expect too much overt passion \u0096 but neither Julie Andrews nor Christopher Plummer really convinces as a character suddenly consumed with romantic fervour! Their eventual embrace seems improbable and rather stagy. You certainly don't get the feeling that they are in a rush to rip one another's clothes off! Far sexier is the superb Eleanor Parker who not only looks fantastic as the Baroness but manages to convey a much earthier attraction for the Captain. Similarly Charmain Carr as Lisl ('Sixteen going on Seventeen') is actually very adult and appealing in her feelings for the telegram boy Rolf. Ms Carr was in fact twenty-two going on twenty-three when she performed the role and you fell that she could give some tips to Maria rather than the other way around!\n\nSo although SOM is an unconvincing love story that does not seriously diminish its appeal as a movie. Julie Andrews is superb as the children's friend and the release from the straightjacket that she engineers for them is convincing. When she stands up to the Captain early on you feel that this is driven by a very genuine and almost innocent determination to set them free. There is no self-interest at play here - she does it because she thinks that it is right. Ms Andrews made SOM the year after Mary Poppins and frankly she continues the Mary Poppins character into Maria. Hence her performance works as the eccentric governess where it certainly does not as a portrayal of a young woman in love.\n\nYou will want to see SOM because of the wonderful music and lyrics, the marvelous scenery in the location shots around Salzburg and the collective performance of the cast. The Oscars got it about right. Best picture, best direction, best editing, best music and best sound. But there were no actors Oscar's (although Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood were nominated) and, in truth, none of the individual performances is particularly worthy of much more than a special mention. No disrespect to Ms Andrews or Mr Plummer but the roles did really call for a bit more than they were able to give if we were to be convinced of the love that was supposed to be developing between them!"

Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those \"hidden talents\" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere \"Uncle\" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'."

A perfect way to end the film.\n\nAnd like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.\n\nAnd it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now...\n\n\"My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is the kind that makes people jump up and shout at the screen. Me, too, things like: \"Shut up, already!\" and \"Look behind the tombstone, you silly Nazis!\"\n\nI guess when it comes to \"The Sound Of Music,\" you either have it, or you've had it. Count me in the latter camp. Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.\n\nExcept for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?\n\nI guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing \"Edelweiss\" to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.\n\nEven Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for \"North By Northwest\" and \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\", pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing \"So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit/I float/I fleetly flee and flyyyy...\" these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.\n\nThere are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?\" well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.\n\nBut Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky \"Edelweiss\" and \"16 Going On 17,\" a nice song undone by campy staging. \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain,\" a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.\n\nFinally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.\n\nTwo things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made \"The Sound Of Music\" a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD."

Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.\n\nEverybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ing\u00e9nue with great screen presence. Christopher Plummer provides the compelling leading man. This is probably one of the best romantic musicals."

They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the \"Do ah Dear\" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.\n\nThe main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.\n\nJulie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.\n\nChristopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.\n\nA real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.\n\nThe charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.\n\nThe Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings."

In fact, famed critic Pauline Kael was fired for daring to write a bad review of it when it first came out. Julie Andrews sure worked her mojo on that one.\n\nFunny thing is: The Sound of Music doesn't need protection from critics. Yes, it's schmaltzy, but it's not nearly as schmaltzy as, say, Titanic. Yes it has all those adorable kids and all those adorable songs and even a cute puppet show stuck right in the middle of it, but it also has grit, drama, and some harrowing moments. Hell, it's got Nazis racing around in big black cars! It is a total cinematic experience, and one that benefits greatly from technological advances that let you enjoy its lavish sights and sounds on a big TV screen with big surround speakers that make it feel like Julie Andrews is embracing your or the Nazis are sneaking up on you from behind."

        "review_detailed_main": "The \"Sound of Music\" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is \"elevated\", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good \"engagement sequence\" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple \"Eidelweiss\" ballad to \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria\" , \"Do Re Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"I Have Confidence\", \"The Lonely Goatherd\", \"Something Good\", \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" and the voice-challenging \"Climb Every Mountain\". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway \"book\" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time."

Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, \"Who is this new person?\" The songs are fine, and the kids aren't offensive, but I can see why some refer to this as \"The Sound of Mucus\". It's ladled with indifference. *** from ****"

We see that the magnificent beauty of Salzburg is also crowned as a different character throughout the film. Quality songs that have been expressed musically also attract attention. It never bores a person to listen to it many times. Predictable entry-development-results do not bother at all. In fact, the film shifts to a lot of politics in the last quarter. Let's also remind that it is inspired by real events and characters that have happened. So the von Trapp family is completely real. After watching the movie, those who are curious can do some research. It can be recommended unconditionally to everyone young and old, one of the rare films that can win everyone's liking."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music is the greatest movie of all time. That's not hyperbole, it's just fact. TSOM is as close to being a perfect film as the art of filmmaking has ever seen. A musical based on a true story, TSOM boasts an inspired score, stunning cinematography, historical drama, romance, comedy, and a beautiful and supremely talented actress with an operatic voice.\n\nJulie Andrews stars as Maria von Trapp of the von Trapp family singers who escaped Austria, and the Third Reich, at the outset of World War II. As the story begins, Maria lives in a convent near Salzburg and is preparing to be a nun. Her plans are delayed when she is temporarily assigned to be the governess for the seven children of widower Georg von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, a decorated Austrian navy captain who is resisting recruitment by the Nazis. The story follows Maria's integration into the family, her eventual romance with Captain von Trapp, and the dire circumstances they face with the impending German takeover of their beloved homeland.\n\nEvery aspect of TSOM is brilliant. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote an indelible collection of songs that would become part of American culture itself, and that were choreographed and performed with inspired whimsy and grace. The choreography showcased the beauty of the Austrian Alps and the charm of Salzburg, and director Robert Wise coaxed magical performances out of the seven children and other supporting actors, including Plummer. The story itself is a winsome mixture of wry comedy, drama, and romance. But it is Julie Andrews' stunning portrayal of Maria von Trapp that elevates this film above all others. Her authentic beauty, theatrical agility, and soaring musical performance are breathtaking and unforgettable.\n\nMusicals, for many, are an acquired taste. The Sound of Music can be categorized as a musical because it contains songs that help move the story along, but this towering cinematic achievement transcends genre designations - it is timeless art that reflects the goodness of the Creator of all great things. As such, it is the only movie this author has ever deemed a 10 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness."

With its images and clich\u00e9s, the film has shaped Americans' perception of Austria. Accordingly, the landscape shots are also kitschy, very beautiful, but also a bit too much of a good thing.\n\nBut there are also good aspects. Julie Andrews shines in the role of the joyful Maria, who not only captures the hearts of the children but also those of the widowed Captain von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and contributes significantly to the film's emotional core.\n\nAll in all, it's a bit too long but worth seeing, especially to understand the perspective of Americans on Austria."

The film has been an inspiration for me since I was a very little girl, and i hope to fulfill my ambitions of starring in a staged production of 'The Sound Of Music'.

        "review_detailed_main": "I love the perhaps apocryphal story that the BBC had The Sound of Music ready to go in case of nuclear holocaust. The film is filled with such warmth and joy that it would be a wonderful distraction from the world ending. Based on the stage musical by Rogers and Hammerstein and the real life tale detailed in Maria von Trapp's autobiography The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, Robert Wise's The Sounds of Music is an absolute delight for about 2/3 of it. And then the actual plot and romance take over, and it just kind of loses a level of its charm. I mean, it's still nice, but it's not the same level of just pure joy that comes before it.\n\nMaria (Julie Andrews) is a novitiate in a nunnery in Salzburg. She's a problem. She's too flighty and unfocused for life in a convent despite her obvious piety, and the mother superior sends her away to become the newest in a long line of governesses for the von Trapp family, headed by the widow Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). Georg runs a tight ship of a house, introducing his seven children using specific tones from a whistle as they report their name with military efficiency. The eldest is Liesl (Charmain Carr) who has an innocent little romance going on with a neighborhood boy, Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), a courier. Maria finds her welcome to the house cold as the children play tricks on her like putting a frog in her pocket, but she can cut right through it with her kindness. Simply thanking them for the trick at dinner sends the children into tears. It's a stormy night when Maria fully makes her connection with the children. Liesl has her number \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" with Rolfe, highlighting her innocence and desire to grow up, but she gets caught in the rain, sneaking into the house through Maria's window. Maria helps her hide her infraction against Georg's rules while also comforting the other children with the song \"My Favorite Things\". Their emotional bond has started, and it becomes complete with \"Do-Re-Mi\".\n\nAll of this is just joyful in execution. Julie Andrews, whom Plummer called \"Ms. Disney\" on set because of her perpetually chipper attitude and Oscar win for the title role in Mary Poppins, is in almost all of it, and her attitude and skillful voice bring so much of the wonderful music to life. Helped in no small part because the songs themselves are actually really good. \"Do-Re-Mi\", for instance, lays out the building blocks of musical composition in its most elemental form, and it's a steady progression of complexity until it becomes a medley of, essentially, two songs, and all of it is filmed using the locations of Salzburg to the utmost, beginning in the mountains and progressing through the streets of the small city. And that kind of joy just keeps popping up, especially with \"The Lonely Goatherd\", the culmination of the musical relationship between Maria and the children in the form of a puppet show given to Georg.\n\nIf the film had managed to find a way to continue this same feeling through to the end, I'd be more purely a fan, but two things assert themselves in the final hour that, while I do enjoy them, are simply not at the same level. The first is the romance between Maria and Georg. There's a quote from the real Maria von Trapp about how love grew between her and her husband over years of marriage, and that feels more in line with the Maria as presented in the first couple of hours of the film. Maria loves the children completely, and Georg is almost an antagonist in the relationship. He's a stiff, unloving man who doesn't know how to express himself while Maria has these wonderful, little adventures with the children. He's not the stuff of romance, and throw in the fact that Georg is betrothed to the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) and you've got this situation that does not sing the same as the relationship between Maria and the children. It works on a basic musical theater, we have to get the male lead and female lead together in the end, sort of way, but it's not exactly the most compelling part of the film.\n\nThe other part of the film I have some resistance to is the use of the Nazi occupation after the Anschluss. The threat of Nazi invasion of Austria is mentioned once in the first two hours of the film, and then, suddenly, it's the focus of everything with Rolfe joining them, losing his innocence and sense of humor, and delivering messages like the von Trapps are any other family, not the family of the girl he loves. I think part of the problem I have is that Georg's opinions on any politics are completely hidden until he comes home from his honeymoon with Maria and tears down the Nazi flag the local magistrate had draped on his house. It's good how the family, with the help of their friend Max (Richard Haydn), uses their music to act as their distraction to escape, bringing the motif deeper into the film instead of it just becoming a thriller of a sorts all of a sudden. I don't hate the final hour or anything. I think it works decently well, but the joy of the first two-thirds is replaced by a less enthralling bout of tension that the film that preceded it didn't really pave the way for.\n\nStill, that first two-thirds is marvelous, and the final third is pretty good. That's not too shabby.\n\nBut really, my complaints are fairly minor. I find so much to enjoy in The Sound of Music that my issues, to myself, feel petty. I mean, they're still there, and I'm not trying to shoo them away. However, they are simply overshadowed so completely by the joy that I have watching the film."

A film that is the definition of 'classic', and will remain forever in the hearts of the audience.\n\nThe acting is amazing, evoking many emotions from the audience. Andrews is just phenomenal and fits her character so well; a strong minded and outspoken personality who does as she sees fit. Her character is just so likable and the characters of the children so lovable. The chemistry between all of them is just spot on and you can tell that they have actually gotten close to each other. The acting brings out the sincerity of the characters which may well be why this film is able to transcend time. Though there are some little awkward/cheesy moments in some scenes, but those are easily forgettable.\n\nThe songs and the way they were sung and executed is just perfect. Disney is phenomenal at making songs to match the lively moods of films and the lyrics are so catchy. I hadn't really known the lyrics to 'Do Re Mi' before, but after paying attention to it again, it's pretty clever.\n\nThe landscapes are so beautiful and the cinematography does it justice with great panning, aerial shots and the full use of spacing.\n\nIt is truly amazing how this film has transcended decades and just celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary. A film that gains new fans every year and I hope it will never run out of popularity. With an emphasis on family and love, this is truly a majestic film.\n\nRead more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" was produced to entertain audiences and allow them to escape from reality for two hours. The vast majority of Broadway musicals produced in the middle of the 20th century were primarily leisure distractions. Only a handful of these offerings center around thought-provoking material, such as \"Porgy and Bess\", \"South Pacific\", \"West Side Story\", \"The Man of La Mancha\", even \"My Fair Lady.\" But \"The Sound of Music\" was not designed to force radical contemplation of social issues. It was designed to make people feel happy about music, although depending solely upon the music in \"The Sound of Music\" to excite me about music would not really work.\n\nThe release of \"The Sound of Music\" was the beginning of the end of Hollywood's love affair with the so-called Broadway musical that began with the advent of sound pictures. Between 1930 and 1960, the movie musical was a mainstream genre and represented a huge amount of the output of Hollywood. But after \"The Sound of Music\" in 1964, the movie musical began to disappear and films would go in varied directions. Many would focus on less escapist subjects, such as politics, dysfunctional relationships, even suicide. New genres entered the mainstream, such as science fiction and the action thriller. Fewer and fewer movie musicals would be produced, and none that I can think of would have the unparalleled success of \"The Sound of Music\".\n\nMost young people today are unaware that two of the biggest names in entertainment for about a third of a century were Rogers and Hammerstein who dominated musical theater in New York thereby influencing much of the output of Hollywood films shot in studios 3000 miles away from Broadway. Most if not all of the duo's musicals were green-lighted as movies. Their musicals were really fantasies with songs, light-hearted escapist fair designed to entertain, with little or no thought-provoking ideas or complex thematic writing. If you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment, you need almost look no further. But if you want something that challenges your perspective, Rogers and Hammerstein have little to offer.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" was beloved by all who saw it when it was first released in 1965. It seemed the one movie everyone could agree they at least liked, if not loved. And it's reputation as everyone's favorite musical still persists, more or less, even today. But is it really as wonderful as everyone would have you believe? Is it worth some critical analysis? For today's younger audiences, \"The Sound of Music\" probably comes off rather dated. It is really a fantasy portending something deeper but doesn't quite get there, except for possibly a moment toward the end of the film. The story is an idealization of the history of the Von Trapp Family Singers and how their adopted mother, Maria, played with pleasurable innocence by the incomparable Julie Andrews, first met the children and their father. Andrews' singing voice is without question from the heavens and, along with her acting, holds the entire film together.\n\nAndrews' character, Maria, is at the beginning an Austrian nun in love with music and not so enamored with being in a convent. She keeps singing in the prayer halls. Realizing that Maria may not be fitting into the monastic life, the Mother Superior sends her to become the governess of the children of a widower and former naval captain who runs his household like Captain Bligh on the Bounty. At first not sure how to connect with this family, the young Maria uses music to bond with the children, and help them ultimately find the love of their father, played with militaristic fervor by Christopher Plummer, who finds himself reluctantly warming to the presence of Maria. The only real edge to the movie is toward the end when the Austrian annexation with Nazi Germany is briefly explored, an aspect that could have used further development.\n\nTo enjoy this movie, you have to understand that the whole idea is escapist fantasy. The songs are sweet little corny tunes without much behind them, the likes of which would probably make Bach, Beethoven and/or Brahms cringe. They do what they are expected to do, and you might find yourself humming them afterward, but they do very little to spark the imagination.\n\nThe title song \"The Sound of Music\" is probably Julie Andrews' best musical moment. It's really not that substantive a song by itself, but Andrews makes it great, which shows how exceptional a performer she really is. Simultaneously, you have to credit Rogers and Hammerstein for attempting the nearly impossible: writing a song about music without it lapsing into sentimental mush. At least the corniness of the title song is kept to a minimum.\n\nFor me, the strongest songs are \"Edelweiss\", sung by Plummer about the flowers of Austria, and \"Climb Every Mountain\", sung by the Mother Superior to encourage Maria to find herself. I don't know if \"Do a Deer\" would really inspire young people today to explore music. The weakest number is a puppet show to the overlong \"The Lonely Goatherd\" which has no bearing on the story and goes on endlessly. Sort of reminds me of \"Get Me to the Church on Time\" from \"My Fair Lady\".\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" is not the easiest of movies to review without offending those who have so loved it. Pauline Kael's review of this movie was incredibly scathing, claiming the movie was purposefully designed to pull your heart strings in a single direction. I think Kael's assessment is a little unfair as every viewer must decide if the film touches them or not. Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it a bit corny? Perhaps, as it sacrifices substance in favor of sentimentality. That being said, if sentimentality is what you're after, \"The Sound of Music\" will definitely fit the bill."

I do not want to affront anyone who's in love with this movie (we all have our own taste and that's a good thing), I'm just saying, that this movie was not getting to me ... at all! If you on the other hand, like drama (plus the musical part of it), all in a long movie, than you probably should watch this, if you haven't already!

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" (1965) is one of those rare films that continue to capture the hearts of viewers across multiple generations. Directed by Robert Wise, the film provides a perfect blend of music, drama, and romance, all against the stunning backdrop of Austrian landscapes.\n\nJulie Andrews delivers a powerhouse performance as Maria, a youthful and vivacious nun dispatched from her convent to serve as a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Andrews brings an infectious joy and warmth to her character that makes her immediately likable, making the audience root for her from her first notes in the opening sequence on the mountain to her final scenes. Her character development from an unsure young woman to a strong and loving maternal figure is beautifully portrayed.\n\nChristopher Plummer complements her perfectly as the stern Captain von Trapp, a widower softened by Maria's charm. His performance is beautifully nuanced; he makes a convincing transition from the distant, disciplinarian father to a man who rediscovers love, joy, and the value of family.\n\nThe seven von Trapp children, led by Charmian Carr as Liesl, contribute significantly to the charm of the film. Each child is distinct and contributes to the story in their own way, making their performances memorable and integral to the narrative.\n\nThe film's most unforgettable element is undoubtedly its music. With compositions by Rodgers and Hammerstein, songs like \"The Sound of Music,\" \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Do-Re-Mi,\" and \"Edelweiss\" are timeless, carrying emotional depth that brings tears to the eyes and a bounce to the step. These songs have become a part of popular culture, highlighting the film's enduring influence.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" is not just a movie; it's an emotive experience. The plot, based on real events, is engaging, heartwarming, and at times, suspenseful, as the looming threat of the Nazi annexation adds a grim undertone to the film's otherwise cheerful disposition.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking. Every scene is a work of art, with lush Austrian mountains and grandiose architectural structures providing an exquisite setting for the story to unfold.\n\nDespite its 3-hour runtime, the film never loses its grip on the viewer, a testament to the power of its narrative, performances, music, and direction. Some may argue that the film borders on the edge of sentimentality, but it is this very emotionality that makes \"The Sound of Music\" so compelling and relatable.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Sound of Music\" is a cinematic masterpiece that celebrates the themes of music, love, family, and courage.

        "review_detailed_main": "When it comes to timeless classics, few films have left as indelible a mark on the world of cinema as \"The Sound of Music.\" Released in 1965, this musical masterpiece directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer has enchanted generations with its captivating story, memorable songs, and stunning Austrian landscapes. However, even the most beloved classics can be subject to scrutiny, and in this review, we will explore the notion that \"The Sound of Music\" could potentially be better, examining its strengths, weaknesses, and the possibilities for revitalizing this cherished cinematic gem.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the beautiful Austrian Alps, \"The Sound of Music\" tells the heartwarming tale of Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young nun who is sent to be the governess for the seven von Trapp children, widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s offspring. The film is a captivating blend of romance, music, and drama, as Maria's free-spirited nature clashes with the Captain's stern demeanor, while they both grapple with their growing affection for one another amidst the looming threat of the Nazi regime.\n\nOne of the film's undoubted strengths is its memorable music, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. From the iconic opening number, \"The Sound of Music,\" to the touching \"Edelweiss\" and the lively \"Do-Re-Mi,\" the soundtrack is a symphony of melodies that have become a part of our cultural fabric. Julie Andrews' soaring soprano voice and the children's harmonious choruses create moments of sheer auditory bliss that are hard to rival. The musical numbers elevate the film and provide it with a timeless quality that continues to draw audiences to this day.\n\nThe cast of \"The Sound of Music\" is another asset that has stood the test of time. Julie Andrews is luminous as Maria, exuding warmth and charisma, while Christopher Plummer brings depth and vulnerability to the stoic Captain von Trapp. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their love story remains one of cinema's most enduring romances. The von Trapp children, played by a talented ensemble of young actors, add charm and innocence to the narrative, making their journey from discipline to joy all the more endearing.\n\nThe film's breathtaking cinematography also deserves acclaim. Robert Wise and his team expertly capture the stunning Austrian landscapes, with sweeping shots of lush green hills, crystal-clear lakes, and majestic mountains. The visuals serve as a visual symphony that complements the musical one, immersing the audience in the story's picturesque world. The contrast between the natural beauty of the surroundings and the encroaching threat of Nazi occupation heightens the film's tension and emotional impact.\n\nHowever, despite its many strengths, \"The Sound of Music\" is not without its flaws, and it is these areas that warrant a critical reevaluation.\n\nFirst and foremost, the film's pacing can be a bit uneven. While the musical numbers are undoubtedly the film's highlights, the transitions between these musical sequences and the dramatic moments can feel abrupt and disjointed. The film's nearly three-hour runtime occasionally drags, and some scenes could benefit from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent flow.\n\nAnother aspect that merits reconsideration is the treatment of certain characters. The portrayal of the von Trapp family's housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and the nuns at the abbey where Maria resides can be seen as somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. These characters, while important to the story, are not given the same depth and development as the main characters, leaving them feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals.\n\nFurthermore, the film's depiction of the Nazi threat, while undoubtedly a central element of the story, may come across as somewhat sanitized to modern audiences. Given the gravity of the historical context, \"The Sound of Music\" could have delved deeper into the political and moral complexities of the era. While the film does not shy away from the looming danger, a more nuanced exploration of the characters' choices and dilemmas in the face of Nazism could have added depth to the narrative.\n\nIn addition, some viewers may find fault with the film's idealized portrayal of the von Trapp family's escape from the Nazis. The daring flight over the mountains is undoubtedly a gripping climax, but it also carries a sense of adventure that borders on the fantastical. A more realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by those fleeing the Nazi regime could have made the story even more impactful.\n\nSo, how could \"The Sound of Music\" be improved? One approach could involve reimagining the film as a limited series, allowing for a more expansive exploration of its characters and historical context. This format would provide the opportunity to delve deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of characters like Captain von Trapp and Maria, as well as to address the broader political landscape of Austria in the late 1930s.\n\nA longer format would also allow for a more gradual development of the romance between Maria and the Captain, giving their relationship a more authentic and nuanced feel. It could also provide the space to explore the emotional impact of their choices on the von Trapp children and the other characters in the story.\n\nIn terms of pacing, a series format would alleviate the need to compress the narrative into a three-hour film, allowing for a more natural progression of the story and character arcs. It would also provide an opportunity to delve into the lives and experiences of characters like Frau Schmidt and the nuns, giving them the depth and dimension they deserve.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Sound of Music\" is undeniably a cinematic classic that has earned its place in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Its timeless music, enchanting performances, and stunning visuals continue to captivate new generations. However, a critical reevaluation reveals areas where the film could be improved, particularly in terms of pacing, character development, and historical context.\n\nOne possible approach to revitalizing this beloved classic is to reimagine it as a limited series, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of its characters and historical backdrop. While \"The Sound of Music\" may never be perfect in the eyes of every viewer, it remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the magic of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "With all the respect for this movie's fans, but seriously I don't find it that great.\n\nFor one thing, the biggest downside of this movie is its runtime. I mean, this movie is almost 3 hours long! It's too long and becomes tiring! A movie like this could be told in less 1 hour than this.\n\nThe movie itself is nothing extraordinary either. But not everything is bad. It has some great moments which are really enjoyable.\n\nThe opening sequence is perfect. It shows us all the beauty of big mountains, large lakes and a blue sky with clouds. Then Julie Andrews appears singing \u00abThe hills are alive with the sound of music\u00bb. After that, the nice village of Salzburg (in Austria) is presented to us, which is another quality of the movie.\n\nOther great and memorable moments of this movie are the sequence \"I'm sixteen, going on seventeen\" and the part when Maria takes the 7 Von Trapp children for a walk in Salzburg and teaches them how to sing. This sequence has also the precious help of the naturally gorgeous backgrounds, surrounded by green places, giant mountains, a blue sky with clouds and a view to the village.\n\nI also enjoy when Captain Von Trapp finally accepts to bring back music to his life and his kids's lives. He even sings very well, like Julie Andrews does. More than that: from a cold and very serious man, he becomes a loving and nice man.\n\nThe songs of this movie are all nice and classics.\n\nBut the rest of the movie isn't that good. I think it has too many needless moments and perhaps that's why it becomes too long and even a bit boring. It naturally loses some of its enchantment and classic status. By the end, when the war starts, it becomes even slower.\n\nJulie Andrews and Cristopher Plummer play very well their roles and it's notorious that they really enjoyed making this movie."

Truly.\n\nAnd not just that, but also meaningful message in it. About kindness, compassion, hope, second chances.\n\nOne day I really want to visit all the places there is in the movie.

Just like everyone else this music is some of the best ever put in a movie. It's funny how everyone seems to forget that just how absurd and unbelievable a lot of it is. For example the kids go from hating her to liking her in an extremely short time. Strangely enough, this movie is long & yes even some of the musical numbers drag it out longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children & big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films. Still this as really good movie & I wish I would have just stuck to remembering how great it was when I saw it as a kid."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a teenager in the swingin' 60's, this movie was, to myself and every male contemporary, an object of derision, a sickly piece of confection for soppy girls and their mothers who had an unofficial competition running to find who had seen it the most times and consumed the most tissues.\n\nI finally came to it many years later in a moment of weakness, watching it alone, gratefully, as it was still suspect for a chap to have moist cheeks in a movie.\n\nThe borderline between true sweetness and mawkish sentimentality in film is very hard to draw, but repeat viewings confirm that this is not a marginal case. The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.\n\nThe music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals. Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.\n\nI have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments. This is the never-ending-story which will delight all those of cheerful heart for as long as films are shown."

Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs a governess to help control his seven children whose mother has died. The captain is VERY stern and treats his children like slaves. Maria (Julie Andrews) a nun is hired for the job. She quickly tames the children and has them singing. She even gets through to the captain. However he is engaged to be married to an evil Baroness (Eleanor Parker) who just wants him for his money.\n\nBeautiful scenery, great songs and a wonderful performance by Andrews. Sure it's syrupy and TOO sweet but I find it irresistible. The three hours just fly by whenever I see it. Andrews is wonderful and all the kids are OK. Parker does what she can in the evil woman role. The only real debit here is Plummer. He didn't want to do it and that comes through loud and clear. He called it \"The Sound of Mucus\" and complained about his singing voice being dubbed. So his performance is bad but it doesn't ruin the movie.\n\nAll in all I LOVE this movie and heartily recommend it. Best part: Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess belting out \"Climb Every Mountain\"."

But I loved it. I showed the movie to my mother. She doesn't understand English very well, I had to keep interpreting the lines for her. But she too loved the movie. I had read somewhere, this is one movie, a copy of which should be there in every home on Earth. And i agree. It is an experience I wont ever forget. however, I wonder, why are musicals so rare in the west? we watch almost 100 Hollywood movies every year, and I have watched just two with songs. Movies from the west are good, I only wish they produce more of musicals, I am sure the world is ready for some of those. And I am sure, the west can make great musicals each month.

Robert Wise's multi Oscar-winning production sees Julie Andrews unleashing her singing voice once more (after MARY POPPINS) during a true story about a large family living in 1930s Austria during the rise of the Nazi party.\n\nFirst, let's get the detractions out of the way. The film is a little overlong and gets bogged down in a syrupy romance around halfway through that drags it down. I've never been able to like Julie Andrews; there's just something twee and too perfect about her, and that opinion is reinforced here.\n\nOn the plus side, there are some great and well-regarded musical numbers here, and they've stayed in the public consciousness for a reason. There's a wonderful supporting turn from Christopher Plummer, and the seven children are all fine and really give the film their all. Wise's direction is strong, and he manages a fine and suspenseful climax that works well in conjunction with the sugary stuff that's come before. In essence, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is essential viewing for musical fans, even if I don't agree that it's quite as brilliant as it's made out to be."

Recently I was on a choir trip and the night we won, we were in the dining room and I started singing Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I got everyone to join in! We ended up singing the entire score, it was so fun! I got so into it I ended up standing on the table and there are some really embarrassing photos of me, but it was worth if because everyone had a great time.

But with Andrews performance as such, Christopher Plummer comes in and gives a tremendous performance that, to me, makes this film extremely good.\n\nHe complements Andrews while giving a very different type of performance than Andrews gives, and it brings the film a sense of organic earthiness that was much needed. It brings the film back to reality, which is where many musicals miss the mark. Having said that, I believe while the film is extremely good, it is not a Masterpiece as many film historians suggest, though I believe that Plummer's performance might be.\n\nThis Plummer performance is up there with his best like his films 'The Insider', 'Barrymore' or 'Remember'. All 4 of these films are almost a completely type of acting by Plummer & helps to show what a multi-dimensional actor he was."

Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.\n\nOver the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews & Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really. As a guy it's at the one hour ten mark where I get something to hang my coat upon, from there on in the Von Trapp family, and their gorgeous governess, have me hook, line & sinker.

        "review_detailed_main": "THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a music romantic drama film which, through melodic and sentimental story, shows us a rhapsodic family. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name. The opening sequence is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. A charming scenery, with the musical score, is the biggest asset of this film.\n\nThe Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Trapp Family Singers. Maria is a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing and enjoy in nature. Her imagination and lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and harsh with his children. A young nun wants to change the condition in the house and returns a smile on the face of children, however, she falls into a sweetest life trap ...\n\nA fictional reality flashing on all sides. Simply, it is hard to make sense. A warm and colorful family story is out of control. There are funny nuns, rich man with two faces, modest Baroness and an interesting fraud. A delicious lie in which song makes dreams come true.\n\nJulie Andrews as Maria is \"mischievous\" nun full of enthusiasm and energy. Her character is attractive and lively while she sings. However, what is worse, she becomes an uninteresting character in the second part of the film, because she could not bring their feelings in a pale romance. Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp is a firm hand, which quickly opens and turns into a frivolous grimace.\n\nRichard Haydn as Max Detweiler is a harmless impostor who sees all and slyly silent. Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder is a nice and fragile character. The children are very entertaining.\n\nNo matter what, if you like to sing and dance in a quiet night, this is the movie for you."

The Reverand Mother then sends Maria to naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) - whose wife recently died - to look after his seven children.\n\nThe children are between the ages of five and sixteen. With Georg running the house as if he is on one of his ships, the children are subjected to a very strict upbringing and not even allowed to play. At first, it seems like its going to be a daunting task for our inexperienced young heroin, but as she gets to know the children - and they her - a strong bond forms between them.\n\nWhen Georg goes away to visit Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) - whom he intends to marry - Maria and the children get a chance to be adventurous. In the process she becomes a mother figure to them. I enjoyed Maria being a free-spirited yet strong character who never allowed Georg to intimidate her, and she always voiced her opinion.\n\nThe love story was predictable, I suppose, but it is a beautiful and romantic story and I wouldn't have had it any other way. I must say, for a three-hour long movie, it was surprisingly fast-moving and I was never bored. On the contrary, I enjoyed every moment very much. The film took a very different direction during the third act, which I never expected, and it was wonderful.\n\n'The Sound of Music' boasts fantastic sets and production design, beautiful costumes, good cinematography, good and funny dialogue, and superb performances. I absolutely love this delightful movie!"

Nor are they the most exciting voices: the Mother Superior exhorts,somewhat out of place, the \"Climbing of every Mountain\", the Baron (or Count),if he does at all, sings in an uninteresting bland voice; Julie Andrews is no Lily Pons or Kathryn Grayson, or even Jeanette MacDonald,but vocalizing in \"Pediatric\".walks us through her favorite places where \"the dog bites\" or \"the bee stings\". \"When you're sixteen\" etc. is rather insipid, and the nuns' chorus is on the juvenile side. The Baroness acts insecure rather than malicious and the whole cast of characters is not more than unidimensional. The photography and scenery are excellent,but apart from this I would feel that this is a children's picture; perhaps that was what was intended."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1960s were an era of haunting Bollywood musicals with Dev Anand-Shammi Kapoor- Dilip Kumar-starrers giving us some unforgettable songs. Their melody set to extraordinary lines were on just about every pair of lips.\n\nIt was in such a scenario that The Sound of Music opened in Calcutta's famed Globe theatre, and its gripping story and innumerable songs caught on - giving a run for their money to the likes of Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar, Anands and Kapoors. Incredible as it may sound, the man on street - bhadrolok or otherwise - was heard singing Edelweiss and Do Re Mi.\n\nFifty years later, The Sound of Music - helmed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer - is all set for a huge celebration. This will begin on March 2 in Britain and March 10 in the US with the release of a five-disc blu-ray DVD digital HD collector's treasure.\n\nThe blu-ray disc will include 13 hours of additional content with a brand new documentary - - The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg - telling us all about her recent visit to that city of magic and music where she was once Maria, a young woman in a secluded abbey training to be a nun.\n\nAs the film opens with a zoom shot of Maria -she grows from a tiny speck on a marvelously undulating patch of greenery with the Alps behind her - singing 'The Hills are alive with the sound of music', the movie pans across to the abbey. The sisters there are wondering what to do with Maria as she rushes in - late as ever for the prayer. \"How do you solve a problem like Maria\", they burst into a song - smiling and good natured though, a reflection of times perhaps when kindness and compassion ruled our lives.\n\nThe golden jubilee commemoration will continue on March 26, when Turner Classic Movies (TCM) will pay a tribute to Andrews and Plummer with an opening night screening of The Sound of Music at the sixth TCM Classic Film Festival, running from March 26 to 29. Movie historian Robert Osborne will introduce the brilliantly restored film, and moderate a Q&A with Andrews and Plummer (who played Captain Von Trapp).\n\nThis meeting of Maria and Von Trapp will be sheer nostalgia for two of the greatest actors we have known. In fact, no scene in the history of cinema has had such intense sexual tension as the dance number in the movie where the two are doing the Landler, an Austrian- German folk form, which was forbidden in parts of Europe for about 50 years in the 18th century.\n\nThe Sound of Music, which won five Academy Awards - displaced Gone With The Wind (which was already 26 years old in 1965) as the highest box office grosser of all time.\n\nAnd why was it such a big hit? The answer is simple. It had a fascinating story that moved seamlessly through some of the sweetest songs one has heard. Top this with Andrews' excellent performance against the superbly scenic Salzburg.\n\nIn fact, Andrews was the first choice of Wise, although his list included Grace Kelly and Shirley Jones. Kelly and Jones might not have been quite suitable for the Maria we saw on the screen -- bubbly, mischievous, innocent, sincere and utterly lovable. Otherwise, how could a widower like Von Trapp - so strict that he used the whistle to call each of his seven children - fall so deeply in love with this simple girl who is not chic or polished. Remember that scene when she rings the bell at the Captain's villa. When a man opens the door, she announces: \"Captain, I am your new governess\". To which he answers: \"I am your butler\".\n\nWise had seen Andrews in Mary Poppins, which was yet to be released then. A few minutes into a special show of the film, Wise told the producer, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this movie and grabs her!\"\n\nThe Sound of Music was inspired by the Von Trapp family singers. Many things were changed in the film. The Von Trapp family had ten children; seven were from the Captain's first marriage, and three more children came after Maria and Georg Von Trapp were married. In the movie, the children's names, ages and genders were also changed.\n\nThe real Captain Von Trapp was a warm and good-humoured man, not the hard and cynical character seen in the film. This inaccurate portrayal distressed the Von Trapp family greatly.\n\nAnother major deviation in the movie was that the real Maria did not fall in love with the Captain at first sight - as the move shows us. Maria once said: \"I fell in love with the children and married their father; I got used to the father, and we were very happy.\"\n\nEven the climax has been tweaked. The Von Trapps did not flee to Switzerland walking over the Alps, an escape made possible by the nuns at the abbey who pull out a wire in the car used by the Nazis to chase the family. The Von Trapps left by train to Italy in clear daylight. Eventually, they made their way to the US mostly with the money they made singing. Once in America, they settled in Stowe, Vermont.\n\nDespite these so-called inaccuracies, The Sound of Music was adored by generations of cinema buffs. And when it opens again, it will probably be a grand hit."

        "review_detailed_main": "The greatest, best-known, most irritating and over-rated screen musical of all time - that's Rodgers and Hammerstein's last collaboration, 'The Sound of Music'. Julie Andrews is Maria, appearing on film again after her Oscar-winning triumph as Mary Poppins and her stage successes as Guinivere in Camelot and Eliza in My Fair Lady. Maria on stage had been the peerless Mary Martin, not quite as sugary as Andrews, but who could argue with this sweet-voiced screen version? Maria is in a convent but she isn't suitable material for a bride of Christ. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood, here I think dubbed for her rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain', considering her pure soprano years earlier) sends Maria out into the world to take charge of the Von Trapp children. Their father, the starchy Captain (Christopher Plummer) rules his household with perfect timing and has little love to give to his children - Maria is about to bring a ray of sunshine into their life.\n\nYou know the big songs - 'Doh Ray Mi' (which seems to go on forever), 'The Lonely Goatherd' (while the children work with a puppet theatre), 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' (lovely performances in a summer house from Charmian Carr as Liesl and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe), and, of course, Julie Andrews spinning around a grassy hill singing the title song.\n\nMaria and the Von Trapps get caught in the second world war and have to ship out from the clutches of the Nazis pretty quickly. With the sugary musical backdrop to this war-torn drama stopping it working, this section of the film is sluggish in comparison to the joy of 'My Favourite Things'."

Whatever spawned them simply must be tracked down and eliminated. Why are they so happy? Why don't they mind all the ridiculous singing coming from that absurd woman? Why do they join in?\n\nSeriously, it may be crowd-pleasing, but I just don't like the attitude it's conveying."

Then, a month or two ago, I sat down and watched the movie without prejudice, without comparing it to real life, just considering it purely as a movie.\n\nI love it! It may not be close to real life, but it's quite enjoyable. Julie Andrews - a year after her breakthrough it Mary Poppins - stars as Marie, a nun who doesn't fit in at the convent, and who is assigned as a governess for 7 children - who don't want a governess. The children and Marie bond, and romance blossoms between Marie and the children's hard father, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). However, the Nazis are on the rise.\n\nIt's quite fun to watch, with lots of fun songs, and a nice story. I now quite enjoy it."

        "review_title": "A Sweeping Tale of Family, The Sound of Music is a Film to Fall in Love With.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music, Bob Wise's adaptation of the Rogers and Hammerstein musical, is so beloved, and has been for so long, that it almost seems wrong to look at it with a critical eye. It's not so much a movie as it is a cultural monument. But forget the monumental money it grossed, or the Oscars it won. There's something about The Sound of Music that cuts through the critical divide. I love this movie. No, it's not that I simply think it is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of family entertainment. I do, but unlike almost any other film I've seen, The Sound of Music makes me feel something like real, genuine love. When Julie Andrews sings, my heart swoons.\n\nBased loosely on the true story of the Von Trapps, and the stage musical that came from their remarkable exploits in Austria in the late 1930s, The Sound of Music is primarily a tale of family. For those few who haven't seen it, the story centers on the Von Trapp patriarch (Christopher Plummer), and Julie Andrews' nun-turned-governess Maria, as she teaches the family music, and brings life back into the Von Trapp home. The plot takes on a richly un-purposeful quality. Maria's connection with the Von Trapp children is the main thread through the picture, and it is given ample room to breathe and grow. Intimate as it is, the film's story of the Von Trapps' gradual shift from a strict and regimented household to a place of warmth and love, actually has something of an epic reach. At 3 hours long, including intermission, The Sound of Music is set against the rise of Nazi Germany. That length and historical reach, however, is not all that makes The Sound of Music feel epic.\n\nThe film benefits immensely from its locations. Salzburg is given the spotlight, and it is appropriately majestic. Framed against those famous Alps, the city is, pardon the clich\u00e9, a character unto itself. The Sound of Music does one thing that seems so simple, and yet very few movies achieve. It creates a tangible sense of place from its opulent sets and exquisitely photographed exteriors. Simply looking nice is not enough to give the audience the type of experience Bob Wise's production does. This is a patient film, one that savors its spectacular settings, immersing rather than just showing.\n\nAnd it is also patient with its characters, even more to its benefit. We are allowed to live with the Von Trapps, and really get to know the Von Trapp children, all well-cast and played. The familial relationships are built naturally over time. The meandering quality of the story is an asset. It's not a film where every scene counts, where every beat moves the story forward. It would be a lesser film if it was. Instead, The Sound of Music spends time with \"meaningless\" scenes. A frolic in the hills, impromptu musical numbers (The Lonely Goatherd puppet show is a totally unnecessary, but absolutely delightful interlude), and outings that convey only the remarkable charm of the actors and the splendid beauty of Austria. Part of the movie's success rests on our connection to these characters. Mercifully, nothing is rushed. These people make fabulous company, and the acting only makes our hearts grow fonder.\n\nAs stated before, the Von Trapp children are genuinely charming, never falling victim to the sugary artificiality that plagues many child actors. The supporting characters, including Eleanor Parker as The Baroness, strike the same note, colorful but not overbearing. Christopher Plummer is invaluable as the film's straight man. A rigid drill sergeant who gradually discovers love again, he provides the movie's most potent emotional beats. But I'm burying the lead. Julie Andrews is miraculous in the lead role. Maria is a more understated take on her Oscar-winning Mary Poppins, but Andrews is just as vivacious here. It's hard to play motherly, lovable, or fun. If you don't have a natural effervescence, the audience will reject it. Julie Andrews has it in every fiber of her being. Her performance is a tour de force. The film is about bringing life and love to a family that needs it. Andrews' performance does just that. She brings no less than life itself to the screen whenever she is on it. Along with her classically beautiful singing voice, Andrews' presence is uncommonly memorable. More so than perhaps any other movie character, I felt as if I myself had fallen in love with Maria. Julie Andrews is just that good.\n\nAll this is in service to the film's outstanding soundtrack. The songs are classics, we know them all by heart, even if we haven't seen the film. In the vein of the rest of the film, the music is bubbly and lovable. For me, the standout numbers are \"Do-Re-Mi\", with it's catchy lyrics and gorgeous montage of Salzburg locations, and \"I Have Confidence\", a new song that showcases Julie Andrews at her most girlishly buoyant. Even the smaller songs work their magic in context. The patriotic folk song, \"Edelweiss\", written by Rogers and Hammerstein specifically for the musical, is given a rousing rendition late, as is the titular song, \"The Sound of Music\", in a poignant scene halfway through the film. They're not all gold, but the songs in The Sound of Music are a class above most movie musicals.\n\nThe Sound of Music succeeds on terms that we don't often think to evaluate movies on. It is lovable to an extreme, not concerned with the strength of its script, but with the charm of its actors, the quality of its locations, and the sound of its music. Bob Wise's direction, as technically accomplished as it is, is not as important as the intangible spark of magic in Julie Andrews' eyes. The breathtaking cinematography is great, but what makes The Sound of Music truly special is the sense of family, and the love we have for them. It's hard to evaluate The Sound of Music critically, because its greatness extends beyond critical evaluation. I fell in love with this film, and like the real deal, I'll never be able to fully explain why.\n\n94/100"

When she sings of making dreams come true, she means it; this was based on a true story set against the backdrop of the Anschluss and Nazi terror.\n\nYou don't have to whistle to get me standing in line to attention, the music provides attention enough. All the children perform sweetly and it's particularly nice to see Angela Cartwright, such a poppet in Lost in Space, amongst them.\n\nFilm making should be inspirational, aspirational and, where appropriate, emotional. Where would Kleenex be without heart-strings being pulled left right and centre as Maria returns to the convent, only to change her mind and go back to the family.\n\nIronically, it wasn't the romance, the historic context or the narrative that induced tears. Rather, it was the encapsulation of significant songs by children in a sort of Never Never Land where music can overcome anything. And literally, make dreams come true."

Julie Andrews is Maria Von Trapp, and because she's just so adorable and optimistic, I won't say anything about her. Now, to the film.\n\nIt baffles me that Robert Wise's \"The Sound of Music\", of all the musicals, is the one that was for five years, not one of the but THE most successful movie of all-time. \"Singin' in the Rain\", Wise's more critically acclaimed \"West Side Story\" or the groundbreaking \"Mary Poppins\" should have been given this honor, at least. But never mind these considerations; it is certain that the film is a classic and one of the most defining American movies. But one would be aware of it, if every classic or defining movie was enjoyable. \"The Sound of Music\" could be enjoyable, if it wasn't too much demanding in terms of patience. Three hours is just too long to take without feeling the need to listen to the sound of your TV, your microwave, your radio car or your bones.\n\nSome long musicals are exceptions though, but \"West Side Story\" was featuring extremely memorable songs and was about two rival gangs and a love story in the middle, there was conflict, passion, youth and blood. \"The Sound of Music\" is about a Nun apprentice who becomes a governess to the seven children of a rich widower, naturally, they don't go along first, but he starts to develop a liking when he sees children singing, then they marry, the Anshluss come and they must fleet Austria to Switzerland, all singing and dancing. It's just like a dramatic take on \"Mary Poppins\" with a realistic back-story, but does that make the film entertaining for all that? It could though with more efforts on the characterization (because Plummer is certainly no Dick Van Dyke).\n\nThere are seven children, but none of them really tries to assert a personality, they actually form a one conglomerate character: the children (except for the older one), but there's no conflict, except for a few pranks that beg you to believe these kids, all as cute as buttons, were insufferable, it might as well try to convince you that Lassie is Cujo. Now, their father is so militarily strict and dour you know it's a matter of time before Julie Andrew' charming smile melts his iceberg fa\u00e7ade. But as heart-warming as it is, the film has a unique power to leave me cold, and I guess it must be my fault. I just don't get the appeal, but why someone would decide to endure three hours of non-stop syrupy songs and kids acting like mechanical toys. Andrews is the only lively thing in the film, besides the Hills\u0085 if that's what she said.\n\nI know there's Plummer but he looked like someone trying so hard not to fart during a dinner and it was so distracting that I couldn't take him seriously. He should consider himself lucky to have Maria.. Anyway,, I saw the film, without actually seeing it, for the second time. I felt the need to check a few e-mails, I did it during the songs most of the time, I needed to do something. And yes, people went to see this film in all over the world and enjoyed it, I just saw someone complaining about the hatred on IMDb, stating that we live in a world that has became too cynical. I don't consider myself cynical, good sentiments are one thing, but there's a point where you can't take them without feeling bored. Besides, the film was panned by viewers at its release, many of whom had enjoyed previous musicals, so, I have an alibi.\n\n1965 wasn't perhaps the most appealing cinematic year, I can't even think of an acclaimed masterpiece (\"Cat Ballou\"? \"Ship of Fools\"?) so I guess there was room for a film like \"The Sound of Music\", the last agonizing sound of old-Hollywood before people would get tired of musicals, before the 'New Hollywood' era. Maybe it's because I'm such a sucker for this period that I can't enjoy all the likes of \"My Fair Lady\" or \"Dr. Doolittle\", but two years later, another film would begin with a song, not \"The Sound of Music\", but the sound of Silence, \"The Graduate\" paving the way to an era of creativity and originality.\n\nAnd I'd think silence over any music from \"the sound of music\"."

Their worst perpetration here was impatience at the music festival, and we expected that. By the time of Spielberg's List, we got the psychopaths (which they were) that we expected.\n\nFor uncomfortable cinematic notions, consider Polanski's Pianist; the notion that the culture that produced Bach, Beethoven, etc. could bomb the radio station broadcasting Chopin.

Is this film anywhere near the real story that actually took place? No. However, as a story for the screen, it holds its own separate life. People say the songs suck. I dig them all.\n\nI think I like this movie cause I love music. I also think this film hearkens back to a more innocent time. Or maybe thats being a slight bit nostalgic.

I could hardly stay dry with the divine harmonies sung. There is also not a bad performance in the film. Julie Andrews steals the show of course, but all the kids and Christopher Plummer are splendid as well. The restoration of the original film was beautiful to behold on the silver screen. It looked like a brand new movie. The colors popped and the motion was all very smooth without any visible grain. I was able to experience what an intermission was meant to accomplish in the theaters of old, a chance to purchase concessions and stretch the legs. This film will always be so dear to my heart and something I could never forget. My 90 year old grandmother recounted her love of this classic as we left the theater. She named my mother, her youngest of seven children, after the youngest child in this movie, the youngest of seven also. This is mandatory viewing in my family. It always brings me such joy, no matter how many times I see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a fan of Musical films, I kept putting this movie off; waiting for just the right time to guarantee a fabulous and magical experience I usually get from such movies. So, I was shocked when I found myself not instantly invested. The first sequence was so corny that rubbed me the wrong way, and I thought this is going to be the case with the rest of this movie. Fortunately, when I relaxed and just continued watching, the movie sucked me in in no time. Few and repetitive the songs are; they are, nonetheless, quite memorable and infectious. Also, the movie has some of the most hummable tunes ever written, and a fair amount of charming musical numbers which, unlike some of those in Mary Poppins, never overstay their welcome and don't seem stretched.\n\nI'm able to digest schmaltzy, sugar-coated family and children films, I'm a huge fan of Disney Classics. But The Sound of Music isn't only a sugar-coated sweet musical film; it's coated and filled with sugar and chocolate even Willy Wonka's factory can't afford. Needless to say, I didn't find it so easy to enjoy this movie. I found many things hard to swallow such as the infuriating expository dialogue, that seem completely out of place amidst the glimmers of wit the characters show every now and then. However, I found almost every story-line quite riveting. There are some cheesy; yet so effective and engaging enchanting romances, and this movie really did take some risks and dealt with some serious issues through the protagonist Maria, played by the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Julie Andrews!\n\nThe story could be annoyingly predictable, but some aspects contain of original ingredients, while some others are encapsulated in a genuine framed to seem as fresh as ever. Another issue I had with this movie is that Ernest Lehman seems to be sure that we already believe that \"The Magic of Music\" can change one's mind in a blink of an eye. I know that the slightest cynicism would ruin this movie, but this is really more than I can handle.\n\nAll the above-mentioned problems pale in comparison with the major issue I have with this high-fructose musical. As I said, I was quite captivated and invested in the story with each one of its likable characters, and my heart was totally warmed. Then came the third act and brought the Nazis with it. I don't know how on earth could the Nazism have anything to do with this movie! Plausibility and reason aside, the \"serious\" tone that prevailed the third act clashed awfully with the sentimentality the movie is submerged in. Plus, Robert Wise failed to make his movie adjust with the serious tone, and ended up tackling the heavy themes in a most heavy-handed way. As a result, the movie left a bitter taste in my mouth after treating me with some unhealthy doses of sweet that I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe performances are impressively energetic and also sincere. The kids are all wonderful, especially Charmian Carr as Liesl, Angela Cartwright as Brigitta and Nicholas Hammond as Friedrich. Unlike Mary Poppins, Maria is plainly a flawed character, and this is exactly the role I needed to make sure that Julie Andrews is a really a talented actress who can effortlessly and gracefully conveys a lot of emotions with her magical sincerity. Christopher Plummer's performance, though, is the one who really standout for me. First things first, young Christopher Plummer looks exactly like Michael Fassbender and Christian Bale combined! :) Secondly, he gave one of the most charismatic performances I've ever seen as Captain Von Trapp. Thirdly, he elevated his character and brought it to life, although it is hindered badly by the script's issues. Eleanor Parker was really great as The Baroness, a character that might seem to be problematic at first glance, but I think it's actually a multi-layered character that really has some depth that gave the movie something special.\n\nThe Sound of Music is massively flawed, inconsistent corn-syrupy musical with a derivative and familiar story. But it's also irresistible, enthralling and undeniably charming family classic that, surprisingly, feels genuine!\n\n(7/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you haven't watched this film yet, you may have seen the scene of a woman running through the fields. You may know it's a musical. But did you know Sound of Music is partly about Austrian nationalism against Nazis? How about that it is based on a real family? This movie is quite an interesting ride. Besides the quality of cinematography and acting, there are two things that set this musical apart from other films: one is, of course, its iconic catchy songs and the other is its surprising depth.\n\nAs for the songs, you may find yourself humming just moments after they are finished, before the movie is even over. They do not overpower your brain but there are definitely some musical hooks involved in the melodies. The songs are quite different from one another, in style and rhythm. Perhaps one weakness is that all the songs are happy songs and the movie struggles adapting its happy music to the more serious moments in the film.\n\nThe movie does this trick where the characters sing the same song twice (at least) but the second time they sing it in a different situation, modifying the meaning of the song or adding more meaning. While the effect of this is quite good, the change is only a minor one in the meaning and not the mood, because most of the songs are too happy to make any change to the mood made. And even to change the meaning, the creators end up needing to modify the song. Only one song, Edelweiss, ends up sounding completely different when played the second time and without any modification to it.\n\nAs for the depth of the film, it is felt in a number of spots: in the slowly emerging nationalistic sub-story, in the psychological situation of the main male character, in the subtle humour and children's commentary.\n\nIf you have only seen little bits of this movie and its title you can be forgiven for thinking that it is just a sappy love story in a form of a musical, and for the first half of the film it is kind of heading that way, but it turns out to be much more than that.\n\nI don't like musicals, but even I cannot deny the greatness and quality of the Sound of Music."

He was trying to entertain audiences.....thats all. Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when \"musicals\" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place. The 70s were a true golden age for high class films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amazingly, perhaps the two best musicals ever with no or minimal stage dancing were released in successive years, 1964 & '65, each winning the Oscar for best picture. Both were essentially yet another take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, the lead female starting out as a 'nobody', taken under the wing of a domineering bachelor, who either makes a conscious effort to mold her into his ideal woman(\"My Fair Lady) or allows himself to fall in love with what she makes of herself and her beauty(this film). Judging by their comparative mean ratings at IMDB and the much greater number of raters for the present film, I have to conclude that the present film is the more popular of the two. Not surprising to me, as it clearly has a more fun screenplay, which includes a variety of children, lacking in the other film.. Captain von Trapp clearly is a much nicer man than the megalomaniacal Henry Higgins, who seems to fall in love with his creation, but doesn't consumate his attraction to her in the film. Captain von Trapp is a changed man, for the better, thanks to Maria's personality. In contrast, Henry Higgins is still the egotistical misanthrope at the end, gloating over his 'impossible' creation.\n\nOn the other hand, I would judge the body of songs of \"My Fair Lady\" to be approximately equal to that of the present film(Boo!). At nearly 3 hr. Long, both films were perhaps too long to sit through comfortly in a theater chair. Fortunately, we can now buy copies and watch portions at our leisure, hopefully in more comfort than theater chairs!"

And that adds an extra layer of humour to this musical offering.\n\nJulie Andrews (Maria) plays the Governess who bonds with the seven children but the family need to escape from the Nazi Anschluss, uniting Austria with Germany. The film gets some good tense moments towards the end as the Von Trapps make their escape. Otherwise, it's a song fest with mostly terrible songs that become annoyingly catchy. I do like \"Eidelweiss\", though.\n\n\"Tea - a drink with jam and bread\" - 'jam and bread', 'jam and bread'.\n\n\"Jam and bread, jam and bread, jam and bread!\"\n\nHa ha - that musical festival at the end of the film must be the most rubbish music festival ever.

There are those who have criticized the film for being too \"schamltzy\" but the magical moments far exceed the few that might seem amateurish.\n\nAmong the performances, Andrews is rightly renowned as a good-hearted and soulful individual who tends to rebel against rigid rules. Plummer is sharp in his subtle wit. Peggy Wood, as the mother abbess, is easily convincing as a spiritual leader with heart and wisdom. And Eleanor Parker does a fine job as a snotty, spoiled one-percenter.\n\nLikewise, the scenery of Salzburg and its nearby mountains and villages are breathtaking. But it's the musical numbers that give this movie its rightful status as a classic. Among the highlights: the opening scene of the title song and the overture - both accompanied by stunning background scenery; the nuns singing beautiful Latin hymns followed by the more comical \"Maria\" which is also movingly repeated in a wedding scene; the truly joyous \"Do-Re-Mi\" which can bring out the child in all of us.\n\nMost moving of all is the show-stopping \"Climb Every Mountain\". It is magically sung by Margery MacKay who dubbed for Wood in a pivotal moment. When the song is used again for the affirming conclusion (following that joyfully impish line \"I have sinned, Reverend Mother\"), the movie's ending leaves one with a feeling of spirit and joy that is wonderfully rare. - dbamateurcritic\n\nOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Songs by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein."

Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably. Most stage musicals have failed in their transitions to film for example \" Annie\", but Sound of Music set the standard for future musicals to try and achieve."

        "review_detailed_main": "Growing up, the Sound of Music was an integral part of my childhood. I'd visit my grandmother every weekend & we must've watched the movie every visit for as long as I can remember. When I was in choir in elementary school, I was one of the few kids that already knew all the words to Do-Re-Mi & Favorite Things the year we performed them. Edelweiss & Sound of Music are also amongst my favorites, although every song is really good. And I should mention that the top thing on my bucket list is to travel to Salzburg and splash the Horse Fountain that Julie Andrews splashes during the Confidence song.\n\nThis movie made me fall in love with Salzburg. I don't just want to splash the fountain, I wanna see the whole city. The country side is beautiful and the architecture (especially in the church) is stunning! I know the musical is slightly different from the original story of the real life von Trapps'. Either way, both the real story & its adaption are great stories.\n\nWhile there are some deep dramatic moments throughout given the Nazi climate, this movie has it's funny moments. Julie Andrews & Christopher Plummer worked really well together during comedic moments. The \"you mean to tell me my children were running around Salzburg wearing nothing but some old drapes\" scene is a classic. And I've definitely made the \"it's been so cold lately they turned blue!\" reference a few times when eating blueberries.\n\nI'd probably site all the musical numbers as my favorite scenes. The dance duet between Maria and the Captain is also another great scene, and their wedding was gorgeous. These days I tie the wedding scene to the time Andrews returned to walk down the church to remanence during an anniversary special. I've also grown to appreciate Maria's arc as a whole as I've grown up. She was an outcast that \"followed every rainbow til she found her dream,\" and as I'm in the process of doing the same, I relate to her story much more than I did as a kid.\n\nI must end with Julie Andrews. She takes my breath away. This is definitively her greatest role. Of course her entire career is magnificent, but there's just something about her portrayal of Maria that stands out. And her voice... I could write a thesis as to why I love her. To be in her presence would leave me deceased. She's a queen."

Soon, the couple's feelings for each other deepened, and the following year they married in Salzburg, Austria. But life didn't become what they'd expected. First, Georg von Trapp lost his fortune during the Great Depression, and then Nazi Germany annexed their homeland. In 1938, however, they managed to escape to the USA, where Maria and the children formed a musical group, giving live concerts in order to support the family.\n\nSister Maria writes about all this in her autobiography \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\". The rights to the book were bought by 20th Century Fox who wanted to make a musical out of it. The film, called \"The Sound of Music\", was to have Julie Andrews in the lead role (she was hot, after her success in \"Mary Poppins\" the year before). The part of Georg von Trapp, initially planned for Yul Brynner, was then offered to Canadian character actor Christopher Plummer.\n\nDirector Robert Wise utilized the beauty of the alpine landscape around Salzburg to the max. Filmed in DeLuxe Color, \"The Sound of Music\" opens with a smart helicopter shot of Julie Andrews' hill-top performance of the title song. But then things ground to a halt. Due to persistent heavy rain in Austria, the film crew was forced to stay on location much longer than the six weeks that was budgeted for. And time is money, even for a major Hollywood studio.\n\nFortunately, \"The Sound of Music\" became an outstanding, worldwide success. Although most critics were hostile, that didn't stop people from rushing to the theaters in droves. In December 1965, \"The Sound of Music\" was the number-one domestic box office movie of all time (in adjusted dollars). In addition, the RCA soundtrack album had sold more than twenty million copies. None of the many musicals that followed came even close to matching its popularity."

But never mind that there is a silly puppet show to get laughs from!\n\nI don't know if it is because the world is going through a resurgent far right at the moment or what but re-watching the film the other day the entire concept of the movie, that is a light family musical, struck me as the the wrong concept for this story and time period. It comes across as tone deaf, morally repugnant and artistically flaccid. The Von Trapp story needed to be told with far, far less sugar or not at all. This aspect basically renders the joys of the film for naught.\n\nThere are two aspects of the film that seem to counteract this problem, but alas not enough. The first is Plummer's performance, which is imbued with his loathing of Andrews, the material and the kids. His icy captain does a lot to help make the sugar a little less sweet. Second, Wise does a far amount of mise-en-scene (especially the beginning) in which darkness are always on the edges of the frame. It helps give the impression of danger-evil closing in that gives the goofy musical comedy a hint of irony.\n\nThis film has gotten far worse with age."

After the new governess, Sister Maria, appears in his premises, he finds her his new target and dumps the baroness, then succeeds in winning this innocent nun's love with another performance. (Look how he acts to Maria under the moonlight in the garden)\n\nI like all those music numbers and the family's three youngest girls in the movie very much, but this Captain von Trapp is really a phony. Plummer and director Wise should take most of the responsibility."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a running joke at my house: every time I watch The Sound of Music, I remark, \"I liked this movie more than ever this time around!\" My mom laughs at me, since I seem surprised that it's such a good movie. When I was a kid, however, I didn't like it that much, which is why I am always surprised by how wonderful it is when I watch it all grown-up. As a child, I fell asleep during the long running time, and I didn't understand the wartime setting. The only musical number I loved was \"I Have Confidence,\" and I would have been perfectly happy to see that song on a continuous loop for three hours.\n\nAs an adult, \"I Have Confidence\" is still my favorite song and scene of the film, and I never get tired of appreciating all Julie Andrews put into the physicality and expressive singing. It's very funny that that song is my favorite, since it wasn't included in the original stage musical; but to me, it perfectly showcases Maria's character. She's eager to help, anxious to be liked, headstrong, well-intentioned, enthusiastic, and adorable. Without that song, it might take a longer time to understand why the children love her and why the captain thaws. But in three minutes, before she even rings the doorbell, she's irresistible.\n\nIt's not a necessity to love Julie's performance, but it adds extra appreciation if you've seen The Sound of Music on the stage. It's incredibly different, not only because her songs were originally written for an alto, and not only because she doesn't twirl on top of the Swiss Alps singing the title song, but because all the infectious energy and great loving nature comes directly from Julie Andrews. It's not exactly written into Maria von Trapp, but Julie put it there.\n\nFrom child to adult, I always loved Eleanor Parker playing the elegant, classy baroness. Her clothes are so beautiful, and she uses a subtle delivery to change a villainous character into a sympathetic one. While I'm sure other actresses would have loved to play the baroness, like Joan Fontaine or Anne Baxter, Eleanor was extremely likable. I can't imagine anyone else convincing the audience that Julie Andrews should return to the nunnery.\n\nThankfully, the story is about Maria and her relationship with the entire von Trapp family. If the main plot focused on the captain, I wouldn't like the movie nearly as much. Every time I watch it, I try to find something in Christopher Plummer's performance to like, but I never do. Peter Finch would have been wonderful, with more pain and less flippancy - and he can sing, too! Another fantastic choice would have been Curd Jurgens, who also sings, and who would have spoken in an authentic accent. And, given his personal background, there would be added emotional drama in the last portion of the film; if he sang goodbye to his country in front of Nazi officers, it would have an entirely different meaning.\n\nBut with all there is to love about the movie, does anyone (besides me) care about a little botch in the casting department? Robert Wise's imaginative directing turns lackluster (no offense) songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\" into a sightseeing tour-de-force, and the beautiful sets of the von Trapp estate really show the audience what the family is willing to leave behind. Julie Andrews breathes new life into all her songs, whether she's on top of a mountain or merely conducting a puppet show. Even folks who don't like \"The Lonely Goatherd\" love the way it's filmed in the movie, with such attention to detail as the kids \"control\" the puppets. The first half is whimsical, the second half is suspenseful, and each viewing is totally absorbing. Although it faced stiff competition at the 1965 awards season, the Hot Toasty Rag board members agreed with the Academy Awards (a rare occurrence) that it was indeed the best picture of the year."

        "review_title": "An ULTIMATELY UNEVEN cinematic adaptation of the musical",
        "review_detailed_main": "Most fans give this 10/10 on the basis of nostalgia alone, without any careful analysis of the film's merits and demerits. It is neither a faithful reproduction of the spectacular original musical, like 1964's \"My Fair Lady\" was, nor does it transcend the stage musical for it replaces 3 amazing songs by Rodgers & Hammerstein with 2 inferior songs by Rodgers (and Saul Chaplin), totally diminishing the pivotal supporting characters Baroness Elsa Schraeder and Max in the process (it is these characters who provide a realistic middle-ground between the piety and optimism of Maria, the nuns and the kids on the one hand, and the atrocity of the Nazis on the other hand).\n\nIt is a testament to Eleanor Parker's star power alone that she could make such an impact in a musical without singing or even lip-synching a single note, and that she was able to rise above the fact that the screenwriter weakened the complex, nuanced, multifaceted stage version of the Baroness, reducing Elsa to a third rate soap opera villainess. Had the Baroness been played by someone like Joan Collins, the result would have been totally trashy, due to the dumbed-down screenplay.\n\nAnd now for the leads! I saw Plummer live in Los Angeles when he did his one man show about a decade ago - brilliant raconteur, but Julie Andrews was an even better raconteuse when SHE did a Q&A in L. A (about 5 years ago). Plummer's performance as Von Trapp is one of the finest performances in film history - I think he and Eleanor Parker are what make the film so priceless in the last analysis. Maybe like Julie said, his cynicism actually HELPED him because his overly enthusiastic screen performance as Hamlet - around the same time - was *INSUFFERABLY HAMMY*. I could not believe that Plummer who was so subtle and real and prefect as Captain von Trapp would play Hamlet like a SCHOOLBOY BUFFOON.\n\nJulie Andrews is definitely the more mature professional of the two, and of course she had the voice of a century, but I much prefer Mary Martin's more soulful and contemplative version of \"The Sound of Music\" title song - and although Andrews' acting was brilliant in the first two thirds of the film, I feel like she REALLY SUFFERS in the last third of the narrative......Robert Wise seemed to have suddenly stopped directing her and focused all his attention on Plummer at that point, it seems (which is a flaw in the film version overall; Maria is suddenly completely sidelined after marrying the Captain, even though she had driven the narrative up until then).\n\nOverall, I have much more regard for Andrews as an artist, but I don't think THE SOUND OF MUSIC was her finest showcase as a singer-actress overall. It was 75% there at most. I think her finest film/performance overall was \"STAR!\" which was made a few years later, even though it didn't do well at all in the box office - probably because the character was so radically different from Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp - but I do think Plummer in \"The Sound of Music\" gave one of the best Leading Man turns in film history.\n\nRobert Wise and the production team clearly wanted to present the film as a \"modern European fairytale\", relying on wonderful and evocative cinematography to compensate for a problematic script and lopsided characterizations!\n\nMany cinema enthusiasts who are visually driven above all tend to overlook all kinds of flaws as long as a film LOOKS GOOD - and of course Robert Wise is no David Lean even on that front, although I think Wise did a much better job visually speaking with \"Helen of Troy\" nearly a decade ago. This film can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a documentary style travelogue of Salzburg, or a typical 1960s soap opera, or a paint-by-numbers song list.\n\nThe reason I'm giving it 7 stars out of 10 is because the talent involved is ultimately strong enough to make the final result genuinely memorable. This is a musical that works better on stage for me, where the focus can be squarely on the psychology and interior lives of the characters, without the director feeling compelled to broaden the visual scope at every turn (which often happens at the expense of the characters in this adaptation!!). Maria von Trapp is supposed to be a soulful heroine, which really comes through in every good stage production, but here it sometimes just comes across as \"good old Julie Andrews\" simply singing and doing her thing, submerged by the mountains and the director's desire to go toe to toe with David Lean.\n\nThe character of Brigitta is also woefully butchered, diminished and stunted here, which totally dilutes the impact of the children on the narrative - whereas in the stage version, Brigitta first calls out Maria on some lapses of logic during her DO-RE-MI singing lesson (a lapse of logic which is completely ignored in this film), while later on during the party sequence, it is BRIGITTA who originally pointed out the fact that Maria is falling in love with the Captain.\n\nThe ending of the narrative is also ruined here by a pivotal character turning out to be a TRAITOR rather than a HERO as in the stage version - thereby making it easier for another character to \"move on\" from the traitor, rather than have to sacrifice the more heroic version of the same character (which would have made the ending much more bittersweet and touching, versus a stereotypical GOOD VERSUS EVIL ending as provided here).\n\nI could go on and on, but I do think the film is ULTIMATELY OVERRATED. Robert Wise knows how to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but he is always hit-or-miss when it comes to appealing to more discerning and sophisticated people."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maria (Julie Andrews) lives in Austria. She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a \"problem\", as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed. So, any day, any time, any season, seek this one out for you and all those you love."

But what you have to recognise is that the film IS a musical and so you have to expect the songs. They are after all well-written, and have good melodies.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is the last musical of the legendary team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein to be made into a film. The two artists and impresarios of musical performances are regarded by most in the theater and film world as the masters of the musical play. While not the originators of such, as a team they polished and perfected the musical play.\n\nThis movie has great music with some memorable songs and tremendous settings and scenery. The performance by Julie Andrews as the female lead is superb, and Christopher Plummer as naval Captain Von Trapp is excellent. All of the children who sing and the rest of the cast are outstanding This is a wonderful musical film with captivating music and songs.\n\nThe great mark that distinguishes Rodgers and Hammerstein films is that they deal with family, social and moral issues. Here those are family, war, oppression, prejudice, and freedom. \"The Sound of Music\" is based on the memoirs of Maria von Trapp and her family of singers. The von Trapps fled Austria after Nazi Germany occupied the country at the start of World War II. So, this film is historical and biographical as well. This film is arguably the best musical ever made, and it is among the most successful movies ever made.\n\nThe movie received five Oscars in the 1966 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director; and it won two Golden Globes from the Hollywood foreign press association - for best picture and for Julie Andrews as best actress. It is one of the most successful movies of all time, grossing more than 35 times its budget worldwide.\n\nIt topped the U.S box office in 1965 with ticket sales of more than $145 million. The next closest box office hit that year was \"Doctor Zhivago\" at just over $126 million. Third place for the year was the James Bond action thriller, \"Thunderball,\" with just over $76 million in the domestic box office. Only two other films all years finished above $30 million in U.S. ticket sales - \"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\" at nearly $38 million and \"The Great Race\" at nearly $31 million.\n\nThis is a wonderful film that the whole family should enjoy. It will be shown and watched far into the future."

Although \"Mary Poppins\" is a fairy tale, and \"The Sound of Music\" is realistic, the stories essentially have many similarities. The same goes for the characters, especially for the main role, which is why I decided on this title. Both films have excellent cinematography and directing and cheerful, upbeat music full of life. However, as much as they are similar, they won't bore you even if you watch them one after the other. The streets of London and the imaginary landscapes here have been replaced by the endless pastures of the Eastern Alps and the stone of old Salzburg, over which the threat of the Third Reich looms. But don't worry, this is still a feel-good musical and love conquers all, so if you embark on this adventure, expect three hours of positive emotions and pure children's joy captured on film just for your enjoyment.\n\n9/10"

I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness.\n\nIt's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner.\n\n8/10"

I would have thought it was just a joke, but then the list also contained Batman and Robin. I guess I don't know much about acting, directing, producing or even criticizing movies. One thing I can objectively say is that this movie was for me the most 'rewatchable'. I could watch it over and over again without being tired of it (my sister could actually recite the whole movie word for word). After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good. I can however boldly say that this movie should automatically accompany every purchase of a VCR or DVD player!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as \"Favourite Things\" and \"So Long, Farewell\" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say \"hello\" to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.\n\nRobert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen, as evidenced here and by his earlier \"West Side Story.\" He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen, and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations. In \"Music,\" the Austrian scenery is dazzling, and nearly becomes a character in itself. And the music sounds great, though it's not one of Rodger's & Hammerstein's best scores (it falls well below \"The King and I\" and \"Carousel.\") Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria. She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable. And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader. My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max (Richard Haydn) and whispers sarcastically, \"Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica?\"\n\nI forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear, but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then.\n\nGrade: A-"

        "review_detailed_main": "The classic late observation was also completed in stages. Except that three hours is indeed too long, it is important to note that this is a film with outstanding advantages and disadvantages. The excellent part is so excellent. Dorami Edelweiss is a lonely shepherd, densely packed between 60 and 90 minutes. Just recall how many popular songs have been left behind in classic musical films in history? What is the second famous song in the rain? The Sound of Music has dedicated enough works to compete with the top three in only 30 minutes, which is great. On the other hand, the story process used to produce famous songs is, to be honest, somewhat tedious. The anti Nazi theme frames certain emotional expressions on one hand. In addition, at the character level, the Colonel's personality is too hard and reserved, while Plummer is tall and handsome but not attractive enough; Maria only shows her charm when singing with her children (Andrews' love for the play is ordinary), and the couple's emotional spark is not enough. In addition, her competitor, the Marquis, is deliberately defeated everywhere, even if the love path is winding, it cannot make the audience more empathetic and expectant. Seven children have shown a sense of difference, but are limited to age and form, personality or emotional likes and dislikes, or are they biased towards monotony - why must they all love Maria?"

It actually had some genuine tension when the NAZI's where using their influence. But first and foremost it is a love story between two people from different classes. Mary Poppins, sorry, Julie Andrews, as Maria, leaves the parish as she was on track to become a nun and begins to work for a widowed naval captain as the governess to watch over his seven children. He is extremely strict and regimented and she is more free-spirited and takes a different approach in his job. Slowly, she is able to melt away the captain's steely demeanor. This is a pleasant romance tale with some catchy numbers that progress the story. Certainly a good family viewing."

        "review_title": "Never tired of this classic film",
        "review_detailed_main": "We all know classic things are those that have been on the market for decades or even centuries yet that never get obsolete. And this film is definitely one of them. I just revisited this visually pleasing, acoustically resonating and emotionally touching film with joy and probably a bit of tears tonight. I can't remember how many times I have watched it but still I'm not tired of it. In fact the more I watch the more I like it. It is a classic film in all aspects. Not only is the storyline a classic topic but also many of its songs have become household memories well into the present time, Do-Re-Mi, Edelweiss and So Long, Farewell, just time name a few. It is classic also in terms of the cast, many of whom have become symbols of classic actors and actresses, Julie Andrews for example. So let's delve into the storyline first. People might have to ask: what has softened an outwardly tough captain's heart? I believe we all know it's a little simple word - love. And the medium? Music. To me music connects all of us. It transcends borders. It surpasses languages. It bridges gaps. And it brings healings. It is truly transnational, cross-cultural and inter-generational. This cannot be more vividly expressed in the scene where Captain von Trapp argued with the governess along the lakeside over the way the children are taught when a song by the children levitates into their ears and finally breaks this quarrel and turns things around. It is music that brings joy and happiness, fun and laugher back to a once rigidly trained and militarily managed family. This movie is also very touching in that the remarriage brings love back to children who once lost their mother. It is also encouraging and inspiring when the von Trapp family leaves everything they love behind to flee Nazi German ruling and pursue freedom in another country, which somehow reminds me of many current Hong Kongers. One thing that makes me so obsessed with this fils is its art form - musical. I find myself relentlessly fond of musical movies. Many of the songs in this film have been classic. Take Do-Re-Mi for example. It comes into being in the backdrop of teaching music beginners how to sing. The words and the tone are so cute and pretty. Just visualize those little things, doe, ray, me, far, sew and tea. Which one if them doesn't sound instructional? Edelweiss is another highlight which expresses a mature man like Captain von Trapp's deep love for his country. And Sixteen Going on Seventeen sings out a teenage girl's longing for her first love. Last but not least let's not forget about the mind-soothing So Long, Farewell for bedtime. Little Gretl is just such an adorable baby. As for cast and crew Dame Julie Andrews she is indeed a landmark actress who is dearly loved and remembered by all people for her tremendous talent for singing, acting and even writing. She's got the look, she's got the class and she's got the stamina to be a classic figure. And she's so British. I always think U.K. exceeds in history, culture and literature over the US although the latter enjoys far greater political influence and technological supremacy. And anecdotally I was asking people some time ago to name three of their best loved movies and my answer was 1. Sound of Music (1965) 2. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) 3. Mary Poppins Returns (2018) Well done The Sound of Music (1965). I have every reason to believe that you will continue to be a classic film for many years and decades to come. May the world be filled with the sound of music instead of infighting. The hills are alive with the sound of music. So are we."

        "review_title": "The Sound of Joy!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Who said that schmaltz was such a bad thing? In the world of film, too much of schmaltz or saccharine is often viewed in a negative light. In 1965's The Sound of Music, the film is practically running with sentimental/saccharine feelings.....and I love the movie every bit for that. This movie is viewed as the best musical of all time, and I can agree to that statement. The word that can describe the movie is joy. From the moment Julie Andrews popped on screen, waving her arms in the air against the beautiful mountain background and beginning the title song, a smile creeped upon my face and it stayed there for two hours and fifty-two minutes. The joy is infectious and each character has a sense of happiness despite the Nazis lurking in the background. This is the type of musical you'll remember forever. I saw this movie once as a child and twenty years later, was able to sing along to such joyful songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Edelweiss\", \"So Long, Farewell,\" and of course, \"The Sound of Music.\" With all these songs, composed by the brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein, the movie moved with a brisk pace despite the running time and left an imprint on all musicals to come.\n\nThe movie is loosely based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp, and I emphasize the word loosely. Many historical facts were changed for dramatic purposes and director Robert Wise made a trip to see Maria to tell her this movie is not a biography and will be the better for it. From the memoir that was published in 1949, the famed Broadway show opened in 1959 and ran for three and a half years being a huge hit with fans and critics alike. Ernest Lehman was hired to write the screenplay, Robert Wise to direct, and the rest is history. Some may find Lehman's script to be compared with dripping maple syrup from the Vermont woods or Wise's direction to be corny, but I think they were perfect for the film.\n\nIn 1930's Austria before the onset of Anchluss, there is a young woman named Maria (Julie Andrews) who works as a nun but is clearly not the type of woman for that profession. A Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) seeks a governess to care for his seven children. Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) convinces Maria to take the job. Von Trapp runs a tight ship and the children show their unhappiness by driving away their previous governesses. However, Maria is able to warm up to the children by showing them love and the joy of music. More to that, Georg and Maria begin to fall for each other despite the postulant nature of Maria's and Georg's engagement to a baroness (Eleanor Parker). But world events may soon run its course. Nazi Germany is about to annex Austria and Von Trapp may be needed to commandeer the German Navy's ships.\n\nThe joy shown throughout the film is seen through the performances of nearly every character. If you thought Julie Andrews signature role was 1964's Mary Poppins, guess again. She was fantastic in that movie and that magical role is what gave her this role as Maria, but really transcends herself. From the start to finish, you are in complete awe of her. The joy she brings to Maria and her voice is powerful. I said many good things about Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago, but I think Andrews should have won on second watch. Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is also great. He was a veteran Broadway performer, but his performance as Georg Von Trapp introduced him to the world of movies. The seven Von Trapp children were all surprisingly good, although it's a shame none of them would go on to have distinguished or lengthy careers, but at least we have them to remember with these iconic roles. My favorite child is the eldest child, Liesel played wonderfully by Charmaine Carr. She brought a realistic vibe of finding love. Just listen to her beautiful rendition of \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen.\"\n\nI was really impressed with The Sound of Music. It impressed audiences in 1965, and it still impresses people in 2018. In the world of negativity, this is the kind of movie we need. The movie has the ability to put a smile on a person's face through music or through love. Schmaltz is oozing from these songs, but in a great way. All because there is joy to be seen and heard. Julie Andrews is the heart and soul of the movie, and it's her magnificent role that drives the film. In addition to the music, the Austrian views are breathtaking and they also add to the joy of the film. If you like musicals, or films in general, check out The Sound of Music.\n\nMy Grade: A"

I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it."

About a nun name Maria, who is sent to become a governess to 7 kids of the Von Trapp family who only has a father who has lost his wife. This is one movie I can still remember watching in my young days. Watching it over again with the family, you will remember those old tunes you might have sung back when you were still a young boy/girl. The Sound of Music is a really enjoyable movie which I highly recommend to watch with family or friends. I think young adults who have watched The Sound of Music before in their young days, and now have kids and family, they will watch the movie and will remember all the lovely and wonderful songs they use to listen or sing along to. Julie Andrews was just really perfect for the role of Maria, especially Christopher Plummers as Captain Von. Trapp, and also the children. This movie has family, music and love. Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made. The movie gets known every year as young kids watch it while growing up and then they show it to their kids when they have a family, which makes the movie more popular. Overall the Best movie of all time, which will never get old and will never be forgotten."

        "review_detailed_main": "The beautiful music is at the heart of The Sound Of Music. Richard Rodgers' gorgeous and varied melodies, and Oscar Hammerstein's exquisite and witty lyrics don't just dazzle you - they move the story along. Even Eidelweiss, such a simple ballad, is a gem. The Sound Of Music is a wonderful (kind of) true story: a nun, Maria, wins the hearts of a sad, strict widower and his seven children who she is sent to mind as governess. It's a classic look back at the sadness of exile and oppression, the triumph of goodness over evil and the joy that just one woman, Maria, makes in people's lives. As Maria, Julie Andrews has great chemistry with Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The child actors are great. The choreography and the script are both a bit regimented - probably because this was a polished stage show before the movie. Overall, this is one of the classic movie musicals, possibly the best ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the heart warming story of an Austrian nun (Julie Andrews) who enters the Von Trapp family as the governess of Georg Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) seven mischievous yet adorable children, and ends up entering their hearts with her warm personality and sugar coated music. At the risk of sounding cheesy, 'The Sound of Music' is regarded as one of the most loved cinematic treats of all times. Full of now- popular songs and laced with extravagant background score, the film has its own soul.\n\nThe beautiful cinematography takes you to a trip of the magnificent land of Austria during the time of the Second World War. The hummable songs include the all time favorites like 'the Lonely Goatherd', 'So long, farewell' and many more. No matter how stone hearted you are, you get emotionally attached to the adorable children of the Von Trapp family.\n\nFor more reviews visit: 'rohit mehta reviews. blogspot. com'\n\nThough, a few points cannot be overlooked. Julie Andrews' portrayal of Maria, the carefree and loving nun, comes out to be more artificial and over-the-top than realistic. Based on the hit musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein II on the memoirs of Maria Von Trapp, the film is naive in characterization as almost all the characters displayed are one dimensional. The only character balancing the cheese being oozed by almost everyone is Christopher Plummer's Cpt. Georg Von Trapp.\n\nAll throughout the film, Plummer seems detached from the surroundings which helps his character. No matter how popular, hummable or adorable the songs are; some of them just catch you defenseless. Unlike the hit musicals like 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Wizard of Oz', some of the famous songs in the film are out of context at times. It is always hard to explain in a musical why a song is relevant, but some of the inappropriate situations for the songs make them just unacceptable. The children singing in the festival or in a party sounds reasonable, but a senior mother of the church singing valuable lessons of life to her confused nun, is just too unrealistic for me to stomach.\n\nSome other characters like The Baroness and the postman have sudden change of values at the appropriate points in the film. There is a 70% chance that you will like this highly entertaining and lovable family film. But if you are a fan of more realistic and easy to digest stories, even if it is about a computer program controlling the world, this is not your cup of tea. For a musical enthusiast too, this is not one of the best musicals you'll see."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never saw this movie, when it first came out back in the mid- 60s but I know my mother has a VHS copy of the movie as its part of the \"Family Feature\" release. Did I watch it as a kid? No. I didn't bother to watch it, and wouldn't think if this was a good movie. Of course as I became a teenager, I saw that Vin Diesel movie \"The Pacifier\" from Disney as Diesel's character has to direct \"The Sound of Music\" play as he still keeping eyes out on the children. Also, I didn't know that \"Family Guy\" was making fun of the movie as I now realize as an adult that Seth Macfarlane is fan of it. Of course, the movie does have fans. So I pop in the old VHS into the VCR as I was looking at some old movies as I was into filmmaking, and after watching it I personally fell in love with this movie from beginning to end. During Christmas, my mother now has a copy of the movie for the first time on DVD for its 40th anniversary with the picture quality being upgraded. Never have the 45th anniversary edition as it was release on Blu-Ray for the first time, because I wonder if 20th Century Fox was ever going to release this movie again on Blu-Ray for its 50th anniversary, and what do you know it, they did. I got it as a birthday present, but I only watch the special features first. Haven't watch the movie yet. However, I did see the movie being reissue on the big screen by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events with Robert Osborne being the host for the introduction and its closure. It was my first time seeing it at a movie theater, and had an amazing experience. The opening scene Maria sings the first opening musical number brought a smile to my face, and as the movie ended I was the first one to clap as the other audiences joined in. It wasn't a huge crowd, but it was nice for others to see it. The movie is about a young Austrian woman name Maria as she is wanting to be a nun in Salzburg at the abbey. So the Reverend Mother gives her a task to be a governess as she is suppose to take care of Captain Von Trapp's seven children. While she takes care of the children by teaching them how to sing, she also brings love to the family as the Captain fells in love in Maria as they got marry and leave their home behind as the Nazis take over Austria. The movie is based on not only the musical Broadway, but it is also based on a German movie \"Die Trapp-Familie\" and the true story of Maria and her family. There are not much words to say about this movie, because everyone has already love this movie and already know what is so great about it. I really love the story as it is told brilliantly. The direction by Robert Wise is outstanding as he knows how to tell a good story, and bringing characters to life. The cast in this movie are wonderful. The children all did well on their own as Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews are both wonderful for their performances as well as the chemistry they made. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are a whole lot of fun to listen to as well as Irwin Kostal's take on the score. The movie does have its beautiful cinematography as I indeed love the look of Salzburg, Austria. The movie does have its funny moments, while its other moments are touching and heartwarming. The movie is almost three hour long, but I never got bored with it as the pacing of the movie keeps me going. Lastly, it does have great message as the movie tells where you have the Reverend Mother tell Maria not to be afraid, but must face her own destiny by faith and courage. That is what the spirit is for the movie as like myself, I must face my own choice of destiny by courage as well as my faith in God. I know anyone may identify for where the message of the movie comes from. So that is how much I love this movie, and I am glad that for 50 years, the hills are still alive. \"The Sound of Music\" continues to be a beloved classic, and it will always be a beloved classic. I give it a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10."

In fact, I watch it pretty recently because of it overwhelm reputation.\n\nonce my eyes dropped on the movie the first impression was a very relaxing sensation and joyful adrenaline ran through my veins, especially with it's first amazing shout screenplay, and Marie singing \"the mountain are alive\" which to be honest reminded me instantaneously of Moulin Rouge which a very dear movie for me too. Stepping out of the first impression, It would be banal if I would spend lines describing the perfection of the Director, writers, and the composer of the music.\n\ninstead I prefer to put down my one point of view right away. and as a modern movie watcher, I would say that Sound of music is an impressive classical American movie. and I totally agree with the Oscar not choosing the actors for the prize, because I think the movie had a some sort of deficiency on this specific aspect, the character were definitively well composed but we might figured that they would apply much better to a theatrical performance, of course I'm not saying that out of lack of classical movies interest, because i don't think that anyone can compare the characters of the sound of music with the ones in \"a streetcar named desire\" or \"Casablanca\" or \"vertigo\". that would be the only thing that sort of annoyed me in this movie. After all, the sound of music is a musical, and indeed a successful one, it's a cultural element that whole families grew up with, especially because the movie is very popular among kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't count how many times I have seen The Sound of Music. If I had to estimate, I'd say about a dozen. I believe it was the first non-Disney live action movie I had ever seen, and I would have been 7 or 8 years old, and I am leaning towards the former.\n\nMany know of the plot already, but for the unfortunate soul who has never seen The Sound of Music already, the plot centers on Maria, a nun who must leave her abbey to care for 7 children. Overtime, she teaches the kids how to sing and in time she softens the heart of their father, who has been uptight towards them since the death of their mother. Then, to avoid spoilers, let's just say Nazis play a part in the final act.\n\nThe Sound of Music is a pure delight from start to finish. I don't know how else to put it. Even with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, it never fails to entertain or enchant the audience. And there are many reasons for this.\n\nFor one thing, the movie is of course known for the songs since it's a musical. My personal favorite as a kid was My Favorite Things, where Maria cheers up the kids during a harsh thunderstorm. Now, I appreciate Climb Every Mountain the most, where the Mother Superior tells Maria that she should tell the Captain that she loves him.\n\nOther classic songs the movie includes are: Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going on 17, Edelweiss, I Have Confidence, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, and, along with many others, there is of course the titular song that opens the movie.\n\nThe actors are all worth some praise as well. Julie Andrews plays Maria and it deservedly become one of her most iconic roles. It's interesting to note that she almost didn't take the role since it was too similar to her role in Mary Poppins, which she had just finished. Thank God she took the role, because the movie wouldn't be the same without her. She plays Maria with lots of charm and she is wonderful in each scene she is in.\n\nThe Captain is played by Christopher Plummer, in what most likely IS without a doubt his most famous part. He is wonderful playing a strict father in the first half and a caring one in the 2nd half that is not afraid to show his hatred for Nazism. What's shocking to note is that he actually originally hated the part, saying working with Andrews was like getting hit in the head with a Valentine's Day card.\n\nHe also was drunk in the scene where he dances at the party with her because he wanted to forget filming it. However, I have heard him say in an interview that a Make A Wish girl said that she wanted to see the movie with him, and when he grudgingly agreed, he ended up loving the film. Most of the other roles don't have other notable roles, for example the kids didn't do much else, but they are all wonderful in their parts.\n\nAnd what works most with the movie is the emotional level. Every scene is sure to make you beam, and the film itself is simply one of the most feel good movies of all time. That really is the most I can say without spoiling the whole movie.\n\nI simply can find no fault in this movie. As a kid, I disliked the first 2 minutes, where mountains and hills are shown and wind is heard. Now I embrace that part as well.\n\nI just saw it on ABC with my Grandma. Usually I ask her what she would rate the movie on a scale of 1-10, and she rarely gives a 10. (I am currently aware of 15 movies that she would rate a 10). When I asked her to rate this, she immediately said 11. I don't blame her. The Sound of Music really is that great.\n\nAs I watched the movie, I noticed how family friendly it is. There's no profanity, drugs apart from some drinking, and no sex. I can name very few live action movies that I can say are as clean as this, and that is worth the highest of praise. I wish more movies could be like that today, an original movie that can appeal to both young and old and endure for all time.\n\nThere's a reason this airs on TV every year, and many have seen this repeatedly. I have 2 close friends who have seen it more than I have, most likely. Unlike them however, I am a man. Gender simply does not matter for this movie.\n\nUntil time ends, this is one of the classics that will continue to endure. I am forever grateful for that. I could give more praise, but I will stop here. You will understand when you see the movie. The Sound of Music is a film everyone needs to see and cherish in their life, and that undermines how wonderful The Sound of Music is.\n\nSimply put, any words in the English language would be insufficient to explain how marvelous it is. It's that wonderful. You just need to see it for yourself to understand."

I liked it, but what with me being a twelve year old male, it did not rate very highly with me among the Jame Bond features, action films, and numerous World War Two films being shown at the time. It DID resonate with me at least a little bit due to my knowledge of and hatred for all things related to Nazi Germany. My father, and the fathers of all my friends had fought in World War II, and when my friends and I wanted to play Army, we had to play Civil War, as no one wanted to be either the Germans or the Japanese. Compared to them, the Union army, and the Confederate army were lovable or at least not hated by my friends and I.\n\nI recently was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music again on the Big Screen. I again liked it, no- this time LOVED IT. As a huge fan of films, I have a very large collection of films on DVD, and I regularly attend my local theaters. Of ALL the films I have ever seen, IN MY OPINION, this is the only film I have ever seen which I deem to be both TECHNICALLY PERFECT and ARTISTICALLY PERFECT.

        "review_detailed_main": "When the film came out in 1965, six years after the original opened on Broadway, countless classes from schools across the country made this their senior trip or class outing for the year. So it was with my class at Armada High School in Michigan. We had to see it on the big screen, and when Julie Andrews twirled into view singing the title song it changed our lives. I don't think anybody could have predicted that more than 50 years later we'd still be humming tunes for this marvelous score by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II. From the opening song to the improbable escape from the Nazis with the assistance of the nuns from the abbey, we are enthralled, viewing after viewing, and I can say with certainty that it has everything to do with the songs. \"My Favorite Things,\" for example, has withstood numerous interpretations, including saxophonist John Coltrane's classic jazz rendition. Yes, the children are cute, Christopher Plummer is handsome, and Julie Andrews enchanting, but it is the songs that make this show: \"Climb Every Mountain,\" \"The Lonely Goatherd,\" \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen,\" \"Something Good,\" \"Do Re Mi,\" \"So Long, Farewell,\" and \"Eidelweiss\" are all memorable and make you want to hear them sung again and again. See if you can spot dubber extraordinaire Marni Nixon as one of the singing nuns. No need, of course, for any dubbing where Julie Andrews was concerned. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013"

And its parts are almost all excellent. It is, in a way, perfect.\n\nTo begin with (as the movie does), the cinematography is breathtaking. We soar, as if from heaven, and the hills are indeed \"alive\".\n\nFrom the very first number, with the exception of one or two rather ordinary songs, the music is all deeply moving and delightful, and superbly staged. Many of the songs are sung more than once, but always in a clever new context that moves the story forward and dramatically contrasts with the original.\n\nThe cast, even and especially the children, is wonderful. Julie Andrews, above all, is almost (perhaps actually) angelic -- in voice, beauty, and spirit. I need not say more.\n\nI would not begin to imagine anyone else as the Captain besides Christopher Plummer. He produces some of the most heartwarming moments of an utterly heartfelt film. However, he indulges just a bit too much in the playfulness of his character after his transformation, so as to lose a bit of the respect we had for him before it.\n\nThe personal and political plot lines are simply and seamlessly overlaid, adding just enough gravity to one another as to not weigh it down.\n\nYes, this film is long, but it is not slow, and it is \"timeless\", in more ways than one. Make time in turn for it, and immerse yourself in the experience.\n\nIt is perhaps for some somewhat sappy at times, but in a most forgivable way. When I think \"the Sound of Music\", I generally think \"the epitome of joy and goodness\". It is a \"happy place\". For many of us, it is truly one of our favorite things."

Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie \"The Sound of Mucus\" - I thought to myself: \"So that's the guy from 'The Return of the Pink Panther', 'Dragnet', 'Dolores Claiborne', 'The Insider' and 'Syriana'?\" As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her \"Mary Poppins\" role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.\n\nFor the record, one of the \"Simpsons\" comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry?

Make sure that they have one catchy hit song which would be reprised later. The rest of the music is bland.\n\nNot so here. The musical contains several catchy and uplifting songs. You could easily hum along to them.\n\nThe plot itself is saccharine and far away from the truth regarding the real Von Trapps.\n\nSet in Austria of 1938. Maria (Julie Andrews) is the problematic novice nun who might not be suited for the role. The kindly Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) sends Maria to an opulent mansion to be the governess for the seven children of the widowed Baron Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer.) He is a retired naval captain, stern and humourless with it.\n\nThe children have managed to mischievously send the other governesses packing by pulling pranks. Maria manages to get the children to warm to her a she teaches them to play music and sing songs.\n\nShe even gets Baron von Trapp to soften up as he is courted by the glamorous Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker.)\n\nHowever the Nazis are encroaching on Austria and times are going to change.\n\nDirector Robert Wise won his second directing Oscar. It also won Best Picture. The movie was a box office colossus and a perennial television favourite.\n\nEven Plummer who nicknamed it The Sound of Mucus eventually warmed to it. It is charm personified, very much like Uncle Max (Richard Haydn.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film. I watched it one other time, about five years later on DVD, but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else. However, I still have a high regard for the film.\n\nThe film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here. In fact, her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years. Too bad. At least here, she's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn. Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis (which include Eleanor Parker) - aren't prevalent. They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story.\n\nThe film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.\n\nI did think there were too many songs in here, something of them done twice. That's too much. Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough. (I'm not big into musicals.) On my second viewing, for some reason, I found the movie too boring in too many spots, which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total. It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it. I am glad at least I could enjoy this once."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music\n\nJulie Andrews stars in the film that set a course for future musicals and dramas.\n\n`The Sound of Music.'\n\nWe all know the story. Julie Andrews plays a Catholic nun who becomes a nanny for Christopher Plummer's millions upon millions of children (not literally) in Austria. After a while she falls in love with Plummer's character. They sing. The children sing. We all sing for ice cream \u0096 err, I mean\u0085never mind.\n\nAnyway, that's how the story goes. Interesting to note that three whole hours revolve around just that. But it is also interesting to note that the film is incredibly good.\n\nJulie Andrews plays her character like it is she. She completely envelops her character. The role of Christopher Plummer turns out to be one of his only good performances.\n\nFor people that do not know, Plummer calls the film `The Sound of Mucus.' He hates it. It's all because people remembered him for it, and he could probably never get any good jobs in film afterwards. So, of course, he purposely chose perverted roles or co-star roles. Shame on him. He should learn to live with the fact that this movie made him \u0096 he wouldn't even be able to get `and Christopher Plummer as ____' roles.\n\nMy only complaint about this film is that the children can't sing worth a darn. Every time they start to sing my ears go numb. They are miserably off tune. They also can't dance.\n\nI sometimes wonder if Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, both of whom tried out for the roles of the children, would have been better\u0085 I wonder\u0085wonder\u0085wonder\u0085\n\nDREYFUSS: A doe. A deer. A female\u0085BOB?! BOB (Bill Murray): Dr. Marvin?! DREYFUSS: Don't you see? HE'S NEVER GONE! Even when I'M TEN YEARS OLD!!! BOB: Is this some kind of radical, new therapy? DREYFUSS: You see?!\n\nOkay. Maybe not. Still\u0085he couldn't have done much worse than the kids in this movie.\n\nThe cinematography is another thing worth noting about this film. It might not have been filmed in Austria, but I sure can't tell the difference.\n\nAnd also worth mentioning is the fact that `The hills are alive with the sound of music!' scene has spawned off countless rip-offs, spoofs and goofs. In fact, I was just watching `European Vacation' about a week ago, and they had a scene where Chevy Chase is singing, `The hills are alive with the sound of Griswald!' One of many countless spoofs on the scene.\n\nAll in all, `The Sound of Music' is one of the most cherished and remembered films. Ever. Definitely worth seeing.\n\nIt's a great musical, and a surprisingly entertaining one, too.\n\n5/5 stars -\n\nJohn Ulmer"

        "review_title": "An Exhaustive DVD Package and a Pristine Print Should Satisfy Fans of This Indisputable Musical Classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning romance that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.\n\nA romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.\n\nBut no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for \"Do Re Mi\", the unintended slumber party for \"My Favorite Things\", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of \"Edelweiss\", the gauzy gazebo duet \"Something Good\", the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality in his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as a convincingly insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.\n\nIn stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte, in his only movie role, transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" is a tad too operatic for my taste. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on \"West Side Story\" and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.\n\nThe 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the other a more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, \"My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers\" which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen \u0096 even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.\n\nThere are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).\n\nAnother short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&E Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler \u0096 scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music (1965)\n\nNot a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!\n\nRogers and Hammerstein need no praise from me, and their work for The Sound of Music is so embedded in everyone's head--do, re, mi--they border on timeless, without exaggeration. Starting as a smash 1959 Broadway musical and running for years (followed by years in London), it was only a matter of time before Hollywood put together a smash widescreen version.\n\nDirector Robert Wise was a perfect choice in some ways. Despite years of making less fanciful movies (I Want to Live, for one), he had one notch on his belt worth noting: West Side Story. And so the 70mm cameras were pulled out and the Austrian Alps hosted the cast and crew for the location shooting (the rest was shot mostly in Hollywood). A legendary film was born, Julie Andrews rose higher into the firmament, and the whole world was singing \"My Favorite Things.\" It doesn't get any better than that.\n\nAs a movie--the editing, shooting, acting, and so on--it is surprisingly good without being one bit original or breathtaking. It is famously saccharine, and the question is mostly whether you can stomach some very very sweet (some would say goody-goody) scenes. But listen, this is a musical, and musicals are like that--false and arch and absurd and dreamy. That's one reason we make them and watch them. The plot is a terrific romance, really--it develops predictably, but slowly, with delicious restraint. And it has the best of antagonists, too--cold hearted Nazis. The famous ending, and I mean the very end, after the convent scene at night, is weirdly brief, and shot from so far away you only get the gist of things, not any actual faces or reactions. Maybe this makes its message of hope and perseverance more universal.\n\nBut all this said, it is surely the music itself that makes this movie astonishing. I have seen the movie too many times to count, but hadn't seen it recently, and as one familiar song after another came up, I heard melodies that felt as right as a good hat, lyrics that rolled into the air like laughter. It is all easygoing stuff, for sure, but slyly sophisticated, much more difficult to pull off than you can imagine (ask Stephen Sondheim). And even if Julie Andrews isn't your cup of tea, she sings with such clear ease, and in tune, and without a lot of self-conscious warbling. The music, from her, permeates the movie as fully as the scenery.\n\nIs it a perfect movie? Oddly, it is perfect at what it does, which sounds like I'm saying \"it is what it is\" and I don't mean to be silly. I mean, it wants to be a family movie filled with sentiment and warmth and uncomplicated psychology. And lots of great music. And it does that to a tee. It's hard to complain that it doesn't raise social issues, or the photography is pretty but stiff as masonite, or the acting is clich\u00e9d, or the plot is saccharine (yes). All of these are true, but that's like complaining that the songs in a gangster film aren't sweet enough. The Sound of Music is an engrossing, perfect, heartwarming experience if you let it be. It's a musical, remember, just a terrific musical."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once in my childhood I heard an interesting proverb: \"words hold a power but if they are supplied with tunes, they are twice as powerful.\" I had not realized how true it was until I first saw THE SOUND OF MUSIC, seemingly the most appreciated musical ever made, the action of which is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last happy days of the 1930s.\n\nMost probably, it is meaningless to present the content of the movie since a lot has been said about it by other reviewers. I'd rather focus on something that requires more analysis and I apologize if it seems too subjective for you. Yet, I feel an undeniable need to share those thoughts with people who read my comment. I'd like to discuss the powerful message of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. This movie, being loved but also despised by various viewers, is not as easy as its story. Perhaps a fairy tale good to be seen on Sunday afternoon with a family, but perhaps a thought provoking film that, besides all its colorful message conveys a profound message that addresses both human heart and human mind. After all, the movie does not have friends only but raises contradictory reactions too. Why?\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSIC constitutes a sort of catharsis. Everyone who feels lost in materialism of today's lifestyle, in vanity of today's consumption and in brutality of today's rat race faces another world here: similarly to Von Trapp's family when Maria enters their home. Like her entrance supplied the whole family with forgotten music, the film supplies a viewer with forgotten treasures of humanity: simplicity, pure love, joy, respect for nature and, most importantly, admiration of music... the treasures which are not so unavailable and vague but which lie hidden deep within one's heart. Robert Wise did a terrific job showing a combination of sweetness and profoundity, of humor and sentimentality. Consider, for instance, very gentle love scenes of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As a result, this film is purely a movie of childlike hearts and sublime emotions compared to a blissful moment of spiritual climax. One of the song says: \"(...) A dream that will need all the love you can give, everyday of your life for as long as you live.\" How can you ignore that profoundity as a viewer? Isn't that a short \"definition\" of what greatness is all about?\n\nAs for the cast, the performances are very good, especially from the seven children and Julie Andrews who portrays her character with vitality and enthusiasm. A lovely sequence in the picturesque landscape when she teaches the children the notes will long remain in your memory. Christopher Plummer has a more difficult role of Captain Von Trapp who is reluctant to the new governess and her methods at first but, in the long run, gets through a sort of rebirth and the rise of true Love. This \"rebirth\" is caused by facing pure joy that leads him to admiration and cleans him within. The moment they sing \"Edelweiss\" on the stage is absolutely sublime and Plummer does the top job as someone who deeply desires to express the love and compassion for his nation. I also liked Peggy Wood as Mother Abbess who constitutes a very positive image of a nun giving profound wise advice.\n\nAs for other artistic features, the film has a wonderful cinematography with absolutely stunning pictures filmed in the picturesque landscape of Austria. Indeed, the hills seem to be alive with the sound of music. It also has brilliant moments that constitute a real burst of vitality. Yet, it is important not to put this aspect as the key one when analyzing the film since THE SOUND OF MUSIC cannot be limited into a nice picture, melodious songs, fine moments and adorable faces of children only. It is much more...\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSIC is an oasis of human treasures for today's viewers, its charm will bloom and grow as long as there are people who can notice a wonder in the simplicity and sublimity of a child's smiling face.\n\nYes, Maria with Von Trapp children and all childlike hearts round the world, go on singing because the world needs your song..."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is one of the most famous opening scenes in film history. Shot after beautiful shot of the Austrian hills, one after the other, until in the final shot we notice a tiny little figure off in the distance. The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.\n\nThe film's story is so familiar that a recap of the plot seems rather pointless. Suffice to say that it is a great story which provides a worthy foundation for the moments, the songs, the beauty and, above all else, the performances which make the film so memorable. Of course as great as the cast as a whole are there is one performance which stands above the rest. Has any performer in any role in any film ever been as perfect as Julie Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music? The perfect look matched with the perfect voice. Her acting is superb. Her singing is the stuff of legend. How do you solve a problem like Maria? Don't even try, just allow yourself to be charmed by her. And she can work her charm on anyone, even the toughest nut to crack, Captain Von Trapp. In the film's other starring role Christopher Plummer's Captain provides the perfect complement to the unrelenting sweetness of Andrews as Maria. But of course it will turn out that he's not really as deadly serious as he initially seems. At least he won't be after Maria brings some desperately needed joy back into his family's life.\n\nYes it seems Maria is too good to be true. She's absolutely bursting with life and everyone around her gets swept along for the ride. And the audience gets swept along too. There are so many moments here to bring a smile to your face. Everyone remembers the songs of course. And well they should, they're spectacular, with \"Do-Re-Mi\" in particular being just about as fine an example of film-making as you'll ever see. Brilliantly choreographed, beautifully photographed, exquisitely edited...that sequence is pure genius. But this movie is so much more than its wonderful songs. There's the engaging story and the beautiful scenery. There's the tremendous cast, headed of course by the wondrous Andrews but with plenty of opportunities for so many others to shine including the young performers portraying the wonderfully precocious Von Trapp children. If there is any real quibble with the film it's that the third act seems a little tacked on. There's a natural high point in the story which would seemingly have made for the perfect, happy conclusion. But with the Nazis lurking in the background of the film's story throughout you knew they eventually had to rear their ugly head. So right after that natural high point it's Nazi time and the third act takes on a very different tone from all that has preceded it. Deep down you know the third act is important, that this is how the story really has to play itself out. But with all the dark, foreboding drama at the end you can't help but think you'd just rather be watching Julie Andrews get in another pillow fight with a bunch of children. But the film's conclusion, while certainly not all raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, does allow for its own moments of triumph. Ultimately the film gets the rousing conclusion it so richly deserves. The Sound of Music is an absolute treasure, a film which will be beloved for all time."

I feel that it could have been better if the political details were introduced right in the first place, not until the very last part. However that would have made the film somewhat heavy at first. If the German troops marched into the opening, I guess I wouldn't have stayed to watch it when I was a child.\n\nThe Sound of Music is a timeless classic for the whole family.

I do understand why this film is considered a classic but I disagree with it. The storyline of this film was a bit too simple and straightforward. It was also a bit weak. The cast selection was fine enough. They strongly committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members was light and could have been stronger. This film reveals to viewers that the world of today is dangerous and unpredictable. There is a lot happening out there in the world of today that no one can control. This is a classic film that could have been better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed.\n\nPROS:\n\nI am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too.\n\nMESSAGE: \"Be cheerful\"\n\nVERDICT: \"Most Recommended.\""

It brings order in chaos and peace in life.\n\nMusic is what Maria brings into lives of the children of Georg Von Trapp. They in turn become loving, sincere and disciplined kids.\n\nThis film is certainly about music, the impact of music and how music can be used as a tool of inspiration to children. From the song \"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\" to the inspirational \"Do Re Mi\" to the title song \"The Sound of Music\" and the other wonderful song \"My Favorite Things\", these are exceptional songs that are tailor-made to the script and carry the narrative forward. Even the final song \"So Long\" is done wonderfully by everyone. Credit to the composers Richard Rogers and his team for this. Also, the director Robert Wise who had a vision and let the songs flow into the narrative fluidly and let the songs speak for the movie, is a wonderful thing.\n\nthis is certainly one of the great musicals that will be there for as long as movies exist. The well placed nuances, the theme, the characterization blended with the glorious style and the grandeur set in the alps. It makes this a great movie. Yet, I have only one thing against this and it's the plot. The plot is predictable and thus making me lose fun in between the film itself. The climax is pretty simplistic and comes in haste. barring these, the rest is mellifluous and poetic.\n\nNo wonder why many musicians have loved this film. Even I love this, wish it was more unpredictable. A 4/5 for this."

I first saw it when I was about twelve, and developed an immediate (and huge) crush on Christopher Plummer, who is still one of my favorite actors. The film is great, if taken for what it is: a sweet, heartwarming family musical. Julie Andrews is wonderful (what I wouldn't give for a voice like that!) as Maria von Trapp, and the kids do a good job, although some of their dialogue seems a bit forced. Charmain Carr, as Liesl, was perhaps my least favorite part of the film. Surely a more talented actress could have been found for the role. All in all, though, the acting is good. The songs are pleasantly hummable; no, this isn't the most brillant music in the world, but not everything has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. \"Edelweiss\" is my personal favorite. The love story is believable and touching; the ending is suitably suspenseful. You genuinely care about the family making it safely to Switzerland. To be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't like this movie. It's a part of our collective childhood."

There is so much love for this movie out there, just the name involves pleasant memories and thoughts of singing in the alps. I, like I imagine most people, saw this when I was in grade school and hadn't seen it since.\n\nWow, have times changed. Both since this was made and since I last watched it. Ripping the bandage off, this has agreed wretchedly. It's awful, makes no sense and is ridiculously offensive. The opening ten minutes are just glamour shots of Austria, and that's only a slight exaggeration (it was more like eight).\n\nThe Nazi stuff is a bit heavier than I remembered too and it's a but uncomfortable. With things like Indiana Jones, the world is pulpy and Jones punches and outsmarts the bad guys. TSOM can't decide if it wants to play things super real or fantastical and that's an issue for me.\n\nBiggest problem? This is insanely sexist. Normally I try not to judge proof films by modern standards. Things have changed, we've changed. That's hard though when there's a big message about how women are incapable of taking care of themselves and need men to think for them. That's not hyperbole either, that's literally what like the third song is all about and it keeps coming up.\n\nThere were a ton of other nitpicks and annoyances as well but rather than getting into all of those...\n\nThe kids go through multiple outfit changes during \"Do, Re, Me\" so either there's no one on set monitoring outfits between shorts or... are they singing this song about how to sing for like a week straight while traipsing about the town? Julie Andrews plays a nun turned governess, but a governess is meant to be like a pro home schooler and the only thing she ever does is sing. So does she just suck at her job or did the makers of this not know what a governess is because she never teaches them anything really substantial aside from how to sing.\n\nAnyhow! Andrews is delightful and Plummer plays a character that I think steals this movie in just about every scene he's in.\n\nSorry, last one. The Nazis want him, but he has a spot on Austrian Idol so he gets a temporary pass. I mean, what is that? They sent an armed escort to his home to keep him from trying to flee and make sure he goes with them but then, \"Oh, you want to sing first? Sure!\" Makes no sense. It's not like the Nazis are going to care about the ratings for Austria's Got Talent.\n\nThis was remarkably disappointing. I really thought I'd pop this in, enjoy a charming musical and move on. NOPE! This was awful. Oh, and it's near THREE. HOURS. LONG. Utterly ridiculous. I quite liked Plummer though and if they would have put some thought into things this would've been much better. In the end though, it's time hammering a coffin nail into this one. For a charming musical, it is downright offensive at times and that is a rough place to be."

        "review_title": "A Peak of Hollywood: The Sound of Music",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music is a legendary while heartwarming movie about story of a governess(nun), Maria, living in Captain von Trapp's house with seven children. This movie is based on a Broadway musical also called The Sound of Music of 1959. Because of the success and fame from the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta von Trapp and the Tony awarded musical by Richard Rodgers, director Robert Wise and his team started the staging and filming of the movie version of The Sound of Music in 1960. The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the \"von Trapp Family Singers,\" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general. The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award nominations while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song \"Farewell\" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen,\" and \"My Favorite Things,\" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, \"The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;\" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are."

In reaction scenes at the party, she appears convincingly distracted, since she saw her fiancee, The Captain (Christopher Plummer) dancing warmly with the nanny Maria (Julie Andrews). The sultry character is commonly labelled the villainess, but she traveled all the way from Vienna to marry her beau, only to be pushed aside by a (younger) charmer; of course the Captain was a willing participant, too. Acting, script, direction, score, photography still exemplary."

A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question."

Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whether or not \"The Sound of Music\" is in fact a good musical has been something of an ongoing debate. It did in fact open to mixed reviews in it's original Broadway run and was panned in it's original London run. When it comes down to it, the score is mostly excellent, even if the songs don't flow in quite as naturally as they do in other R&H shows. But where the show ultimately fails is by not joining together the three stories that go on in the show; Maria winning over the children; Maria and the Captain falling in love; and the Von Trapps Escaping from the Nazi takeover of Austria. The three stories pretty much just happen, rather than flow in.\n\nThat being said, the film of the sound of music does manage to do just that, making it quite possibly the only film version of a stage musical that actually improves on it's source material. The film wisely rearranges songs to go in more sensible places, even though dropping both of Elsa and Max's songs is more questionable. The shots of Ausrtia are simply breathtaking, often disguising the weaknesses of the material. True, the two new songs written by Richard Rodgers (music and Lyrics) are not as sophisticated as those he wrote with Oscar Hammerstein, who died in 1960, but they are enjoyable none the less and do move the story along. Julie Andrews is perfect as Maria, having the youthfulness which Mary Martin lacked on stage, which allows Andrews to mature during her performance. Even though he has stated his dislike of the film, Christopher Plummer is excellent as the Captain. While \"The Sound of Music\" does not rank as one of the best musicals ever written, it's film incarnation certainly ranks as one of the best (if not the best) of it's kind."

This film must have been outdated in 1935.\n\nUnbearaby kitchy story, utterly artificial characters and - honestly, the music is rather poor most of the time. There are not more than only maximum 2-3 notable and/or memorable melodies in the entire piece.\n\nThe only positive part of the film is Julie Andrews, who is really beautiful, kind and brings the otherwise loughablly puppet-like character to life. Christopher Plummer seemingly feels uneasy, so his performance resembes a second-rate high school performance most of the time, - occasionally smiling in most unfit moments...\n\nI refraned from seeing it for over 50 years and I was right to do so..."

I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching \"Cabaret\" which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the \"great\" part."

I had to just shut it off when I got to the favorite things song. Sixteen going on seventeen had a horrible message that any modern woman should balk at. Five songs in and not a single banger, in fact not a single one I'd willingly listen to again at all. Julie Andrews' singing was too high pitched and the lyrics made me cringe every time. The scene at the first dinner where they started crying I almost laughed.

I'd forgotten how good it is.\n\nFirst, I hold a negative bias toward most musicals. Yes, there are exceptions (\"Moulin Rouge\", \"Beauty & the Beast\" for example), but most of the time I just get annoyed when the filmmakers stop the story for a little song-and-dance routine, then crank it back up when the musical number's over.\n\nMy recollection of \"The Sound of Music\" was simply of the songs -- but I'd completely forgotten how well the songs work in the narrative. Instead of halting the flow of the story, they actually help carry it along. A pleasant surprise.\n\nAnd I'd forgotten, too, how well the film steers clear of syrupy cornball territory -- something that could've easily mired it, especially when you consider the time period in which it was made. I appreciated the honesty of it, and the lack of melodrama and overacting you so often find in the films of yesteryear.\n\nThe only drawback -- man, I can't stand it when Liesl goes \"wheeeeee!\" once Rolf runs out of the little gazebo after he's stolen a kiss from her.

My Mother took my 5 siblings and I too see this when it was re-released into theaters years after it came out in 1965(they used to do that with the bigger movies - before the days of VHS and DVDs). When we left the theater and walked home that evening, we talked about the movie the whoooole way, and sung the songs in it.

It was the smash hit of its day. This is a movie that has dominated the Bank Holiday TV listings for many a year, but the reason they keep showing it is because people will always sit down and watch it.\n\nNow, for a film with a duration of 174 minutes to grab a large audience with every repeat viewing, it must have something really special going for it. There aren't many films that have such great repeatability. It may not be 'cool' to admit to liking 'The Sound of Music' but those of us who are not repressed are unafraid to express pleasure openly and proudly, when it suits us.\n\nThe audience has been waiting for this moment, having sat through several minutes of beautifully shot 70mm aerial footage of the mountains and lakes \u2013 but it's that moment when the shot cuts from wide to close up on Julie's wide armed spin that causes a rising feeling in the chest.\n\nThis film is absolutely great! The acting is great, the music is great, the direction is great. This is truly one of the best movies of all time.\n\nBy far, the best musical ever."

It was my favorite for many childhood years, and even now in my late teens I still consider it in my top ten films of all time. And I'm positive it will never be removed from that list, for many reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost: Julie Andrews. She gives a masterful performance as Maria. This film literally made the world fall in love with her. I know I fall in love with her every time I see it. She's the kind of person you just want to hug. I hope to have the privilege of meeting her one day.\n\nBesides just that, the rest of the film seems quite perfectly cast as well. Christopher Plummer turns in a spellbinding performance as the Captain VonTrapp, and all of the children are adorable. Eleanor Parker is also of particular note for creating a character who you so want to hate, and yet still feel the pain of. Richard Haydn turns in nice work as well as all of the actresses who play the nuns.\n\nAnd then there's the songs. Songs that I've grown up with and set my life to. Songs that have touched not just my heart, but an entire globe in a very special way. The songs are simple, yet reach deep within us all. Not to mention they're impossible to stop humming and singing in your head.\n\nA masterpiece this film has been called, and a masterpiece it is indeed. It is a film that will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. It will always hold a special place in my heart- it will always be one of my favorite things.\n\nJay Addison"

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1960s were a time of transition in cinema, when independent producers began to take control from the old studio moguls, neo-realist influences crept into Hollywood, foreign language films became trendy, and for the first time pictures were being made in black-and-white for artistic reasons rather budgetary constraints. And yet the most popular picture of the entire decade was a bright, joyous and epic musical, a product of old-fashioned studio professionalism, crafted for pure entertainment. And there is no shame in this fact, because The Sound of Music is a truly wonderful classic of the screen.\n\nLet's start at the beginning (a very good place to start) with the musical from which the movie was adapted. This was certainly the best of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores, the culmination of all their works prior to this. It demonstrates, in many instances, what was really exceptional about Richard Rodgers's tunes. His melodies have a subtle beauty which comes at you in ways you wouldn't anticipate. There are those sour blue notes in the title song, the haunting chord progression of \"Edelweiss\" through major and minor or, in \"My Favourite Things\", the shift from a minor key verse to a major key chorus while barely seeming to change melody at all. Filled with Oscar Hammerstein's deceptively simple yet rhythmically sensitive lyrics, this is music as gorgeous as the hills and mountains that provide the motion picture with its backdrop.\n\nThe director is the highly versatile and under-appreciated Robert Wise. Wise began his career as a sound editor and he really understood the musical genre. He doesn't give The Sound of Music that very precise, choreographed look of say, a Vincente Minnelli musical or his own earlier picture West Side Story. Instead he has the performers doing very simple \"dances\" of realistic movement, for example Julie Andrews speeding up her walk as the song gathers pace for \"I Have Confidence\". He also gently and unobtrusively makes the image match the scope and style of the music, a great example of this being in the opening number. For the slow, broad opening of the song, we have Andrews against the backdrop of the mountains. Then for the busier but quieter section he has her walking among trees, skipping between their trunks like the notes of the song, before having her running out onto the hillside as the music swells up again.\n\nStar Julie Andrews, like Irene Dunne and Judy Garland before her, was one of those rare talents who could both sing and act. Of course her role here as an actress is mainly one of childlike earnestness, but the thing is she pulls it off with complete sincerity, never becoming too grating or too pathetic. And of course she is able to carry her acting performance through into the musical numbers, putting her character into every note and dance step. Male lead Christopher Plummer was reportedly not comfortable in his role, but he does an adequate job all the same. Apparently Richard Burton was also considered for the role, and he undoubtedly would have given an excellent performance, but he might have been a little too good, making the captain perhaps a bit too stern and menacing in those early scenes, so I'm glad the role went to the softer and more fatherly Plummer.\n\nOne criticism that is often raised about The Sound of Music is that its story is rather weak and short on substance. It is true that it lacks the compelling drama of say, My Fair Lady, that it never really builds up any true sense of danger over the Nazi anschluss, and that perhaps it is at times a little overwhelmingly cheerful. And yet the fact is that the weight of this picture is not in its story, but in its music. This is something that is significant about Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Think about those lyrics. Most of these songs don't say anything very specific about the story or characters; most of them just play around with a little idea like saying \"goodbye\" or going through the notes in a scale. With the exception of \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\" these are songs about feelings, not expositions. The songs do not exist to tie the story together, the story exists to present the songs. And these musical moments are powerful enough to send shivers down spines and send hearts soaring."

But knowing the general public they will be fickle and go and watch it and see what the film is like. Its bad enough Andrew Lloyd Webber is doing a stage production and looking for a Maria on TV. I think he thinks he cant do no wrong but I think he will get his comeuppance with this one hopefully. Why dose he have have to do remake all the time,has he forgotten how to write a play of his own."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sound of Music is an almost universal favorite, even with he-men or liberal sophisticates who \"don't like musicals.\" I'm not wild about musicals either, especially since popular culture began a whispering campaign that said all guys who like musicals are gay. The splashy, funny story about a postulate Catholic nun who leaves her convent for a trial-run at being a regular adult, and then finds love with a suitable leading man who happens to have 8 very talented children is a good adaptation of boy meets girl, and there's lots of hilarious lines and situations to carry a lesser story to box-office success. What really makes this movie compelling is the background drama showing a definite conflict between good and evil. The anti-nazi stand that Capt. Von Trapp takes against the forces arrayed against Christian decency in 1930's Europe is both admirable and dangerous. The Capt. has lots to lose: he's very rich, socially prominent and he's courting a sexy Countess who's wealthy too. His friends council to be politically-correct, go with the flow and just bend a little to the new National Socialist overlords who've just seized control of his country; \"compromise and be wise.\" Von Trapp is outraged that his inner-circle is both so greedy and so cowardly. The background plot is serious like West Side Story is serious, but has enough of a frivo- lous front story in it that you may not notice the moral that Sound of Music teaches."

It wasn't some rich Hollywood-fellow with a big cigar who invented this family. They are true! The songs are great, and after seeing the movie twice, you are able to sing along with most of them. I don't have a favorite song, because one song isn't a song without the others. Perhaps the love story is a bit phony, but that is how the romantics like it. It gives us a bit of hope, that love is out there, and we can get it too... even though we're only poor nuns, with a simple guitar ;)"

Earlier, to us English songs were unintelligible 'hooo' and 'haaaa', opera style. Now, 40 years after I first saw it (saw it in the cinema 5 times between 1967 and 1982)it remains sheer magic, the songs exquisite in the simplicity of the words and melodies. It is a film which has been rubbished both for its music and everything else, and yet it is perhaps my 2nd favorite film, English, Bengali and Hindi combined.The title is perhaps one of the most appropriate ones. The film is all about what music is and what it can do to one's life, and also what its absence can do."

I always make him play them so I can sing along with them. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, \"The Sound of Music\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" or \"Edelweiss\"(which is my favorite) . Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken nun turned governess. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965. The Sound of Music\" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention."

It is set in Austria, where the views are breath taking, and from the moment Julie Andrews comes waltzing into view, singing about the hills, to the very end, the film has the audience entranced. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great in their roles as the novice nun and sea captain, and whoever said Andrews couldn't act obviously hadn't seen this film. The songs are great and you find yourself singing about deers and yodeling for days to come, and although the film is quite lenghty at nearly three hours, you barely realise, as the film never loses its pace for a minute. Anyone who hasn't seen this film, has obviously had a very deprived childhood, as its one of the greatest films of the 20th century, and will no doubt captivate audiences for years to come."

And the kids who shine especially with their scenes with Maria and towards the end of the film they act like a real family when the nazi's are ready to escort Captain Von Trapp to the navy.

That's why it's usually shown at Christmas, the only time appetites and sensibilities are robust enough to prevail. It's like an over-stuffed turkey, a great pile of mince pies dusted with icing-sugar, a portion of pudding too big to eat never mind digest. Seem-splitting, constitution-challenging, hernia-inducing, gut-busting feelgoodness. Nobody swears, nobody farts, nobody has a run of snot, or halitosis, or spits crumbs at others while they're talking. Nobody leaves a floater in the toilet. None of these are her favourite things.\n\nThey're all so practically perfect in every way, Mary Poppins wouldn't get a look in. Which is just as well, because she was shot down by ack-ack over Dresden and died from a perforated brolly.\n\nPeople like this only ever existed in the imagination of Rogers and Hammerstein. They're not real. They're a cartoon exaggeration, a benign behavioural tumour grown monstrous with self-delight. You know it. Yet something inside you still wants to believe it is possible. It could never happen to you, though - only others. Like a road accident. Better drive on quick; Christmas arrives earlier every year.\n\nMore sherry trifle, anyone?\n\n(BURP)\n\n'Scuse me."

A family as they escape the Nazis. Based on a true story, but greatly changed from the real truth to create the best modern fairy tale for 200 years. This story will make you feel every emotion possible. It is the most perfect use of cinematography ever. Andrews & Plummer's performances are so perfect that they will have you guessing for the rest of your life.\n\nWho should see this film: Everyone. Children (8yrs upwards) must see this film, it is a total education, but huge fun with it. Adults must see this film to get in touch with the joy & point of the purpose of life. Afterwards you can read the Von Trapp book & compare film with reality & be totally amazed!! Both are so different, yet work!! Why?\n\nRating: 10/10. Film does not get better than this. It has love, war, romance, tension, hate, youth, age, religion, music, singing, tradition, excitement, fear, brilliant props, fantastic Real scenic locations, hope & genuine talent.\n\nWhy should you see this film: You must see this to 'get' what the point & scope & range of film is. This is the ultimate film, nothing compares to it. You must watch this, for the same reason that everyone must read Shakespeare. You do it because you want to know what everyone is talking about or to be enlightened in a media field & to gain from it's treasures. You can watch this film a thousand times & never 'see' every frame of it!!! It is a filmic treasure, pure Gold. For fun, you can try to guess what became of the child stars & what films did they end up in? We are privilaged to be able to experience the wonder of this film at all it's levels (some are rather deep or political). Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II I thank you, you are perfection. We mourn the current absence of your genius. Cinema is lost without you, sadly, it has not been able to emulate your intelligence. But, at least we have this film to realise how great cinema should be."

As a huge fan of hers I love the way she captivates the audience with her natural beauty and sparkle. She absolutely lights up the screen as Maria von Trapp and is fantastic in her role. She truly deserved the best actress Oscar for her performance. Her voice is incredible, one of the best I have ever heard and the last note of the \"do re mi\" sequence proves that. Her acting is just as good as her singing and I believe that this picture shows that she is not only a brilliant stage actress but is also a legend on the screen.\n\nChristopher Plummer gives a slight darkness to the film as the stern Captain von Trapp which is great because it gives variety to the characters in the film and shows that not all of them are sweet and sugary.\n\nEleanor Parker (Baroness Shoerader), Richard Haydn (Max), Peggy Wood (Mother Abbess) and all 7 children form a great supporting cast and add to the success of the movie.\n\nThe Sound of Music is truly a classic movie and will be around for many more years to come. If you haven't seen this movie then I strongly recommend you do because I guarantee you that you will love it. It is unique in that it does not rely on drugs, violence, sex or bad language for its success and is just simply a brilliant masterpiece suitable for all ages.\n\nExquisite!! 10/10 stars"

I will do that so long as I am still able to teach. It is so inspiring, so instructive,telling the audience what to love what to hate. For non-native English speakers, it is film that can bring motivation and desire to learn the language well. It is more than a movie.\n\nI found my own love with the songs in THE SOUND OF MUSIC. In 1986 a new teacher came to borrow the song book in which she found the song,the title of which I can not tell(the song words go like this: You are 16 going on 17...).

This movie is fulled with wonderful and nostalgic music, superb acting and character depth, beautiful sceneries depicting the Austrian landscapes and towns and a brilliant story based on survival, music, love, sacrifice, family and lessons.\n\nIt is based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp (Julie Andrews). She is sent to the house of a retired naval captain, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), to care for his seven children. Through the teachings of music, Maria won the hearts of the children and brought love in the Von Trapp family. Maria and Captain Von Trapp soon fall in love, despite the fact that the Captain is engaged to Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) and Maria is a nun. These events also take place when the Nazi Germany takes control of Austria, and demands that Captain von Trapp assume a position in the German Navy. Their true events are beautifully depicted in this film.\n\nThe most memorable scenes, I think, are the puppet show, Maria leaving the Von Trapp family for the first time and returning to the convent. There is also good dose of comedy, including the parts of Maria sitting on a pine cone and a boat capsizing with Maria and the kids in it.\n\nThe memorable and unforgettable songs including \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Female Deer,\" \"Confidence in Me\" and the powerful \"Climb Every Mountain\" will send chills down your body and forever etch in your minds.\n\nI am glad this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture. The cinematography was fantastic and the directing by the great Robert Wise was brilliant.\n\nOverall, this movie is filled with great memories and will bring you nostalgia after each watch.\n\nGrade A"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw this movie I was truly enchanted. It was a musical unlike any other I had ever seen. My Nanny Varnish and my Grandad Varnish, my mum's parents, bought it for me in 2001 and it really does remind me of them and it also reminds me of that very year. I was quite unhappy in that time but I also liked it and I did have some good times as well. It tells the story of Maria (Julie Andrews), a bright young woman who doesn't fit in at the abbey where she is supposed to be working like all the other nuns. Mother Superior tells her that it would be respectful to god to leave the abbey and the very thing that'd be useful for her is going to become the governess of seven children - who she finds are all very naughty. Their behaviour improves with Maria's lighthearted passion for music after all they all are very unhappy underneath it all. Maria and the seven children get to know each other better while their father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) is away seeing his girlfriend who is slightly older than he is, I think. Their friendship grows and it is decided he'd bring her back to the Von Trapp villa and her close friend, Uncle Max played by (Richard Haydn). The Baroness wants to get to know the people of Salzberg and so a party is planned. When Maria and the captain dance and start to fall in love the Baroness secretly gets jealous and is determined to win back her man - and does. What Maria must accept is that he really loves the baroness and only likes her as a friend - but will he change his mind? The best way is to watch this fantastic movie and find out then. There is absolutely everything you would want to see in a great film; there's wonderful songs you would want to listen to again and again, romance, sentiment, beautiful real-life Austrian scenery, lavishly rich sets, outstanding performances from every actor and actress, perfectly cast and even scenes about the Nazis and just how the Von Trapp Family Singers manage to set a plan to become free of their evil reign. Well, there you have it! A film of every glorious wonder you could possibly think of. I hope that'll still remain in at least the next hundred years from now because every generation should experience the golden qualities of \"The Sound of Music\" - it's a film I am proud to give the full-star vote and I'll love it forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound Of Music is an all around classic, with the talented Julie Andrews (who will always be Mary Poppins in my mind) playing governess to the Von Trapp family. Mr. von Trapp is a retired captain of the navy, his wife died many years ago leaving him with seven kids and a bad attitude. Because of his lack of interest & nurturing, the children try to win his attention by annoying the hell out of every governess he hires. The movie opens famously, with a camera descending upon the majestic austrian mountainside, capturing a gorgeous view, as Julie runs in the grass singing. Her character, Maria, is somewhat lost, she grew up wanting to be a nun but her mentors seem to think that the quiet life is not for her. They gather together in the abbey and sing about it of course, because this is a musical. The reverend mother tells Maria that she should first go out into the world and get a job so that she would have time to rethink things. So Maria winds up as the Von Trapps' governess. Inexperienced and awkward in her new position, she tries her best and eventually wins the hearts of the children and their trust. They learn to sing and go on many jolly holidays in the hills...until daddy finds out and has a hissy fit one day, when his snobby baronesss girlfriend is over with her plans to marry him and get rich. But soon (almost three minutes later in fact) Mr. Von Trapp's stone heart breaks when he walks in hearing his kids crooning. They hug and he makes up to them in a very memorable Kodak moment. He too apologizes to Maria and this is the beginning of a love thang between them.\n\nThe Sound Of Music is among one of the best movie musicals, if not movies ever made. With its touching plot and gorgeous scenery along with the music...you have a real winner. But I will never forgive it for winning out against Dr. Zhivago for the Best Picture Oscar of 1965."

They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason I like it is Julie Andrews' amazing performance as Maria, a girl who longs for a better life, I think. Maria is beautiful, has a beautiful voice, mixed with nervousness and sadness, all qualities that Andrews brings to her performances. The only film she slightly disappointed was Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as is the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. I can't pick a favorite scene, but who can forget the opening and the \"Do ah Dear\" sequence? I also thought the kids were sweet and the movie had some clever subplots, like Liesels secret love. 10/10 for a musical, which should be in the top 250. It's number 2 on Greatest Musicals, beating out Grease."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think the sound of music is, if you excuse the term, a sign of contradiction. Just reading here a few pages of commentaries one can see how different people's reactions are to it, some people loathe it with a passion that is fascinating to me, I, who love it with delirium.\n\nGoing over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would. Indeed, I'd say a 99,99% of the people who adore the Sound of Music don't find the words to express or understand the reason. But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way. The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances. One can see in Maria, as Julie Andrews herself said, the person you'd like to be if things wouldn't be so rough in their own lives. Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh: so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria.\n\nAs a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question. Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever? I am torn at the question, because I find myself comparing it to something so disparagingly as Citizen Kane, the movie that is heralded by most critics circles and serious polls as the greatest movie ever. Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view. Cinematography and photography are flawless. But it's a shallow classic even if it's perfect. As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous. So the heart of the best movie of all times is this? This is what is represented by the Number one movie humankind has produced? Deep question indeed. Maybe I take it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone.\n\nNow, although it's a completely different genre, the Sound of Music is Art. It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film. The beauty of the soul of Maria, the positive ethics the story has, the joy that is underneath has nothing of sugary as many shallowly purport, but instead it's a soundless song by itself. The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally. The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness. It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart.\n\nThe script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit.\n\nIt all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time. If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit. That is love, beauty and art.\n\nThis is something I am very thankful for."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film begins with a young woman named \"Maria\" (Julie Andrews) who has recently joined a local abbey in her hometown of Salzburg, Austria with the intention of one day becoming a nun. Yet even though her desire is sincere enough the problem she has is that she is so energetic and full of life that it inhibits her ability to fit in to a monastic lifestyle. After much consideration the \"Mother Abbess\" (Peggy Wood) decides to temporarily send her to fulfill the position of governess at a large estate owned by a retired naval officer by the name of \"Captain Georg von Trapp\" (Christopher Plummer) who has recently lost his wife and has seven children to raise all by himself. Not knowing any better he has tried to install a great degree of military discipline to his children without realizing their ability to fully absorb that particular lifestyle. As a result, the previous governesses have all tried and failed to achieve any sort of balance to the equation which the Captain or the children can accept. To that end Maria-who has absolutely no experience for that particular position-finds herself in the middle of situation in which nobody has successfully handled before. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent musical which captured the environment of Austria prior to the Anschluss remarkably well. It won several Academy Awards including Best Picture along with Julie Andrews being nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as well. In short, those viewers who are interested in a nice family film of this type should certainly give it some consideration and I have rated it accordingly."

Therefore, I always feel uncertain before watching them, knowing they could go either way.\n\n'The Sound of Music', though, is a delight. As alluded to, I have obviously heard countless positive things about this film down the years so I'm glad it didn't disappoint. Despite a potentially damaging 175 minute run time, it absolutely flew by - superb pacing. I will say the last 30-40 minutes do feel like a possibly unnecessary add-on, but it all still makes for entertaining viewing.\n\nHow about that soundtrack? So many songs that have seriously passed the test of time in terms of relevance, I had practically heard of them all before despite never setting eyes of the film until now. \"My Favorite Things\" is the standout in my opinion, but all the music is excellent.\n\nJulie Andrews is terrific in the role of Maria, I will say early on I thought she might've been annoying given how excitable she is, but she quickly becomes great to watch throughout. Christopher Plummer is impressive, also. Those two are the clear stars of this, but all the other cast members do worthy jobs too.\n\nIt's, so I read, not completely true to the real life story of Maria von Trapp & Co. However, all I care about is whether it's an entertaining film - which this undoubtedly is. A must-watch!"

Both give performances as they were meant to be and give the film the perfect flow. Plummer is one of my favourite actors and watching this film will give you a good idea of how talented he is.\n\nThe best aspect of this film is the beautiful way it was shot. Robert Wise did a brilliant job giving this film even more character, making it more than just another musical. The opening sequence of the camera coming through the clouds into the wonderous mountains is just a taste of what is to come later in the film. The way the subtle whites and blues are used to give the film a special glow is something that has rarely ever been emulated.\n\nI give a full recommendation of this film and put it in the must-see category.\n\n8/10 stars."

This proves we do need music in our lives, good music. (And a good looking Naval Captain wouldn't hurt either.)"

I really suggest this movie to all that enjoy musicals, and who want to learn a little bit on history as well. Trust me on this, rent the movie. Your home television screen, will truly come alive, with the sound of music."

I really liked the time when the children and Maria are in the meadow and Maria teaches all seven children how to sing, using one of the classic songs Do-Rae-me-fa-so-la-tee. I also like the concert at the end before they hide in the Abby. I recommend this movie to all people especially old movie lovers. This is an extremely great over all for movie for the whole family to enjoy, and a must see. This movie will live on for many, many years to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" is a timeless musical film directed by Robert Wise and released in 1965. Starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, it is based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which in turn was inspired by the true story of the von Trapp family. The film follows Maria, a young nun-in-training, as she becomes a governess for the seven children of Captain Georg von Trapp, a widowed naval officer.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of \"The Sound of Music\" is its beautiful music. The film features a memorable score composed by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The songs like \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Edelweiss,\" and the titular \"The Sound of Music\" have become iconic and are still cherished by audiences today. The music adds depth to the storytelling and enhances the emotional impact of the film.\n\nThe performances in \"The Sound of Music\" are exceptional. Julie Andrews shines as Maria, bringing warmth, charisma, and a stunning voice to the role. She perfectly captures Maria's free-spirited nature, her love for the von Trapp children, and her blossoming romance with Captain von Trapp. Christopher Plummer delivers a strong performance as Captain von Trapp, portraying both his stern exterior and his eventual transformation as he rediscovers his love for music and his family.\n\nThe cinematography and set design of the film are visually stunning, capturing the breathtaking landscapes of Austria. The movie showcases a mix of grand, sweeping shots and intimate moments, which help create a sense of immersion in the story. The costume design is also noteworthy, with the iconic outfits worn by Maria and the children becoming instantly recognizable.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" strikes a balance between light-hearted and serious moments. It tackles themes of love, family, freedom, and the rise of Nazism in Austria. The story's historical backdrop adds depth to the narrative and raises the stakes for the characters. The film's climax, where the von Trapp family must escape from Austria, is both suspenseful and emotionally satisfying.\n\nOverall, \"The Sound of Music\" is a beloved classic that continues to captivate audiences with its charming characters, unforgettable music, and heartfelt story. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless appeal and the lasting impact it has had on generations of viewers. Whether you're a fan of musicals or not, \"The Sound of Music\" is a must-see film that showcases the magic of cinema at its best."

My father had passed away that year and this movie and these songs are so heartfelt that it gave me hope.\n\nA true story that is as charming as it is thrilling. It breaks my heart that the incomparable Julie Andrews can no longer sing. So you relish every song she performs with gusto and joy.\n\nChristopher Plummer is divine. The whole cast of children are a delight.\n\nRogers and Hammerstein's Oscar-winning masterpiece!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Great musical with Julie Andrews. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been watching this movie for 60 years. The first time I saw it I was nine years old. It enthralled me. It has enthralled me ever since. Every time I watch this film it makes me happy. I can no longer say that. I know all the words to all the songs because watching it with subtitles I realize that I have forgotten the odd word overtime, but I still find it extremely difficult not to sing along with every single song. I personally know of no other musical, where every single song is worth trying to remember. Every song in this show is a memorable tune. From How do you solve a problem like Maria to Doe a deer, through Lonely Goatherd, I am 16, the shows signature tune and Climb every mountain, to the lovely and sentimental Edelweiss, every song evokes an emotion, that calls to the heart.\n\nMany of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals deal with dark themes from the tragic loss of love due to war through the rape and abuse of women and the sound of music deals with the impending terror, the rise of Hitler's Nazis, but it manages to address this terror but still find room for light and love. Beautifully filmed, sensitively directed and extremely well acted by the entire cast, for me, this is simply the best musical film ever made."

And who could possibly forget the iconic opening scene? How the camera swoops all across the mountains and towns and lakes and fields and finally closes in on Julie Andrews circling around with her arms open. Also, the Blu-ray release is one of the best Blu-rays I've purchased."

Maria is very nice, and she helps the children have fun and be happy. The movie shows the importance of family and being brave during tough times. The scenery is beautiful, with big mountains and lovely gardens.\n\nIs it easy to understand? Yes! The story is simple and easy to follow. The songs are catchy, and the characters are very likable.

        "review_detailed_main": "My grandmother (God rest her soul) took me to see this movie on my eighth birthday, which was of course, in 1965; the year that it was released. Except for the thunderstorm scene, this was a great movie! The opening scene with Julie Andrews dancing through the Alps singing the title song still brings tears of joy to my eyes! They just don't make movies like this anymore. Even my grandmother loved it.\n\nSince this was filmed over in Austria, I always wondered how they filmed those thunderstorm scenes. Did they go out in an actual thunderstorm and film this? I also read that it did rain in Austria while they were over there filming this.\n\nI finally got the answer to that question: no. The interior shots were filmed at the 20th Century Fox studios in Hollywood. The first scene filmed was where Liesl (played by Charmian Carr) was coming in from a thunderstorm, with her dress all wet and dirty from the rain, and climbed into Maria's bedroom window. (She was outside in the gazebo with Rolf, played by Daniel Truitte, when it started to rain, and they ran into the gazebo.) Anyway, they sprayed Charmian Carr with water several times and she had to be wetted down for every take.\n\nSadly, they just don't make movies like this anymore. Today's films are simply filled of sex, violence, and cursing. The Sound of Music was a huge success at the box office, and is still a timeless classic! It won five Academy Awards; including the Best Picture of the Year. The songs from the film are just memorable: \"My Favorite Things\", \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"Edelweiss\", \"Climb Every Mountain\", and of course the title song. In fact, \"My Favorite Things\" is played on the radio at around Christmas time; especially the version done by Diana Ross and the Supremes.\n\nIt's a shame that Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood didn't win the Academy Award for their acting performances. And Christopher Plummer should have been nominated for Best Actor as well. They were just fantastic in this movie. In fact, every time I see Julie Andrews on TV, I always think to myself, \"The best movie that she ever did was The Sound of Music\", and believe me; it was.\n\nForty-seven years after it's release, The Sound of Music is still a timeless classic!"

Having revisited it 6 years later, I am now much more of a fan than I was before, the 3 horsemen of old musicals, Mary Poppins, Singin in the Rain, and The Sound of Music.\n\nJulie Andrews is perfect, having played both Maria and Marry Poppins, released back to back, she surely has solidified herself in the hall of 60's/50's musical stars, her voice and mannerisms are absolutely stunning.\n\nEvery single technical aspect of this movie is a 10/10, visual, production, music, dancing, and likeable characters, the way it's shot and directed are truly outstanding, every shot and scene are filled with beautiful visuals and marvelous colors, and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, I have quite a few replaying in my head infinite times over, Edelweiss, So Long, Farewell, Do-Re-Mi, and so many others, chefs kiss.\n\nAnd all of the children actors are memorable and adorable, the suspense during the final hiding scene was masterfully done and had me holding my breath.\n\nThe Sound of Music is a near perfect musical, and it gets an A."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some very good stories that are set to music, AKA musicals. Problem is, I just don't like musicals, never have.\n\nWhile nearly all musicals bore me, this is just slightly different.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\nSTORY: The character played by Julie Andrews sets the tone for the entire story, e.g. If you go along with all the normal BS, you'll end up being part of the same BS, e.g. Patriotism, war, lusting after money, etc.\n\nThe character of \"Maria\" (Andrews) is a wildly complex and innocent person - half adult, half child. Conventional religion can't hold her, but she's not your average girl that gets married just to be married. Frankly, she's a marvelous \"catch.\"\n\nIt's the unusual story and Andrews portrayal of its central character that make this film, and God can that woman sing!\n\nACTING: Everyone does a good job here, and who knew Plummer could sing.\n\nBut Andrews' freely expressive way, her precision, and her symphonic voice carry this whole film. She plays the part to a tee, and her voice just gives the film a heart warming brilliance. She's really that good here.\n\nTEMPO: Overall, it's fine. But again, I dislike musicals so I dread it when they have to stop and sing (ha ha), well, not always.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Wow! Wow!\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: Wise (director) has shot a number of good films: \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" \"Run Silent Run Deep,\" \"West Side Story,\" \"The Andromeda Strain,\" \"Audrey Rose.\" He was quite gifted. BTW - I recommend all the aforementioned titles.\n\nIs it a very good film? Yes, it's excellent.\n\nShould you watch this once? Yes, especially if you actually like musicals : )\n\nRating: 9.0."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched The Sound of Music, and I thought it was a very good movie. The story was engaging, and the music was absolutely beautiful. Julie Andrews did an amazing job as Maria. Her voice is incredible, and she brought so much life and energy to the character.\n\nThe kids in the movie were also great. Each of them had their own personality, and they were all so charming. I especially liked the scenes where Maria teaches them to sing. The songs are so catchy and have been stuck in my head since I watched the movie.\n\nThe scenery in the movie is stunning too. The shots of the Austrian Alps were breathtaking, and they added a lot to the overall feel of the film. The sets and costumes were also very well done, making it easy to get lost in the time period.\n\nThe movie is a bit long, but it never felt boring to me. The pacing was just right, and there was always something interesting happening. The mix of music, romance, and a touch of drama kept me hooked from start to finish.\n\nOverall, The Sound of Music is a classic for a reason. It's a heartwarming story with fantastic music and memorable performances. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who says you can't buy happiness? As long as Robert Wise's The Sound of Music is playing, you can. And that's going to be for a good long time. Don't, however, wait. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure a moment longer than necessary. Run, do not walk, to the nearest box office. The 20th-Fox release will be one of the movies' all-time hits, one of the all-time great pictures. It restores your faith in movies. If you sit quietly and let it take, it may also restore your faith in humanity. It does this with infectious wit, with consistent gaiety, with simple and realistic spirituality, with romance of heartbreak and heartmend. This is set against the most beautiful scenery you have seen in your life. The Sound of Music is quite a picture. There are many reasons why this musical, from the lilting intelligence of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, is such an enthralling success. Credit producer-director Robert Wise, first of all, for his consummate skill in organizing and guiding it. But the talent that gives it the final lift is unquestionably that of Julie Andrews. This lady is not just a great star, she is a whole whirling, dazzling constellation. She is not just an ordinary movie personality, she is a phenomenon. Once there was Mary Pickford, then there was Garbo, now there is Julie. She is very likely going to be the object of one of the most intense and sustained love affairs between moviegoers and a star in the history of motion pictures. Various song numbers have been without exception expertly staged. \"My Favorite Things,\" sung by Miss Andrews and the children, is perhaps the most warmly presented, while \"Do-Re-Mi,\" showing femme and the moppets picnic-bound through the streets of Salzburg, the most spritely. Miss Andrews' opening title song atop mountain marks an effective start of the picture which is prologued by aerial views through the mountains, and \"Lonely Goathered,\" a puppet number backed by. Hers and children's voices. Provides a light note. Moppets' \"So Long, Farewell\" is charming, and various reprises throughout the film lend additional interest. It has been common to say that this score by Rodgers and Hammerstein is not one of their great ones. So it seemed when the show opened in New York. The show had a curious rising curve, though. Despite the patronizing tone of the critics, it enjoyed a substantial Broadway success. Its enduring values have been seen elsewhere. It has turned out to be one of the most popular shows in new musical theaters now dotting the land. Maria, a postulant at a convent near Salzburg, Austria, is detached from her duties to be governess to the seven motherless children of Baron Von Trapp. The Baron, formerly a captain and hero in the Austrian navy, runs his home on military lines. His five girls and two boys exercise their rebellion by tormenting a string of governesses. Maria is the first to defeat them. She does it with spunkiness and charm, teaching them to live and love. She also makes a conquest of the captain and ends up herself Baroness Von Trapp. Wise shot all the exteriors of The Sound of Music, and some of the interiors, at the locale, the Austrian city of Salzburg. He justifies that location in the first few minutes. It is a daring opening, with no music, no sound, just clouds floating across the screen, clouds that thin to disclose the Alps, and then Miss Andrews singing the title song. It is some kind of irony that this incomparable scenery has been the paint-and-canvas background for a dozen operettas. This is the first time it has been used \"live.\"The Sound of Music is what it says, almost continuously musical in sound. Wise and company have used music to cover two bad gaps in the stage version. There is a new song, \"Confidence in Me,\" sung by Miss Andrews with bounce and verve, on her journey from the Abbey to the Von Trapp villa. The final big scene, where the Von Trapps must confuse the Nazis in making a getaway, has been set in a Salzburg concert hall. There is a good, exciting scene following this where the Von Trapps elude their pursuers with the help of Maria's nuns. This leads naturally into the final scene of the Von Trapps walking over the mountains to freedom."

Maria is a young wannabe nun who is hired by Captain von Trapp to be the governess for his 7 children. Eventually they fall in love and are married. When the Nazis try to forcefully enlist Captain von Trapp to their navy, he and his family are forced to flee Austria. The movie has stunning footage of the Austrian Alps and catchy songs, but I feel that it is too outdated to receive a higher review. My main issue is that von Trapp is old enough to be Maria's dad. The culture and time in the movie is just too different from today to be relatable. In addition, the 3 hour movie felt too slow and could sometimes be quite tedious. It is the sort of movie you watch once just for the sake of watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening scene from this film has been parodied umpteen times, and I think that just goes to show just how impactful Robert Wise's adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein story has been on cinema. The idea that one could have seven children is, frankly, quite terrifying (I have none) so I can readily empathise with poor old Julie Andrews \"Maria\" as she is despatched from the safety of her nunnery to be the governess to this extended brood in the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). After an initially hostile reception from both father and youngsters alike, \"Maria\" soon ingratiates herself with all concerned - except, perhaps, for the Captain's beau Eleanor Parker who is wonderfully elegant and aloof as the \"Baroness\" - and romance gradually takes firm hold. The anschluss injects some seriousness into the fluffiness of the plot - the family must adjust to their new Nazi \"protectors\", but when the Captain is invited to take up a commission in the Navy they realise that they must act. Though a little cheesy at times, Andrews and Plummer are terrific, the songs are the stuff of musical legend, and I suspect one of the things that makes this more enduring is the fact that it is based on truth. The happiness tinged with the peril of the enveloping ruthlessness of the Nazis gives this an authenticity that would have been felt by many in Europe as Hitler was in the ascendancy and Wise manages to capture a little of that feeling. It's got some classy supporting performances from Peggy Wood (the Mother Abbess), a super Richard Haydn as the charming, if slightly opportunistic \"Uncle Max\" and even the ordinarily upstanding nuns get in on the act. There is definitely a chemistry between the two stars as their love story enfolds with the help of the children, a rather lavish puppet show - and a bit of Strauss! It looks great, too - musical cinema at it's best, this..."

I think there's something here for everyone whom enjoys film and filmmaking. I couldn't possibly recommend it enough. Especially due to the stellar and tense finale we're given.

Only a very selected and unfortunate few will not be able to tie that to the movie which has gone down the years as a golden classic and an all-time favorite and a definite must watch. Are you still trying to guess the movie? Let me try again......\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?\n\nThose who guessed it right, good on you. Those who still are clueless need to go grab a DVD or Blu Ray copy of THE SOUND OF MUSIC! Set during the latter1930s in Salzburg Austria is this heartwarming musical of the Von Trapp family and the hardships they had to live through during uprising of Hitler's empire. Inspired by true events of the highly decorated WW1 Austro- Hungarian Naval officer George Von Trapp , Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews along with the Von Trapp children will touch your hearts and take you back in time to when their newly united family is almost about to be separated by the evil clutches of war.\n\nMaria who is a postulant at the Nonberg abbey is absolutely as graceful as a swan and yet as lively as a chipmunk and has the voice of a nightingale. Her tendency of getting into constant mischief has the nuns doubting her future at the abbey. It is at this point that Maria is sent of as a governess to the Von Trapp estate. It is here that she changes the norms and once again brings within the Von Trapp mansion walls the sounds of music. Captain Von Trapp a decorated WW1 hero is a patriot of Austria and isn't timid about his beliefs and flies the nation's flag high at a time the Nazi revolution is sweeping across Europe.\n\nWholesomely packed with marvel tunes as Edelweiss, My favorite things and Climb every mountain this musical extravagance is one of my favorite musicals of all time and absolutely has the potential to be yours as well. Whilst most of Julie Andrews singing was done by her, facts state that it isn't so with her co-star Christopher Plummer. Facts state that a lion's share of his vocals is done by invitee artists. Surprisingly this does not for a moment draw out any negativity towards the musical.\n\nDirector the Late Robert Wise, a legend before my time, a legend whose work I have loved as a child. I recall the year as 1992 when I first watched this movie and my heartfelt respect goes out to the brilliant work of the late Mr. Wise. Sir your production will live on for many generations to come and I sincerely hope this piece of mine will help her journey at least in a minuscule manner.\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSIC has been selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the national films registry. Thus unfolds this master of classics in the genre of musicals. Now you tell me if you should watch it or not?\n\nTitle: The Sound Of Music Directed by: Robert Wise Starring: Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews Rated: Rating: 09/10"

Who knew!\n\n60 years later and my 5 year old granddaughter already sings along. Definitely the loudest if not the most dulcet tones to be sure. Kind of the definition of a classic. I doubt her grandchildren will be singing along with Hamilton.\n\nThis and other Roger's and Hammerstein classics define what it means to be a classic musical. While easy to to dismiss as fluff, it is based on a true story set in 1938 on the eve of the Nazis taking over Austria, and has Nazis, betrayal, escapes, life and death situations, hiding behind it's musical scrim. The music and lyrics range from filler to carry the story along, to songs that became American Standards. \"Edelweiss\" is so well written many assume it is the actual national anthem of Austria. There are several story lines, both young children and their parents can watch the movie and leave the theatre having experienced completely different movies. Several scenes could be stressful for young children, in stark contrast to the movies general lighthearted theme. Each time I watch, a hidden gem reveals itself, worth a 30th or 40th viewing for sure. Note the stage musical and the movie version are not the same, the movie version reorders the original, and eliminates a couple of songs. Though not as extreme as the stage and movie versions of \"Chicago\" for example. That said I find Robert Wises version to be the superior production. Enjoy!"

        "review_title": "One of the Greatest Movie Musicals of All Time",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" is rightfully remembered by many as one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. It came out during the golden age of movie musicals, with \"West Side Story\", \"Mary Poppins\" (also starring Julie Andrews), and \"Oliver!\" all being produced in the 1960s to critical acclaim and Oscar gold. In my opinion, \"The Sound of Music\" tops them all. Some of the most memorable musical pieces of all time, the beautiful location shooting in the Bavarian Alps, and wonderful performances from Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The story's a bit simple and lighthearted, but it works as a wholesome movie for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nMaria (Andrews) is an aspiring nun from Salzburg, Austria, who is always getting into trouble with her fellow nuns for her youthful disregard for the strict lifestyle. She is sent away to work as a governess for the Von Trapp family with the hopes that that would better suit her personality. When she arrives, she is greeted by the cold Captain Von Trapp (Plummer), an Austrian Navy war hero who keeps his seven children tightly disciplined and treats them like soldiers. Maria introduces them to singing, dancing, and playing, and the children's newfound joy in Maria slowly rub off on Captain Von Trapp. Meanwhile, the Third Reich's influence over Austria slowly tightens.\n\nApart from the music, I was surprised to find myself gushing over the cinematography on my most recent viewing, which is rare for musicals and movies from this time period in general. Older movies were often filmed in a very flat and boring way, with actors sitting in rooms while cameras with reversed angles roll. But \"The Sound of Music\" makes great use of its 70mm widescreen presentation. There are so many shots with a wide panoramic scope, characters lined up from side to side, that were just made for this format. This is definitely an older movie that I need to see on a larger screen if I ever get the chance.\n\nI recommend \"The Sound of Music\" wholeheartedly as a bonafide cinematic classic. Anyone who loves musicals, older movies, or just lighthearted fun will enjoy this movie a ton. There's not enough praise that I can give what I consider to be one of my favorite movies of all time."

If that's not true art - than what is?\n\nA special note of excellence to the actors, perfectly casted . Julie is magic, her voice is heaven, It feels Julie IS Maria - there is no acting! As is her chemistry with the children and the Captain .\n\nChristopher Plummer made every women's heart go from pre puberty to puberty and beyond. His looks is beyond handsome. He has an almost impossible mission to transform from a stern furious guy to the loving tender man he is inside. Only the Alien movie required this! But this Shakespearean actor can do anything, turn saccharine to sweet wine, that ages so fine.\n\nCan't end this without noting Robert Wise, the Maestro director for conjuring this potion of youth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviews of the Sound of Music always revolve, naturally enough, around Julie Andrews, a splendid actress and singer who plays the role of Maria in a second coming of the loveable nanny/governess type figure that brought her so much success in Mary Poppins.\n\nHer performance is in many ways magnificent, although her dancing pales in comparison with the subject of this review (just compare the curtsies in the ballroom scene) and I've always found it hard to believe that the Captain would dump the Baroness, a beautiful, intelligent and eminently suitable woman, and fall for a would-be nun who, despite being able to bond with his kids, dresses terribly, wears her hair short and appears essentially virginal.\n\nConversely, reviewers often downplay the role of Liesl, played by the late Charmian Carr, perhaps because she's \"just\" one of the seven children. However, the 21 (and not 16) year old dazzles at every opportunity in her debut role with a voice to die for and breathtaking dancing that reflects her upbringing in ballet. She's the one child who gets her own scene (in the gazebo) and the five-or-so minutes this love story lasts are almost a film in themselves.\n\nWhile Maria fails to suggest any sexuality, Liesl has it in spades. As an anecdote, some readers will know that Ms Carr stayed at the same hotel as Christopher Plummer during the filming in Salzburg and they drank and partied (with others, I hasten to add) into the early hours, developing a friendship that's reflected in the odd flirtatious moment in the actual film.\n\nPerhaps an offbeat opinion, but I think this exceptionally beautiful and talented singer, actress and dancer deserves more credit for her performance."

When I graduated high school I left home to go to college and a good 20 years passed before i saw it again. I was surprised upon seeing it as an adult and 30+ years after it's original release just how wonderful it is. It's definitely a polarizing film, and for those many critics the main and singular complaint seems to be that its too sweet, saccharin, unrealistic. I don't completely disagree with them, in many ways those charges can be levelled against most movie musicals. Frankly, that doesn't hold up for me. Sure, there's a little bit of fantasy here, but I do think its very well done. The sets, direction, story, are all excellent and make for a memorable and thoughtful viewing experience. This is a grand film worth seeing, or giving another viewing if you haven't see it in a long time."

She pulls you into her plight, which seems a bit one dimensional at the start but fills up with more emotional depth as the story presses on and becomes more wrapped up in everyone's lives.\n\nIt discusses formerly taboo subjects like the Nazi occupation of Austria and what it felt like to be an appeaser versus a renegade in a time where people's true patriotism was tested.\n\nI couldn't think of this movie being more fulfilling and well-done.

Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun, Sister Maria, who is sent to help a local military man, Captain Von Trap, played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children. At first, the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways. She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all. Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again. She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters. They sing, play, and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains. Of course, Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children. Of course, this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II. When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon, they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain. The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns. Again, the scenery, the art direction, the costumes, the music, the writing, and acting are all first rate."

I am sure Mary Martin was wonderful as was Australias leading lady June Bronhill but there is no denying that Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria. She is indeed practically perfect in every way. The opening when the camera pans over the glorious scenery and we see Maria singing the title song must be one of the great moments in film. It is up there with the shower sequence of Psycho. The whole cast is great. One performance that just get better and better each time I see it and lets face it we have all seen it dozens of times, is Eleanour Parker as the Baroness. She is wonderful. It was great to see Marni Nixon, the great voice but unseen in many a movie. It is a pity a few grumpy old critics could not see through their bias and take the film for what it is, a joyful celebration. It gets a ten from me and it always will. I read once that Christopher Plummer was not happy with his performance in the movie but in actual fact he gave a nicely restrained gentle performance. It is indeed the role he will be remembered for."

Tours run from the town centre which, alas, I could not fit in when visiting in 2004.

        "review_detailed_main": "The string between bona fide sweetness and sappy over-romanticizing in movies is very difficult to describe, but Robert Wise's masterful and infinitely entertaining musical epic The Sound of Music is not a minor instance. The depiction of that meager good, true purity, is so superbly played by the supreme cast. There is not one moment where I feel like I'm watching plaster-smiled caricatures that come along with so many musicals. What I cherish so much about this film is its happiness and its meaning, its characters' feet being relatively close to the ground and yet their heads up in the clouds.\n\nThe music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been overlooked for being beneath the benchmark of their generation like George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein and others, but it is also unquestionable that their work on this, the perfect musical, have endured the trial of decades for the utter aptness of point in time and situation of the infectious songs that support the dramatic course, that are actually a part of the stream of the story, rather than interrupting it in its path like Singin' In the Rain. And their intrinsic catchiness carries on with both school and professional musical theater in innumerable revivals.\n\nThe musical numbers work magic visually, as the choreography is sometimes almost logistically impossible, but not in that it uses any special effects. Many musicals would either be much better without the music or much better without the story. The Sound of Music's fun and energizing music is inborn. I would not have the story any other way. It would hardly work.\n\nTaking place in Austria's beautiful countryside, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is studying to become a nun but is not sure if convent life is right for her. She's just too musical and spontaneous. Can you blame her? So she is sent to be the governess to seven children, ranging in age from sixteen to five, of an overzealous widower naval commander, Captain von Trapp, played with seamlessly masked resentment by the great Christopher Plummer. Maria and the Captain right away conflict on the way the children are cared for. The Captain has been raising them in keeping with the ethics of military authority, whereas Maria wants them to take pleasure in life as children. In spite of the children being initially naughty and unwelcoming to Maria, in spite of Plummer's overwhelming rigidity, we love them all immediately.\n\nWould a Captain whose wife has passed away not find the naval discipline that he'd been living with for so long to be his first mechanism against the pain and heartbreak of his wife's death? And is that not an indirect manner of showing love to his children, by making their lives so strict and systematic that they cannot take the time to reflect on what life is like without a mother? The Von Trapp family is lovingly developed and, as should be the perogative of any story by no means excluding musicals, are the footing for the rest of the story.\n\nThe reason The Sound of Music works so wonderfully well is because we are lost in the same perfect world with this unique but natural little family in which love, music and beauty are one, and then when the outside world doesn't slow down for them, we are there with them."

        "review_detailed_main": "What Rodgers may lack of pure style, / He makes up for - well, once in a while - / By the way he can bluster / From the depths of lacklustre / To the almost transcendently vile.\n\nApologies to John Ciardi, who composed a version of this limerick in honour of someone else - but it exactly sums up my attitude towards Richard Rodgers and, to a lesser extent, Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers was never much of a musician. His spectacular box-office success makes little sense when you consider that his contemporaries included (at different times) George Gershwin, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein - all composers who could blow him out of the water and who all, incidentally, wrote better songs. Rodgers and Hammerstein specialised in middlebrow inoffensiveness. But every so often they would leave this realm and enter that of the positively bad: `Surrey with a Fringe on Top', `A Gal Who Can't Say No', `Clam Bake', `I'm Gonna to Wash that Man Right out of My Hair' and `State Fair' are all songs with a pungent stink.\n\n`The Sound of Music' is their best work. It never stinks, it's heartfelt, and at any rate it avoids the air of calculated innovation and phoney bigness that pervades most of their other musicals. And this is a glorious transfer to the screen, it really is. (Note that Robert Wise was also responsible for the screen version of `West Side Story'.) Its weaknesses stem from weaknesses in the original. For instance:\n\nToo many songs occur in performances for the benefit of other characters - it's the old let's-put-on-a-show problem. By the end of `Lonely Goatherd' we are fidgeting and wondering when we'll ever be done with the impromptu theatrical productions, and if the story will ever be allowed to proceed. The lyrics for `Something Good' were written by Rodgers himself and they demonstrate that Hammerstein's job was much harder than it looked. `So Long, Farewell' is just too slight in every way to be worth staging - and it's staged TWICE, no less. And some dialogue that might work on stage plays cheezily on the screen.\n\nOn the other hand, the Rodgers and Hammerstein style for once truly suits its subject. Many of the songs are children's songs, nursery songs (`My Favourite Things'), beginner's songs (`Do Re Me'), or simple patriotic folksongs (`Edelweiss'). Even more musically sophisticated things like the title song come off well. Yes, this musical isn't at all innovative, but then Rodgers was never GOOD at innovation - that kind of thing was better left to Gerwshin, Weill, Bernstein, et al.\n\nIt's a pity that `The Sound of Music' is the only `epic' musical that many people see - `West Side Story' and `Fiddler on the Roof' are better examples of the genre, and at any rate give a more balanced view of what it's capable of. But I must side with those who say that it's nonetheless a great movie. The script is (mostly) sharp, the languid direction is appropriate and engrossing, and it simply LOOKS good. Besides, like everyone else, I've seen it more times than I can count. Does that mean anything?"

I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore. Thats a shame, but thats a fact of life in contemporary Hollywood these days.A genuine classic that seems to get better every time you watch it. Grand entertainment and the best musical film ever made, it is truly one of my favorite things!"

I'll take that over the mindless, loud, trashy, computer-generated drivel being made today. The Sound of Music never fails to lift and inspire the best that is in me and I believe that is a large part of its tremendous appeal. It speaks to our noblest ambitions and most dearly-held beliefs--freedom, family, God, country, love and the beauties of the world--the things that no one can ever really take away; the things that matter most. Combine that with how beautifully crafted every element of the film is and you've got a classic, worthy of repeated viewings and of passing on to successive generations as an example of a well-made film that is truly a credit to all who participated in its production. Beautiful music, outstanding performances, exquisite scenery, strong themes, humor, adventure and romance--it's got it all. If I knew I was going to be stranded on a desert island with my VCR and only one movie, this is the one I would choose. We need a little more innocence today and a whole lot of cheering up. Thank heaven for the Sound of Music--long may it endure!!!"

Of course,it is cheesy beyond belief at times.But when cheese is as well made as this it isn't really a problem.\n\nThere are times when I had to stifle a chuckle.When the Mother Abbess bursts into 'Climb Every Mountain',I really struggled to take it seriously.But the story is charming,the acting is fine and the scenery is just stunning.The movie is also very well photographed with excellent lighting and fabulous interior shots.The songs don't all hit the mark,but are in general excellent.I especially liked 'The Lonely Goatherd','Do-Re-Me' and 'Edelweiss'.\n\nIt has to be said though that the best thing in the movie is Julie Andrews,who shows again what a fine musical actress she was.Just as in 'Mary Poppins',she totally convinces as Maria and gives an excellent performance.She is sparky,dippy,strong and romantic and fits the role like a glove.\n\nSo then,'The Sound of Music' isn't perfect.It is too long and there are cringe worthy moments.But all in all it is a fine family film with it's heart in the right place."

I am the same age as the daughter \"Marta\" so I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least 50 times and could watch it again and again. Its one of those movies that makes you forget all your troubles and just an all around feel good movie. How many of us don't know practically all the words to the songs? I bet we can all sing them. (and were talking 40years here). By far, a movie that will live in our hearts(or at least mine) forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite its historical inaccuracies, \"The Sound of Music\" is an outstanding film.\n\nI never forgave Rex Harrison for opening up the best actress envelope and quickly saying the winner is Julie...and then pausing. He looked right into the eyes of Julie Andrews and said...Christie for \"Darling.\"\n\nNote that I said inaccuracy. As an historian, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that Maria did not marry Georg Von Trapp in 1938 as the film suggests. They wed in the 1920s. In fact, by '38, as the anschluss engulfed Austria, the Von Trapp children were mostly grown. One son had just graduated from medical school.\n\nWith this inaccuracy, we still have a glorious film about a singing family and a woman who came one summer as their governess and wound up marrying the widower.\n\nJulie Andrews is just picture perfect as Maria, the woman, who was not destined to become a nun. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Georg, who loved his children, but whose love had to be brought out by Maria. Eleanor Parker was quite effective as the baroness. She saw Maria as a rival and attempted to get rid of her. When Maria returns, she bowed out gracefully.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking. Austria was never lovelier. The songs are staged beautifully. Who can forget I Have Confidence, Going on 16,and My Favorite Things? It's all glorious. The dancing throughout Austria was marvelously staged by great choreography.\n\nThe children are just adorable and so memorable. Charmaine Carr, portrays the eldest, Lisle, at age 16. Actually, Miss Carr was 21 when the film was made and Julie Andrews was 28!\n\nToo little credit is given to Marnie Nixon, who portrayed Sister Sophia. Few people knew that she did all the singing for the nuns in the rendition of How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? She even sang for Peggy Wood in the latter's rendition of Climb Every Mountain. Miss Nixon, who sang for so many of the stars in films, was never given the credit she so aptly deserved.\n\nNorma Varden, known for playing erudite women in smaller roles, played Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Few people know that Miss Varden was set to play the Peggy Wood role of Mother Superior. At the last moment, Miss Varden was replaced by Wood.\n\nGo see this film over and over. The chemistry between Andrews and Plummer is terrific.\n\nRichard Haydn, as the music impresario is great. His line of \"how many men that you know confer with their children on their honeymoon\" was memorable. Ben Wright made for a wonderful villain who later becomes the town's gauleiter after the anschluss takes place.\n\nA film for all occasions, never to be missed."

Filmed largely on location in Austria, the scenery is simply breathtaking. Who can ever forget the beautiful opening sequence where the camera pans over the mountains before zooming in on star Julie Andrews singing the title song. And there's that unforgettable Rodgers and Hammerstein score.\n\nThe story line is simple. A novice nun Maria, (Andrews at the peak of her career) is sent to be governess for a family of seven children ranging in age from 5 to 16. The family is that of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) a former naval hero. The story takes place during the 30s just prior to WWII. The Nazi influence is felt more or less as a background to the story until the final minutes of the movie.\n\nThe songs are plentiful and memorable. My favorite is the rendition of \"Climb Every Mountain\" sung by the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood). But there are so many memorable songs. Plummer tries his best with \"Eidleweiss\" but the best that can be said about that, is that as a singer, Plummer makes a great actor. Andrews was born to play Maria and gives a marvelous performance in the Role. Richard Haydn as Uncle Max and Eleanor Parker as the Baroness are also in the cast. The children who also give memorable performances are played by talented youngsters too many to mention here.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" has stood the test of time as evidenced by the recent release of a sing-a-long version to theaters. It is a true classic of family entertainment."

Sometimes the story gets faded by melo-dramatic romantic moments, but what the heck(it is a musical, you know). Cinematically beautifully captured mountains and Austrian landscape also lend to the appreciation of this play brought to film. There definetly are not many movies like this that bring together drama and music so well. I guess this and many other reasons are why this movie will be loved for a long time."

I grew up listening to Do-re-mi and You are sixteen going on seventeen. It was simply great. The reason why we like this movie is basically because it is simple. The storyline , the script are all very ordinary and so they appeal to us.The music has become famous the world over. Why ? Definitely because it is melodious and the other reason is - Because it is that kind of music which appeals to all. Sound of Music is a story which deals with the life of Maria a woman to be made a nun. But the others discover that she is very much unlike them and so she is sent to become a governess to the seven children of an officer . Later it is shown how Maria changes the lives of the children who live a spartan life by teaching them to dance and sing and play . And along with that changes the life of their father by showing him that life is beautiful and lovely. They unknowingly fall for each other and get married . The further part deals with their journey - how they escape from the clutches of the Nazis and then live a quiet life , but a musical one, in the mountains. It indirectly teaches us something. Life is not just living and then dying , but doing something remarkable that will make you be remembered forever. And the love of Maria for music and nature also makes us come close to nature. Her understanding of children makes her seem to be a very beautiful person. And it shows us that children are not brats who do not know anything but if taught with patience can do wonders. The music of this film is still heard by all the world over.And in this genre too. The photography is wonderful. It fills me with wonder to see a movie which can make an impact on people's mind. This film is not just an ordinary one or a one which deals with some issue. It is special because it delivers many messages to us as I already told. A movie to be viewed by one and all !!!"

This film also has a fantastic story, it's a 3 hours long epic about love, war, faith, family and many more values. The actors are phenomenal, their performances are very natural. Most important thing - the songs. Most musicals have songs sung at random which usually has nothing to do with the film. In this film majority of the songs are sung in the right time which feels realistic and the lyrics are very important to the storyline too. Sometimes the songs are sung while in real life they would not, but I don't mind it at all since their lyrics are important to storyline. And the songs themselves are so great, they sound beautiful, cachy and very memorable. The dance choreography is very good, it feels natural and cute. The music score is beautiful. The characters are interesting and unique. This film features some great comedy too. The dialogues in this film are so deep and meaningful. It's a very inspiring movie. This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. True art."

Sound Of Music is a sweet romantic movie with variety and a beautiful storyline. The story takes place in Austria around the 1930's.\n\nA young woman by the name of Maria(Julie Andrews) is trying to become a nun but miserably failing at each attempt, that is when the convent receives a letter from Navy captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), asking for a governess that can take care of his 7 children. Maria is given the job in hope to do better..\n\nThe captain's wife is dead and he is often away. The children keep managing to run off the former governesses and have resentment towards Maria at first, but her kindness, understanding and fun loving nature win the children's approval and the captain's. The home is run by a strict hand; much like the captain runs the ship he sails on, but as Maria spends time with the family, the home soon changes into a happier household and music is brought back into the family's life.\n\nAs time goes on, the captain and the governess both fall in love with each other and end up getting married. The whole family now must escape Austria, so that the captain won't be forced to fight for Germany. The decision tears the family because of their strong nationalism, but gets them closer to one another.\n\nThe movie is based on a real story and a real family, who escaped Austria during Nazi control. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer really portrayed the essence of the family and their situation. The movie overall was very heart warming and a classic to watch. I found the cinematography to be outstanding and breath-taking, showing off Austria's beauty in many frames and a joy to watch.\n\nI highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has everything you want from a movie, tragedy, comedy, romance, and a message. The film is very moving and hard to forget."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did not see The Sound of Music until maybe 15 years after its initial release. For some reason, my mother and father did not feel I should see the film. Did my parents think it too long and too slow for someone my age (nine years in 1965)? Did they consider the story and the film's style more suitable to girls and women than to boys and men? Did they fear that a situation or two might upset me? Maybe my parents recognized that while the movie did not include any scene truly scandalous or controversial, they did not think the subject matter would interest me.\n\nWhatever their thinking, I recall that this movie that I was discouraged from seeing had apparently created something of a craze across the nation. I remember clearly that in the town where I grew up elementary school teachers, during the 45 minutes devoted 3 times a week to chorus, led their students in singing songs from the Sound of Music's soundtrack, just as high school music instructors included elements of The Sound of Music in the annual On-Broadway production that 17 and 18 year-olds performed for any and all members of the community to attend.\n\nJulie Andrews, herself, had an impact on me, as she did on many other people, who seemed rather enamored of her. In addition to her cute looks, she projected a wholesomeness and innocence -- qualities embodied, not coincidentally, by both her Mary Poppins and Sister Maria characters -- which caused audiences to treat her more as a role model than as a movie star.\n\nBecause of its powerful theme song and various other catchy tunes, awe inspiring cinematography, fine acting and an inoffensive script, light humor, and plot involving a significant historical event, The Sound of Music can give the impression of having been made during an earlier era. Despite all the straight-laced characters, however, The Sound of Music may have reflected the culture of the 1960's more than viewers realize.\n\nSister Maria may not behave like a rebel, but she does show herself to be an individual, who recognizes her inner conflict and comes to realize that a life of devotion to God and many hours in meditation within the confines of a convent don't suit her. More notably, her mother superior, rather than reproach Sister Maria for feeling pulled by both the natural and human activity beyond the walls of the convent, encourages Sister Maria to heed her inner voice and to pursue the interests that fulfill her, even if that means forsaking a higher calling."

But what I would like to comment upon is a kind of nasty, mocking cult that has grown up around this classic film.\n\nI was just a teenager when this film was released, and even though back then we were avid rock & roll fans and certainly were keenly aware of how terrible it was to be thought of as \"square\" (we worked as much at being \"cool\" as we did at anything else), our peers didn't point and laugh if we ventured to say that we thought TSOM was a spectacular film. There was not the almost insidious maligning of TSOM as a joke, as a totally uncool, corny film as had developed some years later. The need to mock TSOM as sport was at a peak I would say, however unscientifically, around the late 70s, early 80s. Recently it seems to have abated somewhat since those peak years, but remnants of it still doggedly persists, even to this day. It's irrational, it's peer-driven and it's sophomoric.\n\nMy take on it, again, wholly unscientific, is that after the Watergate era, anything that had a happy ending was suspect. People wanted hard reality; the musical genre itself was totally out of favor. A format in which the characters burst into song was a suspension of disbelief that audiences could no longer sustain. Musicals, unless they were WOODSTOCK or LADIES AND GENTELMEN THE ROLLING STONES, were disdained by the young. THE SOUND OF MUSIC, MY FAIR LADY, THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN were a dying breed. I surmise that because THE SOUND OF MUSIC was *so* incredibly popular, it turned out to be the biggest target. The undeniable fact it had certifiably \"cute\" moments was a major detriment. We had become much to jaded to respond to it with anything but cynicism. Yet anyone who actually watches this film sans this prejudice, will easily see that there are dark undertones that grow louder as the film progresses. The Nazi threat is real and it isn't exactly the stuff that cute fluff is made of.\n\nWe are lucky enough to be running a new print of this title next week in our outdoor venue in Prospect Park, Brooklyn NY (Celebrate Brooklyn), and so tonight we began running the coming attraction for it. Wouldn't you know it, some of our staff, all in their early twenties (and most of whom I guarantee have never seen this film on a real movie screen), were making derogatory comments about the \"The Puke of Music\" as one smartass called it. Then much to the embarrassment and chagrin of these MTV generation upstarts and despite that lingering cult that says to be cool you need to loudly mock the Robert Wise triumph, an audience of 3500 who watched the coming attraction broke into spontaneous, thunderous applause as the \"Climb Every Mountain\" chorus crescendo ended the trailer.\n\nSo go ahead, all you oh-so-cool hiphop-sters, mock away -- but deep down, you and I both know that your protests are nothing but a great sham, and like 99.99% of the rest of the entire civilized world, you *love* THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Come out of the closet....we'll all welcome you with open arms."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have no idea how I have gone 27 years without seeing The Sound of Music, yet simultaneously knew all the songs featured. I'm also glad that I know the origin of the popular internet meme of Julie Andrews dancing in a field; I enjoy knowing where things come from! This Rodgers and Hammerstein's collaboration directed by Robert Wise starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer has remained a classic long after its 1965 release. The film's message is clear and relatable; love will always exist, and only you can live your life. A pure tale told with exceptional acting and eye-catching cinematography; it is no wonder that The Sound of Music took home Oscar's top prize for Best Picture for 1965.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930's Austria, Maria (Julie Andrews) is trying desperately to become a nun. When a letter is sent to the convent that a Captain in the Navy needs a governess to tend to his 7 rambunctious children, Maria is awarded the task. After getting initiated into the home with a frog in the pocket, and a pine cone in her chair, Maria understands that she has her work cut out for her caring for Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) gaggle of children. Since his wife's death, Captain, as he wishes to be called, has run his home as tight as the ships he commands. After successfully warding off each of the previous governess's, Maria is thrown a bone by the youngest Von Trapp child who declares that she likes Maria immediately after her arrival. Maria's kind and joyful disposition brings happiness back to the bleak Von Trapp household. Maria's presence also gains the attention of the Captain, who is engaged to be married to a wealthy baroness. As the feelings grow between Maria and the Captain, the two begin to question the choices they have made in their lives and begin to accept the lives they were born to live.\n\nOpening with overhead shots of vast mountains, eternal sky, and majestic seas, it is more than worth mentioning that the cinematography in this film is beyond compare. There were amazing shots all throughout the film, culminating in a great shot of Maria and Captain professing their love for each other. The chemistry between Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews was convincing and endearing. They worked so well together on-screen that I teared up upon their reunion at the Von Trapp house. Chemistry had to be believable seeing as Maria was convincing Captain that he needed to foster relationships with his children when he believed the only relationship that needed to exist there was a dictatorial one. Christopher Plummer's progression to rigid authoritarian to affectionate music-playing dad was incredibly well-acted. I would recommend this film, really, to anyone. Even if you aren't a fan of love stories or musicals, I believe, you will enjoy this film. The message of the film is one that persists, and can resonate with any viewer; \"You have to live the life you were born to live.\"."

It's hard to know where to start when a film simply has so many great elements to it. These are some of the best musical songs ever written, some of my favorites being \"My Favorite Things\" and the one in which she teaches the children how to sing. The musical is based on the touching and amazing true story that has managed to inspire so many. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast (being one of my favorite actresses) and was robbed not to receive an Oscar for this role, in addition to the one she earned the previous year for \"Mary Poppins.\" Christopher Plummer is also an excellent choice as the tough military father in the film. I love the tiny humorous moments, such as Plummer seeing his children in the tree or all the children falling out of the boat after seeing their father. Excellent from beginning to end. For me, it's between this and \"Singin' in the Rain\" for the all-time greatest movie musical, and it's truly impossible for me to make that call. If you have never seen this, you've missed a real treat. It is a must-see for fans of musicals and movies alike. Perfect.\n\n**** out of ****"

Here acting is par excellence. Her comic timings are great.\n\n2) The supporting actress too has done a great job. Her emotions are juggled well.\n\n3) The music: Too good. Even Opera music is delightful to hear. I adored the title song ' The sound of the Music'. Even other songs were great. Some were slow but the combination of fast paced happy and slow songs didn't lower the movie's spirits.\n\n4) No vulgarity. Even the kissing scenes were marred in the dark.\n\n5) The movie is lovable and heart warming. Can be seen many times.\n\n6) One of the few classics that doesn't have the actor and the actress talking about love and crying all the time.\n\nThe bad, though there are only two points: 1) The main actor wasn't really good. He looked comical rather than stern and he seemed a bit fake in acting.\n\n2) Though the movie was great, I wish that it was a bit shorter. Even cutting about ten to fifteen minutes would have improved it greatly.\n\nWhatever cons might be, it still is a great movie to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since I was a kid, I saw \"The Sound of Music\" and considered as the best musical and one of my favorite movies. Now as a young adult, it still remains as one of my favorites. First of all, it has Julia Andrews's best performance. I enjoyed her role as Mary Poppins, but she flourishes and illuminates the screen as Maria, the cheerful, witty, and funny want-to-be nun. She brings to life some of the most memorable songs that drown out all others such as: \"Do-Rei-Mei\" and \"The Sound of Music.\" Second, the magnificent score of Irwin Kostal adds to beauty of the music. It uplifts my soul to levels that hardly any other music can surpass. Third, the wonderful shots of the landscape (on location) add to the authenticity to the film's story that not even Terrence Malick could dream up. Fourth, the supporting casts (particularly the seven children) make believable performances. Even the serious Christopher Plummer shines a new light on his character as the widower Captain.\n\nFifth, the story itself makes a great film. It's not elongated or filled with plot holes, but unique with many individual subplots at hand such as the romances between Liesl and Ralph, and later Maria and The Captain. Sixth, for a movie in the 1960s covering events in the 1930s such as: the lighting, sets, art direction, and costume designs make it all feel real.\n\nThere are some people that I know says this movie is too \"sugar-coated\" or even unrealistic to the time period. That's a load of manure. This is the perfect feel-good musical ever made. There's only six other musicals that I have seen that I consider grand, but this beats them all. 10/10 If you have not seen this movie, even if you don't like musicals, you're missing a whole lot!"

Its powerful and compelling from beginning to end. The best thing about this movie is of course the songs; they have so much meaning and are perfect to the atmosphere in the movie at the time they are heard. The highlight is no doubt when Mother Superior sings 'Climb Every Mountain'. There is so much poignancy involved in that song that you begin to cry, laugh and just be stunned by the song at the same time. The only low point of this movie comes from Christopher Plummer's acting and especially his singing which lacks the quality of the other singers in the movie. If anyone's ever told you that this is an amazing movie, they couldn't be more right about it. Be prepared to experience many emotions in one movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Sound of Music\" (1965), this movie is quite simply a musical masterpiece. It's one of my top 10 all-time favorite musical films, and also one of my top 10 all-time favorite family films! This film is based off a memoir written by Maria von Trapp, who also happens to be a main character in this movie. She wrote a memoir back in 1949, and it was eventually adapted into a stage play. After over 1,000 performances of the play, it was set to be adapted into a feature film. Usually, taking a stage play and transferring it onto the big screen is hit or miss. However, this movie does the original play justice, and then some. In fact, it's even better than the stage play! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, great special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. At first glance, the story may seem simple. But, the way that it's executed makes it so much more than your traditional family and love story. It keeps you hooked from beginning to end, yes, a nearly three hour film that truly keeps you interested all the way through, that's incredible. This movie goes by in a flash. If a long film goes by really fast, then you know it's good! The acting is fantastic from all the actors and actresses. But, the ones that steal the show are Julie Andrews as Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp. As always, Julie Andrews is such a joy to watch in any movie she's in. This film is no exception to that! Christopher Plummer always gives it his all in any movie or show he's in, and he takes the role of Captain von Trapp to a whole new level. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all put on outstanding performances and truly bring this movie to life! All of the sets/locations are spectacular, especially the scenes in the Alps. It really gives the movie a breathtaking atmosphere and really sets the tone perfectly! All of the special effects are extremely well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack of this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. What can I say that hasn't been said before? Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein III wrote the original music and lyrics for the stage play, and movie. All I have to say is, they have given us some of the most iconic songs in any musical! \"The Sound of Music\" is a cinematic achievement, and always will be. Is it my favorite musical? No, there are a few that I personally like better. But, I can assure you all, that it's definitely on my top 10 all-time favorite musical and family films list! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"The Sound of Music\", go see it today. I guarantee you will love it! If you have children, be sure to show them this movie. You'll be glad you did, and they'll be happy too. But, this movie can be always be enjoyed by people of all ages. This film will definitely bring you to life, with the sound of music!"

She is rather mischievous and playful. The sisters at the convent get tired of her childish behavior and send her as a governess to the children of an ex-naval officer. The children are very naughty and they keep on playing pranks on everyone. Their father is a very strict person and likes the children to be disciplined. He is does not like light and playful behavior with the children. So the children become adamant and rebellious. Maria interacts with children as their friend. she plays with them , teaches them new things like music and dancing. she helps them with their problems and even covers up their mistakes from their father. She then brings them close to him for which he is grateful to her. This results in a bond between them. and during the war they flee together."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was a time when saying you had enjoyed \"The Sound of Music\" was considered un-hip. It is still considered corny by many, but at least, compared to the stage version, it is a masterpiece. I finally saw a theater production, and could not believe how poor the text by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay is. Ernest Lehman really did a genial screen adaptation, eliminating songs (can you imagine Baroness Elsa singing about a marriage proposal?), relocating \"My Favorite Things\" to the storm scene, turning \"The Lonely Goatherd\" into a puppet show, or taking \"Do Re Mi\" out to the Alps and the streets of Salzburg. Not much was added concerning the social and political aspects of Austria during the years of the Nazi regime (which probably would have given a greater resonance to this tale of personal struggle against totalitarianism), and very little was taken from the real Georg von Trapp, a ruined aristocrat, or Maria, who was the real stern, rigid parent that turned the family into a musical act for survival. Nevertheless, other aspects of the production augmented its entertainment value. After making the horror classic \"The Haunting\", director Robert Wise surpassed his talent for transferring musicals to film, making the Rodgers & Hammerstein play less stage-bound than his work on \"West Side Story\". Both are industrial films, done under Hollywood's zero-degree style of film-making, but Wise did give a fresh visual treatment to the musical, airing an old property, and guiding Julie Andrews to give the best performance of her career. Finally, what I find more interesting about \"The Sound of Music\" is its sociological value. When it was released, it had a sedative effect on the hearts and minds of almost the entire world population, who was witnessing new cracks in the U.S. empire: the questionable presence of American troops in Vietnam with a generation of young Americans killed for expansionism and not democracy, the violent deaths of major figures of its political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the raise of violence and death on the streets... Solidarity, love, basic family values, and especially music, were sort of rediscovered in \"The Sound of Music\", turning it into a mega hit, and its soundtrack into a best seller."

It was very similar to theater choreography: lively, unshamefully exaggerated, and graceful.\n\nHands down: this is a can't miss classic."

Both films obviously have much in common.\n\nBoth are from the mid '60s. Both are musicals. Both are about a nanny. The nanny is in both cases played by Julie Andrews.\n\nThere are however also differences.\n\nThe father has no time for his children in \"Marry Poppins\" and perhaps too much time in \"The sound of music\". The nanny is shy (at least initially) in \"The sound of music\" and self-conscious in \"Mary Poppins\". \"The sound of music\" is more about songs and \"Mary Poppins\" is more about dance / choreography. \"The sound of music\" has a political context whereas \"Mary Poppins\" is Disney amusement.\n\nBoth films are good in their own way."

        "review_detailed_main": "The cinematography, set design, costumes , choreography, vocal performances are almost perfection! Critics said that Christopher Plummer's \"Capt. Von Trapp\" was a weak performance, but he was given a very difficult character role to portray, from a heartsick, callus, widower to a loving father in a short period of time. As history, it is very poor indeed. He actually was a very good father who loved his children dearly. The major events (marriage, romance, escape) are out-of-order and highly fictionalized. However, they did perform in several wartime-concerts and won awards. Also, the Captain was \"drafted\" for Hitler's submarine fleet. All the children's real names were different. Alas, the true events would not have made an enjoyable musical. Postulate Maria was originally given the task to tutor one child recovering from the scarlet fever, that killed her mother. The character \"Max\" did not exist. Instead, there was a musically-talented Catholic Priest that came with them. Then, a U.S. talent agency almost drove them into bankruptcy. I do agree with one thing that the critics \"said\": the portrayal of The Nazis was far too nice. No distributor caps were removed by the nuns at the Abby. All that was \"made up\". The Von Trapp family just took the train (that passed behind their house) to Italy and never hiked up the Swiss Alps, which were nowhere near them. Eventually, they took a steamship to America. The musical score is also a vast improvement with the deletion of two terrible songs from the Broadway version, and the addition of 2 wonderful new songs entirely written by Rogers for the movie: \"I Have Confidence\" and \"Something Good\". It may be the most successfully-produced musical of all time, with numerous audio, visual, TV, film and Broadway versions and revivals internationally! If you can ever see this on a big screen, the Oscar-winning cinematography is breathtaking.\n\nIf you are curious about the true story, Look for \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\" by Maria Augusta Trapp, (Doubleday & Co. 1949) if it is still available."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of my favourite things for sure. The Sound of Music has an excellent cast of annoying and funny children - as kids would be at that age - all 7 of them. I love Julie Andrews in this one, not only for her singing but also for her portrayal of the motherly Maria Von Trapp.\n\nOf course this is a timeless classic which all homes should have.. especially if you have kids. I remember my mum sitting me down in front of it when I was 3. I've watched it so many times I can write the script.\n\nThe narrative is quite simple but the film's cast, the music, and the scenery of Salzburg make it extra special, albeit the backdrop of the movie is the Anchlus before (and soon after) the Nazis take over Austria. There is something in it for all the family - fun, music, romance and even a little villainry.\n\nA slight warning though, if you're not in the mood for sugary sweet lovey dovey stuff with music on top - don't bother with this one.\n\nAlso, the movie is only loosely based on the Maria Von Trapp story - besides the name of the Captain, Maria and some of the places, all others are fictional - characters like Uncle Max and Baroness Shroeder didn't exist in real life. To have a clearer picture of how the Von Trapps lived their lives through this period, read Maria's (not Julie Andrews') book."

You have to be made of granite not to want everything to work out for Maria and the Von Trapp family.\n\nMusical fans should love the songs which are performed wonderfully, particularly by Andrews. Not being a fan of musicals I can take or leave all but the very best and most cinematic numbers in this one.\n\nCinematic moments are something it has in abundance from start to finish. All shots a beautifully composed, making the most of the stunning Austrian landscape and conveying the plot visually. I love the interior shots as much as the landscapes as there are many spectacular sequences framed to perfection in a variety of indoor settings. It is strongly edited to maximise the impact of the music and contains some lovely scene transitions.\n\nMost performances are excellent with Christopher Plummer surprisingly good as a romantic lead in a musical. The children are not particularly strong actors but entertain nonetheless. Other supporting performances are all spot on for what is required aside from Daniel Truhitte who is a good song and dance performer but for me plays a pretty uninspiring Rolfe.\n\nAs for Julie Andrews, she quite simply blows everyone else off the screen with her acting, singing, comic timing and general charisma.\n\nI felt the length of the movie and started to lose interest towards the end during an additional piece of story that felt contrived to add some additional peril for the characters. For me it is a 8.5/10 but I always round upwards."

        "review_detailed_main": "After \"Cleopatra\" with Liz and Dicky Boy hit the movie theaters, the film almost drove 20th Century Fox into Bankruptcy and even their law suits against one another just added fuel to the bankruptcy fiasco of all time. So, in the meantime, while figuring out what to do to save Fox, Walt Disney had seen Julie Andrews in the stage version of \"Camelot\" on Broadway and decided that she was his \"Mary Poppins\" and the rest is movie history. Back at Fox, looking through their unfilmed scripts they came across \"The sound of Music\"; so, William Wyler, the original director who was casting the film, asked Julie Andrews to play Maria Von Trapp, and she said, \"Of course! But what can you do with a Nun, a Captain, 7 children, and a bunch of Nuns?\" So, Wyler cast the film, but he preferred to do something else, and Robert Wise took over. Wyler stated that he knew that the film would be a hit, but he didn't think that it would be THAT big a hit! In the meantime, at the Acamady Awards, Julie Anderews, the original Eliza Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady\" wins the Oscar for best actress in Mary Popp;ins, and Rex Harrision, the original 'Enry 'Iggins, wins an Oscar for \"My Fair Lady\", and Audrey Hepburn is overlooked for her excellent performance with too many excuses for why she didn't win! So, what made \"The Sound of Music\" such a hit? Good question! Not an easy answer! All the critics hated it; said it wouldn't last, but something happened, and not only did it last but became one of the great money makers of all time to the point that it played in reserved seat first run theaters for at least 3 years, and no movie had done that up to that time, but I think I have the answer: It was just right timing. There was a lot of violence on the movie screen, no musicals, no good-feel movies to leave the theater with your toes tapping with a song in your heart! Today, it would have probably flopped on its nose! So, when Julie Andrews won the Oscar for \"Mary Poppins\" she stated, \"I've heard that you Americans are known for your hospitality, but this is ridiculous!\" Next year when she was nominated for \"Soound of Music\", the rumor is that the Acadamy was told not to vote for her because it was unheard of for an actress to win the years in running for a musical! So, be the powers of Hollywood in those days! And in case you aren't aware of this, Marni Nixon, who dubbed singing for Deborah Kerr in \"An Affair To Remember\" and \"The King and I\", and who also dubbed partial-singing for Audrey Hepburn in \"My Fair Lady\" can, for once, not only be heard, but can be seen as well singing for herself as Sister Sophia as one of the Nuns in the number \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?\" So, the cash flow saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy; but it took many years for the movie public to get over that their virginal Julie Andrews was human beings, and it too many years for Jack Warner to wipe the egg off his face for making such a boo-boo about the possibility of becoming a movie star, and Julie Anderews never, but never, worked on a film for Jack Warner! But, many have made the same mistake. There were those who said that Liza Minelli would never make it in the big-time because she was the daughter of Judy Garland! Boy! Did those know-it-alls, like Jack Warner, eat crow for many years to come!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is by far my favorite movie of all times. I'm a sucker for all Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals, and this one is the best one of all. Perhaps because I was 8 years old when it came out in 1965. My uncle played viola for musicals and I saw it before, but I always loved this movie especially. Boy, did I have a crush on Julie Andrews! Then there's the fact that I come from a musical family, so the film's theme of music overcoming Nazi Germany was a very moving point.\n\nThis is a children's, or \"family\" movie. I am a believer that children need music education and a respect for traditional European music culture. There are many factors that work against children receiving such cultural exposure today: elimination of traditional music education in public schools, the synthesizer revolution taking over the music world causing kids to mess with danceable synth drum tracks instead of learning an orchestral instrument (which is more difficult), emergence of non-European cultures in America creating a resentment toward white-based traditional music education, Modern (atonal) artistic music asserting itself causing more resentment of traditional (usually Romantic based) European music education, the constant emergence of new styles of popular and artistic music causing less & less room for traditional music to hold its ground, etc. etc.\n\nI believe that this is a shame because there is a certain subtle appreciation for music that is instilled in people who are allowed exposure to Romantic Classical music. Of course, classic Broadway music owes much to such Romantic music. Nowhere is this more evident than in this film, which theme essentially asserts the importance of European classical music for children's education, and does so in a manner that makes such music education FUN! Julie Andrews style. Indeed, traditional music education techniques were being challenged at the time of the making of this musical (the emergence of 50s rock & roll). This appears to have been R & H's nostalgic statement for the cause of retaining the old musical values by way of revealing just how fun learning Solfege (Do-re-mi etc.) can be! That is, if you have a really cool governess to play games with in the gardens while you learn the tunes.\n\nGod! I wish I could go back to those days!\n\nRead it & weep, baby."

The Sound Of Music has a simple and happy story without much of intense conflicts but then it meets Wonderful cast, great direction and enchanting Music. There are quite few things to notice in the script as i have done for myself, First i love the simplicity of the Basic script which has so many levels and gateways and the musical journey in the film keep unfolding each and every one of them. The first meeting of Maria with Nuns, then her meeting with the childrens, then Maria and Childrens bond, then a love story, then a turnaround seperation for a while, then her return to find her life and finally the escape from Nazis with Musical End. It fits so perfectly in there. Even the character of Baroness is so cleverly written, it doesn't go Villainous way. Rather she has a sense of true love and not to be a fake one when Captain reveals her about being not loyal to her she clearly accepts it and that scene is so sensible. All characters in the film have thier own identification, whether it is wild, nasty Maria or disciplined but kind Captain or each one from those seven childrens. Maybe the characterisation is something that makes this simple story so connectable. The Sound Of Music broke the long standing box office record of Gone With The Wind and currently it is the 3rd most watched film in Hollywood ever, it doesn't matter now if i even try to point out some minuses because some films are made to make audience happy, not to mess up their minds. The Sound Of Music has a legacy that needs to be cherished forever. Thank you Robert Wise for giving this full of joy, full of music and full of colours life lesson. Rating- 8/10*"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is probably one of the most iconic musical films of all time. It is not just a film, it is a reference for those who like cinema, it is a cultural landmark of indisputable value, which has been copied, parodied, praised, admired, satirized, repeated and remastigated over and over again in the cinema, in the theater, on TV, in advertising, in literature, on the radio ... It is the film that forever immortalized Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, two actors who made great cinematographic careers afterwards. The impact of this film on culture and cinematographic art is immense and difficult to calculate. It has become a huge box office and critical success, and is still regularly shown on TV, especially around Easter.\n\nThe story of the film, based on real events and a family that exists in real life, couldn't be sweeter and is known to most people, so I think it is very difficult to spoil here: a young novice is sent to a mansion in an Austrian aristocrat, a former naval officer from the First World War, as the tutor of his seven children. The cheerful and understanding way she presents conquers the little ones and ends up, in time, also conquering the rigid military, for whom discipline was fundamental. All of this happens, however, in the late Thirties, with Austria on the verge of annexation by the Third Reich. Captain Von Trapp's exacerbated nationalism will eventually conflict with the new order of things and motivate the family to flee.\n\nThe film is dominated by Julie Andrews. She is great in every way and does everything in an almost perfect way. Not to mention he has a beautiful voice and sings very well. Children are equally good and do everything very well, especially Charmian Carr and Kym Karath. Plummer is impeccable and makes an excellent pair with Andrews. Good dialogues help. In the secondary cast, I would highlight the good performance of Peggy Wood and Richard Haydn.\n\nAt a technical level, the excellent choice of filming locations, all or almost all in the Salzburg region in Austria, stands out. It doesn't matter the reality here. The film did not seek to be a documentary about the real Trapp family and therefore did not want to go to the real places where everything happened, but wanted to tell a story with glamor, with sweetness, based on their lives. And the film uses very beautiful and charming places to acquire great visual beauty. But even more interesting are the songs in the film. Almost all of them are worthy of memory and can be heard very easily, but I would especially highlight the title song \"Sound of Music\", as well as \"So Long, Farewell\", \"How to Solve a Problem like Maria\", \"Edelweiss\" and \"Sixteen going on Seventeen\". They are incredible.\n\nNominated for ten Oscars, he won five statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Edition and Best Adapted Soundtrack), but the best award will certainly be the status of cultural icon that he has acquired over time."

The initial sceneries are enthralling and create more interest for the movie. The roles were enacted superbly. Have seen it multiple times and enjoy it vividly every time i c it again. The music touches your heart and the lyrics are written very well. The direction and the locations are perfect. The characters apt.A simple movie which does not involve any thinking and can be enjoyed with complete relaxation. One of the Best dramas made. It has all the mixture in it and never in the movie is there a scene kept for the sake of keeping it, everything is just perfect.This is a masterpiece which gives boost to the movies of this kind. The new generation prefers thrillers actions and horrors and simply think these kind of movies to be slow and boring, but this one really contradicts them and is one movie where time passes by... The movie has a little bit of austrian patriotism and the climax dedicated to it.Overall an excellent movie to enjoy with family and a good movie to enjoy in lonely times :)"

Smackdown, Fight Club, and NBKillers, but I have to admit I really like this movie. Perhaps it's because I am a nutcase and this movie is a secure, innocent movie or something.\n\nWatching all the happy children sing and dance will make want to chase them down with a battle axe and slaughter them but it does give that epic, movie of the time, classic feel to it like the Titanic.\n\nI didn't much like the ending though, it reminds me of The Lord of the Rings ending which sucked too. Anyhow, a 10/10."

That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended, 9/10!"

In fact, I would be willing to say that this is Christopher Plummer's best performance, and I liked Julie Andrews more here than in Mary Poppins or 10, which are the only other movies I've seen her in. I recommend this movie to just about everyone, especially gay Austrians."

        "review_detailed_main": "I vividly remember going to the mall with my dad when I was about 7, shopping for my mom's birthday present. When my dad came across the 25th-anniversary edition video of The Sound of Music, he knew it was the perfect gift. I was less sure, until she opened the present and was incredibly stunned and happy. However, it didn't get watched until about two years later, when I was 10 and wanted to watch a movie one night. Mom suggested Sound of Music, and she began singing along with Julie Andrews right off the bat. Her friend came over that night, took one look at the screen, and burst into \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\", which was playing at the moment. Right then, I knew I was watching something unique, something wonderful. By the end of the movie, I knew I was right.\n\nI've now seen The Sound of Music over 35 times and know it ver batum, dialogue and lyrics. This movie is the ultimate feel-good film-a delightful story that provides a great escape from the drudgery of real life. The love story is so very sweet, and you're hard-pressed to find a scene that is more heart-warming than the dance Maria shares with the Captain. Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic, so I tend to like things like this anyway, but this film is different. It deals with romance, yes, but also the love of siblings and parents, the love for one's country, and the love of God all at once. I recommend it extremely highly for anyone, anytime."

I thought the food in this scene looked absolutely delicious. It took me a while to figure out but after looking and looking I realized that the food in my favorite dinner scene is actually just mashed potatoes with stuffed ham rolls and lettuce with dishes of croissants on the table and glasses of water. It still looks very tasty. Overall this is an excellent movie to stay at home any night alone or with others and watch. It is extremely entertaining and the songs are really great."

She plays the roles so well that I almost forget it's Julie Andrews playing a character, because she is such a skilled actress. Christopher Plumber is also great. My favorite song from the movie is probably Something Good, but I also really like Edelweiss. I'll continue to watch Sound of Music until I die."

I don't want to spoil ANYTHING, but the time setting is during WWII with Nazism. There is a little suspense, but it's mostly a love/musical story. If you classical catchy tunes, this is the movie to watch. I for one love watching this movie and I still watch it."

This film also recalls a time when it was made quite clear that if you didn't stand for something, that you may be in mortal danger of falling for anything, i.e. Hitler's insanity.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Sound of Music had such a powerful impact on people because it was a film of such great beauty--the beauty of innocence and wholesomeness (the latter perhaps a bit overdone), of the Austrian Alps and Salzburg, of wonderful music, of the Catholic Church from the best light, of idealization of family and children, and of incorruptibility, which it seems we need more of these days.\n\nThe screenplay is imaginative, well-executed and well-paced, set in a broad, elaborate scenic backdrop combined with the elegance of more immediate surroundings (and I had the great pleasure of visiting Salzburg and the mansion when I was nine years old, after having seen the movie three times already). So wonderful was the cinematography!! Oh, well, Dr. Zhivago won it that year. The acting is also excellent, fittingly led by Julie Andrews as Fraulein Maria, and Christopher Plummer as the stern but virtuous captain who she lightens up and marries. The Baroness (Eleanor Parker) is Maria's rival for the captain's affections, while the Captain is foiled by \"Uncle Max\" (Richard Haydn), who wants to get along with everyone, even the Nazis, and antagonist Herr Zeller (Ben Wright).\n\nCertainly, The Sound of Music far outdoes Maria's book, which was often quite boring. And hey, if the Captain's sturdiness of character is overdone in the film, it's also true he was the only one in the area without a swastika on his home. The music, catchy and lively, left a lasting imprint (and isn't Edelweiss ever so pretty). My Favorite Things even moves on to John Coltrane, and The Doors in Light My Fire. If you have not seen The Sound of Music, do so by all means. Aside from the film's being so uplifting, I suspect you'll agree with me that it demonstrates cinematographers should be capable of producing more than today's cheap special effects."

Movies are truly not made like this anymore! I first saw this movie in 1990 when it was re-released on video for the 25th anniversary. I was 6 years old and I immediately fell in love with it when my parents bought it. My favorite character was Marta, the second youngest, because I looked exactly like her as a child. Plus she was my age! My favorites of the children were Marta, Gretl, Liesl, and Brigitta. My favorite scenes are 16 going on 17, Do-Re-Mi, when the Captain finds the children singing to the Baroness, Liesl and the Captain singing Edelweiss, The party for the Baroness, singing at the festival, hiding in the abbey, and finally climbing over the mountain to freedom. Christopher Plummer does a fantastic job of playing the Captain. He is handsome and very charismatic. Julie Andrews, of course, was the star of the movie and also was fantastic...but we already knew that! I think that Eleanor Parker's acting as Baroness Elsa Schraeder was underrated. She played her character perfectly. I actually liked her character, although she was called the \"villianess.\" Richard Haydn was very good as Uncle Max, he made me laugh. I only wish that Charmian Carr, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath had done more acting as they got older. With the exception of Angela, the other three stopped acting to raise a family.\n\nThis is one of the greatest family films ever made! 10/10"

In the end, both films won 5 Academy Awards but Robert Wise's family oriented songfest THE SOUND OF MUSIC triumphed over David Lean's somber Russian epic DOCTOR ZHIVAGO to pick up the top picture prize. The odds makers in Hollywood had predicted a certain win for MUSIC , and it did seem that the Hollywood establishment preferred the joyous strains of Maria Von Trapp's guitar to Yuri Zhivago's plaintive balalaika. There were some disgruntled movie fans who felt that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical was an awfully lightweight choice for such a prestigious honor. Surely ZHIVAGO had more dramatic heft (granted the Trapp family had to deal with the Nazis but the song and dance element diminished the reality quotient). The only other serious contender for the year's best was John Schlesinger's contemporary British comedy of manners DARLING starring the stunning (Best Actress) Julie Christie as an amoral model living among the jet set. The less popular SHIP OF FOOLS ( a rather ugly soap opera aboard a cruise liner ) and A THOUSAND CLOWNS ( a cute, at times acerbic little comedy) were pretty much \"also-rans\" from the start. With the passage of nearly 40 years the reputations of both 1965's big Oscar winners have grown in stature. ZHIVAGO is the model of panoramic, epic storytelling ; as for THE SOUND OF MUSIC , it is by far the most technically proficient of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein film adaptations.\n\nVeteran director Robert Wise is the genius behind the movie's success. Although the sticky sentimentality of the original Broadway show remains intact, Wise, along with his topflight crew of film technicians ( cinematographer Ted McCord, production designer Boris Levin and film editor William Reynolds ) truly make this a motion picture experience. The story of a rebellious novice who takes a temporary leave from convent life to care for the seven \"incorrigible\" children of a stern widower and army captain was perilously close to being a dusty museum piece on the stage.\n\nWise and company changed all that by making a movie that really moved, from the stunning overhead shots of the Austrian alps, lakes and countryside to the thrilling introduction of Maria as the TODD-AO camera in all its glory swoops down to meet the outstretched arms of the glorious Julie Andrews as she begins her unforgettable rendition of the title song . No other score of Rodgers and Hammerstein had the care and attention lavished on it as this one did. Irwin Kostal's orchestrations are sublime, perhaps the most beautiful ever heard in a movie musical ; it's one of those rare instances where the motion picture soundtrack outshines the original Broadway Cast album. THE SOUND OF MUSIC will always have its detractors. The plot creaks and the dialog doesn't run very deep. It's not MY FAIR LADY. But it is the work of a major film craftsman at the height of his powers , giving the audience a larger -than-life experience. They don't make them like this anymore. THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an enduring entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first movie I ever saw in the theatre, the year was 1967.\n\nUpon reviewing it the first time it was shown on TV, I have to say this is a movie that must be viewed on the big screen, for TV greatly diminishes the effect.\n\nI remember it from a child's point of view, but this is largely a film about children for children by the child-at-heart. The plot is religious, the songs uplifting to heaven, the scenery heaven on earth. Robert Wise, the screenwriters, Rogers and Hammerstein, all the performers \u0096 all geniuses.\n\nThen \u0096 political reality. The pristine Salzburg is besieged by the most compelling evil humanity has ever spawned.\n\nThe obvious critiques of \"The Sound of Music\" are its unwavering sentiment, and many viewers are repelled by its depiction of wealth, happiness and saccharin love. Any hardened adult should recall the basic message of this movie: You Find the Beauty in Life and Yourself and Those Around You.\n\nCheers: It's a Musical. Some of the greatest songs ever committed to the stage. Wonderful ensemble cast. Exquisitely set and filmed. The best family movie ever made. The finest movie ever filmed.\n\nCaveats: Long. Religious. Sentimental, to the point of repulsion in a few of us ( not me ).\n\nRating: A Solid, Well Deserved Ten Stars."

However when I find that footman at the embassy ball to call each one of the guest's name such as \"Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering. Professor Higgins\" is \"Herr Zeller\",I am shocked. And the Hungarian \"Karpathy\" is Theodore Bikel, who acts Captain von Trapp at the stage in 1959 or so. This make me feel........ Well, His figure is quite different from Christopher Plummer and when i hear his actually singing Edelweiss in CD i am nearly dizzy. Of course Mr Plummer's was dubbed and I am quite used to Bill Lee's. I don't know whether Mr Plummer's real voice is better than Bill Lee, but actually I don't like Theodore Bikel's singing, and, his flat figure."

        "review_detailed_main": "This famous film is about a failing nun who has to become a governess. Why? Because one of the nuns thinks it will help her do something important rather than failing to be a nun. Anyway, Maria (the failing nun) goes to a very wealthy captain to look after his seven children. Maria finds that they have been bossed around by their father since their mother's death. Can Maria find a way to let them play and be free?\n\nWhy do I love this film so much? Read the following reasons.\n\nReason 1: I love all the children. They are misbehaving, though underneath they have their own lovely characters. Gretl is my favourite! Reason 2: The Austrian scenery is spectacular, especially the first two to five minutes at the beginning. The scenery on the hill and just before Do Re Mi is good as well! Reason 3: Julie Andrews is SO good as Maria, better than as Mary Poppins in my opinion anyway. Christopher Plummer is good too, although I can't really compare him because this is the only film I've seen him in. The actors and actresses who did the children were really good as well. Reason 4: The songs! The songs! SOME PEOPLE ON IMDb GIVE BAD COMMENTS ON THE SONGS! I adore them, come on other people, please give them more credit. \"Do Re Mi\", \"How do you solve a problem like Maria\", \"The Sound Of Music\", \"Edelweiss (I think that's how you spell it)\", love them all please! Reason 5: The plot is lovely throughout the film until it comes to the end.\n\nThere are many more reasons than these which I can't remember. So, what are you waiting for? Those who haven't, PLEASE WATCH THIS DARLING MOTION PICTURE! Advertised by ME. :) ;) :()"

The Sound Of Music is a delightful movie for all ages. Everyone in the family of today could relate to the characters in the film even though this movie was made almost 4 decades ago.\n\nI couldn't think of a better artist to play Maria than Julie Andrews. Her voice is ever so captivating and her acting is excellent. She's perfect for the role and she gives a performance of a lifetime.\n\nThe whole cast is amazing, especially Captain Von Trapp (played by Christopher Plummer) and all the adorable 7 children.\n\nIt's amazing how this movie can touch you. It's one of those movies that you just can't get enough if you loved it the first time you saw it, undoubtedly you'll watch it over and over again! It deserves every award it got especially being the Best Picture in the Oscars during its time, or even more. This movie/musical will remain one of the few best classics ever. And everyone in the world should see it!"

The cast is all so attractive and perfectly chosen. The movie keeps moving...there are no dull or slow spots. It seems Julie Andrews worked well with children because she was so good in both Mary Poppins and Sound of Music.

As a family, they must struggle to escape, as Capt. Von Trapp has been ordered to join the third reich.\n\nWhile the story is loosely based on the true story of the von Trapp family, what I enjoy most of this is the musical numbers. I find some of the actual artistic license to be a bit corny, but it is a musical, so just sit back and enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is so perfectly made, that most of its critics point to its \"sweet\" story, as a problem. That, of course, is a matter of taste. The film itself, is flawless. Every aspect of the Broadway show has been improved upon for the film version. Julie Andrews, who was was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and should have won, is more than the foundation for the film's perfection. She is simply without peer. There isn't anyone who could have played the role better. Her performance is so overwhelming, that during its initial theatrical run, she became an international obsession. Of course, the film doesn't end with Julie. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, orchestrations, scenic design and the entire cast, are excellent. This film was meant to be seen in a theater, on a super wide screen (that most cities don't even have anymore). As it is, on home video, you must see it in its widescreen (letterbox) version. The current DVD edition is about as good as you can hope to see it. A 40th Anniversary Edition DVD is soon to be released. Avoid the sing-a-long theatrical version, at all costs! When it's said that \"they don't make 'em like that anymore\", they're talking about \"The Sound of Music\". It is perhaps the best film ever made!"

I'm 14 and I never thought that I could like older movies such as this one. Well, I thought wrong! I adore this movie!!\n\nAnyway...the whole movie is beautiful. The places, the actors, the songs, etc. It's one of those good romance movies. Actually, it's the way a romance movie should be. In movies today, they show two people who are obviously interested in each other, then the next morning they're in bed together. That's horrible!! But in the Sound of Music, you can watch the love slowly unfold. You'd never really know it until a little later in the movie, but it gets obvious after a while.\n\nI was lucky enough to go on the Sound of Music tour in Austria when I went on vacation in Germany. It was a 4 hour tour, but well worth my time. Although at the time I hated it and wanted nothing to do with it. I actually have my picture in front of the pavilion type thing where Liesl and Rolfe sang \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" and where the Captain and Maria sing \"Something Good\". =]\n\nI highly recommend this movie to every single age group out there! Such a good musical and it's even got a little humor. So if you like romance, music, and comedy, then you're gonna love this movie!\n\nAnd let me tell you a little secret...if you're emotional ((like me)) and you get into this movie enough, you just might cry at the end.

Julie Andrews is a phenomenal actress and wonderfully portrays the character of Maria Von Trapp. Her performance moves your soul, and touches your heart like no other actress. The story is unforgettable, as are the wonderful songs such as Do Re Mi, Maria, and Climb Every Mountain. Although the movie is 3 hours long, it gets your attention at the beginning, and keeps you involved until the spectacular ending.\n\nI highly recommend that you watch this movie. If you love musicals, then I guarantee you will adore this film. And if you don't like musicals, overlook the songs, and pay attention to the story. You won't be disappointed."

Good romance movie for general ages.\n\nYou can learn a lot from this movie. I love the twist on the story, I'm sure you gonna love it too. It a kind of movie to watch over and over again, where no time can make it obsolete. It's like a classical song that has no season, where you can play anytime and anywhere.\n\nAs you watch the movie, it is not just about romance, or about music, or about running a big family, but somehow you will see how a well known family can be displaced from a war. The point is there are lots of aspect for your point of view.\n\nHighly Recommended to watch! I think A must have DVD copy."

It's just a wonderful escapist film with no offensive language, no violence and no prejudice. It is a light hearted and lovely film set in beautiful surroundings with songs to fill your heart. People berate it everywhere and that is because they have not bothered to watch it and understand it. It's not realistic in the sense that people don't burst into song in the streets no, but it is quite lovely to watch with your family.It is no coincidence that this film has transcended all generations and boundaries and will never die. Long may it go on and my daughter already loves it too :-)I would urge all families to show it to their children. You can take from it whatever you wish. those who berate it are usually the ones who would rather watch Terminator or get pleasure from watching people having their heads mashed to a pulp by a tattooed Neanderthal in a string vest..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am an unabashed fan of the movie musical. I have all the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rodgers films; Three Penny Opera; Cabaret; anything by Rodgers & Hammerstein, Jerome Kern & Hammerstein. And yet this is by far the worst movie musical of all time.\n\nWe all like a happy ending, and this gives a happy ending to \"The rape of Europe\" by the Nazi maw. For six million, there was no happy ending; for each of those six million evil triumphed.\n\nNever mind that there is nothing but the slimmest connection to the real incidents of the von Trapp family escape from Europe--in reality stroll across the border into Italy.\n\nThe Nazi maw ends up being a minuscule backdrop to the von Trapp saga; it is not really integral to the story line as it is in 'Cabaret.' So the songs are really love songs between Maria and the children and Maria and the Captain. And love songs, as insults, to the audience.\n\nFor all the adulation Rodgers & Hammerstein receive, there is something troubling about their saccharine songs oftentimes hiding a dark and portentous event. 'Carousal' about a new father being irresponsible and getting himself killed. And this musical pours on the saccharine and in that singularity, they produce a musical that trivializes the Nazi maw.\n\nIt's very catchy tunes seemingly mocking the audience in a fifth column kind of way--to sabotage our understanding, our grasp, of the horrors of the Nazi maw. Horrors hinted at by 1938 and realized as the war progressed. When we see the movie, we are more than educated in the implications of Nazism and what it did to Europe; none come to this movie uniformed; and yet the movie seems to mock the audience's knowledge with their songs.\n\nAnd yet, I gave the move a ten, and would want others to see it--for precisely what it is. A love story, with soul stirring music, in defiance of the horrors of the Nazi maw."

        "review_detailed_main": "Today, the seventh of February, my teacher, Mrs. Jackson, played two scenes out of The Sound Of Music - \"The Sound Of Music\" (musical number) and \"Do-Re-Mi\" - for our new unit, \"Beyond The Notes\". She played these two scenes because they really have to do with \"Beyond The Notes\".\n\n\"The Sound Of Music\" is definitely on my op ten all-time favorite movies, like Mrs. Jackson. It's right in-between Harry Potter and TOOTP and HSMII (which are seven and nine). The Sound Of Music is a wonderful drama about Count Van Trapp and his seven children. One day, a nun named Maria comes into their lives and teaches them about scales, notes, and in general, music. Then suddenly Count Van Trapp is forced to go into service (actually I'm not sure; I've only seen PARTS of The Sound Of Music).\n\nThis is a classic you will always treasure and love forever and ever. I recommend this to everyone, even those not on this website. If you have a TV, then this comes on at least once a year on ABC Family. Also, you can get it in a Roger And Hammerstein's set (like Mrs. Jackson did for Christmas). I think this is also on VHS and Blue-Ray. If you can't find it, look up parts on YouTube. They're bound to have at least parts.\n\nThank you for reading about this extravagant movie. It's a sure-fire classic. This has to be one of the best movies ever made. WATCH IT THE NEXT CHANCE YOU GET!!!!!!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "`The Sound of Music' has taken a great deal of flack for its corny musical ways. A lot of that flack is deserved. The songs are forced into the film with conspicuously bad results. The `choreography' is so despicably contrived that it isn't a wonder that stomachs turn at the sight of the infamous introduction. Lastly, Julie Andrews is a nightmare full of hot air.\n\nThis film can pass family viewing standards for its cute plot, with cute children singing cute songs. However, only two things hold my interest as a mature viewer. The first is a dynamite performance by Christopher Plummer, the second is director Robert Wise. Still with momentum from his production of `West Side Story', Wise takes this silly musical and makes it into the memorable masterpiece it is today. No matter how ineffectual Julie Andrews is, or how Ernest Lehman's screenplay falls apart, the production remains remarkable. The cinematography is beautiful and complex in scope with Todd-AO film doing credit to the film.\n\nBut just when it seems that Wise and company have been defeated by a bad plot, the film comes alive with maturity in the nick of time. First with a sensational romance then with a nail-biter of a dramatic finale. In the space of one hour I decided that I might actually recommend this film to someone over the age of 10.\n\nIn fact this is a great film with something for everyone, and good luck getting those songs out of your head. 8/10 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"The Sound of Music\" is one of the uplifting musicals that Hollywood created in the 60s. Similar to \"Hello Dolly\" and \"Mary Poppins\", these films did not mirror the political and social upheavals of the era, but rather served as a retreat from reality into the realm of fiction. The musical \"West Side Story\" stands out as an exception, being the first to portray the Latino community in New York and delve into their political issues.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" has been subject to criticism for its portrayal of politics. The film's protagonist, Captain von Trapp, resists Nazism, but his opposition is not rooted in its antisemitism, militarism, or authoritarianism. Rather, his primary concern is the threat Nazi Germany poses to Austrian sovereignty.\n\nFurthermore, the film has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity."

The beautiful scenery and wonderful landmarks being the palet on which they're telling us the story of the Von Trapps. Julie Andrews and her angelic voice is the shining gem of this movie, but this would never have worked without the charm of the children. Every single one of them is doing a wonderful job portraying their character. Christopher Plummer is a perfect choice for Captain Von Trapp. The cast is absolutely brilliant to be honest. The plot and the music are timeless. \"The Sound of Music\" is the story of a family and how they've survived their hardships through song and how they've discovered themselves through it and how they've become closer and tighter because of it. It's a beautiful timeless fairytale and a real cinematic wonder. \"The Sound of Music\" is a classic for a reason!"
