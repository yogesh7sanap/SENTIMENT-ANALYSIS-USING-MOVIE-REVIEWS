        "review_detailed_main": "I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of \"Ford v Ferrari\". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.\n\nFor a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.\n\nOne of the main strengths of \"Ford v Ferrari\" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of \"big corporation screwing over the little guy\" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.\n\nThe acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.\n\nThere's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to \"Ford v Ferrari\". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."

Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot. This year oscar is going to be a difficult choice."

Best race car movie of all time?? X marks the spot, and that is 'Ford v Ferrari'. No brainer 10/10.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d"

The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.\n\nThis is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie."

I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.\n\nTo finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was really looking forward to watching this film, but I was disappointed about how Mangold directed it, some overacting, and a too melodramatic script.\n\nFirst, the director expects us to believe that two race car drivers will drive side-by-side giving each other the evil eye while careening down the straight at 210 miles per hour. Better yet, in some early scenes they shout at each other in their open-top race cars, as if they could be heard over the sound of the engines. Mangold also channels Ben-Hur's chariot race, with cars nudging each other sideways. During the Le Mans race, he cuts away multiple times to driver Miles' wife and child watching the event on TV. I'm sorry, but no network then or now would televise a 24-hour race in its entirety. I can almost hear the laughter of anyone in the racing industry who watched all the absurdities (I am sure they would have a longer list than this one).\n\nNext, the director did not rein in the outrageous overacting by Christian Bale as Miles. Add in the demonic glowering of Letts as Henry Ford and you have a cartoon, not a well-conceived treatment of an historical event for American racing. As is par for the course with these testosterone-driven movies, the female characters are destined to be background cheerleaders for their men; in this one, there's only one of them.\n\nEqual blame then to the scriptwriters, who came up with a predictable plot line in the best (or worst?) tradition of American melodrama. We have the bad guys (Ford and Beebe) and the good guys (Shelby and Miles), and everyone else is window dressing. Not a shred of nuance here, which should be an insult to the moviegoer, but I guess the bar has been set pretty low for decades now.\n\nThe racing scenes themselves are well-filmed, with lots of low-angle shots that create even more of a feel of being there. A lot of viewers want explosions, and you get more than your fair share of those here -- maybe too many to be realistic.\n\nIt's unfortunate that in a film of almost epic length you don't get a good exposition of the friendship of Miles and Shelby. Unless I'm wrong, and it just consisted of a lot of bantering and occasional meaningful looks."

        "review_detailed_main": "Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.\n\nFollowing multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.\n\nIf you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.\n\nIn the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."

The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.\n\nThe film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.\n\nAll in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering.

I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.\n\nI'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself.

Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.\n\nIt isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.\n\nMaybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.\n\nHowever, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.\n\nScript is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.\n\nAll in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10"

The plot is dramatic, funny, highly entertaining and not historically accurate (in accordance with those that are fans of car racing), with Matt Damon and the magnificent Christian Bale in the lead roles. But the film never disappoints the fans of a great action film.\n\nChristian Bale was nominated in the Golden Globe in the category Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama and \"Ford v Ferrari\" was Oscar Winner in the Best Achievement in Film Editing and Sound Editing and nominated to the Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Mixing. These awards and nominations would suffice to indicate how good this film is and the viewer does not need to be a car racing fan to like and enjoy it. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Ford vs Ferrari\" (\"Ford v Ferrari\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "I finally saw this, indeed a few years after it came out.\n\nI have always been a Shelby fan, and a GT40 nut. This film takes place, for me, during the best times for both racing and production cars. It's an enjoyable film, with a lot of inaccuracies and events completely manufactured for entertainment sake. So, in other words, a Hollywood film.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the casting of Matt Damon as Shelby. Shelby was a tough, leathery, crinkly, crusty guy that didn't mind getting greasy and dirty to get the job done. He was a man's man. When we see Damon with his clean, smooth face and actor looks, put on a cowboy hat and strut on out, it is laughable. He didn't even try. It's Damon with a put on accent, and for me, is quite a distraction.\n\nBale actually tries to look the part, captures facial expressions, and tries to create a character and melt into his part. For me it works, although I doubt the real Miles was as much of a hot head.\n\nSome of the historical liberties are taken a bit too far. I doubt Shelby ever got into a fist fight with the guy he is hanging everything on to be his star driver...taking a risk of him breaking a hand, back, or other injury. I could go on.\n\nThe scenes with Miles' wife are about 3 too many, and the part of her in the car speeding to scare Miles into being honest with her is preposterous. It always bothers me when there is lazy writing involved having characters get into an argument without reason and overdoing it.\n\nThat said, there is some great racing footage and the action keeps the movie going. However, there is just something about the film that is odd. It just feels, just empty. We never feel like we are in a real place with real racing--there is little atmosphere at the racing locations--and so much just doesn't seem real.\n\nThese considerations left me a bit cold, and keep this from being a memorably movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event. Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film \"Ford v Ferrari\". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966. From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully. Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair. Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"

It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!\n\nThe largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.\n\nNowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans."

Not so much that his wife isn't an expert, but that the director felt like his audience was too stupid to be following along at this point.\n\n..and that kinda thing happens throughout the whole movie. There's many times where the same line gets repeated a couple times to make sure the audience understands whats happening I guess, but I feel like they aren't giving the audience enough credit.\n\nThey also included an unnecessary mustache twirling villain that comes in every few minutes to try to foil the plans of the heroes, but it doesn't really make any sense because it's in his best interest for them to succeed. He's literally being paid to make sure they win. It gets pretty hokey at times.\n\nDespite both Damon and Bale being all kinds of great, Bale morphs into Ken Miles near perfectly, I can't give it an 8/10 because, while its a cool time waster and especially nice to see the cars on screen, I thought as whole it was just fine. Not great, but just fine."

Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes.

Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.\n\nThe result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.\n\nAll of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."

        "review_detailed_main": "Somewhat surprised by the high ratings and Oscar nominations this has garnered. Writing as a motor racing fan, it simply isn't a good film.\n\nI'll start with some positives.\n\nThe supporting cast are good, and the rivalries and relationships between Shelby (Damon) and Miles (Bale) and the Ford Motor Co. And Miles' own family are engaging. Production values are high too.\n\nBut there is a long list of negatives.\n\nBiggest problem by far is the two leads. Christian Bale, as usual, is ACTING and he wants the audience to be very aware of it, to the extent of putting on an over-the-top Brummie accent complete with non-stop commentary on everything he is doing while inside the car.\n\nMatt Damon is \"acting\" as only Matt can. He is doing a bit of an accent as well. At least he isn't quite as annoying as Bale.\n\nYou just can't engage with either of them.\n\nAnd the weak lead performances just make you notice all the technical inaccuracies. It's not a good start when some of the first cars you see on screen are obvious modern replicas. On top of that, the timeline is changed to make the story more dramatic (ignoring the GT40s origins in the UK, playing with the timeline of the Fiat/Ferrari takeover, transporting the \"old man\" to Le Mans).\n\nBut probably the greatest crime is that the testing and racing sequences fall into all the bad tropes of filmmakers who don't understand car racing, and change the dynamics to make it more appealing to a general audience. Cars ALWAYS have an extra gear that gives them a 20mph boost to overtake. Drivers coast along the main straights so they can have a lingering look through an opponents window, or maybe even say a few words. Cars are never on the racing line, instead they are weaving at random. Cars collide (or are forced off the track deliberately) and burst into flames with no reference to the consequences.\n\nFord winning Le Mans out of spite is a great story. This film doesn't do it justice."

The cinematography was engaging, the acting was phenomenal and the direction was so well done that I was literally rooting for Ken Miles to win!\n\nFord vs Ferrari is based on a true story and had me googling facts put to us in the film. It depicts the real life determination of Henry Ford II to beat Ferrari at Le Mans after Ferrari had one it 6 times in a row going bankrupt in the process and then mocking Ford's serious offer to buy Ferrari's company, while using his offer to get Fiat to make a better offer. In his determination to beat Ferrari at Le Mons, Ford engineer turned executive Lee Iacocca convinces Ford to let him put together a team of the best, which is how Carroll Shelby (the only American to have won at La Mons) and British born driver/engineer Ken Miles come to be working on the Ford Racing Team...and the rest as they say is history.\n\nThe film does an excellent job building the characters and getting you to invest emotionally in the outcome. I have never been a racing fan...but I was right there on the edge of my seat rooting Ken Miles on! There is also an excellent villain developed in the Ford Executive Leo Beebe. It sounds like he really did rob Ken Miles out of the triple crown. I really hope there is a special place in hell.\n\nI want to give a special thank you for the depiction of Ken Miles' wife, Mollie. Often racing movies depict the females as bimbos or so weak-hearted that they are always trying to talk their man out of racing because it is dangerous. Mollie Miles was portrayed as a solid wife and mother, who not only knew a little something about cars but was supportive of her husband and a stand up individual.\n\nI never thought I would see the day that I would be googling and reading articles about auto-racing. True fact Mario Andretti and my Dad are the same age, who knew!"

        "review_title": "A well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.\n\nIn 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.\n\nWith its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.\n\nDirector James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.\n\nChristian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.\n\nOverall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.\n\nI rate it 8.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.\n\nAlthough this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.\n\nBale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.\n\nThe two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.\n\nThe Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.\n\nEvents play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.\n\nThe racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.\n\nTop notch stuff, well worth watching."

I initially took an interest in the movie when I saw it stared (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) I went into this movie on a complete whim that it might be worth watching. Admittedly I was a little lost during the first thirty minutes of the movie but after getting familiar with the characters aswell as the cars I easily settled into the movies storyline and awesome looking fast paced driving.\n\nI didn't expect this movie to explain how race cars are built or explain anything on a technical level. I was honestly hoping this movie would give a little history on Le Mans and showcase the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari with some fast paced driving scene's that get the adrenaline pumping. Le Mans '66 delivered everything I expected and more not only do we get some beautifully shot driving scenes that look amazing we also get a real heartfelt story of two men who put their heart and soul into making a beautiful car capable of winning Le Mans and all for a company that showed them little to no respect but they still continued to do what they loved building and racing uniquely built cars with a purpose.\n\nThe performances from lead actors (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) are Oscar worthy the passion they put into their unique performances is arguably some of their best work on screen in years. The supporting cast also do a great job of bringing the movie to life every actor and actress is a perfect fit for their role in the movie both the big roles and the smalls roles are perfectly cast.\n\nThe one and only complaint I have about this movie is Christian Bales absolutely awful \"British\" accent that he has throughout the entire movie I think he was going for a classic Cockney accent but instead he sounds like an American trying to imitate a 18th century London chimney sweep. Other than that Bales performance is brilliant.\n\nI recommend giving this movie a chance even if you have no interest in cars and racing there's still plenty to enjoy and plenty you can learn from it's story I certainly felt like I knew more about racing and Le Mans than I did before going into the movie."

Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, \"If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost\", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!"

Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.\n\nAt 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting. Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing. Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well. Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.\n\nOverall Rating: A-"

An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself.

We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.\n\nThe writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.\n\nI am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."

        "review_title": "I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendship and triumph",
        "review_detailed_main": "Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Ferrari (2023) was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.\n\nMangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.\n\nThe film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby () wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb , who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca () contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe ().\n\nLe Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's , insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clich\u00e9d feel-good moments as possible).\n\nThe film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused ) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clich\u00e9d boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.\n\nThis thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer , and sound designers and have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.\n\nIn terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a \"Ford man\", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.\n\nAlthough these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clich\u00e9d and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."

I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history."

Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.\n\nSeveral of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.\n\nAmerican car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.\n\nShelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.\n\n20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen \"co-driver\".\n\nThe supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.\n\nAlthough I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.\n\nFord v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.\n\nThe film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.\n\nThis is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie \"Mine is Bigger.\" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.\n\nThe best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.\n\nI am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.\n\nThere are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.\n\nNot recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "Highly recommended for a different kind of thriller movies, and for the overly competitive.\n\nSo I don't usually write reviews, and frankly setting to watch this movie, I would have never thought it would be the one to prompt me to start writing reviews. But this movie has just completely blown my mind. Despite being a bit discouraged at the start by all the mechanics and cars talk, once i got past trying to understand it I really enjoyed the movie.\n\nFirst, the acting is phenomenal, how Christian Bale has missed am Oscar for this performance just elides me. I don't like Matt Damon that much but I have to say that I was throughly impressed by his role as Carole Shelby, and the chemistry between him and Christian Bale in the movie. Also, despite the predictability of the plot as it is a biography, the movie managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the whole 2.5 hours. In fact I was a bit discouraged by the length of the movie aat first, but once it was doen I couldn't believe how fast it went. I was not bored for a second. After doing a little research also I was happy to see that the movie kept a lot of the true story's details.\n\nSecond, something that I don't see many reviews commenting about is the lightning.. Like seriously, the lightening in the movie is amazing, the outdoors' scenes has perfect recreations of sunlight, and the night racing scenes ar shot with a perfect balance between authenticity and practicality.\n\nFinally, saving the best for the last was the sound effects that were so immersive, it set my heart racing for every second of the movie. Thye were beautifuly complex and minute, you would feel as if you just brought the races home."

Jon Bernthal makes a great addition to the cast and makes his scenes quite intense. The editing and sound are astonishing because it gives us the realistic feeling of racing. Cinematography is life-like and it makes cars easy to follow, I won't even start with the color grading... I thought that soundtrack could be used better, it didn't hit all the notes for me, but it wasn't bad.\n\nIf you're a car enthusiast, it's a must watch, if you're an average consumer, it's a great movie to finish a day with, or even a week."

It's the combination of passion, skill, and knowledgeability that makes Ken Miles THE guy to root for.\n\nMatt Damon was good, however I think he could be replaced with virtually any other actor and the movie would be unchanged.\n\nThe character building we are given before, the villainization of the Ford team; they inject the racing sequences with the same suspense and adrenaline present when your home team is fighting for a championship title. We not only have a favorite, we have rivals.\n\nAnd oh, what a twist--what a soul-crushing twist. I almost couldn't finish the movie. I had to look up whether it was real in the hopes that it wasn't. It's one of those times that you just wished based on a true story was fiction so as to console yourself."

Generally historically accurate. Nice plot in that it creates two anti-heroes battling against being the underdogs and battling against the ruthless ambitions of their own sponsors. Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.\ud83d\ude00"

It's definitely not about Henry Ford vs. Enzo Ferrari. In this movie's case the Hungarian title is better imo: \"Kings of the Asphalt\"\n\nThis movie is about the tenacity and the single minded fanaticism that is needed to achieve greatness. This movie is about the painfulness of being different. This movie is about how hard it is to be extraordinary.\n\nAnd boy, does it deliver. We already know that when Mr. Bale does something - it is done absolutely and without question to perfection. You can feel every thought, every decision, every second of the character through the screen here as well. Matt Damon is also exceptional in my opinion. Their chemistry, their dynamic, their friendship can be felt every scene - and it makes the film great.\n\nDon't get me wrong - there's racing! And lots of it. It's just more than any racing movie ever been... The director of the film - James Mangold - did an exceptional job. There was a lot of - literally - moving pieces and he made those move together in perfect harmony.\n\nIt's good if you know of - or heard of - Shelby, but that's it. You don't have to know everything there is to know about car racing history. They tell you. And maybe it's even better if you don't. You can feel the weight of taking every corner without knowing if that's the last - and you can only have that experience once, until you don't know the story, the ending. Of course, if you've ever driven above the speed limit, and with a 200+ horse power car as well helps - but it's not necessary to enjoy the film.\n\nFun fact: the last part of the movie is the illustration in the dictionary when you look up \"life's not fair\" or \"no good deed goes unpunished\".\n\nMemorable quotes: \"Am I on fire?!\" \"There's a point above 7000 RPM...\"\n\n9/10"

And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding.\n\nThe plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari.\n\nIt is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling.\n\nThe direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by. Or right in the driver side of the car puts you right into the race.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon delivered the performances. They are awesome playing the characters.\n\nOverall, Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of the year. It is exciting. The direction, script, and actors did great with the movie. The racing sequences is one of the best put together action scenes. That will leave you on the edge of your seat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having just stepped out of an advanced screening of le Mans 66 or Ford vs Ferrari if you prefer, I was really looking forward to this film and I wasn't disappointed. As a fan of the 24hr race I found the racing scenes to be heart pounding, adrenalin pumping and visually breathtaking. The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair. It's not just thrills either. There are genuinely touching moments in this film with a great supporting cast and a great villain in Enzo Ferrari. I loved it and if you have an interest in the source material you won't find a better petrol fuelled film this year. SA"

Great supporting cast with Jon Bernthal as the famous Lee Iacocca, Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe, Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, & Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II. Not once in its 2 & a half hour run time did I get bored.\n\nThe score by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders drove the movie just right & even has a track called \"7000 RPM\".\n\nWell done & major kudos all around.

And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.\n\nChristian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.\n\nIf you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).\n\nThe way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !\n\nI will definitely get this on DVD."

Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!\n\nBriefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).\n\nBut towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life. The film is overly long and at times self indulgent, but for fans of fast cars - and racing history - this film will more than satisfy."

The wife's hissy fit could have been cut.

To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.\n\nOf course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here. The racing division is championed by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) but the fly in the ointment is Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) a square peg in a round hole.\n\nIn their sights is Ferrari, who themselves are struggling financially and have the temerity to object to being bought out by Ford. In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.\n\nFord v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well.

I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it. The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it. Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+. 5/5"

As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic. Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message. Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round. If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses. Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half"

He's a big car junkie so I thought he'd like it. When the movie finished, the entire movie theater clapped. That was a first for me in my lifetime (I'm 25). Bale and Damon's acting was incredible. For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard. I seriously feel like we are in the dark ages of theater. There are about 2 movies a year that are good. I rarely mark movies as a 10, but when I left the theater, I couldn't help but mark it down as a 10. I loved the movie from start to finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is the early-1960s and Ford Motor Corporation's fortunes are at a low ebb. In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.\n\nI did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.\n\nDirector James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 \u00bd hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.\n\nNot perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.\n\nOverall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by."

I've not seen acting this good in a very long time, if you're looking to have faith in movies again look no further!\n\nThe best part about this story is that it's a true one, I feel when true stories are the plot to the film its always executed perfectly (from what I've seen as far as true stories are concerned) this was a great watch. I'm a massive fan of Matt Damon, he goes way beyond Jason Bourne and I think he's very entertaining to watch at the best of times.\n\nI highly recommend watching this movie, its so beautifully crafted and the acting is spot on!"

In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Ford v Ferrari\" isn't as much about the battle between the two mega-corporations in the title as much as it is about the fight between bureaucracy and action, calculations and instinct or faith and palpability. It involves internal struggles as much as external ones and carried superbly by its two leads, Matt Damon and Christian Bale--whose performance is Oscar-worthy--is one of the most likable, satisfying and entertaining movies of the year.\n\nThe plot heads towards an epic culmination at the 1966 24-hour Le Mans race in France and it involves the years in which Ford created the now legendary GT40 to finally beat Ferrari who has been dominating the racing realm of motoring for years. It follows car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they deal with the technical ins and outs, corporate interference and media standards navigating their vagaries to get to success. The movie is as old-school macho as its central characters. Shelby was an American maverick, always dressing like the boss he is, always determined to get the job done, but he was understanding of the business side. Miles, on the other hand, is as complicated as he is a brilliant driver. His approach to the world is stripped of formality, his driving is his religion and people should be as real as he is otherwise they become fodder for his unfiltered words.\n\nJames Mangold knew he was entering a world with high potential in entertainment when he approached this story. Whenever attempting to encompass American history, one tends to sensationalize through patriotism and venerate the people it contains. And indeed they are worthy of veneration. This plays out like standard Hollywood fare, the dream factory working its magic perfectly. But it's also very male-centric. Not only its characters look like they were made in a car factory, the women are also hysterical. A particular scene in which Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) has a nervous breakdown during an argument with Ken about him hiding his plan to work on the new GT40 is a bit exaggerated. As they are in their family car, she starts driving erratically and dangerously, the scene playing like an interrogation scene. \"I thought we loved this stuff!\"--she yells until Ken spits everything out. Yet in the end, she is fine with it, she just wished he hadn't lied. Her worries are understandable and called for, but her over-the-top reaction Mangold decided upon is obsolete as representation for women--even if this was the 1960s.\n\nIn the end, though, \"Ford v Ferrari\" finishes with just the right amount of satisfaction. While both characters are likable and Bale's performance rules, Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby is what really made me up this movie's grade. He is perfect as men who try to get the job done but also not upset anyone too much. His approach to Ford's CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) on why he should get a second chance after losing in 1965's Le Mans is as elegant as it is harsh and true. Even if \"Ford v Ferrari\" seems a bit outdated it is nonetheless a movie which really wants to be liked--not only by car people, but by everyone. Well, it succeeded."

For me it's a little long (2h 32m) but the driving sequences are spectacular and the human element keeps the movie interesting even if it feel's like real life has been smoothed out quite a bit with broad brushstrokes to keep things black and white."

He publicly challenges the world's fastest race car, The Ferrari!\n\nFord hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to design a car that can beat the Ferrari. Shelby recruits a arrogant British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to be his top driver. Together they build a Ford GT car that can go over 200 mph and not fall apart.\n\nThey take the GT to the ''LeMans'' in France and try to upset Enzo Ferrari's long, dominant ''Fastest Car in the World'' reign.\n\nI really like this movie and it is based on true events. It is well shot and directed with some really good actors. (Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Caitr\u00edona Balfe, Josh Lucas) If you like cars and racing you will love this movie. There are lots of exciting high speed racing scenes from the driver's POV and a really interesting story about Ford Motor Company's history."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm no petrolhead. What little knowledge I have of classic cars I gleaned from playing Top Trumps as a kid. I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).\n\nMatt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).\n\nA classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.\n\nThe legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.\n\n7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been saying this for years, but making a cine biography isn't easy. I know movies aren't an exact science, but most of the time I watch a biography, I found myself giving something around 7, when it's just an ok movie, or even lower. However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like \"I, Tonya\" or \"Darkest Hour\". And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.\n\nThe most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That's me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.\n\nAnyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.\n\nThe score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.\n\nTo sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen."

Christian Bale was just phenomenal. Especially if you consider that just last year at the same time he was playing a totally different character in \"Vice\", physically and also Motivation wise. Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal. James Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss. Sound and editing were pitch perfect. The final race was one of the most exciting Moments in Cinema we had this year. And in the end it even almost brought me to Tears. A true winner Picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a lot to love and a lot to be frustrated about in Ford v Ferrari, which seems to be becoming a trend in Mangold movies (except The Wolverine - there's truly nothing to love in that horribly misguided movie). It is certainly an exhilarating car movie and underdog sports movie at its core, and the racing scenes are gorgeous and put the audience right into the driver's seat. It's a tight script which particularly shines in its dialogues between Shelby and the Ford execs or Ken. Bale is absolutely amazing, stealing every scene and injecting joy into all of the racing scenes.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the movie is its apparent disinterest in its characters. Shelby is a great example of this - with the background we get early, I wanted some allusion or discussion of how he's devastated he can no longer race but loves being a part of the journey with Ken. None of that was ever implied, and that also gets at a larger and apparently controversial take: Damon's performance was disappointing. He was completely opaque and detached, never successfully selling me the anger with Ford or the love for working with the cars the way Bale did. Some lens into the psychology of the main characters and why racing meant so much to them would've been great. The race ending was fine in showing executive duplicity, but would've been better if we knew anything about the other Ford racers (and truthfully many explanations were left unsaid about how the process worked). The ending, while completely fitting in script, was rushed and sudden, making it less impactful than it deserved.\n\nIt's still fun as a sports movie, leaving no moments of boredom while it flies through it's 2:32 runtime, but for a movie that tries to hit emotional notes and focus on its character interactions, I'm perplexed at how no investigation of their characters or themes of dedication to a lifelong passion existed whatsoever. A fun and good movie, but should've been a great one."

Yes, it is a drama, that tells us a very sad story, that I won't tell now in order to avoid any spoilers. it's amazing how good were the writers and the director, who managed to make an intense movie for a motorsports fan like myself. Knowing the story in details, I was sitting there an watching the movie living every second of it. Amazing work! Matt Damon and especially Christian Bale are outstanding. There are slight differences with the real story, but my guess is that it was done with purpose, to make the story more interesting/dramatic. Overall one of the new additions to the my favorite movie list.

After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens.

At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.\n\nLet's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.\n\nI also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.\n\nThe film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine."

Hoping to keep big business from getting in the way.\n\n\n\nAn enjoyable racing film, also has a great 1960's setting. Racing scenes are also well shot, makes you feel you are in car. But it's Matt Damon and Christian Bales performances that really makes the movie, having Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Josh Lucas is also good."

Enjoyable action performed by masterful actors woven into a meaningful story. Friendship, challenge and trust all displayed in a way that I could enjoy. Trial and error engineering before computers took over the decision process ... wow what a magical time to be alive. The Le Mans wins by the Ford GT40 on 66, 67, 68 and 69 ... epic effort and akin to the first Moon landing as far as motor sports is concerned. In this current political landscape, I can imagine that people who weren't alive then, being dismissive of this story.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a great biopic that tells a compelling story between the American and Italian car makers in one of the toughest races in the world. As a person who likes cars and has a passing familiarity with Le Mans and car mechanics, I thought this move was excellent for people who only had a surface level knowledge of these things and had plenty for every type of movie goer.\n\nDamon and Bale are obviously excellent, with Bale donning a proper English accent and lots of eccentricity and Damon pulling off the forced retired racer and now car designer smoothly. The supporting cast was extremely well done, with special call outs to Tracy Letts, who played an absolutely excellent Henry Ford II and had one of the best scenes in the entire movie. His ability to display such a wide range of emotions really sold the audience to how invested he was in this character. Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, Bale's character's wife, was also excellent. She has a few of her own scenes where she steals the show and is the perfect compliment to Bale's character's own ad hoc lifestyle at times.\n\nIn fact, most of the scenes involving Ford Execs were so good that they warrant their own biopic with their own characters. The political battle between Ford's VPs was interesting and infuriating at the same time, showing repeatidly that they are their own worst enemy.\n\nIn terms of direction, this movie was executed well. Conscious decisions were made to have Italian dialogue not translated in certain scenes, allowing the audience really understand visually the scenes without giving it away. Most shots are very clean and the driving sections are well done to build tension while also not becoming boring.\n\nThe movie does throw a lot of you in terms of details, mentions of gearboxes, lift, brake roters, tire swaps, etc... all show that a proper gear head would enjoy the jargon. The Ford GT40 in general really shines here and takes center stage multiple times in the film. There is one particular scene where Damon's character take the car for a spin and you really do understand the absolute power behind the car and its eventual final designs that lead it to be successful.\n\nAt over 2.5 hours, this movie does not leave anything out and truly does tell the compelling story of the Americans at Le Mans. Overall the movie comes well recommend and is definitely worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "SYNOPSIS: The true story based on the Le Mans race in 1966 following former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) striving to make Ford a serious contender to Ferrari. However, problems arise when his driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) may not have the image Ford wants.\n\nREVIEW: James Mangold does here what very few Directors can do and that's make me interested in something I have no interest in. Everything this film was screamed \"YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, JOHN!\" I've never been one to care about cars, or racing and definitely not films focused on that, but wow this film was executed damn near perfectly. Mansgold creates an intriguing conflict and dialogue. To no surprise we also get superb acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Then you have an amazing supporting cast with the likes of Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts. Josh Lucas played the perfect \"douche bag who thinks he's too good for everyone and everything\" and has a very punchable face which made the ending to this film relatively bitter-sweet (if you've seen this film you know what I mean). I was so afraid of this film being what every film with cars is and that's \"turn left, then turn right, then turn left, reverse and do a 180, turn left again\" and I can't even begin to explain how much that irks me, but this film is beautifully paced and is edited so well that I was actually on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the outcome would be.\n\nCONCLUSION: What I tell everyone is that this is the \"Green Book\" of 2019. Obviously, very different subject matter, however, the very well made, emotional, warm, sad, happy and crowd pleasing type of film worthy of an Oscar nomination. So, regardless if you're a fan of cars or racing I recommend this to everyone. 8.7/10."

Christian Bale can transform into any role/character, and make you believe he's the real deal! The cars were really cool, and the racing was pretty realistic! I like anything based on true events, and I think this movie did a pretty good job telling the story of Ford teaming up with Shelby to win Lemans, and beat out Ferrari."

        "review_detailed_main": "My review for Ron Howard's \"Rush\" enthusiastically placed it at the top of the heap for \"racing genres\" if that is such a thing. That film was excellent even if you are not a racing fan.\n\nWell now that I have seen \"Ford vs Ferrari\", I am having a difficult time choosing which one is better. I'm going to lean towards Ford v Ferrari because of the performance by Christian Bale as it is fresh in my mind and certainly a great character and acting job. I love his rebelliousness and genuine love for the machine...the way he communicates with it intuitively as if it was alive, Iis great stuff. At first I didn't think Matt Damon was cast well for the part of Carroll Shelby. From what I know (and I did meet him once) he was more of an outspoken cowboy, but I have to say Damon was excellent and his performance grew on me. Not as good as Bale who stole the show, but still excellent. The Lee Iacocca character was also slightly miscast but still, a very entertaining performance.\n\nI liked how the period corporate culture of the US car industry was portrayed, with strong personalities and business practices of that era. It was especially entertaining when the Ford boys were they trying to match wits against Enzo Ferrari.\n\nAs to the racing and car stuff, it was great. Period authenticity was respected even in the scenes in France. The growling soundtrack and sweeping score just works. I enjoyed the innovative camera work of the racing scenes. The Ford GT40 was a miracle of brute American know-how against the refined Italian machinery of the legendary Ferraris.\n\nBased on factual history (with a little artistic license thrown in), the story is compelling and left me very satisfied.\n\nIn my opinion, \"Rush\" and \"Ford V Ferrari\" are the two best racing movies ever."

The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Review - Ford V Ferrari Mr rating. 8.5 /10\n\nI don't have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.\n\nFord V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken Miles\n\nThe bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West's 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.\n\nThe story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.\n\nFor me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes Matt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it's Christian Bale that steals the film he's a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn't suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he'll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.\n\nMatt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he's not a \"Ford Man.\" Henry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .\n\nKen Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.\n\nI thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it's one of the best movies of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a very enjoyable film\n\nIt is a feel-good, underdog wins, suits win only the hollowest of battle victories, good guys when all the wars.\n\nThe driving scenes were great, and I don't care if the gear shifting was technically correct. There were a few memorably intense acting scenes: Tracy Lett's reaction to being driven in a great racing car by a great racing car driver. Christian Bale being driven in a station wagon by an absolutely ferocious wife (Caitriona Balfe) stick in my mind.\n\nAfter watching this movie I wanted to see what else Caitriona Balfe has acted in - I've watched a few episodes of Outlander and have been really impressed by her ferocity on screen. Not merely noisy -- but oozing heartfelt intensity.\n\nOh - the cinematography, editing and sound were all world class.\n\nAs an afterthought--Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe are two of the handsomest stars I've ever seen. This production discourages seeing them that way. Bale looks lean, hungry, and slightly weird in most scenes; Caitriona Balfe is not much past ordinary in appearance. The other racing movies this one is compared to are about beautiful people who occasionally need to change out of their racing duds so they can send them to the cleaners before dropping by the club for hors d'oeuvres and aperitifs.\n\nThe --uh, restrained--comparisons with Rush, LeMans and Grand Prix may be justified, but I fully enjoyed this movie. If you like cars, competition, various versions of excessive testosterone,--a number of interesting cultural interactions, I think you'll enjoy it too.\n\nNot deep, not technically fulfilling, but clear and interesting story-telling, and cinematically beautiful movie-making all the way through."

        "review_detailed_main": "GRADE: B+\n\nTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.\n\nIN BRIEF: A terrific sports film expertly crafted and a highly entertaining moviegoing experience.\n\nJIM'S REVIEW: Hollywood's fascination with the race car genre can be seen with varying degrees of success. Famous actors have felt the need for speed in their careers starting with James Garner in the Oscar-winning Grand Prix (1966), Paul Newman in Winning (1969), Steve McQueen in Le Mans (1971), Burt Reynolds in The Cannonball Run (1981), Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder (1990) and Chris Hemsworth in Rush (2013),...not to mention, the highly profitable The Fast and Furious series. Even The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, revved up in some of his crowd-pleasing movies. Yes, it's definitely a man's world and the testosterone runs high. Now we can add James Mangold's exhilarating joy ride of a movie, Ford v Ferrari, to the list. His film is one of the best sport action films about racing ever made. Gentlemen, start your engines!\n\nFord v Ferrari shows the competitive world of auto racing. Based on a true story, Mr. Mangold sticks mostly to the facts, although he spins his tale a bit to heighten the tension between two racing mavericks, Carroll Shelley, (Matt Damon) a former driver and car designer, and hot-headed British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and the suits at the Ford Motor Company and their interferences with them as their sponsors. Everyone's goal is to beat the No. 1 foreign sports carmaker, Ferrari, and put Ford on the map as a major competitive force in the global market.\n\nThe story is not your strictly race car movie with fast cars circling lap after lap. The plot does adhere to a predictable formula although the results aren't always that telling. The screenwriting team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller fashion a tried-and-true tale of underdogs fighting against the system, a them vs. us story that works. They wisely do not just rely on the action scenes and take the time to build characters and relationships in between the many terrific racing sequences: the family dynamics of Carroll's wife and son, the budding bromance between Carroll and Ken, the racer and his pit crew, the white collar executives in contrast to the blue collared working man, American know-how vs. European elitism, the psychology and engineering that is involved with this sport. The film tackles bigger issues than most sport movies aspire.\n\nActually, what added to my enjoyment of the film was my lack of knowledge about the real life events and the people involved. Far from being a race car enthusiast, my expectations about the movie were low and I was pleasantly surprised by this film's visually sweep. Credit the strong production values, fine acting, and masterful direction by Mr. Mangold.\n\nForemost is the incredible editing by Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland. (Their cross-cutting of race car action and personal drama is a glorious showcase of intense images seamlessly crafted, especially the nearly half hour climactic sequence of the 1966 Le Mans race.) Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is stunning in every angle, Fran\u00e7ois Audouy's period production design is spot-on, and the sound by Donald Sylvester, Paul Massey, David Giammarco and Steven A. Morrow brings tension and the needed authenticity to the movie. Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' music score heightens the suspense most effectively. This is technically superior filmmaking, a well-made sports movie about the love of the sport.\n\nMr. Mangold's direction is solid if underrated. He crafts his film with style and substance. He also assembles a wonderful cast. Some may not be physically right for their roles but they deliver convincing performances throughout the movie. The chemistry with the two leads is a wonderful mix of contrasting personalities. Mr. Damon uses his likable screen persona and throws in some subtle angst and frustration to his character. Mr. Bale has the showier role but really excels in the film's quieter moments between him and his family. Both are excellent. Caitonia Balfe and Noah Jupe play Carroll's loyal wife, Mollie, and his adoring son, Peter, and they ably provide the human drama. Josh Lucas makes a very compelling villain. Rounding out the ensemble are Ray McKinnon, Remo Girone, JJ Feild, and Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca. Tracy Letts has a memorable spin as the tyrannical Henry Ford II in one of the film's best scenes.\n\nBuckle up, moviegoers! Ford v Ferrari is an action-packed thrill ride and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2019."

I went in with relatively high expectations just due to the director, and I came out with a whole new appreciation for the sport. Mangold puts you front and forward in the action, with some really impressive shots, the technical aspects alone make this one worth watching. But at its core this is a character driven piece with two career best performances from Bale and Damon as Shelby and Miles, who not only have their own issues to deal with, but also that of the big Ford corporation, and a race they are not willing to lose. This film has a bit of everything, from the personal tolls this project has on Miles and his wife and kid, to the exciting 24 hour race, or the inner workings of big business and what crooks they can be, Ford v. Ferrari is a perfect crowd pleasing movie, and overall one that I personally can't wait to watch again.\n\nI give Ford v. Ferrari 5 stars out of 5"

Ferrari managed to win me over.\n\nIt took a subject matter I had no interest in and got me invested with endearing characters brought to life by great performances from Bale and Damon. This is a perfect movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon; it's predictable every step of the way, but it leaves you satisfied and even a little sad to say goodbye to these characters you've grown to love.\n\nThe only other James Mangold directed films I've seen were his two Wolverine films, and while Ford v. Ferrari is no where close to the quality of something like Logan, it does have that same emotionally honest quality that Mangold's other films have. FvF is fun, it's got a good pace to it, and it put a smile on my face. Sometimes the most predictable story is also the most satisfying."

Matt Damon does a fine job playing Carroll Shelby (inventor of the Shelby Mustang) and the winner of the 1959 Le Mans. Christian Bale plays Ken Miles, the British driver brought in by Shelby to race in the late 60s Le Mans races. Bale was great in the role, better than his Batman days.\n\nFor fans of racing films and racing in general, you will really enjoy the story and the direction that Mangold gives. And for those on the fence about Matt Damon, I have to say I really enjoyed watching him in this film, probably one of his best roles in years. He and Bale played very well off one another, and it made for a very enjoyable film."

At over 2hrs there was time to see the other side of the coin. Bebe while the antagonist in this film in real life was not that bad. Ford 2 was worse in real life. Fun film but not the best.

Even though the title suggests \" Ford v Ferrari \" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives. The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it. At the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time."

The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.\n\nDirector James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.\n\nAs failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.\n\nPut two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap."

This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: \"You won't believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari\" :P\n\nWe literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don't blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.\n\nLeaving this \"title nonsense\" behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven't heard of a machine called \"car\" before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version's essence. That would be my director's cut I guess. Long story short, you won't miss much if you don't watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn't hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time. I didn't hate the movie. It was just far behind what it offered with it's cast, 8+ star rating, fantastic reviews and so on."

Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk. P. S- I am not an F1 freak, yet I loved every frame of it. Such is the power of this movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we'd all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.\n\nOne of the great true stories is that of Ferrari's snubbing of Henry Ford II's attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari's company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.\n\nFord winning LeMans, It's a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.\n\nThese two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it's these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you'd imagine the real man was like in a kind of \"beyond acting\" if you will. Engrossing.\n\nSpeaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable."

Weird.\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Low to moderate value\n\nTEMPO: OK, but for all the attempts at adrenaline-pumping it just felt flat\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Too much CGI\n\nMUSIC / SOUND: Stupid \"Top Gun\" type music\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: Director: Mangold appears to be a decent director, but nothing in his portfolio I'd call excellent.\n\nWriters: The two Butterworth bros. Have a small portfolio including this, none of which merits applause.\n\nIs it a good film? Borderline mediocre\n\nShould you watch this once? I wouldn't bother\n\nRating: 6.0."

Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.\n\nThis was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness."

There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.\n\nThe performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience. This movie was another example of his fine work.\n\nSo, whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari will always be an enjoyable offer even for the muggles. 9/10 for a masterpiece!"

So i am glad this movie come out ,and that there can be people who can feel those things , who can understand further the work of an engineer , and how much work those car companies put into developing newer and better cars ,but also show the work behind a succesful company !! is them engineers/workers and dedication.\n\nYou must not pass over this , is just so delightful to watch it ,even if i didn't had the luck to see races happening real life (in Romania).\n\ni still curse those days ,when a high speed circuit was planned to be builded and been canceled! by politics changes and coruption.. .So those who have acces to those things, appreciate the opportunity of taking part to such a race."

But I'm also not into diamonds or the diamond business, and I thought \"Uncut Gems\" was one of the best films of the year. I don't have to be \"into\" a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what's the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you're going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it's set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It's the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It's the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It's full of a certain American attitude I simply can't stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I'm not sure what the movie's point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.\n\nMatt Damon's good ol' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he's used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don't want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time. The best moment in the movie belongs to Tracey Letts.\n\nGrade: C"

These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale's diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.\n\nThe elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60's.\n\nWith regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them.

Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.\n\nIt's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.\n\nSolid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."

First, to make a car analogy again because it's fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for \"Pizzazz\" with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.\n\nSecond, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won't say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now \"owned\" by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he's been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a \"Good\" beat, where it's almost like the movie is saying, \"yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you.\" But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn't hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.\n\nI don't know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.\n\nOh, and it's a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so. Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like \"Giddy-up!\" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role? Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."

While its unlikely Bale will walk away with any significant silverware in such a crowded year for male performances of note, there's a good chance his turn here will be fondly remembered as one of his best.\n\nWith these two fantastic lead turns front and centre throughout and a raft of memorable supporting performances from the likes of the always great Jon Bernthal, the slick Josh Lucas and a scene stealing Tracey Letts as Henry Ford 2, Ford v Ferrari is the all-round package, a trial against the odds underdog story that is a film everyone should check out, not just those already in the know about this wonderful true life tale.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nA winning delivery of a tried and true formula makes Ford v Ferrari a ride worth taking, further enhanced by some immaculate direction and some wondrously entertaining performances, James Mangolds racing epic is one of the year's most memorable big screen events.\n\n4 \u00bd ruined bags of groceries out of 5"

If a car has four wheels, starts, and can maintain the speed limit: I'm happy. So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.\n\nOn the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.\n\nSo the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.\n\nGive it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Le Mans '66 is a new sports biography directed by James Mangold, director of Logan and Walk the Line.\n\nIn the film, the American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is asked by car company Ford if he wants to make a racing car for the company, so that they can participate in car racing so that they can also sponsor their company in this car world. Ford also hopes to be able to compete more with the Ferrari car company. They try to do this during the 24-hour Le Mans race. To have a good chance against Ferrari, they also have to find a suitable driver. Carroll proposes to ask British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to race for Ford. Ken Miles has a passion for cars and racing, but is also somewhat rebellious. For example, he does not seem the right driver to promote Ford in a positive way with their brand and new racing cars. Shelby and his race crew see that Ken is the only one who has a real chance to successfully drive the Ford race car and a real chance to win the race. Shelby and his crew now have to decide to stay true to Ford's rules with another driver, or to keep the race with Ken Miles as a driver, so they have a chance to win the 24-hour Le Mans race. For a true story, James Mangold knows how to tell the film in an interesting way. You also don't need to have any knowledge about car racing or the true events of Le Mans '66 to be able to follow and understand the story. You will receive the necessary information in the film. If you are familiar with all or a few of these things, there is more to enjoy in the film, because there are enough jokes and comical references in the film for the connoisseurs. The race scenes are also filmed as if you were in the car as a driver or passenger as a viewer. Thanks to the sound effects of the racing cars, it also feels as if you are actually watching a race or you are actually participating in the scenes in the car.\n\nThe film is not really about the battle between car companies Ford and Ferrari. This is part of the film, but the film is more about the fight that the car designer and racer have against the company's board members, which they must keep satisfied. This film shows so beautifully how people sometimes have to choose to continue to follow their passion and own thinking. Or that they neatly follow the rules of the company and the manager, even if they have to put aside their passion and their own ideas. Apart from the race, they also know how to create excitement in the film with the different choices that the characters face. As a viewer you usually do not know which choice is the best and which is ultimately taken by the characters. The film also shows how heavy people are who are slightly different from society due to poor health or a developmental disorder such as PTSD. Despite In the face of these handicaps, they still have to follow certain rules of society, which is not always easy for them.\n\nThe acting is also good and credible in the film. Christian Bale steals the film as Ken Miles a car and racing enthusiast, who looks with critical eyes at how others treat their cars or drive their racing. He knows how to share his critical opinion in comical ways with the other characters in the film. For this role he deserves to be nominated for various film prizes such as an Oscar. Matt Damon also does good acting as a car designer and later as the boss of a racing crew, trying to keep both the rebellious driver and the strict Ford board members happy. For this, he must choose one of the two, which often leads to conflicts. Although the two sometimes go against each other, they still have good chemistry thanks to their shared passion for cars and racing. The rest of the cast such as Josh Lucas, John Bernthal and Ray McKinnon also provide appropriate acting as members of the race crew or corporate management."

Balfe played a minor role, but her outburst in the car felt like it was shoved in to provide some character development. McKinnon was absolute perfection, like they just borrowed him from a real pit crew. The story doesn't pull you in. There aren't big dramatic moments that mattered to me. Instead, the acting and dialogue were enough to pull me in and enjoy the flow of the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Ford Motor Company is said to be masters in taking up challenges. In its giant plant, Willow Plant with its one-mile-long assembling line, the company managed to produce B-24 Liberator bombers at the rate of one plane per hour. This was their contribution to the World War 2 efforts to liberate the American soil and their European cousins from tyranny. The company established a reputation for themselves as \"the arsenal of democracy\" by transforming their production lines to make aeroplanes, tanks and trucks for the armies that defeated Adolf Hitler. They were a pioneer of sorts as women worked in the assembly line and were paid equal wages with men. It, wittingly or unwittingly, to also become \"the arsenal of fascism.\" for its substantial business deals in Nazi Germany. But that is another story for another time.\n\nBy the end of WW2, Henry Ford's grandson, Henry Ford II had taken over Ford Motors. He adopted an aggressive business style. When his bid to buy over Ferrari met a dead end, he went ballistic. He made his personal mission to show his dominance in the motor industry.\n\nIn the early sixties, Ferrari was overrunning the racing tracks. For six years, back to back, from 1960 to 1965, it won the Le Mans 24 hours endurance race.\n\nFord II, through his agents, went on a headhunt to recruit the best racers to beat Ferrari in Le Mans and show them who the boss was. That is where this film fits in. It narrates the story of two American racers - Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby- in a dramatic twist which saw Ford Motor Company finish the Le Man Race in a podium finish.\n\nThis film is not just a run-of-mill offering that depicts the expected David vs Goliath scenario where David comes out tops despite all the disadvantages, and everybody is happy. It offers much more than that. The characters are rich. The chemistry between Miles, a war veteran British \u00e9migr\u00e9 who is a lowly mechanic because of his short fuse, and Shelby, a sports car salesman who himself was a race winner, is phenomenal.\n\nWhat makes it more interesting is the controversy surrounding the final outcome of the race and the mystery surrounding Miles' crash during practice at the end of the film.\n\nThey say jealousy and greed are unfavourable traits. Clearly, this is not always the case. Many innovative inventions and groundbreaking feats have been achieved through our rapacious desire to dominate and tower over our fellow brothers."

I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it.

Fine performances all around and solid pacing sell this point of view while making sure it never overwhelms the movie and becomes preachy.

I think if someone believes in something enough, they will do what needs to done to achieve that goal. Even the impossible.\n\nKen is a mechanic that knows the logistics of the motor and how to win a race mostly because he is willing to bend the rules. An odd ball genius. He is introduced in this film as someone who will beat his hood with a wrench to make the engine fit. He is someone who sees through the conventional wisdom and sets his eyes to the limits to push boundaries. Someone willing to do anything to win. A high risk in the eyes of Ford Motors corporate suits.\n\n\"If this was a beauty pageant, we just lost.\"\n\nLooks aren't everything. But at a time America began setting the standard in the free world, there was an emphasis placed on ethics and presentation. The staple for American conservatism and the veneer for the American hypocrisy, which was always validated by high earnings. Due to the assembly line, American manufacturing has always fared well in earnings from mass production. But what if we reduce the number to one. One car. One day. One race where even One loose bolt can close your One Chance at winning. With the One driver who can win, what is the One obstacle that can get in the way. Themselves.\n\nThe man who has stretched boundaries, maybe even the laws of physics to win every race, will be asked to reach one more time in the most important one.\n\nI can't say enough about this film. The acting is spot on. The director places sporadic dry humor alongside tense moments. Absolute Winner."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Le Mans '66 (2019)', known simply as 'Ford V Ferrari' in America, is a sports biopic that aims to tell the story of the two men who forged Ford's first racing car. While it initially seems as though it's going to get lost in the corporate politics of car manufacturing, it soon becomes clear that it's far more concerned with its two leads and their strained-but-loving dynamic. By doing this, it skirts the usual biopic issue of cramming a hundred-and-one life events into a two-hour run-time whether they're really relevant or not. Basically, it crafts a compelling narrative from its 'real life' story, adapting things in a very satisfying way. The lead performances are up there with the best of the year, a chalk-and-cheese duo who light up the screen whenever they're on it. Bale, especially, is fantastic, sporting an accent and a slimmer frame in his typical chameleon way. Another star is director Mangold, whose assured direction makes for an engaging experience both on and off the race-track. The racing scenes are the thing's highlight, though; they're fast, suspenseful and technically sound. The piece manages to get you invested in the inner workings of such driving, and such cars, even if you've never given it a thought before. This allows everyone to be on the same page for the stunning finale, which is certainly an edge-or-your-seat sequence. The affair makes a point to take a step back now and again, slowing down for often overlooked character moments and rumination on the hidden beauty of racing. Indeed, it feels like a car fan's dream, dipping into the intricacies of bespoke car manufacturing while featuring a bevy of sleek vehicles, to boot. It isn't exclusively for this crowd, however. The story is resonant and the characters are well-rounded. It is a bit straight white male centric, having only one female character and relegating any people of colour to background roles. It feels old-fashioned in that sense, like a film from the period in which it's set. While better representation would be appreciated, its absence doesn't feel like a product of malice so much as an attempt to convey some sort of 'period realism'. Its plot does feel rather 'us v them', primarily because it associates Ford with America and Ferrari with Italy. Ford, the man, even seems to have a racial motivation, although this could be an unintended result of an early xenophobic comment. Really, though, the decision to position a massive corporation as an underdog is simply to fuel better drama. Still, these are pretty much the picture's only major flaws. It's a good movie that fans of its focal sport should get even more out of than I do. 7/10"

Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.\n\nMatt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.\n\nThe movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.\n\nThings about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.\n\nI can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "The history of the creation of the Ford GT40 is no different from thousands of similar histories that have happened in the past and are happening now. Unfortunately, nothing special. Wikipedia gives only 539 words of dry text about it. No dramaturgy. Then how can one produce a 2.5 hour movie based on such material? What it needs is...\n\n\"Man who comes to my office with an idea, that man keeps his job. Rest of you, second best losers, stay home. You don't belong in Ford.\"\n\nWhile watching the movie, my brain gorged on serotonin and dopamine. Cars, races, fierce struggle - just like in The Fast and the Furious. However, Ford v Ferrari is not about that at all. And after watching, having eaten potent drugs, my brain began to signal an obvious discrepancy. Whom the main characters were supposed to defeat in the fierce struggle, follows even from the name...\n\nStop! Now, who did Ken and Shelby fight throughout the movie? Italians from Ferrari? Or maybe unsolvable technical problems? Who constantly put spokes in their wheels? Through the mouth of Ken, the authors give a direct answer:\n\n\"And they're gonna work out new ways to screw you. Why? Because they can't help it. Because they just want to please their boss, he wants to please his boss who wants to please his boss. And they hate themselves for it. But deep down... Who they hate even more are guys like you, because you're not like them, because you don't think like them, because you're different.\"\n\nNaturally, to complete the picture, the authors, through the mouth of Shelby, give a description of those \"different ones\": \"But there are a few people who find something they have to do. Something obsesses'em. Something that if they can't do it, it's gonna drive'em clean out of their mind. I'm that guy.\"\n\nThat's it - the Idea! Raise the intensity of the struggle, add spice to the 539 words of dry text. The on-screen Leo Beebe, with all his intrigues against Ken and Shelby, is a character entirely invented by the authors. The only thing associating him to the real Leo Beebe is the name.\n\nThe war of talents: a knife in the back or a wrench in the forehead\n\nA well-known \"fan\" of Leo Beebe said: \"I felt in them what I called to myself \"sham good nature\", distrust and cruelty hidden under the guise of courtesy. Typical behavior of bureaucrats: they smile in your face, but they will not miss an opportunity to stab you in the back. And in the movie, we can see a knife sticking out of Ken's back. Twice.\n\nThe first blow was the DQ from the race. The second was the theft of victory. That would break anyone. Not Ken. After all, his goal is not a medal or the roar of an admiring crowd. He only needs one phrase from a tramp like himself (Shelby). One hat removed from a rival like himself (Enzo). Why, what he really needed was just another lap! But \"the perfect lap\" Ken had talked about to his son. He had nothing more to dream of. And no power could take it away...\n\nThe wrench thrown by Ken at Shelby is also for a reason in the movie. A burst of rage? Tantrum? A quiet storm released? Yes! It's all about them, about the \"different ones\". They even fought each other!\n\nTwo types of talents are pursuing completely different goals, living on different planets. And they even fight in different ways: some calmly wield a carefully sharpened knife and attack according to a carefully developed scheme, as a rule, from behind. Others rush into a frontal attack with whatever comes to hand.\n\nThat's Ken Miles as he is, with all his unbroken, rebellious spirit of a warrior - in one rashly thrown wrench. That's why Shelby has kept that wrench.\n\nAnd it was precisely what made Shelby stay restless after the death of Ken. For six months. Only by passing a particle of this Spirit to Ken's son, he found peace of mind ...\n\nAccess to the body. Information as a weapon\n\nThe episode of the visit of Henry Ford II to Shelby's is based on the funny \"kidnapping\" of the CEO. Thus, with humor, the authors have included in the plot a task from real corporate life, which is not mentioned in any management textbooks. Many of us tried to get \"access to the body\", but hardly anyone went as far as kidnapping the CEO. And all for the sake of fulfilling their direct duties.\n\nThe duty of any leader is to inform superiors and subordinates. But there is not a word in the textbooks of what can be done with information: blocking dosing embellishing downplaying and exaggerating redirecting distortig inventing and throwing in leveling hiding behind something more important and loud holding and releasing at the wrong time dishing up in different forms harbor like a grudge etc. Etc. Etc.. In general, information can and should be managed. But future managers are not taught this art in any way.\n\nThis lapse is aggravated by the fact that in real corporate life there are always talents who master it to perfection. There is a Leo Beebe in every organization in the world, but we \"don't know\" about it, because in management textbooks there is not a word about dividing people into types (see above). And not a word about the ongoing war between these types.\n\nAnd no one warns that any leader, sooner or later, has to pick a side in this war. That is, sooner or later he will be forced to give an answer to one question. The question the authors of the film, through Shelby, ask at the very beginning: \"Who are you?\"\n\nComfort as a goal. Power and influence as a tool for implementation.\n\nThe fact that the authors have formulated Leo Beebe's goal is of fundamental importance. After all, only if the goals of management coincide with those of the company, one can talk of the success of the latter. And yes, it happens: people hired to achieve the company goals, often formulating these goals themselves, actually implement something completely different:\n\n\"There's gotta be a sense of give-and-take between you and... you know.\" \"No, I don't.\" \"The group.\" \"The group?\" \"Senior creative, Carroll. Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.\" \"Well, I'm confused, Lee. 'Cause up until this moment right now I was comfortable.\"\n\nIt turns out that Leo Beebe is not alone, he is just a member of a \"group\" (informal organization). The goal of the \"group\" and all its members is comfort, a comfortable stay in their chairs. Does anyone know of a company with a goal like that? But the \"group\" is not sitting idly by. It is taking all proper steps to achieve its goal. As in the above dialog.\n\nHence the informal links permeating the entire body of the company and reshaping its organizational structure. Hence the real distribution of power and influence in the company, breaking its formal hierarchy. Simple questions: who was really running the on-screen Ford Company? Who really possessed all the power and unlimited influence? Was it Henry Ford II or Leo Beebe with the \"group\"?\n\nJust take another look at the way that always smiling, sweet, good-natured Leo Beebe holds Lee accountable: \"Have you talked to him?\"!\n\nThis phrase can be placed in another movie masterpiece - The Godfather. And no one will notice the fraud! How did it happen that the marketing director of the largest US corporation turned out to be an errand boy?! Why was Lee ordered to talk to Shelby? Why didn't Lee refuse? Didn't he frankly sympathize with Shelby and Ken throughout the film!\n\nThe answer is obvious: Lee was afraid that the next morning they would find his \"body with a knife sticking out of the back.\" Think it's my fantasy? An extrapolation of the filmmakers' fantasy? Think these \"fantasies\" are far from reality?\n\nLet me remind you the evening of September 16, 1985. News agencies reported a terrible discovery: \"a body with a knife sticking out of the back\" was found near the Apple boardroom. It was Steve Jobs. Or have you forgotten the way the American Icon got kicked out of his own company? Forgotten the way someone stole twelve years from the infinitely short time allotted to Steve?!\n\n*** It's not just the film's double bottom that's amazing. It is amazing how much information the authors have managed to hide there! It is impossible to cover this scope in one review. However, I am sure that any competent business school teacher or consultant, having analyzed this film piece by piece (and it consists entirely of such pieces!), in a day or two will tell much more about real management in real corporate life than is written in all management textbooks!\n\nThe smugglers\n\nToday, you can hardly surprise anyone with smuggling of all kinds of things. It's quite another pair of shoes with smuggling of thoughts. I mean those who are able to elegantly and imperceptibly put their thoughts right into your head, while talking about something completely different. Then, while putting things in order in your \"attic\" after some time, you suddenly discover someone's thought. It's like with a surprise hidden away by one of the departed guests. A box of chocolates or a postcard - just a trifle! Still, it makes your face break into a smile.\n\nAnd I keep smiling each tie I remember the way I was caught with chaff the first time I watched it. You have failed to notice anything too? Take it easy!\n\nEven the 10 000+ experienced people working in cinema have failed to notice anything. The Oscars awarded for best film editing and sound editing is a confirmation. After all, these are the only things lying on the surface. And these are the only things the \"customs officers\" have seen and heard. Everything else, as befits real smuggling, has gone unnoticed. ...\n\nPerhaps someone would think I question the competence and impartiality of AMPAS. But suppose I just want to emphasize once again the talent of the smugglers. Well, that is for everyone to decide for himself...\n\nTouch of Eternity\n\nYoutube is flooded with videos where someone puts a girl into a charged car and hits the gas.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.\n\nAs someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.\n\nThere were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.\n\nFord v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way."

The pacing of the movie is good, the story telling is done right and the dialogues are well written. Despite the fact that it is a bit long at 2.5 hours you don't get tired or bored as time literally flies by. In addition, the cast is amazing and I am not referring only to the star names, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, but also to the lesser known Tracy Letts and Josh Lucas. Especially Josh Lucas nails it here, something he hasn't done in my opinion after Beautiful Mind so many years ago. To be honest, and I might sound like an heretic here, I found Christian's Bale performance good but a bit over the top, but maybe that's just me. All in all a really good movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The challenge of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which gets reduced to an unparsimonious Two Hours and 32 Minutes of Le Movie, is that you have to go fast, really fast, as fast as you can and for 24 hours on an uneven, treacherous track, sometimes at night, sometimes in the rain, all while not destroying the automobile itself, and also not the drivers. Occasionally, you become One with Le Car, somewhere right around 7,000rpm, and you either ascend into pure energy, or you blow a rod shifting into a bonus gear.\n\nThere are a few chances for Ford v Ferrari to be a more socially meaningful film, maybe more openings for more clever statements about the stuffiness of businessmen and suited executives versus the life-loving, individualistic visionaries who make the businessmen jealous because they do not have the creativity or talent to do much beyond monetizing other people's excellences. On the other hand, the movie does a good job of instilling the adrenaline rush of setting new lap records, none of which feels very safe.\n\nIf we all were to make a list of stuff to do for exactly 24 hours, speed racing is not likely to appear on many of our lists. Thankfully, most activities can be achieved in under three hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't see this movie when it first came out. I wasn't terribly interested in another movie about motorcar racing, and the men, their faces half-masked, shifting gears while the foley artists went through their collections of sounds for variations on \"vroom.\" One of these days, I figured, it would be on TV for free, and that would be soon enough. That happened today and I discovered a smart, well-acted movie about friendship, passion, nirvana, and inexplicable corporate malice as personified by Josh Lucas. No, he isn't inexplicable. He just lacks any interest or ability to do with cars, but he is a fine corporate toad who knows how to play office politics better than anyone else.\n\nContrast him with Lee Iacocca, played by Jon Bernthal, looking like Fred Ward. He's an engineer, he sees what's going on, and his understanding and admiration are apparent. But the heart of the movie is the contentious friendship of Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they try to build and race the perfect car, a shared passion, despite the idiocy of executives who have as little understanding of what makes a car run as a dog with its head sticking out the window.\n\nThere are a goodly number of shots of men shifting gears while the foley artists play ''vroom' from their libraries. It's a great movie nonetheless, because of the story about human beings."

        "review_detailed_main": "Typically if you show me a decent trailer involving actors of the calibre of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I will be at least interested in seeing more. Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing's core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans '66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the \"God-driven, hard-working\" Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.\n\nCarroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.\n\nThis is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari's orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn't it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that \"only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race\", and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.\n\nThe driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn't really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn't focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be \"visualising\" his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.\n\nI wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just got out of Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari)\n\nI'll admit, right off, I do not like racing movies for two reasons 1, I have no interest in motor racing and 2, the movies always have the same problem, boredom (the cars go round and round) and predictability (the hero wins) but i'd heard good things about this one and it's James Mangold (Copland, Logan, Walk The Line) so I went to see it.\n\nFirst off, it is not really about the company of Ford versus the company of Ferrari, maybe that's why it is called Le Mans '66 in the UK. Carol Shelby (Damon) is hired to create a car to win Le Mans '66 by Ford, he insists on having Ken Miles (Bale) help him and be the driver. The suits at Ford do not want Miles driving and attempt to drop or undermine him every chance they get, as Shelby and Mild try to design said car in 90 days en route to Le Man's '66. So really it's Shelby & Miles versus the suits of Ford, whilst Ford wants to beat Ferrari.\n\nI loved the performances, Bale and Damon are both great, Bale just steals every scene, he is the heart of the movie, you root for him, he is the underdog, because Ford don't want him as the face of the company!! You never root for Ford, truthfully, I never cared about the Ford V Ferrari thing at all. I just wanted Bale and Damon to succeed. Despite being nasty to the Americans at the beginning, at least Enzo Ferrari cared about what he was doing and the sport of motor racing and he had some honour. Henry Ford didn't care about the car or the sport. He just wanted to turn around decking sales and was mad at Ferrari over an insult.\n\nI think I enjoyed it so much as it didn't really focus on the racing aspect, if you are expecting a racing movie, you will be disappointed. It focused more on the making of the car and the various relationships. You don't need to know about racing to enjoy this movie, it's about the characters.\n\nEveryone knocks it out of the park!! Not just the main actors the supporting actors too, Josh Lucas is in this and of course he is a d*ck, isn't he always!! I mean I really hated him, I couldn't wait to see him get knocked out!! Ray McKinnon is great too, every time he was on screen, I was trying to place him, an IMDB search reveals he was Bradley in A Perfect World.\n\nIf I had one complaint, and it's only minor it's Jon Bernthal, he is great, it is his idea for Ford to enter the world of racing, he chose and is Damon's biggest supporter and then he just disappears or is relegated to the background or if he is in shot not speaking , he is an important part of the first half of the movie then he doesn't speak for the second!!\n\nTop 5 movie of the year for me."

I personal do not think so - i think it is a must watch for all who love great and involving cinema. I do not like car sports personally, but when i see movies like \"Rush\" or now \"Ford v Ferrari\" i kinda wish would like it more.\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" is a great movie. It is superbly directed, write, acted, edited and crafted from start till finish. Running time 2 h 30 min ran like a wind because this movie was amazingly involving and paced. I did not know this story, therefore for me everything here was a surprise (story wise), but even more i was surprised after i realized that this might have been the best movie that director James Mangold has ever done, and i loved his \"Logan\".\n\nOverall, whether you like car sport or not, this movie is for everyone. It is stupendously involving from start till finish. Definitely one of the best movies of the year."

His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.\n\nFord v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.\n\nThis movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.\n\nThe acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.\n\nThe film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.\n\nI have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind. Hats off to everyone who worked on the movie as they gave it their all."

Unable to take this lightly and vowing revenge, Ford II decides to use his considerable resources to defeat Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race. And a legend was born. \"Ford v Ferrari\" is the highly watchable cinematic depiction of the greatest rivalry in car racing history. Matt Damon portrays the calm and collected car designer Carroll Shelby who oversees the operation to win the race for Ford at Le Mans. Christian Bale plays the cocky and outspoken race car driver Ken Miles whose challenging personality stood out as much as his skill in driving. Together their tense relationship forms the heart of the story as their interaction covers the range of combative to genuine friendship as they make auto racing history. Of course, there's the races, where the high speed rush of the best cars of their time try to outspeed each other in fully charged blasts zooming to the finish line. One of the most notable bioflicks and a highlight in a year that has proven to be one of the best in cinema history, this is one that will turn out to be a fave among many fans of the silver screen."

The only reason this movie ranks reasonably well for me and not bottom of the barrel is the fact that I like biopics like this one. Even though I can predict every single beat before it happens, I enjoy the ride. It makes me smile at the right moments, and makes me sad at the right moments. I will note that it never once made me cry, though. I think I could see the strings being pulled a bit too clearly, so the movie became a somewhat mechanical experience and not one that impacted me with any deep emotions. The cast were all solid in their roles, there were moments that made me chuckle, and I do feel like I learned a bit more about this particular race than I originally knew. Ford v Ferrari is a movie that is perfectly acceptable, but never more than that. Perhaps, I've reached that cynical older age where the Hollywood machine can't churn out a movie that tells history in a way that feels \"real\" to me, because I've seen so many others do it the same way before. Inevitably I find myself thinking, \"Maybe this would be better as a documentary.\""

The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.\n\nWhen the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.\n\nComing to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.\n\nWhat makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all."

The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a \"downer\" or more \"thought-provoking\" than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point. In all, Mangold has another win on his hands with one of the best films of the year. Here's hoping it's honored during awards season!\n\n8.9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "You can't but help but root for Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles ... they're kind of the real racing die-hards being used like pawns by Ford management of the time. The movie leads up to the dramatic 1966 24-hour endurance racing event in Le Mans, France.\n\nWhat a great story! It brings together luminaries of the time like Enzo Ferrari, Henry Ford and Carroll Shelby in a fascinating true historical event. We also learn of a name that should be honored in like, namely Ken Miles. The movie has great characters, action, suspense and an amazing ending.\n\nFor me, one of the coolest scenes in the movie is when Henry Ford II takes a ride with Shelby in the GT race car. He is overwhelmed with awe of what cars have become since his grandfather's time. The GT is no model-T.\n\nThe 2.5 hour run time breezes and it's hard not to be glued to the screen the whole time. The movie's a winner in my book."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.\n\nThis gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.\n\nThe actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.\n\nThe story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.\n\nIn the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre."

You don't need to be all about facts, but please, don't think of the audience as complete idiots when it comes to driving race cars fast. Also, what's with the cheap looking CGI and sped up driving clips in a movie of this caliber?\n\nSuch a greatly missed opportunity. The story would have been great without all the extra drama added, and the great actors and their great performances were shot down with second grade technical performance in the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Peacefully gazing into the dusk sky, racer savant Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, lies on the race track next to his son Peter, played by innocently radiant Noah Jupe. Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: \"Everything slows down\". Ken says introspectively, \"You see everything.\" That's the freedom and joy of doing what you love.\n\nDirector James Mangold's \"Ford v Ferrari\" tells the story of Ford Motor Company's challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll's volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.\n\nCarroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he's the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don't appreciate his art, his love.\n\nIn the movie's opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He's in the zone. His epiphany, \"The only question that really matters: Who are you?\" As much as \"Ford v Ferrari\" is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.\n\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James's \"Ford V Ferrari\", 'racing' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances. They're both Oscar worthy.\n\nAt the 'dog and pony show' for Ford's unveiling of their Mustang car, Matt's Carroll accepts Ford's job to engineer a car to win at Le Mans. Charismatic Matt recalls the wisdom of Carroll's Father, who advised to do what you love, then \"it's no longer a job\". Matt poignantly says, \"Find what you have to do...\" Amen.\n\nCarroll sees the best in Christian's Ken. Ken is the 45 year-old World War II Hero, who's broke, and running his own automotive repair shop. His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.\n\nAlthough, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he's the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.\n\nPredictably, Leo's egomania tests Carroll's loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.\n\nPhedon Papmichael's cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian's visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.\n\nMy favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian's Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That's \"the perfect lap\". Peter asks, what if you can't race \"the perfect lap\". Ken smiles, \"You keep trying.\" Because that's what you do for what you love. That's what makes \"Ford v Ferrari\" so very special too."

Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.\n\nThe movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.\n\nThe film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic."

        "review_detailed_main": "The stage curtains open ...\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" is exactly the movie it is billed to be. Movie magic that is a blast from the past with excellent performances by the entire cast. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. Sometimes, when you watch a preview, you can tell that you've just seen all the best parts of the movie. Not so with this one. It delivers.\n\nThe biopic starts with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) receiving the bad news that he can no longer race since it would put too much strain on his heart and steer him to an early grave. So, he pairs up with race car driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and together they form a friendship while remaining on the racing circuit and designing cars. When Ford Motors sales begin to plummet, Henry Ford II turns to Lee Iacocca for advice. Iacocca recommends that they purchase the now bankrupt Ferarri company. This plan is turned down by Enzo Ferarri who agrees to sell to Fiat instead. Enter Shelby and Miles as they team up with Ford to design a car that will put Ford back on the map by winning the famed Le Manz, a 24-hour endurance race.\n\nI absolutely love this movie. It really is why we go to the theaters. The production values were second to none, the cinematography engaging, the racing stunts eye popping, the acting believable and the story involving. The only reason it doesn't get a full 10 stars from me is because it does run a little long. But, even so, you are so invested into the film, it goes by at a very good pace.\n\nI highly recommend \"Ford v Ferarri\". I have plans to go see it at least one more time before it leaves the big screen. We're heading into December now, but it is easily one of my favorite films of the year. If you love a good story with enough action to keep you smiling, this is a great one for you. 9 stars out of 10."

The cinema that I attended had the seats arranged in groups of four. Imagine a roller coaster simulated in a movie theater. The seats also let you feel the rumble of the car engines and lights in the auditorium add the finishing touches such as sparks.\n\nFord v Ferrari is a movie about the Le Mans, France 24 hour race that pitted the Ford Motor company vs. the all-time winner Ferrari. More than that, it is about the friendship between American car engineer Carroll Shelby and the unsung hero English car racer Ken Miles.\n\nHave you ever wanted to experience what it's like to be in the pilot's seat of a race car? This is the perfect film to test drive the 4DX system at a theater near you. I recommend it."

Sometimes it's just some drama filler to build up for what we are waiting for: the Le Mans race.\n\nNothing to say on the events credibility because I'm not familiar with the real facts, and that doesn't bother me as well. It's supposed to be someone's take on the story, and that's ok by me!\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it if you like racing and drama combined."

Christian Bale doesn't seem to have gotten into his character at all and Matt Damon doesn't even really look like he's acting, just putting on an accent.

Apart from that, it's cozily predictable (compulsory oft-repeated family melodrama and all), whether you know the history or not, but mercifully not in an enraging way like most movies of this type. A passable companion piece to Ron Howard's 'Rush'. I give it 5.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.\n\nWho are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.\n\nMatt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.\n\nCo-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as \"a Ford man\", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.\n\nThe film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.\n\nAdditional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.\n\nThere is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through."

Matt Damon is amazing, Christian Bale is pretty great, and everyone else is just average, which is disappointing considering the notable cast. The child acting wasn't all that good.\n\nThe writing is pretty unspecial and average. It takes the classic American underdog trope and does pretty much nothing original with it. There's almost nothing to say on this subject because of how little substance the writing has.\n\nThe editing was alright but nothing special. The shot composition was alright but nothing special. The soundtrack... I've already forgotten everything about it, only a day after it came out.

I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.\n\nThe screenplay was very disappointing, however.\n\nThe racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.\n\nThere's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.\n\nThe film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.\n\nThe only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.\n\nOverall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film."

Christian Bale and Matt Damon both give incredible performances and they have perfect chemistry, although Christian Bale does steal every scene he is in. Jon Bernthal and Tracy Letts are both great. The pacing is incredible as it does not feel as long as it is. The music by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is amazing. James Mangold's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed, resulting in genuinely thrilling racing sequences throughout. It's also surprisingly very funny in certain parts and emotional in others."

Even then, the performances from Bale and Damon are so good that they make even the rockiest parts of movie watchable.\n\nThe third act is so much fun it mostly makes up for many problems I might have had with the build-up.\n\nIt feels like the movie is a big allegory for movie studio interference and how it can prevent greatness. I like that, even if even comes with the cost of makong the Ford and Ferrari execs feel like cartoon villains, but then again, old-fashioned Hollywood movie.\n\nThis was a lot fun."

This movie had all of the elements of a big Hollywood blockbuster: a noble goal, two attractive protagonists fighting against the odds, an evil power-broker, and a wrench. The wrench part only makes sense if you've seen the movie, although I wouldn't classify this as a spoiler.\n\nIt's based on a true story, but there probably isn't any more history to back this up than there was for the Star Wars movies, but we get it. As facile and clich\u00e9 as this was at times, there were some great performances and just enough solid drama and humor to pull it off. Like so many films these days, I thought it was a bit long at 2 hours and 32 minutes, but it wasn't intolerable."

The cars also look very authentic and the racing shots really do make you feel in the enviroment. The deliviries are always on point and really hits the spot. It feels very authentic and different to other Hollywood racing films. The vibe is just immaculate and so well rounded. I did take one point off for some history inaccuracies but they don't take away anything from the watch. Must watch!"

I never could understand the appeal of car crash scenes that viewers have seen a thousand times before. The rivalries -- between the US and Italy, the corporate goons and the free spirits, the free spirits and the race officials -- are written in the ham-handed, \"we have no respect for the audience so we'll shove it down their throats\" way you'd expect. Ninety minutes might have worked but it just gets tiresome."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here's my review of Ford v Ferrari . So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement."

        "review_detailed_main": "An easy watch that reminds me Hollywood can pass on a little truth and pride. Altogether well oriented- Exemplifying dignity and morals by separating the heart driven characters versus the selfish/uptight moneymen.... & also showing that PG13 is a high standard in cinematic storytelling (Mangold must have a heart of gold).\n\nMatt Damon & Christian Bale had the love in their eyes as they played their roles with such grace."

        "review_detailed_main": "My dad grew up watching and listening on the radio about Fords attempt to beat Ferrari and he would share these stories with me growing up. So this movie was a huge deal to me. The movie does a great job how much it meant for America to beat the unbeatable Ferarri but also how snobby of a person Ford the 2nd was to his employees. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's chemistry was the best part of the film in my opinion. Bale stands out the most playing the crazy driver who got the GT40 to 220mph! I highly recomend this movie if you're a car lover, or even a history lover. Great work!"

I don't think Ford v Ferrari is a bad or terrible movie, but I don't know, the story was kinda meh and everything felt like taking super long like they would try to fill up the movie with scenes just to make it longer. I even fell asleep once during the movie.\n\nActing-wise I can't say anything bad, the performance was awesome as always, I also didn't expect anything else from Matt Damon and Christian Bale :) .\n\nI also do not advice against watching Ford v Ferrari, I guess it is just me I am not a huge fan of cars, I actually just watched the movie because of Matt Damon and Christian Bale."

The story, the visuals, the acting..oh Mr. Bale you have to get nominated again and throw one in for Mr. Damon too because their onscreen chemistry was electrifying and super fun. Coming from a female who has no interest in racing cars, this was a joyride in itself, watching the cars go around the track, the speed, the adrenal and Mr. Bale's facial expressions while driving was truly a delight to witness. Thanks for the great ride guys. Loved every moment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I doubt auto racing can be made to be any more engaging to me than in this, which is to say I'm not fascinated by men in sports cars driving around in circles, but \"Ford v Ferrari\" is a ripsnorting ride. Despite its two-and-a-half-hours runtime, it's never dull, and the whiplash cutting and vroom-vroom sounds are wholly deserving of their Oscars. Casting two of the most likable actors around, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both of who try on different accents, in the leads helps, too. The title, \"Ford v Ferrari,\" winds up being rather misleading, though, as the picture shifts gears more along the lines of Ford suites v Ford gearheads. That at one turn, Henry Ford II frightfully weeps as a passenger in a race car suggests where the movie's sympathies rest in that competition. The pissing competition between two bosses of car manufacturers takes a backseat to this inter-corporate one-upmanship and even that is of less interest than chasing the adrenaline junkies speeding around corners and risking death for glory. Rather simplistic for a Best Picture Oscar nominee, although not for its technically splendid production, but it's undeniably popularly entertaining."
