But that's only when the director can create a new modern twist or add more to what the original didn't have like what Zombie did for Carpenter's Halloween. But the remake of Eli Roth's Cabin Fever is just one of the most pointless horror remakes I've ever seen next to Psycho. The story of the movie is lame. It's everything you seen in the original just with different actors in these scenes. You actually know what's coming next. You even know what the characters are gonna say next. There's nothing new added in the directors own vision. It's the same Dog death opening scene. The scene where one of the characters gets his hand attacked by Dennis is the same. Even the camp fire story is the same. The only difference is the ending of the movie, which is not half bad. The characters are very unimportant to this movie or at least they felt like it. You don't pay even a minute of attention to them because, well they are supposed to be the same as well and they make the same dumb choices of survival as the original. The blood n gore effects seem to be up higher than the original. But it might it some gore lovers we do see a lot more blood all around in some scenes especially in the bath tub scene we see even some skin coming off.\n\nI didn't enjoy this remake at all it's nothing, but watching the same movie you already seen. You know what's coming next. The characters die in the sane order as they did in the original. The only differences you'll find is the ending, higher blood n gore, and different actors who shouldn't be allowed to ever act in another movie again. I don't recommend you watch this waste of a remake. You'll have a much more better time re watching the original movie."

The gore scenes are somewhat improved, a little more dramatic, and the dog scene is more dramatic.\n\nI have so very little to say here, as I didn't enjoy it all that much, it seems only a few years ago that I went to the Cinema to watch the original, I find it more disappointing that new ideas simply aren't there, there surely has to be a vast undiscovered writing talent out there.\n\nmehh, 3/10"

Had it been Evil Dead-remake caliber, we would have been in for something special. But everything from the acting to the gore has taken a considerable hit with this remake as to effectively make it Cabin Fever-lite. This movie doesn't even try to be original in its retelling of the film, as the same basic set-up (and even some of the dialogue) has been reused and recycled to ill-effect. Worst part of it all? Save for a few of the actors, the performances were atrocious. Honesty, I have seen found-footage films with better acting than what some of these no-talents pulled off. The movie was limited in its vision, and toning down the gore does a disservice to everything that was good about the original film. It's just basic in almost every way, and really is a waste of resources. If you didn't believe Eli Roth was a hack before, you certainly will after watching this mess. Not recommended, even if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cabin Fever is just another one of those movies where studio executives thought, \"Hey, the original was good so why not milk the f*ck out of the name and release heaps of garbage, call them sequels, and the money will come.\" Now this reboot comes along with the exact same script as the original so I figure the execs were just like, \"F*ck it, why even try?\" And it shows. The good news is that this isn't a theatrical release - it's limited on-demand or something so thankfully a majority of people won't be aware of this abomination's existence. But for those who are, let me affirm your suspicions: this movie blows.\n\nFirst off, none of these people should be allowed to act ever again. I hesitate to call them actors because I saw no semblance of acting on screen. The characters are unlikable and annoying, which is weird because I don't remember hating them in the original. I didn't care if any of them died; in fact I wanted them all to die so the movie would end as quickly as possible. It literally goes down the horror movie clich\u00e9 checklist. The cabin in the woods schtick, clueless college kids, creepy guy at a gas station, perfunctory sex scenes, loud sound effects to make you jump, etc. Hell, even the gore is lame. Patient Zero had better gore effects.\n\nPlease don't watch this movie. It makes Patient Zero look like The Dark Knight. Watch the original if you want, or literally any other Eli Roth movie. I don't blame Roth for this mess because I'm pretty sure he just signed off on it, made some green and never thought about it again. It doesn't even have his signature silly style. It tries to take itself seriously and it fails miserably. Then they shoehorn in some jokes that aren't funny at all, and you laugh at how horribly they were delivered, and then you'll contemplate what you're doing with your life. It's a chore to watch, seriously.\n\nCabin Fever is just another byproduct of the horror remake craze. Avoid at all costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not a shot-for-shot remake (the angles and cinematography are different), this remake uses the same script as the 2002 original with slight alterations. Despite this seemingly pointless exercise, I was prepared to give it a chance and not hate it for failing to aspire to anything original. I'll go on the record saying I -wanted- to like this film, despite some unease after watching the trailer. I'm sad to say it fails to live up to the original in nearly every regard.\n\nWhat sets this remake apart from it's 2002 predecessor is the lack of any chemistry between the actors. It's not that any one particular actor is singularly bad, it's that none of them feel like they're in the same movie. It literally feels as if they pulled random strangers off the streets and asked them to make-believe they were friends for a weekend. I simply couldn't buy that any of them would take off for a weekend together, much less have known one another for years, as is the case for at least two of the characters. They feel like strangers and it doesn't help that all of them seem to be acting as if they're in completely different films--the disconnect is that apparent. It's upsetting that, despite having many of the same scenes and lines as their original characters, everyone in the cast feels so disconnected from the script that they utterly fail to bring any of their characters to life. They're the ghosts of what we saw in the original film, the acting completely lifeless. It's as if none of them wanted to be there.\n\nRoth's trademark humor is also excised in favor of a few random throwaway jokes, delivered in such a deadpan tone by the actors that each one falls flat on its face. This time around, the director goes for a more serious approach to the material (a mistake, I believe) and attempts to paint the film as a tragedy. Nothing attempts to sell this more than the overly-ambitious music score, which is so epic at times that it feels like it belongs in a big-scale war movie. The composer feels the need to John Williams this thing up at times, which just leaves the viewer scratching their heads at why such a big spectacle of a score is being utilized for a film that largely takes place in a single cabin.\n\nAs if to keep from being too familiar, the deaths are altered just enough to qualify as being original, as long as you don't count on being surprised. Practically everything is telegraphed a mile in advance thanks in no small part to the reliance on the original script so that even the prospect of new deaths isn't enough to warrant much excitement.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blunder is the recasting of Deputy Winston as a woman, played by an actress with zero comedic timing (although this doesn't stop her from being handed humorous dialogue). The character is a painful reminder that no one invested in this remake knows how to bring life to their character, as is true with the weed-toting camper (played by Eli Roth in the original). No one would call the acting in Cabin Fever '02 a revelation, but it's as good as gold compared to this.\n\nThe entire film is permeated with a depressing lack of passion on or off camera. It's as if no one wanted to be doing this. Roth's film, while certainly underrated by many, at least felt as if it was made by someone who cares. This is a lifeless remake on par with the new Nightmare on Elm Street. Truly a flat, emotionally barren production not even worthy of viewing as a curiosity."

This \"update\" really just \"modernizes\" the original Cabin Fever staying pretty true to the story line a some minor changes here and there... I was alright with this movie and tried to put up with it but Eli Roth has an ability to make his characters seem like the DUMBEST living sentient beings in the world. In the world of Horror movies, I understand, the people have to be lower than average intelligence and lack common sense so that the plot will progress cause instead of knocking on the door of a trailer so you can use the phone for help, the character decides to \"peek\" in through a window in stead EVEN tho all the lights are on... so the inhabitants obviously don't listen to his pleas for help cause they seem him as a sexual predator.\n\nI was kind of excited for this cause the original Cabin Fever was (IMO) a ground breaking piece of indie horror, it came out during the time when indie films were coming out of the shadows and actually gaining momentum. But this movie, I tried to stick it out, I really tried but there are levels of stupidity in this that \"cringe\" is a gross understatement. If you saw the original Cabin Fever and liked it, give this one a go! It's not entirely bad. But if you haven't seen the original first...\n\nWATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST, PLEASE!!!\n\nand Mr. Roth, please inject just a meager amount of common sense into your characters, please?"

The original Cabin Fever was a pretty bad movie but I wouldn't even recommend this film to Eli Roth fans, as it is a pretty pointless remake. Fans of the original probably should stay away.\n\nIf there was one positive thing about the original film, it was that it had that low budget charm to it. There's something about low budget horror films that I like and Cabin Fever had that. However, this remake does away with that charm as it obviously had a higher budget. A higher budget doesn't always mean a better film, though.\n\nThe acting in this remake is atrocious and the dialogue is even worse. The characters are all underdeveloped stereotypes that you really don't care about at all. Nearly all the scenes of the original are redone shot-for-shot, but they're handled in a much messier manner. There are a few minor differences, such as the \"party man\" cop character is now played by a female, for some reason.\n\nAs for positives, there aren't many. The cinematography was decent and the gore and makeup effects were pretty damn good actually. Some of the music was alright. But that's about it. I don't see why this film had to be made.\n\nOverall, this is a shallow remake of a bad, low budget horror film from 2002. If you've never seen Cabin Fever but plan on watching it, I'd go with the original, as it is the better of the two. However, that's not saying much, as they're both pretty shitty. If you are a fan of the original, you probably won't like it much. But you might watch it anyway just to compare the two. I wouldn't pay much to see it, though. Maybe rent it if you get the chance.\n\n3/10"

All of which are significantly better than this. It has been 14 years since the original Eli Roth gore-fest and some of the audiences that this is aimed at were toddlers at the time. The first one wasn't even good enough to be considered a classic even though it's better than this, and then there were the two sequels the second one better than the first and third one, let's not talk about that one. This brand spanking 2016 version had so much potential and even the Cabin Fever series isn't a talked about franchise, this film still had potential but it's just an extremely lazy remake. It would be better to watch the first one again because this one copies every word from the original script, and that's not to say it's a bad thing it's just that this one is just so bad. The film even copies every well third-base shenanigan the original one had. The thing is, is that claustrophobic horrors can actually be quite good but director Travis Z (Z for Zariwny) goes to far in trying to make this a horror (not convincingly) and not enough focusing on the claustrophobic feeling. To be fair is it supposed to give off tat feeling? Or is it just corny re-hash? People including myself would choose the second one even though the other 3 films are corny but not lazy like this is. Although this is one for the average gore fan but this is neither gory nor entertaining because even the original had gore as a feature but also it had the aspect that it was meant to be entertaining.\n\nHere are some points as to why this is the laziest horror ever made:\n\nStory: The story is probably the biggest point to take out because well there is no story or it's so bad it just feels like there isn't one. The story is a complete remake or in this case reboot because it looks like the director has just copied something that an original much better director did back in 2002. The story is in a humorous is that right to say? No it's humorless and quite frankly just cheesy and there are some really cheesy films out there all of which are better. If you like originality in a story then please this because this isn't original the director just rehashed something that's already been done and that is putting it nicely.\n\nCharacters: Another thing that the director copy and pasted because these characters although not played by the same 'actors' (again putting it nicely) they are just an exact copy as the first. They act in the same way they get infected the same way and it still has the skin peeling when you shave gimmick to it, but that is what made the first one good and well a classic although not really classic. The moral is the characters do the same thing not always a bad thing but in this case it is.\n\nSpeaking of the actors some of them would have very young when the first one came out and it's highly unlikely they even watched it, they should have done because then they wouldn't be in this. The original director intended to make this like The Evil Dead but there was one thing missing it didn't have the Indie feeling to it and yes Eli Roth is no Sam Raimi but you can see why he did it. Even the successful sequel which was disowned by Ti West not long after it came out. As this drags humorlessly towards the end there is a feeling of regret wondering why you spent so much money on a 'crappy remake' to an acclaimed classic. In fact it might be better watch the first one again and forgetting this even exists. There is a growing sense of dread it fosters has less to with the intended horror of watching you BFF's become infected by a deadly virus, than the creeping suspicion that nobody's heart is really in it.\n\nVerdict: A duff remake of the beloved original so really nothing new, Travis Z's do-over of the 2002 classic gore-fest is surely one of the laziest despite the fact it is made from virtually the same script.\n\n1/10 one to avoid forever."

This 'Cabin Fever' remake has a rating of 3.7 on IMDb which is exceedingly low, usually saved for only the most vile, terrible and unwatchable films you could imagine. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a remake? Indeed. I would go out on a limb to say over half the people who have rated the film haven't even seen it, and have simply come to the page and clicked '1' in protest of the film even being made at all.\n\nI don't believe it's fair to hate a film simply because it is a remake. Judge it on what it is and what, if anything, it adds to the original is how I look at it. I enjoyed this one. The original was Eli Roth's welcoming party to the horror genre. In his first film he already had more style, flair and class than most horror movie directors achieve at any point in their careers. The remake, admittedly working with Roth's original script, keeps a lot of that flair and adds a few nice touches of its own. A few characters are tweaked, some death scenes are changed (for the better in my opinion) and yet the core of what made the original great stays in tact.\n\nThis is quite a strange case where the original had its second sequel come out only 2 years ago and yet here we are with a reboot almost at the same time. It's no secret Hollywood is very short of ideas, and a consequence of that is we are going to see more and more reboots and sequels as the years go on. My advice is roll with the punches and see the good side of it, which is that people who would otherwise have never been familiar with the original will now become aware of its existence. Is a 'Hostel' reboot next? I won't lie, I'd actually get very excited if that was announced."

Both films have exactly the same story and this film went so far as to copy dialogues. I need to say more? It is not a remake... it is a copy, almost an act of plagiarism. The cast is also forgettable. Gage Golightly is only there to appear naked, Matthew Daddario and Samuel Davis have no presence and the rest just say their lines and die, in the bloodiest way possible, because that is what matters and what the public wants, the director thinks.\n\nThe film is very low budget and seems, to some extent, made to raise money or as a school test for some group of film students.

        "review_detailed_main": "Have absolutely nothing against remakes, or at least that is the aim. Although there are a fair share of bad ones, like 'Psycho' and 'The Wicker Man' (both of which made the criminal mistakes of being completely pointless) there are some great ones too such as 'The Fly' (which to me was an improvement over the still good original film and a great film in its own right as well, actually forgot that it was a remake which is testament to how good it was).\n\n'Cabin Fever' is among the worst of them. As well as being badly done in every way, and not in a marginally bad way but quite catastrophobic, it commits what condemns too many remakes in being completely unnecessary and having no spark at all. This is soulless cash grab level film-making level, personally do not like films without soul and made for money and nothing else. The original 'Cabin Fever' may not the most mind-blowing of classics and had its foibles, but it was at least watchable and had a likeability about it, that is not the case with this.\n\nThere is a degree of faithfulness to some of the shots that stops it from being rated zero or in the minuses, but they are not particularly stylish or inspired at the same time this time round. The music is far too loud and has no creepiness or any kind of atmosphere whatsoever, you just want it to shut up.\n\nScript-wise, there is just nothing to it. This time there is a real awkwardness and blandness to it with no flow or personality, the worst of it makes one cringe. There is nothing suspenseful or scary here and although there are scenes one recognises they just do not have the same impact here, things just happen but make no real impact and comes over as tired and repetitive. There is no momentum and the direction is the equivalent of being stuck in the mud.\n\nFound myself very irritated by the characters throughout and the actors looked like they did not want to be there and were promised something substantial to do the film (and probably didn't get).\n\nAll in all, a disaster. 1/10"

The cast was very good especially the extremely underrated RIDER STRONG was excellent & gave the best performance in the movie & made a very good lead in the same way Bruce Campbell did in evil dead when he finally took charge & became covered in blood & guts i felt the same here with Rider Strong.\n\nAnyway the pointless remake took away all those excellent elements & performances that made the 2002 movie an instant cult classic & put new boring emotionless soulless actors in place but saying the exact same dialogue as the original classic!!!! So it was weird & POINTLESS & totally terrible!!! I could only hear the original cast especially Rider Strong in my head whenever the new cast talked so it was awful!!!! One of the absolute WORST remakes of all time it can go right next the horrendous The Fog remake!!! Both pointless & completely unnecessary & terrible"

The acting was good, the photography was excellent and so too was the musical score (my home cinema speakers certainly took a pounding in places). The special affects were good...especially the rabid like dog! These days too many films made with plenty of hard work and the very best of intentions are criticised and put down....ignoring all the 'good' things about them and instead just pointing out all the bad points.. Personally I did not find 'anything' I did not like about this film. My only regret is that I did not get to see this at the Cinema....I would have very much liked that! I would like to thank 'everyone' involved in this film for making it an excellent and very polished remake. I enjoyed it from start to finish and I hope you too will give this a chance and enjoy it as much as I did...."

The cabin in the woods is more of a luxury apartment in the woods, the photography is far too bright too much of the time, the hillbilly locals and the deputy are cartoon characters, and the whole thing has as much atmosphere as an episode of Dawson's Creek, or The O. C.\n\nGood horror is more than what's shown - it's camera, lighting, and sound, creating a sense of dread, unease, even other-worldliness. This has none of that. It's got the starkness of a true-crime reconstruction show. The characterisations of the leads are paper-thin; the one death that shows any emotional weight soon descends into borderline comedy (and an after-credits scene that makes NO sense), and the whole film just leaves a feeling of 'why?'\n\nThe girls are pretty. That, in all seriousness, is the best thing I can say. 2/10."

In fact , all characters have the same names. But neither funny. Absolute crap.\n\n2.In the sex scenes, there are b**bs on offer to see. Yeah. There was less nudity in the original one as Marcy of 2002 version (Cerina Vincent) had problems with that. Marcy of 2016(Nadin Crocker) had none. She performed them.\n\n3.Ending has one less scene where in original there is a scene of hospital as Paul is inspected there in 2002. That scene is cut in 2016.\n\nOther than these 3, you can play 2002 version alongside 2016 version. Same script. Same dialogues. No difference at all.\n\nTalk about WORST SEQUELS.\n\nThis even tops Cabin Fever 2 , who I think was the shittiest I've ever seen. I'd have given it -10 ratings if IMDb allowed it!"

They force him to leave through violence, but before long the members of the group start showing signs that they too have the disease.\n\nI saw the original forever ago when it first came out and pretty much forgot about it. Going through Netflix, I saw this and decided to watch it. It was pretty close to a shot for shot copy of the first film, but I must say that the special effects were better. If you are not someone that is part of the cult that loves the original and have not seen that one for years, then this one will not disappoint you. Pretty solid horror movie here."

Different actors but with just a few minor changes from the original it's literally shot for shot, line for line the same exact movie.\n\nThere was no reason for this movie to be made. The original is no classic nor was there an audience clamoring for an updated version. It's only 14 years later. Had they changed the story in some way like the recent remake of the Evil Dead it might have at least been able to say that it was it's own story but no. This is exactly the same. Well actually not quite because compared to this one, the original is better and that's not something I'd ever thought I'd say about the 2002 version.\n\nThe actors in this are bland and honestly don't act like normal people. In one scene one of the guys brings out an assault rifle, mirroring the BB gun scene in the original movie. But this time it goes off accidentally, almost hitting one of his friends. The reaction? An almost bored, \"keep that thing away from me\" instead of the adrenaline pumping scene that this would have been in reality.\n\nAll in all, there is no reason to see this unless you just really need to see a bloodier version of the original."

The idea to make a remake of mediocre horror flicks isn't bad at all. A new director gets the chance to take a script and make a better movie than the original out of it. I mean 14 years past by and film making business is evolving. Taking a mediocre movie the chances are high that a remake will be better than the original but this reboot is almost a 1:1 copy but in a worse way. The acting was so bad that I didn't know if I should laugh or cry about it. The movie itself is packed with horror clich\u00e9s. Man I really had to pull myself together to watch this movie until the end credits. I mean some movies are so bad that they are admittedly entertaining but this one was just bad.

This is immediately followed by a nod to Donnie Darko, so I'm guessing it was intentional.

More gore, and even more stupidity, but these types of movies aren't ever going to be logical.\n\nThe characters, just cut out clones from every horror film, nothing likable about any of them, so you don't even care when they die. The script is just shocking, seriously the dialogue and the execution of it is just poor. The characters are portrayed as having at least half a brain on their shoulders at the start, but that soon disappears. I'd say the beginning is actually OK, just average though, but once it gets into the main story its just another dumb horror movie.\n\nBUT, if you take the film for what it is, its an alright watch. Just a bunch of teens dying in various gory ways (although i can tell there will be an unrated version as some scenes were obviously cut). So if you're into that sort of film, give it a rent. If you want a more intelligent horror, this isn't for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand why the 2016 remake of Eli Roth's \"Cabin Fever\" (2002) is so hated by critics and audiences. It has a 0% rating over at Rotten Tomatoes, and reviews of the movie are withering. I personally thought it was a very well made horror film; I'd rate it at least an 8 out of 10.\n\nSure, I understand the criticisms. This is definitely an unneeded remake. And the new cast here feels bland compared to the doomed vacationers in Roth's campier, weirder outing 14 years prior. (Although this isn't a shot-for-shot remake, it still proceeds mostly from his original script.)\n\nBut the new \"Cabin Fever\" is well filmed, and it's damned horrifying. Director Travis Z significantly ups the gore, violence and frightening imagery - it's not for the squeamish. It passes the litmus test for decent horror movies, because it scared me.\n\nMaybe I'm just partial to Roth's basic story concept - a terrifying new illness that jumps from person to person in an isolated location from which it's difficult to escape, turning them against one another. It's precisely the same plot driver as the one for John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982), which is among the greatest sci-fi/horror films of all time. And I suppose Roth's story could be taken as modern retelling of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" with some of the director's sadism and unique black humor injected into it via his screwball, eccentric characters. Remake or not, this is still a creative change of pace from a genre consistently overcrowded with slashers and shrieking ghosts."

There is a slight increase in gore and a slight twist on the sheriff cameo. Like the original there are some laughs and a few jump moments to go with the gory moments.\n\nI was worried the acting would be poor but to be honest I thought all the cast did a decent job with what they had.\n\nI can understand why some people may not have wanted a remake and to be honest it does seem a bit pointless if you've seen the original. However as a standalone film this really isn't that bad at all and it kept me and the wife entertained.\n\nIf you liked the original and are open minded or if you haven't seen the original then this is worth watching."

        "review_title": "Why?",
        "review_detailed_main": "I don't even want to waste my time on this horrendous collection of digital pixelation, but yet here I am on this site writing a stupid review on it. Whatever. I'm a fan of the original movie; I love the dark sense of humor it has, the high amounts of raised palms and \"wtf?\"'s thrown about while watching the movie. I love the low budget feel of it, as it gives aspiring filmmakers like myself a sense of hope, as if saying \"hey, I can do this!\" It's undeniably stupid and I completely understand why many despise it, but for morons like me, entertaining isn't a good enough word to describe it.\n\nSorry if this review is poorly written. I just simply don't care when it comes to this movie. Hey, kinda like the makers of this movie! Maybe I should be hired to write the next Cabin Fever remake.\n\nSo just 13 years after its release and not even one full year after the release of its latest sequel, some producers thought it'd be a timely idea to remake Cabin Fever. Now even though I enjoy the original, there certainly are a plethora of flaws abound, and a remake could freshen things up. Raise the budget, do some things the original couldn't, hire better actors, better filming equipment, raise the atmosphere, etc. Sadly, and actually quite shockingly, none of that is done here in even the slightest. The actors are bland and forgettable with little to zero distinguishable personalities, whereas the actors in the original looked and acted different. You had the jock, the fat one, the shy nerd, the girl next door, and the slut. Here, you have basic person 1, 2, 3, 4, and gamer nerd. The side characters also work poorly here. The original had basically every variation of redneck and it worked perfectly, while this one has some 30-year-old who looks like the director's cousin, and a fat guy. The budget here is $20 million, whereas the budget in the original was just over $500,000. Don't you think the $20 million version would have the better actors and effects? Sadly, this is incorrect, as the only thing to show the 20 mil is the gloomy forest cinematography. Even the vehicle in this movie, some generic Jeep Grand Cherokee, feels like one of the cast members decided to use their moms car, instead of the original which used a rare 1970's Chevy Blazer Silverado. Don't you think the new, more expensive version would have the vintage vehicle and not the SUV that you could buy from an independent dealer for a few grand?\n\nOther changes are beyond confusing, especially ridiculous changes that aren't even necessary. In the original, Burt accidentally shoots a hermit because he is hunting and mistakes him for an animal; perhaps a bit far fetched, but plausible. Here, Burt is fantasizing in playing a real life Call Of Duty mission, gets a bit too carried away, and accidentally shoots a hermit. Perhaps this could work if he were either eight years old or schizophrenic, but for a normally functioning human to do this is mind boggling on the writers part. The director also thought a random fully automatic Carbine machine gun would be more realistic than a normal hunting rifle from the original, a change that makes absolutely zero sense. The opening scene where a hermit discovers that his dog companion is dead was suspenseful and creepy in the original, where the man slowly realizes his dog is not only dead, but completely mutilated. Here, the hermit walks into the frame with a boring pan shot, his dog literally falls apart like it's made of Lego's, and the hermit falls to his knees like a character from an awful Mexican soap opera and cries \"NOOOOOO!\" to the heavens, all within 15 seconds, giving us no time to feel the suspense. Speaking of the dog, we learn here that its name was Pancakes, meaning the deranged karate kid had mistaken Burt for the hermits dog...? Was that the intention?\n\nOne of the big selling points of the films advertising was that the characters all had different rewritten deaths, so that'll automatically make us want to see it, right? Well, even that is wrong. All of the characters die in literally the exact same ways, with maybe one or two things changed. For example: one person dies by getting bludgeoned to death in the original, while here, they pour gasoline on her, and THEN she gets bludgeoned. Big difference, as you can see. Another character dies by getting ripped apart by a rabid dog in the original, while here, she shouts at the dog and THEN gets ripped apart by the rabid dog. What the point of even trying to exploit these \"different death scenes\" when there is nothing even remotely differently about them? The one thing you could've changed from this film for an actual reason and purpose, and you didn't? Whatever, who cares.\n\nThis is the worst film of 2016 I've seen thus far, and is also probably the worst remake I've ever viewed. Why was this even made? Seriously, why? Cabin Fever 4 is still in pre- production as I'm writing this, so obviously the franchise isn't dead. Maybe Eli Roth is planning to remake all of his movies but with bigger budgets, worse/more bland characters, and only the stupid and unimportant stuff changed. Who knows, who cares. I get that people hate the original, but there is no way people could like this more, even the most dedicated of Cabin Fever haters will like the original more than this rubbish. This thing only played for a week in all Houston cinemas, and it's no surprise why. There are hundreds of more things wrong with this movie, so much more that I could probably kill an entire forest from printing it onto paper, but who cares. Obviously, the creators of this film didn't."

SPOILERS!\n\n1. Girl is dying from this disease that has her skin falling off, begs boyfriend to put her out of her misery so he takes a shovel and stabs her in the face with it because... Why wouldn't you do that? Ugh. To make it worse, when that doesn't work he decides to grab a gas can and douse her in gasoline before lighting her on fire. What. The. Hell? Let's just go out of our way to kill our loved ones in the most drawn out, agonizing ways possible, yeah?\n\n2. Another girl starts feeling symptoms is starting starting to break out and they know that it means rashes and skin falling off. What's she do? Well the same thing any rational person would! She decides to take a bath and shave her legs. OMG I don't even care that you're suffering anymore!\n\n3. Dude raises a gun to defend himself from hillbillies (because of course we need them too) and they laugh and tell him he wont be able to do much with the safety on as he's failing to shoot them. So, clearly he takes that advice, thanks them and goes on his merry, right? No! He shoots them because OBVIOUSLY that's what would happen and this movie and everyone in it is an idiot.\n\nEND SPOILERS!\n\nLook, stupid movies can be fun, generally when they embrace it or are just so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh. This fails to do either. It is taking itself seriously the whole way and good lord it was painful to watch. So much of the horror industry feels like it's trying to get away from some of the super easy tropes and this one just runs headlong into needing everyone to be so stupid I don't get how they survived normal life in the first place. The only reason this isn't getting a rock bottom review is because there was one character that I didn't hate and the visual are effectively off putting, which I'm thinking is the intent. So, yeah, you managed to be gross, way to go movie but you failed to provide a single reason for anyone to watch this. Ever. Epic fail."

It was abysmal. Maybe I'm being too harsh as I thought the cast in the original suited really well, but some scenes here are over acted and you can almost see on their faces they're thinking about their next lines. Almost as if the characters were just going through the motions without any feeling.\n\nThis film is aesthetically slick and modern and maybe that does take the edge off a bit compared to the raw original.\n\nI think it's bad by comparison, but as a stand alone film it's entertaining. Though the original is your better option."

It's nice to see a remake that stays the same as the original. If you are old enough to remember seeing Robocop and Total Recall then lived through to the remakes of those two films you will totally recall vomiting at the screen over how utterly inferior those remakes were. With Cabin Fever it's almost the same dialog and story as the original film. So that's a good thing because it was a good story to begin with. Good in terms of having a setting, a plot, and a good execution of that plot to spell out a story. I found it weird watching this remake as the original and two sequels I had just watched. So nothing was new under the sun except for a worse cast in terms of the babes weren't nearly as pretty. It was just updated in terms of gore effects and the dog was a better character. The hey deliverance line was hilarious too. Let's face it, not everyone saw the original, so based on a viewing of this movie as your only viewing experience I think it's a 7/10."

This remake, directed by Travis Zariwny, had the opportunity to improve upon Roth's film in almost every way, but instead follows the original so closely that it too disappoints, suffering from the same pitfalls as the original.\n\nAs if regurgitating the same content with the same weaknesses wasn't bad enough, Zariwny sees fit to make the characters thoroughly unlikeable, and consequently impossible to care about (at least Roth's film had the lovely Cerina Vincent in it). This is perhaps the only film where I have found myself rooting for bacteria to claim victims in the most painful way possible! With two cruddy sequels, and now this dreadful remake, I think it's time to close up this cabin for good."

They find out who their real friends are.\n\nThis is a remake of Cabin Fever (2002). This sort of duplicate remake seems to lack any real pacing and horror from the original. Its like a fire that doesn't have any heat. One problem is nothing happens for the first hour and then a crescendo of everything happening in 20 minutes.\n\nThe gore is awesome and even some T & A thrown in. The sound and score is great as well. The scenery is wicked but you don't feel anything for the characters or the story for that matter as nothing really stands out. You get this glossy wrapped gift with nothing inside.\n\nMy biggest question was why was this even made? It did keep with the original concept and I believe Eli Roth was involved with the project but they could have at least done Cabin Fever 4. With a few changes we would be none the wiser. No we probably would complain anyways."

        "review_detailed_main": "The very first thing that came to mind when I stumbled upon this 2016 remake of the 2002 \"Cabin Fever\" movie was \"why?\" I am not overly a fan of remakes in general, but remaking a movie as new as \"Cabin Fever\" was just even more puzzling to me than remaking older movies. Especially since the 2002 movie was quite alright. But alas, I gave the 2016 remake a chance.\n\nAlthough little did I know that this was going to be almost a frame by frame replica of the 2002 version. As such, then director Travis Zariwny paid the original movie no respect or tribute, and it was just a shameless cash-in on an already fairly established franchise of horror movies. And this remake was very, very unnecessary in every aspect.\n\nSure the effects in the 2016 remake were good, and were certainly a notch upward compared to the 2002 version. But again, it just left me with an overwhelming sensation of questioning why this movie was even remade at all.\n\nThe acting in \"Cabin Fever\" was good, and the people on the cast list were doing good jobs with their given roles and character. It was actually Aaron Trainor (playing Tommy), one of the guys at the gas station/convenient store, that put on the most memorable performance, despite having only a supporting role.\n\nI am sure that for newcomers to the \"Cabin Fever\" franchise, then this 2016 remake is a great introduction to the franchise, but for us who have been with this since 2002 it was nothing more than a slap in the face.\n\nAnd while the effects and the story was good, the movie just suffers terribly under a very heavy boot marked with \"this should never have been remade\". And as such, then this 2016 remake is not as enjoyable or appealing as the original 2002 version.\n\nOne thing that was a constant nuisance to the overall enjoyment of the movie, was the questionable pick of music they opted for. The music was overly annoying and just too loud, and it deafened out much of the dialogue in the movie.\n\nI am going to rate the movie four stars out of ten based on the story, albeit it being a frame by frame copy of the 2002 version, the good acting performances and the special effects. But in my opinion, then if you are going to watch \"Cabin Fever\", then pick the 2002 original version over this remake any time."

However, about the only thing about the 2016 version is that it forces us to ask that most existential question: how can something be exactly the same yet completely different? The 2002 film has gone down as a cult classic. And for good reason \u2013 it's awesome! Okay, if you're into cheesy horror films with teens dying in various gruesome ways then it's awesome. It takes the \u2013 oh so familiar \u2013 premise of a group of annoyingly beautiful teenagers going on vacation to a remote cabin in the woods and then meeting a sticky end. Nothing new there, but it's just the way it's done. It knows it's not original and often plays on the clich\u00e9s you'd normally find with the genre, plus it throws in some truly random and surreal moments just to keep the audience on their toes.\n\nAnd not they've gone and remade it. And a remake it literally is. They've used the same script as the original, sticking to the same running order of scenes and same dialogue (or at least 90% of each). Therefore, it just feels weird watching a film you know really well, only with new actors speaking all the lines. Just pick your favourite film then imagine watching it with new actors reading the same words just slightly differently. It would probably be a bit disorientating and off-putting and you'd probably just end up thinking, why am I watching this? Well, that's how this remake comes across.\n\nIt's not even like the actors are that good. They all look as uncomfortable as we \u2013 the audience \u2013 probably feel watching them. They have no chemistry and come across like they're all starring in a different film to each other. Plus the gore looks cheaper than the original \u2013 seriously, there's an animal in the opening scene that looks like a blood-soaked children's puppet you'd see on kids' TV. I loved the original and regularly watch it. This version brings nothing new to the genre. If you're a horror film, just watch the original. This one is possibly the most pointless remake ever (with the possible exception of that 'Psycho' remake in the late nineties)."

Its only been a couple years since the other movie, and the other was better. Don't waste your time with this one. Eli Roth really failed at this one. I've enjoyed some of his other movies, but I really wonder why he decided to remake this movie. Did he imagine a big success would come of it? Was he forced to remake this movie for some reason?

He wastes these beautiful settings with bright and exciting cinematography by filling them with moronic characters, ridiculous plot lines, and the sort of actors who should definitely keep their day jobs."

Who in the world would pretty much follows Roth's script to a tee when the story wasn't even groundbreaking to begin with? These are the type of projects that lack vision, emit no feeling or fright, and they waste a bunch of space for potential original horror content in this great genre. Unlike the original that had some scenes that were extremely whacky, this version didn't take a shot at one ballsy scene. The film felt like a total hack recreation but some super fans. Aside from hating the movie, there are a few positive aspects of the film being Gage Golightly and Nadine Crocker.

It also obviously helped me that I haven't seen that original since the year it was released, so hazy memory and all that. What I got here was a pic full of blood and grue, sex and stereotypes, and poor acting. That is often the norm in the gore slasher genre of things...\n\nOn the plus side is the superb cinematography by Gavin Kelly and a truly head rattling musical score by Kevin Riepl, the latter of which even does a cheeky steal from Symphonie Fantastique (Hector Berlioz). And there's the gorgeous and sexy Louise Linton playing a fantasy driven Deputy! Hoo-Hah! But I digress.\n\nI'd never watch it again, I wouldn't dream of recommending it to serious horror buffs, and although there's a very good emotional pull late in the day, it's pretty much an empty shell.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, let's start with the good news. The film is attractively shot by cinematographer Gavin Kelly and director Travis Z manages to not shake the camera.\n\nYep, that is about it. This is easily one the most pointless remakes. Cabin Fever is only fifteen years old and isn't exactly an unreachable classic. This film uses the same screenplay and despite getting rid of the racist old guy (which ironically is one of the scenes that stands out as working in the first film.) it keeps all the rest of the quirky\u0085 and plays it straight. For example, it keeps the party cop (gender swapped) and the bitey kid who yells pancakes. Neither of which are as good as the originals. The original movie, as stated above, plays this material a little looser and funnier. What's even worse for our Cabin Fever remakers is that Cabin in the Woods has subsequently come out and it certainly apes the opening for Cabin Fever and deconstructs it.\n\nThe serious tone does this film no favors and the acting is all over the place. Cerina Vincent played the girl shaving her legs in the original. She had a nice girl next door vibe so to see her in a sex scene was one of those nice treats that horror films can have. Nadine Crocker, on the other hand, has a serious stripper next door vibe. So her sex scenes are more as if one paid the five dollar cover charge and was hitting the free buffet. In fact, all the actors were wooden without a memorable performance. The rednecks looked like they escaped from He-Haw 2000.\n\nI am not against horror film remakes in principle. The new Friday the 13th missed the point but was at least entertaining and the My Bloody Valentine remake was certainly an improvement. Who this movie is for is a complete mystery. Fans of the original will find this wanting, wooden, and pointless. People who hated the original swill also hate this. As for those who were not around for the original? For god sakes, it's from 2002\u0085 rent the BluRay."

I thought I would find the answer in watching the remake, but as fine as this iteration is, it doesn't quite manage to make a case for its existence in a world where the original is still relatively fresh. The cast, the direction, the effects, and the cinematography are not appreciably better nor worse than the original. The story is almost identical, with a few minor variations. (The local hard-partying deputy sheriff in this version has been gender swapped, but otherwise performs the same function as in the original.) The rough spots of the narrative have not been smoothed over -- in fact, they tend to stick out more here than they did before. Even in the original, the rapidly devolving situation the main characters found themselves in and their reactions to the threats they faced came off, at times, as a bit abrupt. That's true here as well, only more-so because the somewhat higher production values make this feel more naturalistic and realistic. The character contrivances stick out more, and the eccentric nature of the townsfolk our city- kid anti-heroes are surrounded by seem even less convincing than they did in the more stylized (and decidedly lower-budget) original.\n\nThis is fine. Anyone who really loved it the first time around might like to see roughly the same movie again with updated technology (which, of course, doesn't work, so it's really mostly useless). I liked the first movie and was mildly engaged by this. Everyone else can safely skip it, unless you think you can arrive at definitive reasons why the filmmakers even bothered."

I waited nearly a year and bought it the first day it came out to own. Then I watched it...\n\nKnowing it was the same script it was incredibly difficult to not compare to Cabin Fever (2002). In the back of my mind I kept thinking why they continue copying what Joey Kern said so masterfully, or how Cerina Vincent could not be re made. It was really difficult but I do enjoy how the remake is a little more modern. I could not nor will I ever get passed the fact there seems to be no chemistry between these characters, the actors themselves seem to be good actors but the dialogue seemed utterly forced resulting in no on screen chemistry, would have been nice to hear more new lines and some improv.\n\nThe things I LOVED about this remake was the cinematography, certainly deserves to be recognized along with the score. It was so different from the OG it made it a whole new movie.\n\nForever a fan of the franchise."

Even if this movie was an original, it would still be the worst movie I ever watched. The ending was definitely the worst part. The fact that I just sat there and wasted an hour of my time on this stupid movie is beyond crazy. How do you take a classic movie and turn it into a poop fest. Trash ending and I don't want to spoil it but the kid over the dead body, the sheriff shooting the boy, the scene where she gets out the shower and is all messed up, the scene where he kills her in the shed. Just a waste of time and Im upset ive even watched this movie, so upset that i sat down and created an IMDB account just to write this review. This movie sucks do not waste ur time watching. PS my cousin said the movie with shawn from boy meets world is way better. Shout out you cousin."

This version of \"Cabin Fever\" is a cross between \"Night of the Living Dead\" and John Carpenter's \"The Thing.\" There is a sense of doom, and paranoia grows among the principles as the film goes on. One scene in the film struck me as very funny. One of the principles exits a shed to find three \"bad guys.\" The \"hero\" tries to shoot the three with his rifle but it doesn't fire. One of the bad guys says, \"No, you got the safety on.\" The hero looks down, clicks the safety off, and then mows down all three badies. I mean, how stupid do you want to be?!"

Nadine Crocker spices the movie up by getting naked several times, though why her boyfriend still has his pants on during the first sex scene I just don't know! Plenty of gore, though most of it comes late on in the movie. The only positive that I can draw from this is that I am going to re-watch the original version."

If you want to watch a crap Cabin Fever film they made 2 sequels which are also meant to be garbage\n\nSome of the story is laughable. The main characters each try to find help at various points. Instead of heading down the road they used to get to the cabin. They decide the best idea is to wonder around the woods. Hoping they will bump into someone. Must be some small woods because they keep meeting a random bunch of crazy characters\n\n4 might be a bit generous but the gore effects for a low budget film aren't bad.\n\nStick to the original."

        "review_detailed_main": "I consider myself a horror connoisseur. It's my favorite genre. I love legitimately great horror films like the Shining or the Conjuring, cult classics like Evil Dead, and campy slashers like Friday the 13th part 8. The point is that I can typically enjoy a horror movie, even if it's kind of bad. But, this film is BAD. It's not even so bad it's good, it's not even enjoyable. It's So Bad it's BAD. I may have gotten a laugh a time or two, but they were very few and far between. Even drinking with friends while watching wouldn't make this enjoyable.\n\nI'll be honest, I've never seen the original Cabin Fever. It's actually why I watched this one. I found this remake on Netflix and got 10 minutes in before realizing it had to be a remake (references to Call of Duty Black OPs and Grand Theft Auto 5 would be anachronistic in a 2002 film) and decided to press on. So as someone with no affiliation with the original source material, I can't compare it to the original. However, I can tell you that as a movie, this film is terrible. The writing is awful (I can't even put into words how bad), the acting is all over the place, and the characters are written to be so stupid that the characters from Friday the 13th (2009) look like Nobel Prize winners by comparison. It's not scary and they also have a few really terrible jump scares where it turns out to be their friends or some random person.\n\nHorror typically requires some suspension of disbelief. But there's suspension of disbelief and then there's that little voice in your head practically begging you to turn it off. But, I completed the film just so that I can tell you to heed my warning and save yourself 90 minutes of your life. If there was any reason for you to watch it (even you horror fans out there), I'd be honest and tell you.\n\nBut just to be fair, here's the stuff I \"liked\":\n\n-It's mercifully short -I'll admit that the gore is okay, but as someone who likes gore (you can go see any of my ratings on much worthier horror films), there are far better choices than this. -Some of the cinematography looked pretty good -The main guy wasn't the worst actor ever, even if everyone else is pretty bad. (Looking at you, girl who played Winston and the guy with the rifle) -The car chase scene/tracking scene was decent. Nowhere near the best I've ever seen, but competent. -This movie had some money thrown at it. I don't know if that makes it better or worse.\n\nTLDR: Save your time. Pretty damn terrible"
