I wanted to see this before going into Disaster Artist (more on that movie on it's own page). Now before watching Disaster Artist I was thinking rating this a 1. Then I was like 1 sounds too much like so bad it's actually good, so I decided to go with a 2. And after Disaster Artist and some background on certain things, I'm willing to go for a 3.\n\nWhy you may ask? Well, if you watch this with a couple of friends or strangerrs, this can be quite the experience. It's not about quality here (certainly not acting or script, the amount of repetition is suffocating and obnoxious to say the least), but about an experience with others about a really bad movie, that was meant to be a drama. Well I guess it's still a Drama, but not in the conventionnal sense.\n\nTommy is really bad and it seems he has to be dubbed at times. There are quite a few \"What the ...\" moments. Tommys laugh is ... curious? Definitely very unique. There's no real story and there are 3 to 4 sex scenes in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But worry not (or do?), it changes pace from there. But there is nudity applenty, especially Tommys bare behind, and a strange position to have actual intercourse is being revealed too. Or at least a anatomically incorrect penetration spot if you want to call it that. Now that may sound just crazy, but some will find this very amusing.\n\nYou can obviously watch just Highlights of this, but you will never know how bad it really is, if you don't watch it fully, to get the full experience of things. The closest to that, without going through the whole thing, is the Honest Trailer from Screen Junkies ..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never in my life been more entertained by a film that has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals. The awkwardness of the actors is framed by strange pauses, jarring scripts and incredibly bizarre production techniques - there are ample 'deer in the headlights' moments, in which you can feel genuine sympathy for these people who are obviously so caught up in Tommy's strange and dominating creative control that they've failed to see any better.\n\nOther filmmakers play with similarly surreal concepts - David Lynch for example - but this film lacks anything resembling artistic refinement, insight or self awareness placing it far from comparison. It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.\n\nThe camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity. This really is a new frontier.\n\nIt is truly awful, but I cannot recommend it enough."

The dialogue is at once very childlike and yet it tries to tackle \"heavy\" themes like adultery, terminal illness, drug abuse and the like. As a result, it feels like it was written by an alien from outer space.

It's a sad testament to the state of intelligence of some, but that doesn't detract from the movies awful redemption.\n\nThere was no way this was made as a 'black comedy' on purpose. The ineptness present in ALL aspects of the film could only come about through an attempt to put Tommy's own high-school angsty experiences (probably) on tape. When the reviews trashed the movie, he pulled a Paul Ruebens \"I meant to do that\". The denial of the films obvious serious beginnings add even more hilarity. Tommy, we are laughing at you, not with you. Thank you for that."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room' three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where The Room ends and I begin. It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging. Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark. Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life. It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no, there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment in The Room. The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself. Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like him. Nor will there ever be. The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly evil fianc\u00e9e 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny, who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends, says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very special movie. After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him. Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely devoted fianc\u00e9, Johnny. Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again. But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of the fact that she, according to her mother, \"cannot survive on her own in the cutthroat 'computer business'\". But not before they recycle the sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage. A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to catch a football thrown by Mark. All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time. And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The Room, 'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!' The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel. See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching the gospel according to Johnny. My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream as well."

And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny, Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching, doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer (which is okay since \"they're curing people everyday\"). Confused? Well don't be...\n\nAnd welcome to the wondrous world of \"The Room\". This is a world from the breathtaking lack of imagination of Tommy Wiseau, the least appealing man ever to walk this Earth; a world where people play football in tuxedo, have the same conversations again and again due to their 5 minutes memory, make babies by humping belly buttons in the middle of rose petals and finally enter and exit places without any other reason than to do just that.\n\nIndeed, this is probably one of the worst film ever made but as opposed to any other cinematic turd, this one is hardly ever dull (except for the \"sex\" scenes maybe), the aimless plot driven through one stupidity to the other by the on-par grammar-school writing delivering gems galore (\"I'm so happy I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much\", \"I'm tired. I'm wasted. I love you darling\"), the final broth served by inept performances (for want of a better word) from its cast. This is truly the most inspired disaster ever committed to screen.\n\nBut what I find the most interesting about the \"The Room\" is its maker Tommy Wiseau. \"The Room\" is a window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks: Tommy IS Johnny. And what are we told about Johnny? Well that \"he's very caring about the people in his life\", provides for his girlfriend, \"is very sensitive\", \"doesn't drink\", \"has a very secure situation\" and has nice pecs. Quite a catch wouldn't you say ladies? On paper possibly... Because everything about his persona seems phoney: his accent which is a mix of anyone's that ever walk this planet whom couldn't speak English, his over-sized suit, his dark, long and way too greasy hair, his geriatric body posture, his re-shaped and re-muddled face and, above all, his completely dry and humourless laughter (and not in a sarcastic way either). Such a penchant for dissimulation is downright creepy and I must admit, the physical repulsion he exerts on me is the stuff fascination is made of.\n\nThe fact that \"The Room\" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. In the oh-so jaded times we're living in, celebrating the mediocre, talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.\n\nMind you, I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that \"The Room\" will go down in Cinema history. But as what?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes it's difficult knowing where to start in reviewing a movie. This film is perhaps the ultimate example where words are simply not enough. The Room is a film that almost defies description. It really has to be experienced in order to understand why it has garnered a reputation as the most celebrated bad movie of the last decade. Unlike previous so-bad-they're-good flicks such as Plan 9 From Outer Space or Troll 2 and countless others, The Room is not a sci-fi, horror or action flick. It is pure and simply a melodrama. This explains part of its huge impact in that it sort of appeals to both male and female audiences alike, while it is really quite unusual to see a film in this genre being quite so spectacularly bad. The Room is undoubtedly one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time.\n\nI'm not going to go into specifics here as to individual moments that make The Room the comedy classic that it has become, simply because there are far too many and it really needs to be seen to be believed. However, it would be remiss to not mention the character Johnny played by Tommy Wiseau. Johnny is the central character in the story. He is an overly nice character who others take advantage of. He seems to either be retarded or is recovering from a stroke. Wiseau is a very unusual central character, while his sex scenes are deeply disturbing - almost like scenes from a scary sci-fi horror film. Wiseau is of course the auteur behind this thing, he wrote and directed it and so therefore needs to be given some credit for producing something that is simultaneously so bad yet so committed and so deadly serious. He has attempted to claim after the event that The Room was intended as a black comedy. Don't be fooled by this for a second, this movie plays it completely straight. It's so very funny because of this fact. It is an absolute impossibility to make the specific anti-genius of The Room intentionally.\n\nI have seen it a couple of times. The second of which was at a public screening and I have to report that I have never witnessed anything like it. It was the closest a movie-going experience ever got to the feel of going to a gig. The sense of excitement beforehand was palpable and once the movie started rolling the audience was extremely lively throughout with no let up from start to finish. It ended with a standing ovation. It was quite incredible. I have never witnessed the like before. Tommy Wiseau I salute you."

It is liberating and hilarious and downright therapeutic to shout, when a character who has never been established suddenly appears on screen, \"Who are you?\"\n\nWiseau shows up at these Los Angeles screenings and revels in what he seems to think is adoration, almost psychotically not in on the joke.\n\nYou do not go to \"The Room\" to see a movie. You go to get even with that screen that promises entertainment and often disappoints. Finally, you get to mock mediocrity. It's enjoyable and liberating. How lucky is Wiseau that he gets rewarded for being awful? At least he is a good sport about taking the abuse."

        "review_detailed_main": "Johnny and Lisa are engaged and in a month will be married. Everything seems idyllic but Lisa is finding Johnny boring and has an affair with his best friend, Mark. Things start to escalate...\n\nRegarded as one of the worst movies of all time, and rightly so. Written, directed and starring Tommy Wiseau, the crappiness is largely a solo effort. Incredibly badly written: the dialogue is so bad to be quite bizarre at times. The central plot - the Johnny-Lisa-Mark love triangle - has no depth at all and really just goes around in circles. The lack of substance in the central plot is padded by random sub-plots and scenes that add nothing.\n\nActing is about as bad as the writing, with Tommy Wiseau to the fore, again. He is so bad he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Marlon Brando. \"Hammy\" doesn't even come close to describing how bad he is, sometimes looking like he is just reciting lines that he is wholly disinterested in (which he wrote!) and then delivering in a ridiculously melodramatic manner (\"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!\" launched a thousand gifs).\n\nThe remaining cast aren't great but aren't anywhere near as bad as Wiseau. They are helped by being in the same scene as him as he's so bad he makes them look okay.\n\nDirection is pretty much uninspired paint-by-numbers, though is not as laughable as the script or acting.\n\nThere are no redeeming qualities to this movie. It's not accidentally a decent comedy while trying to be a serious drama. No \"So bad, it's good\" for it. This movie is incredibly bad, full stop."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to believe I'm not the only person who was prompted to see \"The Room\" in preparation for James Franco's well-received \"The Disaster Artist,\" the story of the cult classic's creation.\n\nCalled the worst movie ever made by many, what I think people mean is that \"The Room\" is one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. It's certainly not the worst; just try watching a movie like, say, \"ThanksKilling\" for an example of a movie so bad that it's unwatchable. No, \"The Room\" belongs to the same category as something like \"Battlefield Earth,\" films so earnestly made yet so poorly executed that they become more entertaining than they would have been had the filmmakers been able to make a legitimately good movie.\n\nOne can't really provide a description of \"The Room\" that will come anywhere close to approximating the experience of watching it. Tommy Wiseau, the film's legendary and strange creator, plays Johnny, who's been dating Lisa for something like six or seven years and who he refers to throughout the entire movie as \"my future wife.\" The problem is that Lisa hates Tommy and doesn't want to marry him, despite bonking him repeatedly. It never seems to occur to Lisa that she could just tell Johnny she doesn't love him anymore, so she instead complains to everyone who will listen to her how bored she is by him and even makes up stories about him getting drunk and beating her. No one seems especially bothered by this prospect, perhaps because Lisa is such an unpleasant person that we don't understand why Johnny wants her in the first place. O.k. maybe it's not so far fetched, since Johnny isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and his prospects for female companionship that he doesn't have to pay for are probably limited. He clearly is drawn to Lisa's formidable intelligence, because he thinks her suggestion that they invite a bunch of friends to a birthday party she plans to throw for him (despite hating him) is \"a great idea,\" which I guess is if the alternative idea is to invite a bunch of random strangers. And Johnny isn't alone; at said birthday party, she suggest that they should all eat some cake, and the party goers act like that's an idea no one's ever had at a birthday party before.\n\nComplicating matters is Johnny's best friend Mark, who gives a brilliant discourse on gender politics in which he categorizes all women as stupid or evil. Given the women in this movie, he may be on to something. Lisa has the hots for Mark, and they pick the least comfortable spot in the apartment (the bend of a spiral staircase) on which to consummate their passion (though I'm not sure if anything was actually consummated since Mark appears to be humping Lisa's knees). Mark seems like a bit of dim bulb himself, since every time thereafter that Lisa initiates sex his first question is \"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe most mysterious character in the movie is Denny, an orphaned kid who lives God knows where but who pops in all. the. time. and who we're told thinks of Johnny as a father figure, though, given the fact that the first scene with Denny finds him wanting to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex, he might have wanted to shop around a bit more. Denny is always carrying either a basketball or a football and acts like he's twelve despite the fact that the actor playing him is about twenty-five. Once in a while, some combination of guys will actually play ball with him, which involves standing about three feet from each other and gently tossing the ball around like it's an explosive device. After some ball tossing on the roof of Johnny's apartment building, and then some more ball tossing in a cramped alley, I started to wonder whether or not San Francisco had any parks these guys could go to, and then later in the film when they actually go to a park, I wondered why they didn't go to one sooner.\n\nMy favorite character is Lisa's mom, who walks into every situation and expresses disbelief that she's surrounded by dipsh*ts, a sentiment I shared. Nothing phases this woman, not breast cancer, not drug dealers, not random people using her daughter's apartment for a booty call. Whatever's going on, she's just so over it.\n\nAnd another supporting character is Johnny's psychologist friend, who looks like the bald Nazi from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and lurks in the background, lit by the camera man like a serial killer.\n\nEvery scene in \"The Room\" feels like the intro to porn sex, no matter what combination of people are present. There are actually a couple of soft core scenes, both featuring Johnny and Lisa, though it actually only counts as one scene since the second one uses the EXACT SAME FOOTAGE as the first. Needless to say, they're not very erotic unless you find weirdly veiny men of an indeterminate age erotic, or are turned on by the sight of rose petals mashed into a woman's back like giant ticks.\n\nI don't know why \"The Room\" is called \"The Room.\" There is a room in the movie, in which almost all of the action that doesn't occur on the roof takes place. The set decorator clearly thought that Johnny and Lisa are the kind of people who decorate their apartment with giant candles and bowls of fruit, which comes in handy when Denny needs to eat an apple as a way of managing the sexual frustration that occurs when Johnny and Lisa aren't up for a menage a trois.\n\nMaybe he should have played some football in the alley instead. Hah- hah! Hah-hah!\n\nGrade: F (for not having even a minimum understanding of the art of narrative filmmaking)\n\nGrade: A+ (for entertainment value)"

A French Canadian friend of mine named Michael first told me and my brother of this masterpiece. At first I was scared when I was told it was a movie about a man who could barely speak English and was struggling to keep his girlfriend, but there was so much more. There were roses....spoons....and Denny. Tommy Wiseau, possibly the greatest independent,new,director/writer/producer named Tommy to come from Europe in the past year...bar none. Some people have compared him to Tennesse Williams, and I couldn't agree more...his acting is probably the closest I've seen to him since Philip Haldiman. The symbolic usage of spoons in this movie makes me love it even more. The cutaways to the fabulous bridge brings a horrifying yet satisfying theme to this already quirky yet serious yet pornographic movie. I cannot wait to see what movie Tommy decides to do next, personally I don't think he can top this one....but maybe a sequel is in order to this great trilogy or saga of movies to \"The Room\"...possibly Denny spin-offs. Actors Awesome, Actresses = Worst I've seen in my entire life. Good Work Tommy...we need more filmmakers like you producing your own movies. The Room = 4 spoons out of 4"

        "review_detailed_main": "Tommy Wiseau...who is this guy? The IMDb biography is pretty scant and his vaguely Eastern European accent is not at all explained. What also isn't explained is how he was able to somehow get $6,000,000 to make this film--as well as HOW it could cost that much to make this movie. After all, none of the actors are professionals (and it shows), the sets look like they are the homes of Wiseau or his friends and Wiseau himself wrote/directed/starred in the film. So where did all the money go?! Perhaps some could have been spent on TVs (see the end to know what I mean). I think most young filmmakers could do just as well with $47 and a HandyCam and chimp actors!\n\n\"The Room\" seems to have nothing to do with a room. Instead, it's like a soft-core porno film where the camera gets blocked anytime you are about to see most of the nudity. I counted something like 6 sex cenes--3 of which were in the first 25 minutes!! So is the film therefore sexy--God no!! I will be nice and not make any more comments about this--you just have to see the writhing bodies to know what I mean. After all, I'm a middle-aged chubby guy and so I don't have much room to talk. But wait, I am NOT starring in a film...so yes, I can say that they were kind of scary looking--particularly Wiseau. So, if there was an award for least sexy film, this one might win....unless Ernest Borgnine made a porno.\n\nSo why has this film become a cult favorite? It's the dialog....and the acting to a lesser extent. It's as if much of the dialog were written by someone with only a limited knowledge of the English language. So often the same catch phrases are repeated again and again. And often what characters say seems very, very random. And, to make it worse, the post-production dubbing is hilariously out of sync at times. Honestly, the dialog in \"Plan 9\" is no worse--especially since Wood was not trying to make a serious film--whereas \"The Room\" is deadly serious.\n\nIs it ONLY the dialog and acting? Well, no. The writing is god-awful--inconsistent, with missing plot lines AND the inexplicable need for all the men to suddenly break into a game of tossing the football--even though they are only 3-5 feet apart and even when they are in tuxedos! I can clearly understand why at L.A. showings of the film, crowd members reportedly bring footballs and toss them about during the film! And, the musical dubbing is occasionally terrible. And, the plot is dull. And, there's the problem with Wiseau's character being the greatest yutz in film history--knowing that his girlfriend is cheating on him near the beginning of the film yet continuing to stay with her AND doing the funniest temper-tantrum scene in film history late in the movie (he should have yelled \"Hulk SMASH!!!\").\n\nBy the way, the film says the couple in the film have been together five years and then later in the film it says seven. Either way, considering the age of Wiseau's co-star, she would have been between 11 and 13 when they first became a couple.\n\nAlso, on the DVD there is an interview with Wiseau. You must see this--the dubbing was hilarious even for this 'making of' mini-films! Plus it tries to explain the repeated use of footballs in his film! And, he wears a nice suit.\n\nIn conclusion, I must quote the film. \"Why, Johnny,...why?!?...\""

        "review_detailed_main": "What can you say about The Room? Tommy Wiseau's anti-masterpiece is one of the best things I have ever seen. Not for mundane reasons such as quality acting, the written word, clever cinematography or engaging story. Rather, The Room is one of the most unintentionally hilarious and stupid films that I cannot recommend enough.\n\nThe film really does revolve around Tommy Wiseau. He looks like a melted wax sculpture of Ozzie Osborne, and has the acting talent to match. He wrote the screenplay, but doesn't understand his own words when delivering them. He focuses on completely irrelevant material both as a director and as a writer - see the infamous football scene and the dramatic close-up of Mark's clean shaven face. Their importance is something we will just never know.\n\nAs a director, Wiseau has no idea how to construct a scene. Characters just show up in places they have no reason to be. The confrontation with Chris-R on the rooftop has most of the main cast either arriving during the fight or apparently already there! How did Claudette and Lisa get to the top of the building, and why did it take so long for them to react? What made Tommy and Mark climb the building? In fact, why on earth was the confrontation on the roof to begin with?\n\nThe screenplay has to be the most heinous thing I've ever listened to and I love it for that. Johnny bursts into \"cheep cheep\" noises at random opportunities, characters weave in and out of importance (Steven and Peter being the real examples) and around a half dozen subplots go unresolved. Mark's character changes between scenes - he has more personalities in his own body than the rest of the cast together. The real corker are some of the film's lines, which are more memorable than half of the Academy Award for Best Screenplay winners could produce put together. See below: - \"No I can't, anyway, how's your sex life?\" - \"Chocolate is the symbol of love\" - \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode\" - \"You betrayed me! You're not good. You, you're just a chicken. Chip-chip-chip-chip-cheep- cheep.\" - Lisa: Did you get your promotion? Johnny: Nah. (pause) Lisa: You didn't get it, did you? - I have to go see Michelle in a little bit to make out with her.\n\nThe acting, well Tommy Wiseau aside, there's still nothing special here. One might be forgiven for suspecting another is watching porn when they are in fact watching the room. The only way you could really tell is by how fake the sex scenes look (though not for lack of nudity). Juliette Daniel and Greg Sestero really do just do what Wiseau tells them, even where it makes no sense. Phillip Haldiman is creepy but not Matt Damon (The Talented Mr. Ripley) or Paul Dano (Prisoners) creepy, just weird.\n\nI have to take a moment here to praise Carolyn Minnott. Not only is she clearly the most talented actress of the bunch, she bites off Wiseau's dreadful words. At one point she demands of Daniel \"Why bring it up if you don't want to talk about it?\" A large part of me feels that Minnott expresses her frustration with this dreadful production through this line, which is fantastic.\n\nThe Room is a truly delightful display of narcissism on Tommy Wiseau's behalf. Everything seeks to show Johnny as a saint, even if it feels more forced than constipation. Its truly the worst movie ever made, and I love it."

On the one hand, this is clearly the worst movie ever made. Tommy Wiseau must be a billionaire, because I have no idea who in their right mind would fund this project. The acting is horrific, the plot drops its incomprehensible tangents about as abruptly as they are surfaced, half of the film is composed of sex scenes (one recycled, by the way), and the dialogue is the most unnatural I've ever heard... it's a joke. And speaking of jokes, all these qualities make \"The Room\" one of the most fun films I have seen in a long, long time. I loved it - it's absolutely destined to be a cult classic. While watching this adorable attempt at capturing reality, I couldn't help but long for the return of MST 3K so they could have a crack at this thing. Fortunately, the audience picked up on my vibes and shouted out jokes and comments sufficient enough for my yearning. I would recommend that every person in the world find a way to see this film because it will leave you feeling that much better about yourself. I mean that sincerely. So long as you have a great sense of humor and don't mind that the characters' only motivation for action is simply their ill-explained personality traits, I guarantee explosive laughter throughout the surprisingly quick hundred minutes. It's like nothing I have ever experienced before. Wiseau's character delivers the line at one point, \"You're tearing me apart!!\" My sentiments exactly. 10 stars."

When I finally saw the film, I noticed that the writing needs a lot of work, however I really find this film very interesting. The only thing that I like about the film the most (especially that interest me to watch this film) is how Tommy Wiseau was trying to tell a simplistic and interesting story. I went to Stan Lee's LA ComicCon in 2017 and I'd get to meet Tommy Wiseau, I thought he was a cool guy. How I met him there was that I was at his aisle and I never thought a filmmaker would sell copies of his script and I was trying to decide (even that it's tough) and I also was telling him that I'm not sure if whether or not if I want to buy a copy of the script and I also thought it was nice for him to have me read the script as I'm deciding.

It beats \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", easily de-throning that movie from its former reign as The Worst Movie Ever Made.\n\nWords simply cannot effectively describe this movie, and it's not worth any type of time or effort to attempt to seriously analyze it from a critical point of view. The movie is hopeless and utterly pointless, literally every aspect of it is terrible. Only ridiculous hyperbole is appropriate:\n\nJust imagine the best movie you've ever seen, now imagine the complete opposite, the total inverse of that movie in every aspect, to hopefully visualize something even worse than the worst movie you've ever seen. Now imagine the worst movie you actually have seen. Pretend they mated, the fictional inverse movie and the actual horrible movie, and that their offspring was a premature abortion which only inherited the absolute worst negative qualities from its parents. Now take that failed abortion, and imagine something ten times as horridly disturbing and terrible as it: \"The Room\" is even worse than that."

It is by far and large the most horrendously incompetent film I have ever had the ironic pleasure of viewing. Everything is just so wrong- the plot is something that would be unacceptable by soap opera standards, the script appears to have been written by a five year old, shots seem to go in and out of focus at an alarming frequency, stock footage is over-used, and the horrendously wooden acting must be seen to be believed.\n\nThere's so much else that's wrong with the film, but to go into further detail would ruin the amusement factor. Just know that if you choose to watch this unintentionally fantastic piece of entertainment that you're in for a treat. The best way to experience it is with a few friends at a cinema with a bunch of other rowdy, like-minded people, but if no cinema near to you shows it, then buy the DVD, invite some friends over, get really drunk, and then watch.\n\nAs a film, The Room is a undeniably a failure of unmatched proportions, but as piece of humorous entertainment, it's superb. It's awful but it's a must-watch."

And Denny, Johnny's adopted son, has a drug problem, or at least a money problem. What does all this have to do with each other? Not much.\n\nCould \"The Room\" be the greatest film ever made? Writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau thinks so. The rumor is he submitted the film to the Academy for consideration as best picture. Sadly, he was turned away. \"The Room\" may not be the best picture of the year, but is probably the single greatest film of all time, at least from a purely entertaining point of view.\n\nYes, the love scenes are recycled. Yes, some of the dialog makes no sense. Yes, there are countless subplots that go nowhere. Yes, one of the main characters disappears halfway through and is replaced by another guy. Yes, the music is bad. Yes, yes, yes. But somehow, the more things that seem to be wrong with this film -- a film that Wiseau assures us was \"meticulously\" made -- the better it gets.\n\nI was laughing so hard, I was in pain within fifteen minutes and cried. All of the \"Oh, hi Mark\" lines, and the epic \"you're tearing me apart\" were too much for me. I ended up spewing my guts, and several bottles of Coors Light, all over the place. The intensity of the awesome in the picture just blew me away.\n\nI have a new favorite film, and that film's name is \"The Room\". What other film could make me want to play football in a tuxedo or sing the \"Full House\" theme song? Only one film has that power... for the full effect, you really need to see a midnight screening of this film with the audience participation. Or at the very least, download the RiffTrax and laugh all over again... this film could be watched fifty times and still not begin to get old."

For real, some scenes were so wild, it was like they was tryna be serious but ended up goofy as hell. Brie Larson, she did her thing, no doubt. And that kid, Jacob Tremblay, he was solid. But yo, the whole vibe was off sometimes.\n\nIf it wasn't for all the laughs, I'd drop this joint to a 1, no cap. The story's supposed to hit hard, but it felt like it was all over the place. One minute you're supposed to feel the struggle, next minute you're like, \"Did they really just do that?\"\n\nSo yeah, \"Room\" got some moments, but it ain't all that.

It did not disappoint. I haven't laughed this much since the last time I saw \"Showgirls\". And don't believe the marketing campaign of it being a \"black comedy\". This new marketing strategy only came about after preview audiences were howling with laughter at the then promoted-as-a-drama-movie. The only thing \"black\" about this movie is the big, nasty stench left on the screen long after the projector has been shut off. It's pointless to even go into the \"plot\" because what little there is of one borders on surrealism due to its inept unfolding. And even though Mr. Wiseau was at the screening, he failed to delight us with a Q & A session after the film finished.\n\nAnd I must commend Mr. Wiseau for a great job of getting his friends to leave an astounding amount of great reviews and \"10\" ratings to this board. \"The best San Francisco cinematography since 'Vertigo'\". Oh, they must be talking about the shot-on- a-Hollywood-soundstage-roof-shots-done-with-bluescreen-and-foggy-San- Francisco-badly-super-imposed-into-the-background.\n\nMr. Wiseau, if you are rich, and you must have been to fund this film, please please please use your passion for cinema and fat wallet to produce, and leave the creative parts to people with a modicum of talent.\n\nAnd for lovers of bad cinema everywhere, see this film at any cost. And pray to the gods of cinema that we will be blessed with a release on dvd soon, so we can enjoy this masterpiece over and over and over...and if the gods are in a generous mood, might we also get \"director's\" commentary....a blooper reel....or is that too much to ask?"

Sure, you can easily sum up the banal, clich\u00e9 plot, or approximate the mind-bogglingly amateurish acting and the hole filled, insanely convoluted, and just plain weird screenplay. You'll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines (\"Hi Doggy!\" \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode!\" \"The world would be a better place if everyone loved each other.\" \"Oh hi _______!\" \"Chocolate is the symbol of love.\" \"Cheep cheep cheep!\" et al) and mime Wiseau's hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences (\"It's not true, I did not hit her! I DID NOOOOT.\"). You'll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing, the hilarity of the jogging at the park, the brilliance of Chris R., the beautiful blue-screened rooftop, the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end, the mantra-like, gut-wrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes, and the inescapable, mind-erasing voids of Lisa and Claudette's mother-daughter one-on-one's. However, frustratingly for the would-be promoter of the film, these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees \"The Room\" for the first time.\n\nAfter hearing about the film on NPR, my interest was peaked. Soon after, I discovered that there were several clips of the film available to view on Youtube. After watching the rooftop conversation between Johnny and Mark, and an excerpt of the tuxedo-clad football game, I was sold. Living over 2000 miles from Los Angeles, I knew my only option was to purchase the DVD, which retails for about $11 on Amazon. Later that week, I found myself staring at Wiseau's curiously droopy face and preparing, at long last, to watch \"The Room.\" Words fail to describe my experience; I was immediately hooked. Now, several months later, I've watched the film close to ten times, and I can say without hyperbole that it has become more fascinating and hilarious with each viewing. If you're reading this and you're on the fence about whether or not to go to a screening, or to spend the $11-$15 for the DVD, fear not \u0096 you will regret nothing. In fact, you'll begin to wonder how you lived for so long without seeing \"The Room.\" Well, what are you waiting for? \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIFE??!!\""

The settings are dull in the lighting and feel very limited and overly-compact, while the cinematography and editing are some of the worst I've seen in a while. The music feels jumpy and doesn't fit with some scenes, while apart from one classic \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off\" the dialogue is inane and painfully cheesy, the story is thinner than a sewing thread, the direction is one of the most inept directing jobs I've encountered in recent years and the film in its pace is painfully slow in many spots. The acting is also atrocious from everybody involved. Tommy Wiseau is a big reason why The Room is so bad, he shows little talent for writing or directing, while his acting fares even worse as I can't remember a single moment where he didn't make me cringe. All in all, a truly inept film, might have some novelty value, but even that can't hide how appalling The Room is. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

It's an exercise in shoddy filmmaking, but there's something about it that's just . . . well, it's just a whole lot of fun. And yes, I do mean it's a lot of fun to bag on this hot mess, but doing so has never felt so satisfying.\n\nIf you boil this movie down to its base elements, Johnny loves Lisa, Lisa cheats on Johnny. Why does she? Ehh, not really sure. It's not like he deserved it, really - I mean, he's a super nice guy. He's not the best looking guy, but she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And the rest of the movie is just Lisa being a galactic hussy (seriously, they don't come more arbitrarily two-timing than this).\n\nThere's a lot here that goes unanswered. What happened with the mother-in-law's cancer? Will Denny get off drugs? Why does Mark turn on Johnny? You can tell this is supposed to be a big tragedy, kind of an inept Tennessee Williams joint. But nothing about this comes off like it should. Subplots are introduced and then forgotten, the dialogue's full of non-sequiturs, and there's not really any meaning to anything. Add to that the bad green-screening and the Skinemax production values, and you're witnessing a veritable trainwreck.\n\nBut, my god, is it entertaining. Ninety minutes chock-full of unintentional hilarity. The reputation is there for a reason, and it's definitely earned. The \"so-bad-it's-good\" label is thrown around so often these days, but it truly applies here.\n\nIn the best way possible.\n\n8/10"

Films created with the best intentions that ended up so bad that they cross the line of their genres and move to the comedy section. Well the Room is the king of all these films. Written, directed and produced by that alien life form our world known as Tommy Wiseau, the Room tells the story of Johnny a banker who loves his Lisa so much and he's happy that has Mark as his best friend. Lisa by the way is an average looking chubby woman that in the Room's universe is hotter than Megan Fox. Mark is a model looking man that will not hesitate throwing you off the roof and apologize some seconds later. There's also Denny a neighbor/son/retarded weirdo that likes to watch people having sex. There's also Claudette, Lisa's mother who's dying of breast cancer. Other characters you ask? Well we have Chris R. who sells drugs to kids before getting paid, Mike and Michelle, two chocolate lovers (I mean that literally), Peter a psychologist who transforms into Steven and a dog that looks like a frog. Confused? Don't be. Everything makes sense in Tommy's mind.\n\nWhat make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's (like the trailer said) a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong. Every scene has one quote that will stay in your mind forever. Because I forgot to mention that The Room is also the most quotable film of all time. The Godfather? Pulp Fiction? Star Wars? No. Just no. The Room beats the all.\n\nAt the end The Room is the worst and best film of all time. It's a paradox film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where do I begin, because I have come to realize there are no words in any language that are fit enough to describe the travesty that is The Room. Horrific, dull, mediocre, amateurish, ridiculous, apathetic, all these words come to mind but fail to aptly describe the disaster that this film is so popular for being. And make no mistake, the reason behind this cataclysmic horror show strongly stems from the undeniable and lethal contribution of the lead actor- who so magically also happens to be the director, writer and producer of the film- Mr. Tommy Wiseau. All along throughout the movie I have relentlessly tried to unveil the mystery behind his being so astronomically awkward and overly inhuman, but to no avail. The way he talked, walked, laughed and his overall demeanor seemed out of this world.\n\nMy only question is how can one appear so profoundly mentally unstable, and originate from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization at the same time? Because that's what Wiseau is to me, an alien. Not to be too negative about his performance though because he genuinely tried his best to act human, although he failed beyond analogy. My conscience will never be able to digest this impostor of a film, because its eccentricity is too solid to be broken down into smaller matter for mental digestion. A film which, at best, conjures an Ed-woodian vision albeit utopical, and instigates psychosomatic self-harm in the viewer. This is without a shroud of doubt the fourth worst movie ever made. Ever. Its preceding contenders being Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2 and Birdemic: Shock and Terror in their respective descending order. Normally when I write a review I will start off by giving a brief note on the storyline but this time I didn't because, well, there is no storyline. The only thing harder to believe than the awfulness of The Room is its mind boggling self-financed budget, a good $1 million, half of which was doubtlessly spent on promoting it and shooting countless takes of the same scene because Tommy Wiseau had a hard time remembering the incomprehensible lines he wrote himself. I read somewhere mind you, that Wiseau had originally included a subplot which would reveal that Johnny, his character, is actually a vampire.\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nThere is a plethora of mysteries in the world and third of them are embedded in The Room. Things remain unexplained like irrelevant scenes that contribute nothing to the development of the plot; scenes like when age decrepit Denny, out of place Mark and some bi-dimensional random character (probably played by a spare crew member with about as much acting experience as an Egyptian Pharaoh) are tossing a football around and when the guy spontaneously trips and falls softly apparently breaking a few vertebrae, they all decide to go back inside the house with no indication what impact it has on the story. Or should I talk about the sudden inexplicable mood swings that the characters seem to be experiencing, like when Johnny is apparently in rage and goes to the rooftop cursing and arguing with himself over his girlfriend who's claiming domestic abuse, only to find his friend Mark there and say, in a an oddly quite cheerful manner \"Oh Hi Mark,\"\n\nDid I mention The Room has more continuity than CCTV footage?\n\nTommy Wiseau's delusory attempt at cinema is nothing like his counterpart James Nguyen's with Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Nguyen at least steered his supernatural crapfest with stark albeit dubious earnest. Wiseau on the hand assembled his cinematic tour-de-force with resonating apathy, shoulder-shrug level determination and an impetuous attitude that echoes throughout his masterpiece.\n\nI could sit here and go through this film illustrating flaw, ineptitude and shortcoming but my time is far too precious to be spent on a preschool film project that is but utter conversion of garbage material into filmstrip. I haven't the slightest idea what message this film was trying to put out there, but it did give a faint hint on love, romance and the ups and downs of relationships (or the Tommy Wiseau's twisted personal view on these subjects) which will only be perceived by the keen-eyed and the one who manages not to fall asleep or commit suicide before the end credits.\n\n\"It's not true, I did not hit her, she's lying I did not hit her I did naat.\"\n\nI was mentally tortured to sit through 100 minutes of unprecedented depiction of human interaction, the exacerbating diction of Tommy Wiseau's character (not forgetting Wiseau's unidentifiable accent that could only suggest brain damage inflicted speech impediment) and his own ethereal demeanor. All the aforementioned traits merely being characteristic of the actor's own psyche by the way. Thanks dear producers, that is Tommy Wiseau, Tommy Wiseau and Tommy Wiseau.\n\n\"You're tearing me apart Lisa!\" Actually you have to witness the way he delivers this particular line to believe it. You have to. You've never seen anything like it before.\n\nThis entire film looks like a bunch of Martian green men trying to re-enact human behavior in not-so everyday situations, needless to illustrate the results.\n\nThe Room is an insult and a great crime committed to celluloid, while Mr. Wiseau and his team are gargantuan degenerates of biblical proportions.\n\nP.S everyone on the planet should see the final scene where Johnny is on a self-destructive rampage. As Cartman would put it, 'I broke a funny fuse.'"

But what makes it great is not just that the film-maker Tommy Wiseau is completely incompetent, but that he somehow managed to spend millions of dollars on the production and it still turned out like it did. Although it's truly an awful film, it's so entertaining to watch. You are laughing at the film and at the actors, but most the them now have a good sense of humour about it. Even if you're not into cult films or low-budget films or watching films because they're bad, you can enjoy The Room. It honestly has to be seen to be believed. On entertainment value, I could give it 10 stars, but realistically, this is the film that 1/10 was created for."

We've both watched it multiple times and we're both not satisfied. You thought the scene changes in Memento where confusing? Try The Room. You find yourself always wondering what the heck is going on. That's especially true when the actors are talking. Who wrote this stuff? Tommy Wiseau is who wrote this, youngin'. Get to know him. Seriously. Wiseau not only made this movie, he MAKES this movie. Without Wiseau, you'd be wondering what the hell you're wasting your time for. With Wiseau, somehow the movie makes perfect sense, in a not making sense at all sort of way. Why is he always laughing? Is he nervous on the set? Is this the character of Johnny coming through? Who knows. This is why this movie is so great, it leaves you with so many questions. For instance, in the drunk scene, you find yourself bewildered as to the reason Lisa and Johnny choose to drink what could only be described as Vodka over Whiskey. And then Johnny confirms that the drink \"Isss goood\". How is that possible? You were confused by the time lapses in Primer? You ain't seen nothing. The Room not only has time issues, but it has missing scenes and sudden changes of behavior by the characters. A simple filler shot of San Francisco (Whenever you see Alcatraz, I recommend shouting ALCATRAZ!!!!!) can mean anything from, \"Well, it appears an entire day has passed\"... to \"Well, I think it's the same day\"... or \"Why did I just see that?\".\n\nSo anyways, here's my final take, starting with the negatives:\n\n-The Room suffers from too many sex scenes. The first one is hilarious and disgusting (Does anyone know what's up with Wiseau's body?). After that, the sex scenes are boring, but still disgusting. The only good part is the original music, which is hilarious and addicting.\n\n-The Room also suffers from too many Claudette/Lisa scenes. These are really boring and the conversation is always the same... i.e. Lisa complaining about her relationship with Johnny.\n\n-Peter is a lame character.\n\nAnd then the positives:\n\n-Any scenes with the following characters are stellar: Johnny (Of course). Denny. Chris R (They tease us with only one scene with Chris R). Doggy (Again, a one scene tease). Mike (Watch his face).\n\n-This movie is highly quotable. There are too many great quotes to even mention.\n\n-The message of the movie \"How can you ever really trust anyone?\".\n\nThat's about it. Do yourself a favor and watch The Room. I only wish I lived near LA so I could attend a screening and meet Tommy or some of the cast."

As every character changes and develops throughout the course of the story, so to does your consciousness evolve as its warring factions are reconciled into a rapture of blissful harmony and understanding. This film has helped me in ways I have only just begun to understand, and it is a sure must-view. Mere moments after this majestic work had concluded, I felt my ignorant, close-minded sense of self fading into the void, and my soul filled with visions of His masterpiece. I am one, not just with this universe, but with all others. Earthly trappings matter not to me now, as I care only to spread His word and to forever carry out His will in whatever way this sniveling mortal form that my higher self clings to can manage. This movie as an integral part of the human experience, as it will be what ends the human experience.

I hope you will join me in shedding the weaknesses of being and ascend into a higher plane of existence, so we may one day call Him from beyond the curtain. When that blessed day arrives, and the sounds of His divine vocal cords send the words \"oh hi Mark\" echoing across the cosmos, then we will truly know the meaning of existence."

I felt angry when Tommy Wiseau was mad and I cried when he was depressed. This masterful piece of artwork was definitely throughly thought out, especially the biography on Steve. Then when this Epic piece ended I stood up and cheered knowing that I just watched a good movie and a single tear appeared from my eye and rolled down from my cheek as I was in awe.

Contributors here are generous souls.\n\nReading audience and critical reaction about \"The Room\" is more entertaining than watching its 99 minutes of jaw-dropping, mind-melting celluloid lunacy. Although, I must warn you, \"The Room\" can be addictive (for all the wrong reasons).\n\nI'm interested in both film-making and writing, so Tommy Wiseau's disasterpiece plays out like a kind of crazy text book on \"How Not To Make A Movie\" - But as an advert for Independent Film Making it feels similar to selling tickets for the Titanic.\n\nThe serious point here is that Independent Films are so important for the industry. And, its with independent productions that new talent in all areas of Entertainment can shine and even prosper.\n\nTommy Wiseau is a far better business man than he is an actor/director/writer. His genius lay in raising $2 million dollars to fund this self-indulgent, grandiose folly. If you're going to rip up the rule book on movie-making, at least care enough about your audience to make something worth watching.\n\nThe Room does not feel like a black comedy. The treatment of women (the central female character is both unscrupulous and amoral) and theme of sexual betrayal explored in the script are just not comedic. Almost by accident, Tommy shows us how vacuous modern life and relationships can be.\n\nTop Reviewer Comments:\n\nLinkara: \"It sucks out your mind and replaces it with stupid!\"\n\nScott Foundas- Variety Magazine: The film prompted \"most of its viewers to ask for their money back... Before 30 minutes had passed!\"\n\nNostalgia Critic: \"You can basically make trading cards out of how many pointless sequences there are in this movie!\"\n\nQuestions About The Room:\n\nWhy is the director obsessed with San Francisco and its trams? Did any of the cast read the script before signing up to the production? If the film was edited, was the editor asleep, fired or did Tommy do the editing too? Did Tommy mean to direct the fight and romantic scenes in such a way as to make them as awkward and wooden as possible?"

And the first sex scene that quickly follows gives the impression of observing an illegitimate brother of Beavis and Butthead in full romp: the little giggles the character happily produces during coitus made me want to slap the screen.\n\nWhat follows is an hour and a half of flat characters who spend their time greeting each other as they enter the picture, and telling each other banal, implausible tales. With embarrassing eroticism and cringe-worthy action and dialogue.\n\nNever before has the final event of a dramatic action been so aptly named: catastrophe. A disaster in every sense of the word, and an insult to the public's intelligence.\n\nBut in the end, I still wanted more. This movie is so bad that I'm looking forward to seeing it again to discover new nonsense.\n\nGrandiose! A masterpiece of a disasterpiece!"

So I had to sit down and watch The Room to see for myself, which I did with no preconceptions about it other than a few vague references to it being a bad movie.\n\nI won't say it's the worst film ever made, since I believe that (dis)honor goes to Birdemic in my opinion. While The Room had atrocious acting, a lousy plot, and poor dialog, it at least had decent editing and good sound although if I see one more panning shot of San Francisco I think I'm going to vomit.\n\nSeveral things which brought this film down were the aforementioned poor acting (whoever told Tommy Wiseau that he could act needs to be slapped senseless), lousy dialog, and poor plot. There was only one or two decent actors in the whole film.\n\nThe character of Denny was just annoying. I mean, he's 18, not 8 for goodness' sakes, why does he want to throw the football around all the time? Speaking of which, the one football toss scene where the actors kept running into and out of the scene reminded me of a Saturday Night Live skit.\n\nThe use of green screen in the rooftop scenes was pretty noticeable, partially because the actors hair didn't blow in the wind. This wasn't particularly annoying though.\n\nThere was nothing lovable about the character of Johnny which made you want to like him. The way he acted didn't give off any feeling of warmth, so why was everyone so concerned about his feelings? There also could have been a couple of good subplot with Denny & the drug dealer, but once that conflict was over, it was never mentioned again, nor did they ever figure out why he was buying drugs anyway. Same with Lisa's mother telling her about having breast cancer, almost in passing. But once that scene was over, nothing else was ever said. It's like those parts of the movie were just thrown in for the heck of it.\n\nThe fight scenes were totally unrealistic (as was everything else) and near the end when Johnny was going on his \"rampage\" was pretty laughable.\n\nBasically the whole movie was worse that a Lifetime made-for-TV movie, with basically the same plot. Even as a so-bad-it's-good type of movie, this one doesn't even make me want to laugh at it."

This film has the best worst acting I've ever witnessed. The star/director/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau should be in the Hall of Fame of bad acting if there ever was one. I'd describe him as a cross between Christopher Walken and Fabio, except he makes Fabio look like Daniel Day Lewis when it comes to his acting skills. It's not just Tommy who lacks in the acting department. Every single actor/actress in this film will make you want to cringe with every line. It doesn't help the already dreadful actors that the dialogue is absolutely atrocious.\n\nWhen it comes to plot in this movie, there are so many holes it's like Swiss cheese. I would try and explain the plot but there is barely one to begin with. I lost count on how many scenes that were in this movie that were absolutely pointless to the plot.\n\nIf you are just starting to watch some of the worst films ever created there might not be a better place to start than the Room. It is worth all the hype it receives, simply a movie you have to see to believe."

I really do get the appeal and I understand why \"The Room\" has a cult following.\n\nPlease, I ask you humbly to stop giving this film (and other piles of #$%^) nine or ten stars. Do you realize by doing so, you are comparing the quality of these films to \"The Shining\", \"Casablanca\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" among countless other masterpieces. These classic films have earned their ten star ratings. Please quit compromising the quality of reviews on IMDb with these inflated ridiculous scores. It's not fair to the REAL filmmakers who have earned their stripes through years of work, and defined talent.

The best actor in the film is the 2 minute appearance of the drug dealer who merely has to play 'Angry'. It is a no star film, but a 10 star comedy; not by script, purely by the poor production.\n\nI am not one for spoilers, but there is a scene when the men all show up in tuxedos to the apartment. The story does not explain why the occasion for tuxedos, or the two strange fellows who are now on camera you have never met before. I digress\u0085They all go outside and play catch with a football in tuxedos!!! Conveniently standing exactly three feet apart from one another. Why???

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Room\" is a film that must be seen. Usually, when a movie deserves one star, it's not worth wasting your time watching. This movie, on the other hand, must be seen . . . in order to be believed.\n\nA more appropriate title for this film should be \"Murphy's Film\", because everything that could possibly go wrong with a movie did go wrong with this one. I suppose a light didn't fall on a cast member while filming, but that's not a compliment to give to any film.\n\n\"The Room\" could be the worst film ever made for a variety of reasons that feels like a grocery list. The story feels ripped from the most basic soap opera, there are subplots that are out of place and go nowhere, the dialogue is terrible, the actors in the film either underact or overact, there are too many shots that are out of focus, there are unnecessary sex scenes that drag the pace of the story . . . I could go on.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the basic plot of \"The Room\" can be described in one sentence, whereas all the things that are wrong with the film can fill a book. It should be shown in film school to show students how NOT to make a movie.\n\nTommy Wiseau, a man of unknown origin whose accent sounds Austrian (I guess), starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote this film on a $6 million budget. He shot it using a 35 mm camera and an HD digital camera simultaneously, reportedly not knowing the difference between the two.\n\nAlso alleged is his financing for the film, which Wiseau claims he did by taking leather jackets he mysteriously acquired from North Korea and selling them for a profit. That explanation seems more plausible than actually convincing someone to put money down to finance a script already so weak.\n\nWhat results is a film that is just a mess in virtually every aspect. The main story, should you care, involves ad executive Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his frustrations with his fianc\u00e9 Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Johnny is oblivious to her having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sustero), but notices how distant she has become. Wiseau even goes as far as to vent his frustration by channeling James Dean when he shouts, \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\".\n\nThe subplots that go nowhere include a creepy college student named Denny (Philip Haldiman) who likes to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex (and actually tells them so!), Denny's borrowing money from a drug dealer which he can't pay back, Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) revealing she has breast cancer, and a pointless game of football in tuxedos. These scenes come and go so often, that you wonder why they were there in the first place.\n\nWhy, then, am I recommending the film? I went to a midnight showing of it at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline, Massachusetts, and had the time of my life. Similar to watching a midnight showing of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", fans brought plastic spoons and footballs to throw around during crucial parts of the screening, and shouted out responses to the dense dialogue like it was \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" times 1000.\n\nThe film is available on DVD, but like many films famous for their midnight showings, including \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", \"The Room\" has to be seen in one of these public screenings. It is no fun sitting at home alone watching a film like this one.\n\nI hate using the hackneyed phrase \"It's so bad, it's good\" for that reason: it's so overused. I won't give \"The Room\" credit for being good, because it's not. It's just very fun to watch, and I urge whoever reads this to find a movie theater that screens midnight showings in the nearest city and get tickets for this film if you can. It is terrible, but so worth checking out."

The shoehorned character development. The insanely blatant plot holes.\n\nI love this movie! It is one of the greatest \"bad\" films ever. It is a film that does everything so fundamentally and blatantly wrong, that it achieves an amazing watchability. This goes up there with \"Troll 2\", \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and others as one of the best \"So-bad-it's-good\" films of all time!\n\nWritten by, directed by, produced by and starring the strange Eurpean man named Tommy Wiseau, \"The Room\" is an attempt to make an edgy, romantic thriller about a man who is pushed to the breaking point by the circumstances of his life.\n\nYeah, and it's pretty awful.\n\nMy score for the film is what the film deserves based on it's merits- (direction, writing, acting), however, I will say that for a \"fun factor\", this film gets a 10. It's insanely hard not to enjoy something this train-wreck awful.\n\nWiseau plays \"Johnny\", a bank employee who lives in a nice neighborhood in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa. His best friend is Mark (played by Greg Sestro), and we are reminded that they are best friends about 50 times throughout the film by the wonky dialog. Also living in the building is Denny, who Johnny has more-or-less adopted. Denny is a strange character. He is meant to be an innocent, silly young college student, but the performance and writing turn him into a strange, creepy man who comes off as more of a total sleeze than a good guy. However, when Johnny's girlfriend Lisa begins to cheat on Johnny with Mark, things quickly spiral out of control.\n\nThat's all I want to give away for this film. But trust me when I say it's a blast to watch!\n\nThe film is strangely quotable. The abysmal dialog is almost poetic in it's nonsensical-ness. The direction is flat and uninspired, and quite humorous. The acting is hilarious (Wiseau's strange accent and ho-hum attitude makes his character sound like a zombie), and the cinematography is cheap.\n\nIt really is a textbook example of how not to make a film.\n\nWhich is where all of the hilarity comes from. This is the sort of movie you pop on while drinking beer with some friends, and meticulously pick apart piece by piece. There is nothing that this film does right, and the chuckles and laughs you will get out of it's incompetence start right away.\n\nI love this movie. The film itself gets a 1 out of 10, but the enjoyability gets a 10. Watch this film! Love this film! And be sure to say \"Oh, hai...\" to the Doggy!"

At least one reviewer mentioned the legendary \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" in comparison, but I feel this film excels over the latter in certain areas such as crude acting, a muddled plot and strange, unappealing and undeveloped characters. Still, I reluctantly feel compelled to give it a 2 if only because of the appealing visuals of San Francisco (which are nonetheless odd for a film that wasn't primarily filmed in San Francisco, aside from the second-unit footage; wikipedia's article on the film relates that the rooftop scenes were filmed against a green screen with the city added in afterward). Instead of keeping this film in its current anonymous region of mediocrity with a mixture of very high and low votes, perhaps true fans should pitch in to plunge this film downward toward a place alongside other unique visions like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\". Indeed, this film reminds me a great deal of \"Manos\" insofar as both were made by people outside the Hollywood mainstream (not so much the case with \"Plan 9\"'s Ed Wood); \"Manos\" is a bit more lucid than this film, but both share a similar kind of entertainment value for people who appreciate just how far this medium can be pushed and still be recognizable."

Directed, produced, written by and starring the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau, this film is a shining example of how not to make a movie. And yet, somehow, it has become a cult classic.\n\nThe film follows the life of Johnny (played by Wiseau), a banker who is engaged to a woman named Lisa. However, their relationship is far from perfect, and it soon becomes apparent that Lisa is cheating on Johnny with his best friend Mark. The film's plot is haphazardly constructed and filled with nonsensical scenes and awkward dialogue.\n\nBut this is precisely what makes \"The Room\" so entertaining. It's unintentionally hilarious, and it's impossible not to laugh at the film's many unintentionally funny moments. Wiseau's performance as Johnny is wooden and stilted, but it only adds to the film's charm. And the supporting cast is equally bad, with lines delivered with no regard for pacing or tone.\n\nThe film's low-budget production values only add to its appeal. The sets are clearly fake, and the green screen used for exterior shots is so poorly done that it's difficult not to laugh. And yet, the film's unintentional humor is what makes it so endearing.\n\nWhile \"The Room\" is certainly not a good film in the traditional sense, it is an excellent example of an accidental comedy. It's a film that is so bad, it's good. And that's what makes it worth watching.\n\nOverall, I'd give \"The Room\" a 6/10. While it's far from a cinematic masterpiece, it's still a hilarious and enjoyable watch. Just be prepared for a lot of cringe-worthy moments.\""

But boy, it may be one of the worsts but that still doesn't make it any less funny then it already is. It stars our main character, Johnny. Who is played by our lord and savior, Tommy Wiseau. But here's the kicker, Tommy Wiseau *barely* speaks English and talks with a really bad accent. Even when he attempts to be serious, his direction of his acting and voice is never portrayed correctly and offers some hilarious dialogue for all the wrong reasons. And for someone who also directed, written and produced the film, it comes off as a surprise. Anyways back to the \"plot\", Johnny lives in a Suburbian area in America I think, it's never explained where he lives. He lives with his future fianc\u00e9e, Lisa. Lisa is without a doubt, the worst human I've seen in a movie. Lisa is supposed to marry Johnny but it turns out she doesn't like him at all (I don't blame her, really). But the fact that she cheats on his \"best friend\" (which is Mark by the way), and lies about whatever Johnny did to her just makes me cringe. She also has some banter with her mother MULTIPLE TIMES in the movie, and it goes like this: \"Marry Johnny.\" \"No.\" \"Do it, ya' female dog!\" Like I said, this same conversation happens multiple times, and it NEVER gets ANY better. Don't even get me STARTED on the sex scenes... There's also this weird \"subplot\" where this kid \"Denny\" is buying drugs from some guy and nearly gets killed when Denny doesn't pay him back. And like most bad movies, this subplot NEVER goes anywhere afterwards. The arguments between Lisa and her mother along with the sex scenes go on and on until we finally go somewhere at the end where it's Johnny's birthday. For some weird reason, Lisa decides to have a go at Mark at the MIDDLE OF THE PARTY until some random person finds them. Johnny notices sometime through and we have some HILARIOUS dialogue with even more hilarious deliveries like \"I AM FED UP WITH THIS WIORLD!\". Johnny locks himself in a cupboard like a little kid and Lisa calls Mark to have sex...again when Johnny is literally in the NEXT ROOM. This causes Sudoku...I mean, suicide. Mark, Lisa and Denny notice this and cry until the ambulance or police come...my brain has melted. The biggest problem with the movie is that there's virtually no pacing, direction and even plot. But it's so damn hilarious that it gave itself a higher score then what I should get and hell, I recommend binge-drinking while watching it. But if you want a serious movie that is in a similar genre to this (I don't know what genre I'm thinking of), avoid this movie at all costs."

But with the rest of them, you figure that when they're not in front of the camera, they can probably order a burrito without needing some kind of Star Trek universal translator device.

        "review_detailed_main": "it just wasn't that bad. I actually purchased this after I saw a news item on blocks long lines of people waiting to see this film ala \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\". What I was expecting was \"so bad it's good\". And yes, it is not good, but it is also not so bad that it would really qualify for MST3K. Granted, there are lots of hallmarks of bad film-making - wooden performances, strange reactions, subplots that go into a brick wall, and what is it with that footage of Alcatraz between every scene? This is the story of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, who discovers she is bored with Johnny shortly before their wedding. A cast of characters pop chaotically in and out of the plot, which include Johnny's voyeuristic young ward and Johnny's best friend who winds up sleeping with Lisa, but does at least show his loyalty to Johnny by whining about it before, during, and after. Lisa's mom's performance is certainly one for the books. She casually mentions she has cancer as though she has mentioned a hangnail and then nothing is ever said about it again. Lisa certainly doesn't seem that worried about her mother's impending doom. Maybe her lack of concern is understandable considering her mother is always telling her she needs to stay with Johnny since Lisa doesn't have what it takes to make it in the job market and needs someone to take care of her. This is a mother figure the way Howard Hughes used to write them.\n\nThis whole film viewing experience leads me to one conclusion - young people today are both spoiled and deprived when it comes to film. They are spoiled in the sense that they think this is the worst film in history just because of the rather cheap sets and oddly constructed storyline. Independent filmmakers that make such films as a rule have been priced out of the market, and all that is widely released today are prepackaged superhero films with special effects to dazzle and scripts that have no impact on the soul. Young people are also deprived since they don't get to see much \"so bad it's good\" film-making either. If you want to see truly bad films that entertain feast your eyes on \"The Killer Shrews\" with dogs suited up in bath mats as the shrews. Also, try any film written by/directed by /starring Ed Wood and see what really bad stream-of-consciousness dialogue and cheap art design are all about.\n\nI gave this film five stars because more stars would say it's a good film, which it isn't, and less stars would say it is really bad, possibly to the point of being interesting, and it's not that either. It's mediocre - which means it really is not worth your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Last night, I engaged in a long conversation with my brothers girlfriend. Although my memory is unclear due to the hammering effects of drinking three cocktails, there is one thing I still remember. She declared Legally Blonde as \"the worst movie ever.\"Having seen LegalIy Blonde, I challenged her by reminding her that she had not seen The Room, although she had endured the Nostalgia Critics infamous review of it. While both films are bad, there is a distinguishing difference between a bad film like Legally Blonde and a bad film like The Room. You see, Legally Blonde is bad because like many mainstream films, it has shallow characters. The Room is bad because it fails on every conceivable level that a film can fail which is why it has been dubbed by some academics and as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\". Because Citizen Kane is often cited as \"the greatest movie ever made\", The Room is therefore \"the worst movie ever made\" even if the title that has long been held by Plan 9 From Outer Space for well over thirty years. However as bad as The Room is, it delivers unintentional laughs in bucket loads. Go onto Youtube and look up \"Hi doggy/Flower shop scene.\" If you aren't amused by the obvious scripting and editing errors, not to mention the downright bizarre mis en scene, then clearly there must be something wrong with you.\n\nThe Room is the story of Johnny (played by writer/ director, Tommy Wiseau), a banker who is about marry his longtime fianc\u00e9, Lisa (Juliette Danielle) . After an unnecessarily long and detailed love scene that is briefly interrupted by the perverted Denny who just likes to watch. Lisa figures she is bored of Johnny, and decides to invite his friend Mark (Greg Sestero) over so she can have a talk that involves having sex on a spiral staircase. Drama inevitably ensures, through several convoluted plot points that are instantly dropped before everything climaxes in true Shakespearean style.\n\nOne of the great features of The Room is how amazingly repetitive the dialogue is. Every time a character enters a set, they are always greeted with lines like \"oh hi Mark\", \"oh hi Denny\" , \"oh hi doggy\". The \"oh hi\" phrase is repeated so often, it's almost as if Tommy thought they were necessary to remind us that the scene has now changed. But that's not the only thing he reminds us about. Every time Lisa seduces Mark, he always declares \"Johnny is my best friend\". At several points in the film, Lisa's mother ,Claudette comes in to remind us that by cheating on her fianc\u00e9, Lisa is going to suffer deep financial troubles. If you want see what plot driven dialogue looks like in its most unsubtle, non character driven form, look no further.\n\nThe character interactions are also monotonous. In the films first half hour, we see three sex scenes that are ridiculously gratuitous to the point of nearly being soft core. The only way for Johnny to hang out with his friends is to play football. Johnny laughs even if friends tell him something that wasn't meant to be funny or ironic.\n\nThe limited character interactions are not helped by the acting either. Never before seeing the famous \"I did NUHT\" moment, had I ever seen acting that was so detached and void of any convincing emotion that replacing the actors with Hayden Christiansen or even the HAL 9000 computer could actually mark an improvement.\n\nAnd yet, because of its sheer level of badness combined with Wiseau's love of film, The Room represents a rare feat in cinema. Its success is the kind that many would be directors have wished for. Yes it's a bad amateur film by a clueless first time director . But like many of the best films like Quentin Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction, or Monty Python and The Holy Grail, it delivers scene after unforgettable scene with schizophrenic writing that's hilarious enough to deliver the kind of joy that could finally give Super Mario an erection after twenty five years of sexless marriage.\n\nThe Room came out in 2003, the same year that gave us hits like The Matrix sequels, Bruce Almighty, Terminator 3 and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle which all made millions at the box office. But none of those films are likely to be quoted five years from now. By contrast The Room is much worse than those films and vanished into thin air upon release. It has since attracted an ever growing cult with some fans who were dedicated enough to faithfully adapt it into a video game.\n\nYes, the films I've listed are bad. But they do not have the passion that The Room has to reach for a high level artistic greatness. And because the film aims so high, it fails so hard. Because it fails so hard, it is without doubt the worst film ever made. But because the film often aims so high and fails so hard, it is without doubt one of the funniest and therefore greatest films ever made. Wiseau did not make the masterpiece he wanted to make, but he still made one. I think that's enough to satisfy any director.\n\nFor: \u0095 Extremely funny in the most unintentional ways.\n\nAgainst \u0095Technically speaking its horrendous.\n\nRating 10 out of 10"

The terrible line delivery, poor green screen effects, godawful voice dubbing, bad editing, and overall dreadful writing all collide to create the perfect storm.\n\nSo, please, watch this movie. I have seen it many times, and it still has me rolling on the floor. I've never attended a screening of this movie, but from what I hear, the audience yells lines at the screen that I would imagine would ruin the hilarity of it if you watch it in that atmosphere without seeing it beforehand.

It's so complexly layered with fibers of feces that you have to rewind and replay each few minutes (except the sex scenes, which replay themselves) to catch all the nuances.\n\nMy voice is hoarse from shouting \"What the hell?!\" over and over. The screenplay seems to be a Mad-lib filled in by patients in an asylum. You can stare at Wiseau's face for minutes on end and still not understand how it is connected together. It's like his makeup artist is M.C. Escher.\n\nAbout a minute into the movie, I get the giggles and they don't stop except when the confusion/badness/outrageousness level gets so high that I have to vent by begging for some sort of explanation.\n\nEverything about it is perfect. The sincerity mixed with incompetence. The abject pathos of the autobiographical message mated with the apparently huge ego of the subject. The ambition compared to the final \"output.\" As each moment is added to the pile, the silliness increases.\n\nIt's as if you're at a wedding and a bridesmaid has her skirt tucked into her underwear. It gets funnier and funnier the longer it goes on. And then someone farts. And you are trying so hard not to make any sound because the preacher is talking and he says \"We are gathered her to salivate this holy headlock.\" Then the candles catch the bride's veil on fire. And then when they try to put the fire out, the bride starts doing push-ups. It's as if each event is more impossible than the last and there's no explanation, and all the while, you get this sense that someone went to the trouble of making it just like this because that's how he wanted it to be!\n\nIt truly is like sitting on an atomic bomb that's about to explode."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room has been called \"the best worst movie\" and \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\". It is definitely a bad movie, but it doesn't even know it's bad. It goes so over the top with its acting, with Tommy Wiseau to blame mainly. and so thin on progression and depth. It's even a challenge to review since many of the scenes basically plea to be seen rather than to be discussed from a narrative perspective.\n\nTommy Wiseau is the film's error in a nutshell. He is a horrendously poor actor, doesn't know exactly how to recite his lines in a believable, and for that matter convincing, manner, and has this awkward, stiff screen presence. Think of Jean-Claude Van Damme's talentless brother. I've heard from many that when you meet him in person and comment on how bad The Room actually is, he doesn't even know what you're talking about. He is oblivious to the fact that he created one of the most laughably bad dramas in recent history. But also, the most entertaining in the worst possible ways.\n\nThe story is about Johnny (Wiseau) who is about to be engaged to a gorgeous women named Lisa (Danielle). What Johnny doesn't know is that Lisa's love for him is wearing thin to the point where she resorts to having an affair with Johnny's friend Mark, played surprisingly well by Greg Sestero, who seems like the only person that is trying to give a decent performance. There's also a kid named Denny (Haldiman), Johnny's neighbor whom Lisa and him treat like a real son. I use the term \"kid\" loosely. We don't know how old he is, if he has parents, or what his purpose is at all. At times, he seems like he could be a functioning adult, but at other times he acts like a curious ten year old.\n\nThe biggest problem, besides some of the most atrocious acting in recent years, is the countless number of continuity errors and abandoned subplots that plague the film like a virus. Not only does Wiseau seem mostly unfocused, but so does the whole script. There is an instance where Lisa's mom is talking with her daughter and brings up that test results prove she has breast cancer. Gee, that's pretty depressing and sad, huh? Would you believe Lisa doesn't even ask a single question afterwards? We have bigger topics to tackle. Like Lisa becoming uninspired and bored with her relationship.\n\nAnother scene that feels like it was added in during post-production is the scene where Denny has a violent encounter with a drug addict on the roof of their apartment. It's arguably the most interesting and climatic scene in the film, but we fail to garner any specific backstory. Just this rushed, deflated scene, and then it's on to the next anomaly of filmmaking, with this instance never to be mentioned again.\n\nThis is a cult film in every sense of the term, and the one star rating should not be viewed as a heavy one. I am inclined to review films based on whether or not they are good, and what I believe they rightfully deserve. The Room doesn't deserve a positive rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't personally enjoy it. It's not a good movie, but I had fun watching it and was never bored. I would almost go on to say its viewing is vital for those who are brave enough to hold out for it. Its comedic value is high, yet its quality value is shockingly low. I guess I can say I've never seen a bad movie this good.\n\nStarring: Tommy Wiseau, Juliette Danielle, Greg Sestero, Philip Haldiman, Carolyn Minnott, and Robyn Paris. Directed by: Tommy Wiseau."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love movies! I really do, and I am willing to watch almost anything because I believe even the worst films have at least one good thing about them. This film has nothing good in it. Nothing! This particular gem of awfulness was written, produced, and directed by a guy named Tommy Wiseau. He was also the main actor. No one knows where he's from (I think he's Eastern European), but he is such a terrible actor. Every line of dialog he speaks is emotionless, boring, and has this very snooty feeling about it. That's not even the worst part. He can't enunciate his words correctly. Not a single phrase is spoken correctly. It's so bad that it's actually funny.\n\nThe film is about a guy named Johnny, who works at a bank and lives in an apartment in San Francisco. He lives with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa, has a best friend named Mark, and a high school/college student named Denny who is is admirer. We never see Johnny at his job; we just see him play football in a tuxedo, and make passionate love with Lisa. However, Lisa becomes bored with him (how does that happen), and she cheats on him with...you guessed it, Mark. I think Wiseau was trying to make a drama about cheating and the negative effects of it, but the film plot is so full of holes that you won't even know what's happening half the time. At least the plot's slightly better than Uwe Boll's films, but that's not saying much.\n\nUltimately, even though I hate this film with a passion, I recommend that people go out and watch it. It's really interesting to see how this project went so bad, and it stands as a lesson to those who want to make movies. It's not as easy as it seems. Even though it's one of the worst films of all time, I recommend that you see it at least once. You'll thank me later.\n\nFinal Verdict: 1/10* Recommend you see it at least once."

The dialogue was clearly written by someone lacking fluency in the English language, there are subplots introduced then discarded, the acting is often wooden and uninspired...but it much, much greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nTommy Wiseau is why. He wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this unique film, and he carries it. Despite very little acting talent, and fleeting grasp on English, he has an inexplicable screen presence. He is one of those actors you can't take your eyes off of. I can't tell you the number of times I've watched this movie...and I love it every time.\n\nMy rating of 2 is a measure of the objective quality of the movie, but I assure you, if I were told I would only be allowed to see 5 movies before I died, this would be one of them (also, a middling movie gets no attention...one of the lowest rated films ever will get noticed).

        "review_detailed_main": "To sum it up briefly, it is like staring into the eyes of God and having Him say back to you, \"You are my my beautiful creation.\" Much like the followings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Room is quickly gaining a following that will go down in underground cinema history. I just recently saw this movie for the first time, and am already hooked. I cannot wait till next month when it will be shown in Hollywood again. Don't expect a good movie by any means when watching The Room, but instead, expect a movie going experience that you will never forget. Just hearing the comments veteran Room viewers yell out at the movie screen is enough to make you want to come back for more. The movie has NO CONTINUITY WHATSOEVER. It appears that the movie was never edited and that scenes are completely out of place, or in the movie for no reason. Several shots are reused scene after scene to save money on production costs. Yet, these things that are so wrong as far as regular movies go are what make The Room such a great movie. The fallacies are intentional and should be taken as such. Also, a big plus to the overall experience is the question and answer session before each screening by producer, director, writer, and lead star Tommy Wiseau. At least that is the case at all the Hollywood screenings at the Laemmle Sunset 5 on Hollywood Blvd. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet is to see it with a friend, or a lot of friends, so that you can crack jokes with them while watching the movie. Also, you must see the movie more than once, YOU MUST. The movie is so much funnier the second time. Overall, The Room really is the best worst movie ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "2003's 'The Room' is a difficult film to rate. I'd like to give it 10/10, but, unless you have at least a small understanding of the history of this film, you may be mistaken for saying that it's possibly one of the greatest movies every made, up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Empire Strikes Back.' I can assure you it's not anything like those films. In fact, although I'd still give it top marks, it should be noted that 'The Room' is only top of its own league in some alternate universe.\n\nIf you've ever watched a film that, deep down, you know isn't actually good - and yet you've taken a fair amount of enjoyment from it anyway, then chances are you occasionally treat yourself to a 'so-bad-it's-good' sort of movie. If you have then you may get something out of this.\n\nI would tell you the story, only there isn't really much of one. At best it's a romantic drama about a couple - one of which is having an affair with her future husband's best friend. It all sounds pretty standard stuff for a drama, but it is one film that has to be seen to be believed.\n\nIt's awful.\n\nI literally cannot think of any positive thing to say about it. And yet I loved it. It truly is a carcrash that, if it hooks you, you will be completely unable to look away from. The acting - awful. The sets - bizarrely awful (check out the last scene where the spiral staircase has been boarded up and yet characters are still supposed to be going up and down it). The dialogue - cringeworthy. And the sheer randomness of scenes that don't go anywhere, coupled with new characters who just sort of pop up and then disappear again with no real explanation, all leaves you with more than a few question marks above your head.\n\nThe irony being that writer/director and (believe it or not!) 'actor' Tommy Wiseau actually thought he was creating something brilliant. However, only after 'The Room's' release did it dawn on him that people were mocking the film as it appeared to top more than a few 'Worst Film Ever' lists.\n\nNow 'The Room' is more infamous than famous. It even spawned it's own dramatic 'making of' movie - the excellent - 'Disaster Artist.' If you're into films then you should at least be aware of this film and the tales of how it came about. If you like your 'so-bad-they're-good' films then you'll probably stick with this one. It certainly will leave an impression with you - whether that's a positive or negative will be up to you."

It is a fantastic work of comedy, that is both dark, cringe-worthy and bizarre...all the ingredients to make it a hit in the cult classics hall of fame.\n\nThe storyline is simplistic, a love triangle between a loving fianc\u00e9e, his unfaithful wife, and his best friend. But the paper thin plot has complete irrelevance in this film, it has no bearing on the fact that this is a marvel for all the wrong reasons.\n\nA review cannot explain, or do justice to just how incredible this movie actually is. Just get a copy of this film at all costs...you will not regret it."

Please watch this film as it is a total train crash, there is no plot, the script is dire, bizarre set locations (living room or the roof), music is a mixed bag and the icing on the cake Tommy Wiseau.

        "review_detailed_main": "Many Indie films are overlooked for many reasons. Down-to-earth plots, non A-list actors, and avant-garde visuals. In retrospect, Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" is an indie film that is overlooked for all the \"right reasons\". It's a black comedy romance, that revolves around a love traingle between Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). The overall narrative is confusing with several subplots juggling around at the same time. Any movie-goer (even little kids) could point out all the plot holes and visual errors of this 90 min film. The characters are all from the stockpile of any movie clich\u00e9 one can think of. The dialogue is beyond the horribleness of a George Lucas (not to mention that most of Tommy Wiseau's dialogue is dubbed). Nothing is subtle in this film, any moment of awkwardness sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite these numerous faults, \"The Room\" is probably the most entertaining film ever made. I wouldn't be lying if I said I would watch this film over and over again and still laughing at Tommy Wiseau's odd delivery of lines and the awkward \"filler scenes\" that flushes away some of the drama. Tommy Wiseau may be one of the worst filmmakers in history. However, he should also be credited as one of the most important filmmakers who revitalized the cult followings of other independent films overlooked by the mainstream audiences and critics."

I know what you're thinking: \"you must be kidding, aren't you?\" Believe me. The room will change your life for the best.\n\nTommy Wiseau is pure genius. He has written, produced, and directed the best movie ever made, and I don't understand why the Oscars ceremony wasn't canceled in order to fully recognize the art that is \"The Room\".\n\nBefore I saw this movie, my life was going nowhere. I was living on the streets with no money and no reason to go on. But then I got the chance to see \"The Room\", and I instantly felt enlightened. I got the confidence to do something with my life. I owe everything to Tommy Wiseau.\n\nEvery aspect of this film is flawless; the character's are all lovable, the set is believable, the screenplay is phenomenal. The whole movie is a message to us all; that love is blind.\n\nSo please, if you ever get the chance to see this masterpiece, watch it. Then watch it again. Then think to yourself, have I really been living my life without the words of Tommy Wiseau to guide me? Then watch it again. And to all the haters of this movie, keep your stupid comments in your pocket! The Shawshank Redemption itself is no competition for this film.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is the best movie ever. That's a promise."

It's not deep, introspective, or worthy of any sort of serious thought or reflection, unless you're a complete idiot. Actually, the fact that I sat through the whole thing thinking that there may be some redeeming quality to this waste of time makes me feel like an idiot. The best part about it, if anything, was the fact that that tool blew his brains out at the end. I only wish that could have happened in the first two minutes.\n\nIn a film, people are supposed to act. I think the people in this film try to, but it doesn't work. Maybe the point of the whole thing was to show how not to make a film? Hmm...\n\nTommy Wiseau, your 15 minutes were done and gone after you appeared on Tim and Eric Awesome Show Good Job! (people with talent). See, in T&E ASGJ, when people act poorly, it's funny because they don't make an attempt at seriousness. You did, and it was just pathetic.

Instead just Youtube it. You'll get the full Wiseau Experience, but in 1/10th the time.\n\nP.S.

He doesn't understand the basic concepts of spelling and syntaxes, making him appear like a retarded grown man, or a confused teenager trapped in Ozzy Osbourne's body.\n\nApart from that, reviewing this movie is almost unnecessarily, because there's nothing to debate, there's nothing in this film to be criticized or explained. Anyone with 1% of movie culture can predict from the first 2 minutes that this is one of the poorest intentions of making a decent film. The cast, the crew, the editing, the music, the direction, the landscaping... it's just ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense at all, and that's why it's a funny and distracting film. Because every character or line on the film borders stupidity and non-sense. The hole concept of dramatic relationships and social problems becomes an artificial plot that fails epically at displaying any kind of emotion.\n\nVeredict: 30% - WATCH ONLINE The Room serves as a perfect Clase-B comedy for weekends.

As \"Rocky Horror\" did years ago, \"The Room\" has created a cult following of young people (mostly) who go to the film to make fun of the corny dialogue and silly premises. As with any \"experience\" film, the fun is that most of the audience has already seen the movie. They shout out the dialogue and give appropriate groans when the dialogue is exceptionally bad (which is almost always the case). If that is what you crave - a social interactive film experience - then \"The Room\" is your kind of movie. It has nothing else to offer... really. It is not an independent classic. It is not the great insight of a film genius. It is not the latest trend in cinema (although it closely resembles aspects of reality television). And, it is not a good movie. It is a very, very bad movie. But the experience is fun. Thus ended the lesson."

The characters all have NO motivation WHATSOEVER for ANY of their actions, which makes it look like they all were just making it up as they went along. You will never be so confused at the same time as being amused. It is that kind of movie.\n\nHonestly? You have to see it to believe it."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, what I took away from this film regarding the plot is this. Johnny is getting married to his girlfriend Lisa, yet she doesn't love him anymore, she has fallen for his best friend Mark. We know they are best friends because every time Mark and Lisa have sex, he says he shouldn't because he's Johnny's best friend, then he proceeds to have sex with Lisa. Everything comes to a climactic halt at Johnny's birthday party and the lies get unraveled.\n\nSo, for those of you not familiar with the film, let me give you a bit of information regarding the production and the final film itself.\n\nMost of the dialogue had to be dubbed, mostly for the lead actor (who is also the writer, director, producer) and most of it is out of sync. All of the cast, never acted before. The actor who plays Mark agreed to play the role 72 hours before filming began. The actor who played Peter, quit the production half way, so a new character was written and given all of Peter's lines. This character is never named, or explained who he is.\n\nNow let's look at the subplots, events that happen in the film and the impact they have on the story.\n\nLisa and her mother are discussing the party for Johnny, when Lisa's mother out of the blue says this: \"I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer.\" \"Oh, you'll be fine\" was the response from the daughter. The cancer is never spoken of again. One character shaves his beard and other characters decide to dedicate full conversations to it (to fill up time?). Characters are wearing tuxes and then decide to play some football in the middle of the street. I must have missed why they were wearing the tuxes, wedding rehearsal? Characters randomly drop by the house to see if Johnny or Lisa is home, it doesn't matter if they are or not, they leave a minute later and tell the person who answered the door to tell the person they said hi. Denny, a young boy that Johnny helped get a place and paid for, owes a drug dealer some money. After Johnny and Mark take care of the drug dealer, this is never mentioned again. I have no idea what happened to the drug dealer. Denny also apparently wants to watch Lisa and Johnny have sex. Characters missing halfway through, unexplained. The list goes on and on.\n\nThe first 20 minutes, there are four sex scenes. One of which uses the same shots from the previous sex scene. One couple decide to go into Johnny and Lisa's house to have sex, the don't live there, but they have easy access. Tommy Wiseau, the creator of the film, claims to have intentionally made a black comedy, this is BS. The film was clearly trying to be a serious drama and it fails at that. The acting, is well, terrible. The mother seemed to be the only one 'trying'. Well, maybe Wiseau was trying, I couldn't tell. His most emotional scene was his tantrum at the end, throwing things around and tearing the house apart. He looked like he was sleepwalking while he was doing it.\n\nI suggest playing a drinking game while watching this, with friends, not alone. Take a shot every time someone says \"I don't want to talk about it\", anytime Johnny laughs for no reason, anytime you see a football, anytime roses make an appearance, anytime someone says future wife/husband and of course, anytime something inexplicable happens. You'll be wasted within the first ten minutes.\n\nI don't hate the film, I adore it for the absurdity. He tried, failed and is now riding the failing success to the top. The film is considered a cult classic. The 'Citizen Kane' of bad movies and Wiseau is using that to his advantage, smart move. Had he tried to defend the movie, it would have turned into a Showgirls. I wish someone had given me 6 million dollars to make a movie. I would have turned something in better than this. The guy didn't know the difference between 35mm and digital, so he filmed the movie with both cameras side by side. Interesting way to do things, but not showing confidence in your actors there. At least one of them knew what kind of movie it was and split before the film was finished. I would even make a better alley way set.\n\nI don't really know what to rate it."

The love scenes are some of the most difficult viewing ever put to DVD. And the rampage of Johnny is just so staged. Football seems to be everywhere for no reason. Lisa's mother...

        "review_detailed_main": "Have you ever been asked by a good friend to come to see him at an open mic night or to play a couple pieces before another band? Being a nice guy you agree and show up to lend support, your friend gets on stage...and proceeds to destroy all of his chords, screeches his lyrics in an off kilter voice and generally makes an idiot out of himself. Everyone around you is booing and perhaps throwing small projectiles and you're left unable to boo (after all, your friend is now staring at you for support) and feel sort of unpleasantly helpless.\n\nThat's exactly what this movie is, and it's the fact that it FEELS like the guy who came up with this actually was trying to do this heavy artsy piece and everything about it completely falls apart at the scenes. The acting is pretty much all around atrocious, our \"lead\" is just horrific...HORRIFIC...he brandishes his lines like a child with a sword, jumping from complete and utter ambiguous detachment \"everything will be fine\" to completely off key bursts of anger. Of course he isn't playing off gold here, the sets burst from one scene to the next...one minute we're on a rooftop and suddenly we're in a living room and everyone's wearing tuxedo's, and now we're leaving to play football. Characters come into a scene where two other characters seem to be standing pointlessly at a wall, they'll spout one line and then they're gone and the next scene is off and running. There's no introduction to any of these people, I'm not given any reason to care at all about any of them. Plot points are introduced and dropped two seconds later, never to be heard about again...everything about this film is jarring and flat out poorly done.\n\nIf you INSIST on seeing this I'd recommend spending the extra couple bucks and buying the Rifftrax shot at this movie. Doesn't make the movie GOOD but at least makes it watchable and funny."

The whole time I was watching it, I felt like I was sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off. Keep an eye out for the spoons in the background. The best way to experience this movie is at a midnight showing, which I have yet to do. It is a similar experience to The Rocky Horror Picture show. A cult movie of (bad) caliber."

        "review_detailed_main": "...or some such Dali-esque response seems fitting. For. Tommy Wiseau may not be exactly wise but he certainly scored an unlikely triumph with this crapulopus. He authored a movie that became an international phenomenon, a cult hit in the theatres of LA, and went on to be the subject of a bio-pic made by Hollywood A-listers (The Disaster Artist). A dream was realised in the best Edward D. Wood tradition. The Room, for many commentators, replaced Wood's magnum crapulopus, Plan Nine From Outer Space, at the bottom of the void as Worst Movie Ever Made. The difference is that people get a huge kick out of watching a film whose eccentricities make it downright enigmatic.\n\nTommy, who wrote and directed, plays Johnny, in a relationship with Lisa, who wants to leave him for his best friend, Mark. There's also Lisa's mom, who acts as Johnny's cheerleader, and Danny, the young milksop who keeps turning up for no reason other than, one presumes, the farfetched dream of getting into a threesome with Johnny and Lisa.\n\nI was going to quote some of the dialogue in this review, but why spoil the surprise? The Room has acting that would better suit a XXX movie, and a script and direction which represent the perfect guide to what not to do when making a movie. Right from the opening titles, naively intercut with images of the San Francisco Bay Area, through to the first of several preposterous sex scenes, the non sequiturs in the dialogue, the corny music, the mysterious sight of several men in tuxedos tossing a baseball about on their way to...um...somewhere. And what is this muddle really about? Who is Johnny, who Lisa, who Danny, and who were we when the movie started, or when we bought tickets, and what have we become?\n\nIn the long run, there's a kind of integrity to The Room's uniquely peculiar brand of obscurity. Audiences in USA fell off their chairs laughing at this in late night screenings, and why not? It's so inept its breathtaking. It just makes you want to fathom out the auteur's vision, to ask Why of every decision. Unquestionably a disaster as a movie it was also a triumph for the artist, and how such can be possible is a mystery we may never resolve."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the hardest films to review. On one side, this is one of the worst films of all time, no doubt about it. But on the other, it's somewhat enjoyable to watch because of how hard everybody fails. I review films based on their quality and what they were trying to accomplish, so this review will treat this film just like any other. So get ready to read a nonstop list of how much this film sucks.\n\nThe barely coherent plot starts out in San Francisco and follows our main character, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), as he tries to please his \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) who is having doubts about their relationship. Johnny is as \"all American guy\" who loves freedom, football, and fun. Accompanying Johnny from time to time and filling the story with so many needless subplots are his best friends Mark (Greg Sestero), Denny (Philip Haldiman), and Peter (Kyle Vogt). All I'm going to say is that stuff happens throughout, but it's so stupid that nobody cares.\n\nTommy Wiseau fills in as the star, director, writer, and producer for his passion project. It's good that he took on so many roles because it saved a couple of people the embarrassment of being a part of this film. The writing, pacing, and just about everything about this film could have been done better by a twelve-year-old. We end up watching softcore porn for the first twenty minutes of the film as three different sex scenes occur right after another, each one filled the worst R&B music ever. Characters appear in scenes for no reason and some characters just show up without a name or relationship to anyone else. It feels as if some random people got lost and accidentally ended up in the shot.\n\nThe absolute weirdest thing about this film is that it is 99 minutes long and barely has enough content to fill a poorly written short. Scenes are needlessly overlong and subplots are added for no purpose or resolution.\n\nOne could say that this film has an uplifting message for all film students out there. Tommy Wiseau was a passionate man who simply wanted to make a film, and with a script, he wrote himself and $6 million (seriously) he made The Room. If Wiseau can follow through with his dream and make the worst movie ever, then anybody can make their dreams come true.\n\nThe acting in this movie is the best part about it but, just like everything else, for all the wrong reasons. Tommy Wiseau claims he wanted to channel James Dean in his performance, which is somewhat evident. The only problem is that Dean was a great actor and Wiseau is not. Tommy can't speak lower than a yell and can't speak English well enough to deliver a sentence. Greg Sestero, Tommy's on screen and real-life best friend also had a dream of being on the big screen. The good thing for him as is that he accomplished his dream, and he'll never have another chance to repeat it. He's bad, but he can say he's not the worst in the group. That honor goes to Juliette Danielle who probably says the same three lines of dialogue, with slight variations from time to time.\n\nWith the release of The Disaster Artist and the cult status The Room has achieved over the years, I would recommend this film for anyone who feels like they don't have what it takes to make it into the film industry. After watching this, you'll be inspired to make your own film. And hey, even if you fail, you'll know you didn't fail as hard as Tommy Wiseau and his small group of wannabe stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tommy Wiseau may be a genius somewhere inside of his mind. I would still be interested to see it leap out at us unsuspecting viewers. For now, we have The Room on our hands, one of those real marvels of bad movie-making. It's a hilarious kind of bad movie, where one can see that the actors are trying, for better or worse (no, usually for the worse) to act in a serious capacity in their characters. The Room was written as a play first, and it shows: scenes in rooms, scenes on a rooftop (and what a view, ho-ho), scenes in a field somewhere throwing around a football, and back to the Room again. And now it's being touted by its maker as being a 'comedy'. This is called 'after-the-fact' thinking. It was made as a drama, in all sincerity, and now it's a matter of saving face, it becoming a midnight movie, a riot. It's worth it.\n\nWatch it with friends if you can't watch it with a packed audience. It's that kind of bad movie, where one can marvel at how Wiseau managed to eff-up continuity, where actors are supposed to be in a scene, repeating things they just said, saying things that are inconsistent with things said before, characters who disappear for stretches and reappear as if they were just there in the room the whole time. I admire a filmmaker who can do something this wretched, since it shows that somewhere inside of this guy is a voice of an artist. Bad, misguided, and perhaps just untalented. But who is Ed Wood if not an untalented artist who had a lot of ideas and a lack of skills and where-with-all to do it?\n\nOh, and did I mention the film takes place in San Francisco? This point is hammered in so much you expect for Bullitt to roll over the hill at some point and run over one of the kids playing football. I could attempt to go further and describe the plot, but is there any aside from these several words: Johnny (Wiseau) has a fianc\u00e9 he loves, she's cheating on him with his best friend, and neither of them can commit to letting Johnny go. Nothing else happens except many scenes of talking; someone may have mentioned a chamber drama in comparison to The Room, and it's not far off. I imagine Wiseau is a big fan of Ingmar Bergman, specifically Cries & Whispers (red walls, anyone?), and if so, more power to him. That it's often so bad as to be unwatchable, when not crying-buckets-of-tears hysterical in its laughter-quota, should also be noted with that.\n\nAnd one more thing that needs to be said about Tommy boy: he's not a good actor. This is something crucial - he is an easy target for us folks who watch bad movies searching for the next bad actor around the corner. He's so awful not simply because of his lack of emotion in scenes, but how over-emotional he gets when, say, he channels James Dean, or at the end when he (in an act ala Orson Welles in Citizen Kane) tears apart the house at the end. When he enters on the screen it's like an 80's hair-metal cover band is missing its roadie, and he's still in training. He may be inept as a director, and writer, and casting agent, and especially at those sex scenes (good God, someone resurrected BoyZ 2 Men!), but seeing him in the titular lead role is about enough to drive most sensible human beings out of the theater in droves, or shut off the DVD and ask netflix if it was a mistaken delivery.\n\nFor the rest of us, however painful it can get, The Room is an entertaining debacle, poorly produced and all the funnier for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This new film by Producer, actor Tommy Wiseau, demands that you have a sense of humor. This black comedy includes the best cinematography of San Francisco since Hitchcock's Vertigo. Wiseau, a new and mysterious presence on the Hollywood film making scene, produced and stars as the lead in this roller coaster ride of emotions which run the gamut from hysterical laughter to gut wrenching guilt. Wiseau spoof's the Hollywood love story. It's a campy version of a Tennessee Williams film with a little John Waters thrown in. He wants everyone to see themselves. The lead actress is every guy's nightmare with a sexual taste for your best friend. This is a story about a nymphomaniac with great breasts and the victim who is clueless about her scattered sexual outlook about men. Worth seeing. It's now 2011, eight years later and I would never have believed that this problematic film would have become a cult classic,\"worst movie ever made\" with 12 midnight monthly showings around the U.S., all these years. Edward Lozzi & Associates PR, first crticized for promoting this thing, has been vindicated for helping to turn this nightmare into a classic."

I have very really laughed so much at a screwball comedy let alone a movie labeled as a romantic drama. Every single scene had me in stitches. Tommy Wiseau is either the worst filmmaker ever or secretly the comedic genius the world needed. I prefer the former as him genuinely thinking this movie was going to be great makes the movie a whole other level of funny. Trust me you want to watch this movie it is an experience you won't have with any other movie. So bad it's actually amazing!"

I am also not doing a Pros and Cons at the end because there is no point.\n\nThe plot has many subplots that aren't addressed throughout the course of the film, the characters have constant personality changes as the film progresses on and the acting is atrocious. All in all, the film is entertaining much like Sharknado. The amount of plot holes are tremendous.\n\nTommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, and Juliette Danielle deliver some of the worst performances Hollywood has ever seen. The acting is inconsistent and always sounds scripted and is always overacted.\n\nThe pacing is slow and for a film that is an hour and thirty-nine minutes long, it's an hour and thirty-eight minutes too long.\n\nSadly, the film is hilarious to watch and is probably one of the mist entertain movies I have ever seen because it is loaded with material.\n\nOverall Rating: 3.2 (This is only a 3.2 because it is hilarious and kinda entertaining)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally after all these years finally watched the cult classic \"The Room\" as it's a favorite for many art houses and independent movie chains as the film still has countless midnight showings. Many consider it the worst movie ever made, however after watching I disagree, as I liked it the film was blended with drama and twist of love and lust that lead to bad means for all involved as really it was a good black hearted comedy.\n\nSet in the city by the bay \"San Francisco\", Johnny(Tommy Wiseau) is a successful investment banker who enjoys life and love as he plans to marry his younger and sexy girlfriend Lisa(Juliette Danielle). However this is the game of life it's not always a bed of roses(unlike the love making scenes!)as lust, passion, lies, and betrayal take over.\n\nJohnny has a best friend named Mark(Greg Sestero) and all three become involved in a web a deadly game of temptation as these games slowly, but surely lead to loss for all involved. This film is a great take and spin on life, love, and friendship, as can anyone be trusted? It proves love runs deep, yet when lust and passion mix it's a deadly combination. Overall well done movie that teaches lessons in a painful way, and the movie is spiced up by love making scenes and the acting and on screen chemistry between the actors is good for a low budget independent that would become a historical cult classic."

        "review_title": "The king of \"so bad its good\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "The acting is so terrible and stale. The dialogue is awkward and doesn't flow. I dare anybody to do a drinking game - one shot for every time they say \"oh hi 'name'\" and 5 shots for the infamous \"oh hi Mark\" line. There is just no chemistry or emotion between the characters or actors. They just seem like a bunch of fake friends pretending to like each other. The characters themselves were just dry and colorless and had no dimension at all. The story itself is stupid. Maybe different story arcs looked good on paper, but the execution was poor. And to top it all off, there are a few more sex scenes than necessary.\n\nNow that the complaints are out of the way, let me give credit where credit is due: Everything that makes The Room bad is everything that makes The Room good.\n\nOf course it's a bad film, but it has its charms. The story of the Room was flawed, but it really did have some good themes in there, and its obvious that Wiseau tried his best to get different messages across, particularly through the use of Danny's character. Hearing about the making of the film is interesting as well and adds to the experience (watch Disaster Artist before and/or after watching the Room). My rating is 3/10 - 2 stars for the attempt of making a decent move, and 3 stars for Sir Tommy Wiseau.\n\nTommy Wiseau gave it his all in this film. He wanted to make a movie, so he did. Though I'm sure the movie upon release was received poorly, he continues to work to this day and has many beloved fans that follow this cult classic. It's honestly inspiring that he achieved success, but in a way he probably wasn't expecting. As low quality as the Room is, it was at least entertaining. I plan to watch other Wiseau films someday, just to see how much has evolved, and to support an independent film maker who dedicates his life expressing himself through the art of film."

As an actor he is bad but I do think that in the right context he could actually be kind of good. What I mean is that if you gave him an eye patch and had him basically play himself then he could easily be a villain in an 80s action movie. It may not be The Godfather but who cares.\n\nThere are tons of movies that critics love and are very professionally made by very talented people that still end up being boring as hell (cough Oppenheimer) The Room on the other hand is terrible and everyone knows that but people still love watching it decades later.\n\nIf people could get over their snobbery they would have to admit that it is a great movie in the sense that it is constantly surprising and unintentionally hilarious. I'll take that over some pretentious black and white crap about the holocaust any day."

This film spits in the face of what we have come to expect from movies nowadays, because it is so bad it makes you appreciate the salient techniques used in feature films that are often overlooked. \"The Room\" actually becomes really comical once you accept it for what it is. Its not meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster, but simply a satirical drama to make people appreciate the hard work that goes in to making a good film and how terrible and corny a film can become if its not carefully rendered to fit the public's expectations."

'The Room' can restore that appreciation, not from any virtues which it possesses, but from the lack thereof. In short, The Room is an object lesson in what results from a production lacking artistry. This includes the performances, the script, the photography, the editing, the soundtrack....All these elements lack artistry in this film, and the results are so sadistic, that one will never lack an appreciation for good filmmaking ever again after seeing this movie. Some have described it as a traffic accident. I don't think this really does it justice. You might recall an accident in upstate NY a few years back. It involved an intoxicated mother carrying 5 or 6 children that collided head on with a vehicle with a father and his son riding in it, in which everyone but one child in the mother's car was killed. You catch my drift....After watching The Room, I don't think anyone could ever again be under the impression that good films just happen, or that making films is easy, or that little effort is required. 'The Room' will forever remain a testament to what the art of film sans 'art' is: and for that we owe the producers a debt of gratitude."

For me Urban Menace is a for more worser film, a film so bad it has no redeeming qualities.Even Plan 9 From Outer Space is worse.I think a lot of people are told what to like and dislike by the media & the internet (the average Rocky Horror Picture Show is a case in point.) People watch The Room 30 times? Is that because they feel they have to to fit in with the crowd? I give this 5 stars...the endless love making scenes were terrible and I found Lisa a bore but for me every scene with Tommy Wiseau made this DVD worthwhile.He reminds me of Christopher Walken's talentless brother who can't act or direct.The end scene with him is marvelous.\n\nI would recommend this film, it made me laugh a lot but as Chuck D said : Don't believe the hype!"

His \"sexy\" girlfriend is overweight and sits around like a third-rate porn star.

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess that unlike all the other reviews I've done on this site, and I've done plenty, this one should be judged on its own niche merits (or lack of them). The Room is an unintentional disaster that makes it a compounded mess of a film that you just can't help love to watch, which is what has created the cult following. It deserves the poor ratings but that doesn't reflect the genuine joy you will actually get from this film, a kind of schadenfreude.\n\nTo summarise, if you take out any film making textbook and list the key needs for any films, this doesn't fit the bill. The end result is like a trifle without the jelly, using custard not made with eggs, and using pepper instead of the topping sprinkles. It really is that strange. Everything that could be done wrong has been (without intention too).\n\nThe main aspect that astounds is how the crew were awarded $6m to make this tripe! The lead is vain as hell, being the writer/director/lead 'star' in this absurd movie, yet for all his faults he has some charisma (best admired or humoured with from afar). He can't act, direct or manage. The story has lots of lost strands, the actors aren't even actors it seems, the settings are minimal and woeful, and the whole thing has lots of laughable dialogue (and I've never laughed at love scenes in a film so much in my life!).\n\nI watched this recently as part of a cult showing at cinema, with the spoon throwing and quote alongs, and I'd a great time. When you watch it for the first time, you can't but be carried along with the sheer audacity of what is in front of us.\n\nAdmittedly I'm not sure I'd want to do repeat viewings. The film is \"tearing us apart\", and is carried by the vanity and ineptitude of the lead who is pathetic but cult he is. He's a character and in this day of over managed productions, this is a crazy throwbacks.\n\nIn fairness, despite the tag, it isn't actually the worst film you'll ever see, there are big budget movies you'll see who are more deserving of that tag.\n\nSimply, get some friends, some plastic spoons to throw about and sit & watch this film. It's unintentionally ridiculous fun."

Tommy Wiseau created a film so terrible that it has become a laugh-out-loud comedic hit within a large cult following. The production of Wiseau's passion project is widely known as being extremely chaotic and itself a hilarious story, as displayed in James Franco's film The Disaster Artist. Horrible camera quality caused by use of mixing digital and film, terrible use of lighting, atrocious screenplay and performances, and countless horrid sex scenes make this film a Marvel unlike any other. One of the most entertaining comedies I could ever personally name, this disaster is a hilarious viewing experience to unlike any other."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room is famously terrible. First, it's amazing how the dialogue nonsensically bounces around topics yet also repeats earlier conversations, going everywhere and nowhere at once. Meanwhile, entire scenes are unrelated to the narrative while other scenes are copies of previous moments. Plot points are introduced and instantly abandoned. Characters' actions are inconsistent and illogical. This is amplified by the fascinatingly bad acting, particularly Tommy Wiseau's. His energy level is often inappropriate and his transitions between emotional beats are comically unnatural.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, The Room has slight merit but only in a relative sense. The sound design is okay, but audio effects are overused and Tommy's dubbing is hilariously unconvincing. The camera framing mostly captures its subjects, but sometimes action is outside the shot. The musical mood is usually in the correct ballpark, but the end credits song is an R&B ballad that doesn't match. Lastly, the production design looks like actual sets, but they're cheap and poorly dressed. Ultimately, The Room is a symphony of disasters that is quite fun to laugh at. It's not for everyone and it's certainly not conventionally good, but The Room is a glorious wreck.\n\nWriting: 0/10 Direction: 0/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Acting: 0/10 Editing: 1/10 Sound: 1/10 Score/Soundtrack: 1/10 Production Design: 1/10 Casting: 0/10 Effects: 0/10\n\nOverall Score: 0.5/10."

The tradition started with Plan 9 from Outer Space and moved through Manos Hands of Fate, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and, in the modern day, Sharknado.\n\nIt is not totally clear if this movie, The Room, falls into that category--it is so bad that you wonder if perhaps the director has a secret genius and is doing a spoof of said movies, or if his psycho-\"drama\" love-triangle flick is just an earnest attempt at real cinema. Probably the latter, since the dialogue, story and characters of this movie are so amateurish, so far-fetched, and so talent-less that it simply could not be. No spoof could be this brilliant. It is just horrible. The mounting \"tension\" as the love triangle gets ever more exposed and gives way to ever more ridiculous situations and acting, is a beautiful thing to behold, as it is executed with complete earnestness. We watch dumbfounded, and occasionally drawn into hysterical laughter.\n\nWhich brings me to the main reason you should watch this movie. It is hilarious. And it gets funnier as it goes along. And at the end, without tripping the spoiler alert, I can tell you that the last scene is one of the funniest I have ever seen in any movie in my entire life. My son and I, when we watched it, were falling off of our chairs in tears and could barely avoid having an asthma attack, we were both laughing so hard. I never thought I would see a film that could surpass Plan 9 for its campy hideousness, but this is the grandaddy of them all. Please watch The Room, it will take you away from your dreary life and put you into humorous ecstasy."

Thank you Mr. Jimmym, your review actually set loose a bit of that Wiseaunian wtf syndrome back to me, it was almost like watching bits of the movie for the second time.\n\nSecond of all, I loved this movie. Yes, I gave it a 10 star rating. Yes, I would do it again if I was just watching the movie for the first time. Yes, I am serious. This is in no way a mocking business.\n\nThird of all, thanks Mr. Wiseau for existing. I will not write any spoilers, for I'm afraid someone might bump into them accidentally, and that could ruin someone's experience. All I want to say is, if there is such a thing as a religious experience, watching \"The Room\" is the closest to that I'll ever get. It is a whole new dimension of being, feeling, existing. Could it be the twilight zone? Could God have come to earth? Could I be closer to something? Further away? These are all good questions, and there are no final answers for them. Therefore, these questions don't really matter. What matters is, I never felt so closer to myself and so further away at the same time. I often felt like I was watching a movie with aliens that were trying desperately hard to imitate human's life, but couldn't, or failed for a bit. There's something that's off, but I can't pinpoint it, I can't put my finger on it and say \"this is what's wrong!\": and that's the beauty of it. Mr. Wiseau was right, on an interview he gave about \"The Room\": you have to watch this movie at least twice, you won't understand it the first time. I've seen \"The Room\" 5 times now, and I still cannot explain in words the way I feel, nor can I explain what the movie really is, or what it is really about. Mr. Wiseau also tells us that this movie is meant to teach us something, to teach us to be better persons because, quoting \"If I lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place.\"\n\nI am not sure if watching \"The Room\" made me a better person. Although, I can honestly say, it has made me a happier person. And that my friends, is a precious beautiful gift. Let's hold on to this happiness forever and rejoice in it. May Mr. Wiseau be in our thoughts. Amen."

This 2003 movie with a 6 Million Dollar Budget has been memed on to death, had a enticing documentary and book surrounding its creation; and with such a insanely chaotic and toxic production, its amazing that this film ever made it to the big screen, even if it only ranked in $1,916 initially.\n\nBeing a passion project of the Writer, Director, Producer, and Lead Star Tommy Wiseau. The Room is so astonishingly terrible and the writing is so open-handed that it almost becomes a character study of him. You see how he views America, what he views as a normal 'american' friendship as they toss footballs in a alleyway over and over again, and you even get a sense of his past and his views on women with his portrayal of Lisa as a character. Despite being a R-Rated film, there's almost a child-like obliviousness to this film with how characters have unexplainable mood-swings and one-dimensional personality traits.\n\nWhile its attempting to be a tragic story, The Room is so abysmally bad at what its trying to convey it loops around to being the perfect comedy. The performances leave nothing to be desired because the pure insanity behind the script and their acting creates scenes that are truly unforgettable; and when the film manages to accomplish something good, whether it be the grande & epic score or the occasional good looking shot. You will be impressed with the little things it sometimes gets right admist the flames of a terrible movie.\n\nIf you are studying film, watch this movie and watch / read The Disaster Artist. Everything falls apart so magically that it not only creates a unforgettable viewing experience, but one that emphasizes the importance of a strong and unified team. If you feel your production is anything like The Room, then run away as soon as you can."

While initially ridiculed by the viewing public, The Room later attained cult status for its consistently uninspired scripting and second-rate acting. The peculiar constancy of its grade-B qualities derives from Wiseau's East-European origins, origins which bestowed a subtle, but pervasive cultural dysfluency that bled over not only onto his screen play, but also onto his spoken lines. The flattened affect attendant on this dysfluency gives The Room an aura of incompetence and a soap-opera-like character. The Room ultimately inspired the 2017 movie, The Disaster Artist, which details the story behind Tommy Waseau and the making of The Room."

Everything is in this bizarre uncanny valley of being close to correct, but not at all.\n\nThe best way I can explain this movie is that it's the difference between someone saying \"I've got a fire in my belly\" (meaning that they're motivated) versus saying \"My stomach is on fire.\"\n\nI gave this film a two star rating because of things I would consider more objective. It's poorly made overall, but there are some shots and choices that are actually very smart and done well, even if I suspect they are accidental. That being said, I've seen this movie more than some movies I'd give a nine or ten to and not once regretted it.\n\nI love this movie. Despite the two star rating, it is one of my all time favorite movies to watch. Every time I see it, there's something new that pops out at me that I didn't notice before. Of course, it started out as an ironic love, but it's developed from that into an unironic adoration and appreciation of this movie that I don't have for many other movies of this kind.\n\nTommy Wiseau has since come out and said he made the movie as a comedy. I don't believe him, but if it turns out that it was, then he is an Andy Kaufman level of genius and dedication to character.\n\nI can't stress enough that I have never, ever been bored or disappointed by this movie. It's incredible. Watch it with friends."

People blurt out dialogue in scenes like they've been coached to say it as quickly as possible. Tommy Wiseau dialogue seems like it has been dubbed throughout as it goes in and out of sync.\n\nThe plot is non-existent and scenes don't seem to serve a plot they're just there. People come over to the apartment and then leave at the end of their scene which is usually 2 minutes after they arrive. Performances range from terrible to passable. Greg Sestero who plays Mark appears beleaguered throughout which is probably not acting but more the amount of work he was doing behind the scenes.\n\nAll in all it's worth seeing to prepare to see the dramatized making of movie 'the Disaster Artist.

Is there possibly some sadomasochistic comedy genius behind this film and it's train wreck film-making? It could help explain the reason why every month hundreds of people crawl out of the underground of Sunset Blvd to attend the Laemmle screening at midnight. But Tommy Wiseau seems to shroud his motives and background with nonsensical dialogue making the nail biting Q&A hilarious and disturbing at the same time. I can't explain the underground cult movement this film has picked up and I can't explain why I have the urge to go back. You did Tommy, you finally did it... you are starting to make some money back from the black hole of Independent film-making."

From the acting, which runs the gamut from deadpan to hammy to outright histrionic, to the repetitive scenes, which if edited out, might have left about 10 minutes of movie (how many times did we have to see the same tedious sex scenes with the flowers and candles and curtains?) to the preposterous characters and gobsmackingly awful dialog.\n\nAnd yet there is something mesmerizing about the very depths of awfulness to which this film descends. It has you gasping with shock, snorting with disbelief, and laughing out loud at the utter dreadfulness of this production.\n\nIf they gave an Academy award for awful, this movie would have taken it!"

I attended this movie laughing off all the comments that it was the \"worst movie in the world\" as screenings sold out virtually every month. It wasn't until I was there, fatefully making the mistake to attend sober, that I realized the only way you could sit through more than 5 minutes was to be drunk/stoned/both. I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented cult following complete will call back lines and spoons but for anyone expecting a movie worth crowds this size, don't go. The writer/producer/director/leading man Tommy Wiseau lacks talent in both his character acting (if you could even call it that) and writing skills. The self-financed \"The Room\"s shortcomings go way beyond the standard array of glaring continuity errors, dodgy sets and stagnant editing...it's hard to describe how bad the acting in the film actually is. I left the cinema not only wanting my money back but wondering why 15 minutes of the movie was spent throwing a football around on a badly constructed rooftop."

        "review_title": "A great experience with an awful film",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is seriously the worst movie of all time; there really is no contest here. The acting, the use of shots, the music and the overall premise is unbelievably bad. A love triangle between a banker, a hunk and a blonde woman is the plot of this film which has been likened to a play by the director, Tommy Wiseau. Unfortunately this same guy is the producer and writer. Oh, and he stars in it too.\n\nDo not go into this movie expecting the best romance ever made or even a decent romance for that matter. No matter how much potential each actor/actress holds, they all share the same emotionless line reading status. The main star of this film (and I guess rightly so because of how awesome he looks) is Tommy Wiseau who plays Johnny, a banker and lover. It is fair to say without insulting anyone that his accent alone makes the movie. His pronunciation of words and sentences has become standout moments in their own sense. Accompanying him and the other range of characters is a green screen backdrop overlooking a very bland looking city. Despite being called 'The Room', the apartment and the roof play big parts in this movie themselves.\n\nOne of the worst things about this movie is the music throughout it. Despite the movie being a romantic drama, the dramatic piano theme that would be much better suited to a TV movie about hobbits, keeps coming back to annoy us viewers throughout various points in the movie. In the opening it works quite well and sets the scene but then it gets boring very quickly and it is ridiculously overused. If I see this next time then I will be tempted to start a drinking game involving the times this theme appears in the movie! The music is so laughably bad in parts of the movie (and by parts I mean the whole thing) that this makes the movie more laughable than it already is. For example, music suddenly plays when one of the characters, Greg, enters the room and then suddenly stops. This is only one of the many instances when dramatic music is used out of nowhere for no apparently reason! When it's not cheap instrumental music, it's instead cheesy lyrical love songs that play during the clich\u00e9d sex scenes.\n\nAnother funny thing in this movie is the tendency to bring up random story lines and then get rid of them soon after. There is a breast cancer line spoken by the mother which is never referred to again in the rest of the movie. We are aware that it is a movie about love and not cancer, but if there's not going to be a resolution then don't bring it up to begin with. Another storyline that had a lot of potential to interest us viewers above the main storyline was Denny's drug money problems. A random thug appears on the infamous rooftop where he threatens Denny with a gun however after a commotion this is never talked about again. And what's with the couple who feel the need to make love in Johnny's apartment before Lisa and her mother arrive?\n\nThis brings us to another problem in the movie. Many unimportant elements such as the random couple are focused on too much in this movie. The movie focuses on the couple's attempt at love-making for a few minutes which made me think that perhaps these are two other important characters in what could be a separate plot. But nope. They are just simply secondary characters who are never really focused on again; meaning the need to show them at all is simply pointless. In a caf\u00e9 scene, we are forced to sit through the orders of four random customers before Johnny comes into the scene! What is the point? Add to this the countless establishing shots in between more important scenes and it's fair to say this movie focuses too much on what shouldn't be focused on.\n\nThis review could go on forever because there is a lot to say about this movie. And none of it is positive. However negative this review may seem though, this movie has actually given me one of the most joyful movie-going experiences in my life. I would pay over and over again just to see this movie. It is full of unintentional laughs because of its bad direction, terrible acting thanks to our star Tommy Wiseau and the unforgettable music. And for that, I want to thank Tommy for giving us a perfect example of not only everything a movie should never be; a good lesson to filmmakers and audiences alike, but also for giving us one of the best unintentional comedies of all time. I recommend this movie for a good time, and a good time only. Definitely a movie worth paying for if it is playing in your city."

This one isn't exactly on par with Battlefield: Earth, this one is at least enjoyable. It is funny through it's stupidity. When this was first seen, most likely by the critics, laughed at it. Out of embarrassment, Tommy Wiseau claimed it was a Black Comedy. It was marketed as a Black Comedy. That's kind of like making \"Inception\", and then releasing it as a chick flick. Acting was very paralyzed, Every time there was more than two people in the room, one of them would say \"I have to get going\". Everyone is always coming in and out of Johnny's apartment, Lisa's mother makes a comment about how \"it's like Grand Central Station\". People are constantly looking directly at the camera, Kyle Vogt, one of Johnny's friends, does this excessively. Almost all of Johnny's diologue is ad libbed in to the final print, he constantly looks like a fish.\n\nAll in all, The Room is a terrible movie. I gave it a two because it is hilarious to watch and make fun of. 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is very rare for a film to have such notoriety that it is considered one of the worst films of all time yet there is an Oscar Winning film about the making of said bad movie. Sure, we had Ed Wood (1994), an Oscar Winning film about the king of bad film-making, but that is about it. Tommy Wiseau will always be one of the most interesting men in entertainment history. His backstory is sketchy and no one really knows anything about him. I wonder if he meant to make a film so horrible or was it an accident. It's been said that he called it a drama until the internet collectively dismissed it a serious movie. Wiseau cast himself as Johnny, a banker from San Francisco, who is in love with girlfriend Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Lisa is bored of the relationship and has an affair with Johnny's friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Johnny for the longest is oblivious as to what is going on around him and he desperately wants to keep Lisa in his life and marry her. There is also a young man named Denny who follows Johnny and Lisa around and has a drug habit that the others aren't aware of until almost the end of the film. The story sounds like a basic romantic drama, sure, but it is filled with painfully odd and unintentionally funny scenes. There are extremely long sex scenes where we get to see a little more than we need to see if Wiseau. This film is the very definition of absurd and many people love it for that reason, but honestly when I sat down to watch the whole film I was kind of bored. I had seen the infamously funny and bad scenes online beforehand, and most of the film includes scenes like that, but it's actually a little boring in my opinion. That being said, I think Wiseau is a genius in a way."

        "review_detailed_main": "10 stars, no question, and I'm not being facetious. In its own unique genre of film (and it may be the only specimen in its genre), this movie reigns supreme. It's challenging to describe The Room. Yes, it is a terribly made movie, from every possible angle considered. And yes, it is terrible in a hilarious fashion, due in part to Johnny's extraordinary appearance, timing of delivery, accent, facial expressions, etc. What makes it better than other \"bad-funny\" movies, though, and even better than many \"real\" movies (yes), is that it excavates a small permanent space for itself in your brain upon the first viewing. You will be morbidly intrigued by producer/writer/director/lead actor Tommy Wiseau, not to mention his surrounding cast, and you will have many questions about the film. These questions will remain unanswered even upon repeated viewings. So you will scour the internet for anything you can find on Tommy or his film. His interviews will confuse you further. Every time he speaks, his words are so complex with oddities that you seriously don't know what to laugh at first. Tommy IS Johnny, or so it appears. This will lead to somewhat of an obsession, which is fine, as the film's cult following will welcome you. You will tell your friends about it, and each home screening will draw a larger crowd, but sometimes you will crave a solitary viewing late at night. And in some cases, you will even attend a public screening with a group of friends at your local theater tomorrow, with Tommy himself in attendance.\n\nNot many movies have this kind of impact, be it intentional or accidental. And that brings up another important question--was this movie a truly naive attempt at film, resulting in a purely accidental masterpiece? Or is it a masterfully crafted parody, so perfect in its subtlety that it masks Wiseau's wry comic ambition? You will ponder this question incessantly, thus exalting the movie to a platform of philosophical debate. Are we laughing at Tommy or is he laughing at us laughing at him? And if we are laughing AT him, does this make it a failure and/or make us mean spirited? Many comedies fail to make us laugh this hard at all. So regardless of how the laughs are achieved, this movie is undeniably a comedic success. Maybe we are just laughing at the movie's uncanny achievement and not at Tommy personally? And if the joke is on us, is it still funny? If this is the case, it's a brilliant satire of bad movies. Tommy wins either way. Perhaps this is the next frontier of comedy. Hiring rare, eccentric amateurs like Tommy to make serious films, and thereby effortlessly creating comedic gold. It'll be the next wave of reality TV.\n\nBut for now, believe the hype and just see The Room. It generates the same personal reaction of awe and wonder that is usually reserved for the great classics of cinema. It is both entertaining and mind bending, in ways you'd never expect."

        "review_detailed_main": "Things I love about this movie: -Tommy Wiseau resembles an uglier more disfigured version of Frankenstein's Monster -All the sets are made out of popsicle sticks -Every actor is a washed up former porn actor...Including the 75 year old grandma -The 5 lead male characters are unable to throw a football more than two feet -The 12 year old boy from The Brady Bunch is a hardcore heroin dealer -Everyone at all times \"has to go\" in the middle of important conversation or just seconds after they entered scene. -The \"seductress\" who is \"so beautiful\" is actually a hippopotamus with fake tits in a blonde wig -The grandma is the biggest gold digger in the game (BEWARE!) -Somehow an absolute imbecile numbskull r\u00e8t\u00e1rd\u00e9 like Johnny went from being a hotel bus boy to a high powered extremely wealthy banker in the matter of 5 years -All the horrendous clothes Johnny wears are 8 sizes too big, wrinkled, and ill fitting\n\nIt's hard to take the film seriously when the main character is a disfigured Frankenstein with lopsided shoulders, a melted-wax-sculpture face, and speaks like a molasses monster. How can this man go the entire movie without moving one muscle in his face besides his mouth. On top of his physical attributes, Johnny may be the worst dressed human being in the universe.\n\nThe film is as if an alien read \"American Culture for Dummies,\" wrote a script overnight, translated the script from Native Alien Language to English, and then neglected to have anyone look over and proofread the script. Every line in the film is a mixture of a cliche and nonsense.\n\n\"I would like a large pizza half canadian bacon, half pineapple pesto, light on the cheese\" WTF kind of pizza is that. \"Honey would you like pizza?\" \"Ehh not really, whatever\" \"Great, cus I ordered Pizza :)\" WhyTF you smiling when he said he didn't care for the pizza???.... *Pizza mysteriously shows up on table within 1 minute and its a SMALL CHEESE ONLY PIZZA no toppings in sight.\n\nHow to write this script: 1. Buy a book full of cliches 2. Cut out every cliche in the book and put all the pieces of paper in a hat 3. Blindly pick the cliches out of the hat one by one, and put them all in a row 4. Go through every cliche and switch 2 random words in that cliche to words that don't make sense 5. Congratulations you just wrote The Room\n\nBTW WhyTF is this move called \"the room\" that has absolutely NO significance AT ALL. My guess is that the entire film was shot in one room that's how bad the sets are..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The revival theater/playhouse near where I live is screening a 20th anniversary showing of this movie where they are charging $10 a ticket. Instead of going to that show, I found the DVD at the library for free.\n\nSo, where to start? The trivia entries for this title make for very interesting reading. While the end result seems like a project a group of friends did on a lark as an extended take on an SNL skit, the methods used for production (shooting on video and 35mm simultaneously), Tommy Wiseau's almost Kubrick-ian style of takes after takes after takes, and the fact that a simple film like this took six months to shoot means Tommy is talking out of his a%& when he said he \"wanted\" to make a bad-good movie from the word go.\n\nStill, it's also good that he made lemonade out of a lemon by participating in midnight showings and accepts his status as a modern day Ed Wood.\n\nYes, there are so many dangling plot threads one could knit a sweater, and what's up with the guys in tuxes playing football? But it does have a nice score though, and apparently Tommy knew someone who could play piano well.\n\nCinematically, the most competent part occurs at the end with a nice montage scene while the music hits a crescendo. Also, while it's thoroughly bad from the opening credits until the very end, it's entertaining and watchable, and that is huge feat even if Tommy achieved it by accident."

        "review_detailed_main": "What more can be said about The Room? Notorious for being one of the worst films ever made, it's received a second wind as a cult classic and to many qualifies as a so bad it's good flick.\n\nI half agree with that assessment. Yes there are famously hilarious moments such as the flower store and the football in the alleyway scene. However, there are also way too many boring scenes that aren't funny or entertaining.\n\nThe dialogue is bizarre, it makes you wonder if the script was written by aliens. The acting is also terrible, although the amateur actors that fill out the cast look like Marlon Brando compared to Tommy Wiseau. Anytime Tommy enters a scene he brings an element of chaos, as if truly anything could happen next.\n\nAs ridiculous as he is, this movie wouldn't be remembered if it weren't for Tommy. He is the only reason this is worth watching. The element of an overconfident, ego-driven weirdo thinking he's making some masterpiece is what makes this movie so irresistible."

The only reason i picked it up is because of \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017) - an upcoming movie about creation of this \"masterpiece\".\n\n\"The Room\" is hilariously bad - this is what happens when lead \"artist\" beyond the wheel without any talent tries to create something out of league. If you don't know how - maybe sometimes its better not to do instead of doing and then becoming a joke target for centuries. I do admire that Tommy Wiseau at least tried to so something he was passioned about nevertheless.\n\nOverall, there isn't much to say about this movie actually. It is hilariously bad picture, where nothing works, and its done so bad that i kinda watched scene after scene with my eyes wide open in disbelief that it can't be worse that this. This picture is funny in how it is bad, and that is the best one can say about this trashy little picture."

And wow, this character talks like he took lessons from Schwarzenegger and Stallone's School of English. So yeah, it's not hard to see why this film became a pretty big cult favorite. It's not often you see a film that is so bad. The captain of this ship is director/ producer/ writer/ executive producer and main actor Tommy Wiseau. Well, we don't have to spend a lot of words to describe the acting- part, seeing the guy can't even talk properly. And seeing the acting of all the other actors, it's safe to say Wiseau is as good as an actor as he is as a director.\n\nBut Wiseau probably sucks the most as a writer. I mean, has anyone ever seen something so incredibly stupid? Characters come and go, people talk about stuff out of nowhere and nothing seems to make any sense. The entire movie Wiseau and his friends (and a weird kid that should join forces with the kid from Burial Ground: Nights of Terror) just throw a ball, while his boring girlfriend is having boring talks with her boring mother about boring stuff. Wow, it's too bad this film only lasts for 90 minutes, I wanted to see more."

Then it can be hilariously bad, especially viewed with like minded friends , and/or alcohol.\n\nApparently the book has been made into another movie 'The Disaster Artist'.\n\nA cynical voice in the back of my head is asking, what if this is some big scam?

Usually, in such bad films, they include sex scenes for attracting viewers and that works in the case of most B movies. A significant achievement of The Room must be the multiple sex scenes that aren't remotely arousing even with enough nudity.

Or why Tom is so fascinated with the bridge? Or why did Tom's character Mark feel that Lisa had not had sex with him for a while when two out of the first three scenes were of their love making (which includes probably the scariest scene in film history: two repeated shots of Tom's butt when he is humping). Or why Lisa isn't happy with Tom? Or why was this movie even made? What annoys me is that Tom Wiseau called this a black comedy, when this movie barely is a film. I cannot really categorize this as a feature film as it does not deserve the recognition. I can only suggest a change \u2013 rename it as 'The Party' because the last few shots of the party scene is so memorable in its ineptitude and slipshodness that\u0085..

It teaches you the values of what to avoid and how NOT to go down Wiseau's route. The cinematography and lighting is pretty good but unfortunately my greatest criticism is Wiseau's input on the overall film i.e. directing, writing and even starring as the legendary Johnny. There are so many things about 'The Room' that simply doesn't make sense (lines of dialogue and even the plot). Mark's bizarre decisions in life, Lisa's motive to ruin people's lives and even choices of what to actually say like \"Did you get the promotion\" \"Nah\" \"You didn't get it did you?\".\n\nThe summarise it up. I would recommend 'The Room' to everyone simply because no one has ever seen anything like this before for it's 'originality'. It's not the worst film ever made, but I bet once you witness the magic, you'll never want to witness it ever again."

His final film isn't the drama that he wanted but watching it you can see how he wanted some of his scenes to just ooze tradegy and raw emotion (Your'e Tearing Me Apart Lisa!!) but Wiseau's execution fails to deliver this. The Room is not the worst film ever made but it sure as hell isn't the best either. It is just one of the most unique films ever made and viewings of it are more memorable and fun than viewings of other more mainstream films."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to add anything new to a movie that has been described as possibly the best worst movie ever made. It has been said to resemble a depiction of humanity as done by an alien who watched only 24 hours of our television, while others praise it as the best unintentional comedy ever made. Whatever the case may be, everyone who has ever used the term 'worst movie ever' on Godzilla, Waterworld or a Star Wars prequel/sequel should be forced to watch this movie and reconsider. Opinions vary on whether The Room is retrospectively brilliant in that it stumbled upon important themes of friendship, fate and betrayal, but it is generally agreed upon that its merits, bad or good, actively contribute to the fun of watching it. There's no better proof that entertainment can be independent of quality than this movie.\n\nIn the amusing 'making of' movie The Disaster Artist, it is postulated that writer/actor/producer/director Tommy Wiseau survived a major accident years before he started his magnum opus that is The Room. I am extremely curious to know if this is what happened in real life, because it would explain a lot. As a student I learned that paintings and drawings made by patients with mental disorders could often be used to perfectly exemplify what their ailments were. If this comparison extends to all art in general, including film, then The Room is a look into an extremely fractured mind. This should be mandatory viewing for every medical student who ever considers neurology as a major.\n\nBecause let's not fool ourselves: this must be the most disjointed and inconsequential movie ever made. Wiseau claims to have wanted to make a movie about 'human nature', and it looks like he decided to go through every type of human action and feeling imaginable in a mere 90 minutes, without any narrative, logical or dramatic cohesion. Normally, a plot is a course of events where one occurrance initiates another, but most of what happens in The Room is a non-sequitur. Of all the misery, joy and ill-defined stuff that happens over the duration of this movie, only a fraction seems to have any long-lasting effect on the plot or characters in one way or another. Drugs, disease, arguments, violence, love, sex and alcohol all pass by for the sake of human drama, characters come and go, but they are often forgotten by the next scene (or even in the same scene), to be never mentioned again or no longer be of significance. You could effectively edit out the entire second act without any negative bearing on the film's final act.\n\nThis is the kind of film in which people don't seem to be doing anything, yet they claim to be busy; where mothers in 2003 still urge their daughters to marry for financial stability rather than love; where one of the actors was no longer available, so they gave his lines to a completely new character without any introduction, and where there is always time for a game of football without any symbolic or metaphorical meaning. The royal amount of sex scenes almost begs a comparison with a lot of soft-porn B-movies from a decade before, but even those had better writing, acting and directing. As hard as it is to believe, there was even supposed to be a subplot about vampires that didn't make it. Too bad, because it would have made this movie brilliant in its failure over multiple movie genres.\n\nCoupled with his complete lack of talent in telling a story, Wiseau doesn't seem to understand what natural dialogue sounds like. Almost all conversations contain something ridiculous, overblown, pompous, inappropriate or nonsensical. Much of the movie's cult appeal comes from endless repetitions, e.g. that Lisa looks beautiful, Johnny and Mark are best friends, the world is treacherous and people don't want to talk about stuff. But the true gold is in such classic quotes like \"Oh hi, Mark!\", \"You are tearing me apart!\" or \"Why? Why is this happening to me?\" Granted, it doesn't help that there is hardly a decent actor in this film, but the bad script and even worse directing of the actors gives them very little to work with. Everybody seems to be going through a mood swing every two lines, and displays at least 10 different states of mind over the course of the film. Characters constantly contradict themselves or seem to have an extremely short-term memory. If there is one positive thing I can say about this movie, it is that the only things sillier than the acting and dialogues are the cheesy lyrics to the songs that accompany the gratuitious and protracted sex scenes (such as the text \"you are my rose\" endlessly repeated).\n\nThe only job where Wiseau fails even worse than as a writer or director is as an actor. The cult value of his portrayal cannot be overstated. He almost looks and sounds like a heavily drugged and sedated combination of Gru from Despicable Me with Loki from Thor, who is trying to impersonate Pauly Shore. It has to be seen to be believed. His final scene and the movie's finale is the stuff of talentless overacting legends. If you haven't rolled off the couch by then, you'll never will.\n\nIn conclusion, it is quite irrelevant to say that as a film, The Room makes every mistake in the book and is the most unlikely culmination of bad decisions that may have ever been made, since this is exactly the reason for what makes it so alluring. You can have discussions about guilty pleasures, but as long as there is no concensus on what constitutes great art, those won't be very meaningful. If cabinets made from wreckage and dresses made from meat can be forms of art, why not this dubious cinematographic experiment? Something so uniquely bad comes by only once in a generation. So is The Room a good movie? Not by a long shot. Does it make for interesting art? That's the idea."

        "review_title": "Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever seen",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ne day when I was at work, I was having a conversation with a coworker about bad movies. The \"best worst movie\" Troll 2 (known internationally as Goblins) came up. He mentioned a movie called The Room. I told him that the movie \"Best Worst Movie\" was made about Troll 2 and has the distinction of being \"the worst\". He then went on to tell me about the (then) upcoming movie The Disaster Artist, which chronicles the making of this shit storm.\n\nHe told me about the movie itself and I was compelled to see it. I've read about it on IMDb and Wikipedia and it sounded awful. I made it my mission to see this. I finally procured a copy and I'm now indulging in it as I write this. Where can I possibly begin?\n\nThere's a sex scene just after the four-minute mark. Everything else is almost laugh-out-loud bad. The acting, the music, the grunting and moaning. Everything. It's difficult to write this because the writing in this is beyond anything I've ever experienced. Calling it atrocious would be kind. To top it off, the camera goes out of focus periodically. Apparently, nobody bothered to check the lens, so this is a thing.\n\nMy God. Seventeen minutes in and so far there's been nothing but some minor dialogue and two sex scenes. Both scenes have horrible music and at the second one, the actors voices are dubbed over the music. You hear HIM say \"Oh Lisa\", but they're KISSING. This is like a bad porn movie from the early eighties (not the sex, the music).\n\nI have over an hour left of this appalling film. Check this out...I LITERALLY have to use a thesaurus because of how mind-boggling terrible this is. I'm pausing it at times to get my thoughts straight. Back to the bad sex scene. The lines are forced and the \"acting\" is wooden.\n\nWow. Fuck me.\n\nI appreciate Tommy Wiseau wanting to write, direct, produce, and star in his own movie. Independent filmmakers are among the people that I look up to the most. The greatest of them all is Roger Corman. He is (as far as I'm concerned) the Patron Saint of independent filmmakers. He's produced over 400 films, directed over 50, and turned a profit on almost every one (give or take a dozen or so). Tommy Wiseau is the modern day Ed Wood. That's actually an insult to Mister Wood because at least he had vision. If he had the budget that he needed, his films would have been science fiction masterpieces and not the schlockfests that they are.\n\nRobert Rodriguez (like Tommy Wiseau) financed his first film independently. That was a little film called El Mariachi. That got so popular that it spawned two sequels (Desperado and Once Upon A Time In Mexico). Robert Rodriguez is FUCKING AMAZING. I may not be a fan of everything he does, but HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING!!!!!\n\nFuck! Only twenty minutes in.\n\nOkay, who in their right mind orders a pizza with \"half Canadian bacon and pineapple and half with artichoke and pesto, light on the cheese\"? Do these people even know what pizza is? An argument can be made for the bacon/pineapple, but who puts pesto on pizza? Maybe it's a thing and I'm being too critical.\n\nApparently, much of the audio was dubbed which leads to the audio being out of sync.\n\nWhat the hell is this movie about? So far, it's been her having sex with two different guys, some pizza, and some horrific dialogue.\n\nSadly, for me, the BEST part of this Godawful movie is Juliette Danielle. She's very pretty and I like her topless scene. Too bad the THREE sex scenes in the first HALF HOUR were unnecessary . Being objective about the plot (from what I could gather), Lisa and Tommy are dating. He's her financial security and in line for a promotion. She no longer loves him and one day she gets him drunk and complains to her mother that he got drunk (he did) and that he hit her (he didn't). There's also this annoying kid named Denny who shows up at unnecessary times.\n\nIt looks like it's supposed to be about relationships, but there's NOTHING cohesive about this movie. There's a scene where Denny runs afoul of a drug dealer and the interaction with everyone is reprehensible. Lisa and her mom suddenly show up off camera and Johnny takes the drug dealer to the police, but the time it would take to actually do that isn't represented properly. He comes back about a minute later.\n\nThe CLOSEST thing I can get to a plot is as follows: Johnny and Lisa are lovers. He comes home and they have sex. Johnny's ward Denny wants to hang out with them, but they send him away so they can have sex. After he leaves for the day, she calls his best friend Mark and seduces him and they sleep together. After he comes home, they drink and have pizza, and then have sex again.\n\nLisa complains to her mother that she no longer loves Johnny and gets yelled at because she can't support herself. On a rooftop, Denny gets into an altercation with a drug dealer that gets interrupted by Johnny and Mark. Later on that rooftop, Denny confesses his love for Lisa to Johnny. Johnny says that he trusts her, meanwhile Lisa brags to her friend about how she's sleeping with Mark. The way people show up in this is like a bad sitcom. In fact, a laugh track would probably make this better.\n\nEarlier, I said that Tommy Wiseau was in league with Ed Wood. I was incorrect. The directors that are in the same category as him are: Paul W. S. Anderson, Vincent Gallo, and the infamous Uwe Boll.\n\nNot everyone should make movies and this is proof. It's further proof that if you don't know what you're doing, you should ask for help. There's no shame in that. Pride is a bad servant and a worse master.\n\nI feel that this review is a bit irreverent, but that's appropriate given the fact that this movie falls about fifty yards short of making any kind of sense.\n\nCurrently, I have about a half hour left and this movie has gone nowhere. There isn't a single character that I care about. The plot tries to make it out of the jumbled mess that is this movie. Sadly, there's only been four terrible sex scenes that are forced upon us. Only two are necessary for the plot to move forward and while I appreciate nudity, it's unnecessary in this. This would have been better as a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime.\n\nThe most ironic thing about this film is that there's no aforementioned \"Room\". According to Tommy Wiseau, the title is meant to evoke a safe place for viewers. Realistically, the BEST place for viewers is far away from this monstrous creation.\n\nI'm giving this 1 out of 5 reasons why you shouldn't let your curiosity get the best of you."

It has inspired lore and mystique around its creator. It is ultimately a subversive movie in its own right. In an era of cringe obsessed content consumers, Wiseau has outdone them with an ambivalence of intention. So many artistic decisions made in the movie are wrong, and yet they are unintentionally (perhaps?) all the RIGHT decisions to make this movie what it has become.

        "review_detailed_main": "Infamously terrible film. I must admit, it's funny, but, man, is it repetitive and boring. Wiseau, who speaks English with a heavy European accent, plays a thoroughly nice and possibly retarded man who is about to marry his longtime girlfriend, Lisa. Unfortunately, Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark. That's pretty much the entire plot of the movie. For 99 minutes, Wiseau stumbles around saying, \"Oh hai!\" to everyone he comes into contact with. Whenever he leaves Mark and Lisa alone in a room together, they start screwing. Their friends and relatives keep trying to convince Lisa to break it off with him, though none of them are good enough friends to just outright tell poor Wiseau. A couple of subplots get introduced, like Lisa's mother's cancer or Wiseau's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9's dealings with drugs, but they get dropped because the affair is just so damned interesting. The movie's sort of interesting psychologically, though pretty simplistic: Wiseau obviously based the script on his own insecurities (whether a woman ever cheated on him or not), and the film basically contemplates why he either can't get or can't keep a chick. Look up the funny moments on Youtube, but leave the actual film for the braver viewers amongst us."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room is the movie based on the book and theater piece by Tommy Wiseau, American immigrant and retail park manager, who wants to immortalize his romantic life, sexual hatreds and obsessions into a dark, twisted drama of betrayal. Its also a film that's so badly acted and produced that its generally hilarious.\n\nThere's nothing really \"cool\" about the Room, as some cult movies actually are, its just a story of an honest, though somewhat creepy looking finance worker, who's almost-plump suburban girlfriend Lisa has plans to run off with the guy upstairs. The rest of the cast is: Lisa's mother, a vengeful sexual predator with breast cancer and Denny, a wholesome American sitcom teen that wants to watch Johnny (Wiseau's on screen character) and Lisa having sex. Denny's also got some underhanded goings-on with a local thug involving narcotics, something that unravels dramatically on their buildings rooftop where much of the films conflict scenes get especially fiery.\n\nTwo points: this movie is filled with SEX, also its FUNNY AS SH*T, because the cast can't act and the plot points are all confused or very badly telegraphed.\n\nIts also worth 'splaining that Denny is sort of a surrogate \"little brother\" to Johnny, as he has no family of his own. Each scene sets Johnny up as selfless, idealistic, and an nurturing, except for one major event where he tries to fry Lisa for framing him for domestic abuse.\n\nThe movie cost a freakin' bundle: writer/producer/director/star Wiseau commissioned a steamy R&B track for the movie, and his crew an assorted costs crept into the millions, plus billboard advertising to promote his project. Clearly, they didn't have the basic technical know-how for getting the best from their equipment; the most telling sign being the visible interlacing throughout the film.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but I can add that personally, when I first found this film, I laughed uncontrollably for about a week and a half. Maybe a year or so later I returned to the movie, and it appeared to be littered with filler scenes, except for a few great one-liners. In a sense the film satirizes the fascination with love, betrayal and the sacred rite of bland, secure suburban fulfillment that's at the heart of a lot of TV drama and soap story lines. Its a funny movie, but mostly by accident apparently.\n\nA computer game and paperback novel detailing the films troubled production is available also."

And just wait till you hear some background information! Tommy Wiseau apparently financed this movie by selling leather jackets imported from Korea. An actor decided to leave the crew while filming, so they picked another person to finish shooting his scenes; because of that, we have two completely different people playing the same character. Doesn't this sound promising? The Room tells us about the life of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), a successful banker who lives with his soon-to-be wife Lisa (Juliette Danielle), has many friends and is loved by everyone. Unfortunately, his girlfriend doesn't love him any more and is having an affair with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who is constantly battled between his desire to be with Lisa and not wanting to hurt Johnny.\n\nEverybody agrees that nothing about this movie works. The story is recycled, the acting is bad and the cinematography is not worth mentioning. Certain scenes and characters are put into the movie for no apparent reason, except for making it last longer. The dialogue is repetitive and predictable. I guess you're supposed to sympathise with Johnny, because he's such a good, naive person being betrayed by the two people he loves the most \u2013 but you don't, because all the feelings in this movie are just words. But, after you get over the first minutes of confusion in the beginning, The Room is guaranteed to make you laugh really hard.\n\nBesides, this movie is a cult. Who could possibly forget the roof scene, in which Johnny talks to himself and later realises Mark is also present? The famous phrase \"oh hi Mark\" is used in this scene. Or all those inexplicable random football tossings, that once happened while the characters were in tuxedos? And of course, the flower shop, one of the most confusingly useless scenes in movie history. All this can be pretty frustrating to watch, but you shouldn't take it too seriously. If you don't, at the end you might even want to see it again sometime, maybe just to have a few good laughs and to remind yourself that it can always be worse \u2013 you could have been born as Tommy Wiseau!\n\nRating:2/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

The worst thing of all time.\n\nPlot less, ridiculously directed, the worst photography ever... everything is so bad that deserve such a under classed review as the one I'm writing in this moment.\n\nThere are a lot of bad movies which at the end are funny. I won't expend my time enumerating them. All of you know which those are.\n\nBut don't be tricked with this one. This film lets you with a great sensation of emptiness. I felt empty and sad during more than a hour after watching this piece of...\n\nAfter Reading some reviews and bloc entries about the \"cult\" status of this \"the room\" and the iconic shout: \"Your are tearing me apart, Lisa!\" plus the intriguing factor of Tommy Wisseau I decided to give a chance to the film because I thought that, at least, the laughs would be granted. Wrong.\n\nNot a single laugh in 90 minutes. Not a single emotion more than a progressive change of mood from apathy to depression.\n\nDoes it sound overreacted? I'll try to explain the reasons: 1-The acting of the entire cast is immeasurably bad. I don't know how much I going to live (I hope that at least enough to see another 1000 movies) but I'm sure that I'm not going to witness another acting such as crappy as this. 2-Tommy Wiseau. The first I saw his face was in a IMDb's user list and I must recognize that it captivated me. An enigmatic face, worthy of being typical evil troubled villain of a b-series bad movie. But I lost the interest for him in the very first scenes of \"the room\". The worst thing about his acting is he believes he is a first class performer whilst actually he is... he isn't even funny. It's a shame I can't use a better English in order to describe him 3-Was this nightmare's Budget 6 million bucks? In this moment is when I start to cry and when I feel that I would give a huge hug to Wiseau If I were to meet him someday because he's nothing more than a victim. A victim because the entire crew of the film laughed in his face. With 6000 dollars every user of IMDb with a Handy cam, a microphone, 6 Friends and a PC would have made a better experiment than this.\n\nIn conclusion, don't waste your time watching this. This film has nothing to show. Anything to remember. This is not a movie. This is not cinema."

I literally had really bad head trauma after watching the second half of this! The acting is bad, the directing is bad, the sets are bad, the editing is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the lighting is bad. And the worst part, is the writing! The dialogue is extremely atrocious that this film is excruciatingly BORING! I only laughed three times during the \"YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!\", \"LET'S TAKE HIM TO THE POLICE.\", and \"WHAT'S GOING ON?\" that Lisa yells while Johnny and Mark try to save Denny from Chris R wanting to kill him for not giving him his money back. Everything else in the movie, I was extremely bored, annoyed, and I also got extremely sleepy that I had to eat so much food in order to stay awake! This film also has so much disgusting sex scenes that I even felt a little traumatized. Not to mention, the music is also terrible! The classical music is so obnoxious that it makes me wanna destroy my own TV, but luckily I didn't do that. Tommy Wiseau is also a terrible actor. This is literally the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. I've never seen a movie this bad besides \"Cats\" (2019)\n\nI would not recommend this movie to anyone. This is not a \"So bad, it's good\" movie, nor is it a black comedy or a regular or decent comedy, this is a movie that should not have been made and that should be avoided at all costs. Don't believe all the hype and support, they don't even know what a bad movie is! You wanna see a good movie about Tommy Wiseau, watch The Disaster Artist and skip this stupid movie at all costs!\n\nThis film deserves less than a 3.6/10. It deserves more like a 2.5/10!"

Why, you may ask?\n\nThe factors of a movie that make it good, if done well, are good cinematography, good acting, good writing, and good direction. I think this movie excels in every single one of those things.\n\nThe Cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The way the camera gets blurred and shaky at random parts of the movie really gives you the FEELING of the trauma and stress that Johnny is going through, because this movie makes me feel the same way, confused, stressed, frightened.\n\nThe Acting is phenomenal and I'm stumped by the fact that none of the actors got an award for Best Performance. Tommy Wiseau's acting, especially, is absolutely stellar and 100% convincing, the way he puts absolutely no effort in any of his lines, like the \"Oh Hi Mark\" scene, is a creative and intuitive way of telling us about what his character is like.\n\nThe Writing is incredibly clever, and it really makes you FEEL like you are watching a movie about Aliens trying to pretend to be human. The dialogue is very consistent and totally doesn't have a million plot holes in every single scene.\n\nTommy Wiseau did a wonderful job at directing this movie. As I walked out of the theatre, I was looking for a bleach shop when I realised that this movie is actually a timeless masterpiece that will stay with me for a very long time. Sure, I burned the theatre down after watching this movie, but, I eventually did realize how amazing this master stroke of a movie really is. Bravo, Tom Wiseau."

        "review_detailed_main": "First ever full, front-to-back watch, despite being overly familiar with every last baffling line delivery and nonsensical plot point. Glad I got to experience Wiseau's seminal masterpiece on the big screen, alongside a theatre-full of audience members that seemed to know each and every frame. Slightly tiring, however, to have people laughing uproariously at a constant tempo, causing me to decide early on that this is the \"so bad it's good\" movie choice for boring people. It's had its time; watching this in January 2022 felt as though someone were making Chuck Norris jokes or fashioning shareable \"troll-face\" images - a little embarrassing. Nevertheless, I still found much of it quite funny, and it's hard not to with such a tremendous helping of incompetency on display: the stilted performances, obviously including Wiseau's own poorly-dubbed, awkwardly delivered (but in a different way every time) tour-de-force; the blatant green-screen; plot threads seemingly setup that then go nowhere (Lisa's mother had breast cancer, right?); random, unrelated establishing shots of locations that characters never visit (really gets a lot of mileage out of one clip of the Golden Gate Bridge); new people constantly appearing without introduction, then leaving just as soon (WHO IS MIKE?); the same three sets being used throughout; even the props are bizarre: stock photos of spoons framed around Johnny's home, and are they drinking Scotch topped with vodka? Needless to say, it's a bit of a mess, and certainly a monumental failure on every narrative level, if one can be so generous as to grant this film a narrative. Wiseau is the X-factor, the mysterious auteur at the centre of it all, a man whose accent is as unplaceable as his intentions, and as inexplicable as his budgetary sources. The self-aggrandisement is overwhelming, with every character insistent that \"Johnny\" is their best friend and the greatest guy you'll ever meet, always talking about him when he's not there, yet continuing to ruin his life regardless. The lengthy sex scenes set to borderline-parodic slow tunes are uncomfortable to sit through and indicative of the palpable male gaze behind every aspect of the production. Listening to the conversations Wiseau writes for his female stars is as enlightening as it is hilarious; in an attempt to portray some perceived, inherent unfaithfulness in women, he unwittingly reveals precisely why his relationships have likely failed in the past: he understands no one but himself (and a hyperbolically perfect version at that). Imagining what Wiseau thought he was making boggles the mind - some modern-day Greek tragedy, complete with irony and high drama, culminating in a Citizen-Kane-esque room-smashing scene; above all, a depiction of how Great Men like himself can be torn apart by all those conniving women. Therein, of course, lies the humour: the timing is so naturally comedic and the absurdity increases so surely that one cannot help but laugh at the disaster playing out on screen. It captures an odd kind of cognitive dissonance, the sense that one is watching something very closely resembling a film while so clearly not being one. That said, movies get worse than this - not much, but they do - the main theme in the score is decidedly pleasant and the camerawork, all things considered, is not the worst. (Apparently this was shot on 35mm and HD video. Simultaneously. Might as well have started a money bonfire while you're at it.) I suppose this is partially responsible for its cult status, as it's a lot more accessible than cinematic diarrhoea on the scale of, say, After Last Season. Why is it even called The Room? Perhaps a misspelling of The Roof, as they seem to spend a lot more time there than in any specific room. That's it, I'm done: rating 1/10 and moving on."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director/writer/actor Tommy Wiseau has created quite a movie experience with this. The Room has become a cult hit and now is shown in theaters where people yell and laugh at the movie, and really the unintentional humor is all this thing has going for it. The acting is just awful, especially from Wiseau, the direction is strange, as is the writing and the awful soap opera synth music. Everything about this movie is laughable, so it's good people have realized this, and Mr. WIseau has made a name for himself in the Ed Wood department.\n\nJohnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker who is engaged to his \"beautiful\" \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle). She is cheating on Johnny for Johnny's well intentioned best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who knows the whole situation is wrong. Also in the mix is Denny (Phillip Haldiman), a semi-retarded 18 year old who lives in the same apartment as the other characters. He gets into a pickle with a drug dealer. And Lisa's whiny mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) has breast cancer. And Lisa's friend and her boyfriend are making whoopee in Johnny's apartment while they are away. All these great sub-plots...none of which have any outcome on the film. Very strange!\n\nDiscontinuity is one of the biggest problems with this movie. Many sub-plots are introduced and then immediately dropped, including those mentioned above. Character traits are introduced and then forgotten, like Johnny's dislike for drinking alcohol, which is immediately ignored. Along with scripted discontinuity, there's plenty of bad editing to be found, where characters mouths don't match what they're saying, and where the characters bounce around the screen and inanimate objects move about the room. One character who is never introduced appears and begins yelling at Lisa, and the question pops up, \"Who the heck is this guy?\" But we never get the luxury of knowing his name. All we know is that he must be friends of theirs or something.\n\nThis movie is also notorious for it's horrible scriptwriting. Every time anybody sees anyone else they always say in a surprised way \"Oh, hi (insert name here)!\" This phrase must be used forty times in the movie. In addition strange and bizarre non-phrases are used, such as the ever popular phrase, \"Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!\" This film is riddled with nonsensical dialogue, and pointless scenes, and that's one thing that makes this such a hilarious film, is it's complete lack of sense.\n\nActing is another aspect that isn't this movie's strong point. Tommy Wiseau is undoubtedly the worst actor in the film, giving a bizarre droopy eyed performance where he not only gives bad readings, but makes some of the ugliest and most stupid faces you could imagine. Greg Sestero is a better actor but still not good. He seems to be a soap opera character, and reading that he has appeared in soap operas that makes sense. Phillip Haldiman's portrayal of Denny is probably second worst in the film. The character is absolutely idiotic and a complete perv, and the acting just makes the character all the more pathetic.\n\nDespite this film's weakness (everything about it!), this is really a funny movie if you can appreciate horrible cinema. This thing is just awful start to finish, and it definitely will have you at least smirking through most of it!\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins. R for constant sexuality, language and violence."

From there I had to download the sound board and instantly I was hooked. I had to get this movie no matter what the cost...and like the speed of Wiseau's painful laugh I had the movie in my hands a week later.\n\nThis epic adventure takes place in San Francisco, I believe, with a background soundtrack that spins the hits from those classic 90's cine max after dark flicks. Wiseau's screen presence is similar to that of Patrick on SpongeBob SquarePants, comical and ridiculous. I'm not sure where to begin because I'm not sure if this is meant to be a serious script or one of utter illusion and embarrassment. It's random scenes and even more ridiculous classic \"lines\" are so out there that you can't turn it off nor do you want to recommend it to anyone because you're afraid people will think you ate crayons as a child.....a lot of crayons.\n\nI think it can be summed up like this, The Room is a movie that you will watch to laugh, watch to cry, and watch to completely make yourself feel better that you were born on earth and you don't get fed crazy pills everyday."

There's also Johnny's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Room ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Johnny's existential catchphrase \"I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullshit, I did not hit her! I did not!... Oh, hai Mark!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tommy Wiseau's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes, by the way, I DO have a \"Oh hi, doggie\" scene tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Oh hi Mark.\") You just need to go into it with low expectations and be willing to embrace the cheesiness. Don't expect a serious drama. I do feel bad saying all this, because I believe the director was out to make a serious movie, and it gets shredded & laughed at. I hope that he can at least embrace the fact that although it wasn't the outcome he was maybe expecting, this is a much-loved movie because of how silly and bad it is. I'm grateful he made this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Few people will have watched this film without first having seen or read \"The Disaster Artist\" (or at least being aware of the story*). Without the context of 'star' Greg Sestero's 'making of' memoirs, \"The Room\" would be challenging to sit through. The film opens like a 'soft core porn' flic (reminding me of Showcase's semi-adult (and almost as unwatchable) \"Red Shoe Diaries\", 1992) but goes nowhere in the erotic department (although starlet Juliette Danielle shows a lot more skin than the film \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017) suggests). After the titillating opening scenes, the movie degenerates into a disjointed, almost plotless, tale of love, betrayal, and footballs. Having seen \"The Disaster Artist\" and read some of the on-line comments, I watched \"The Room\" with rapt attention, waiting for the iconic \"Hi Mark\"s, \"best friend\"s, neck lumps, BB guns, doggies, and (of course) footballs. This scrutiny doesn't make the movie better, but does make for interesting viewing and gives insights into how much craft must go into making a 'good movie'. Oddly, IMO some scenes might have been excellent in other circumstances (four buddies in rented tuxedos, stressed-out while waiting for a wedding to begin, retreat to an alley for an impromptu game of football could have been a memorable scene in the \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978)). Auteur, star, and bank-roll Tommy Wiseau is as interesting as the film itself and, of all the reviews that I have written on IMDB, this one is the most likely to be read by the reviewed film's director. Lacking the quirky goofiness or bloody excesses of legendary 'bad/cult' movies' (such as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959), \"Two Thousand Maniacs!\" (1964), or \"The Giant Claw\" (1957)), \"The Room\" would have sunk into the abyss of forgotten movies if not for \"The Disaster Artist\". Now, the film is celebrated as a cult film in its own right and, with one film, Wiseau may have become this generation's Ed Wood. *I think, but there are more than 100 reviews of the film on IMDB that date from before the 2013 publication of Sestero's book."

Once you've overcome disgust and second-hand embarrassment hard to swallow, you will take a wonderful trip through a hilarious failure, laughing all the time, shocked by the sheer power of surprise and waywardness of almost every scene you see. The director's foolishness is literally beyond belief.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nYou wonder how some actors and staff could resist Wiseau's erratic directing, or how he himself must have been unaware of everything. Then, you think of Donald Trump's presidency and start to feel sorry for the staff around him.\n\nYou will end up wanting to know more about the movie and Tommy Wiseau, and watching that disaster a third or fourth time to make sure you didn't miss some real gem of brilliant idiocy hidden in the background or between two lines.\n\nBest enjoyed with a couple of friends and a few light joints."

There is not a shred of artistry in what he puts up on the screen, nor any sign of talent over the film's 99 minute runtime. I'm not sure which was greater, the number of softcore sex scenes that go on too long, the number of times the guys awkwardly throw a football around, or the number of conversations between mother and daughter where they say the same things to one another. Meanwhile, there is a tinge of misogyny in its charmless story. It's kind of depressing to me that this has such a cult following as it seems like a celebration of stupidity, but I guess unintentionally funny is just not my thing."

I have never reviewed such a film, a film that is filled with horrible acting, editing, lighting or special effects yet for some reason is so great. Of course the pure stupidity of this film was never intentional which is why it is so hilarious. Wiseau intended this to be a breakthrough motion picture, the film that would catapult him to the top of the food chain in Hollywood. This attitude can be seen when you watch 'The Room'. It is very easy to spot the indulgence of the film maker, he gives it his all in the film. Don't get me wrong, his performance is truly terrible but he is still trying so hard which in a lot of ways I admire. The film went through horrible production issues, many of the crew members abandoned the project and Wiseau had to find replacements. I admire that he continued and finished the picture even with everyone against him. The film offers some of the hardest laughs I have ever seen in a film, I laughed more frequent than even in some of the better comedies. This is absolutely a remarkable picture that I believe should be seen by everyone. Especially that we are now getting the behind the scenes story of this film in this year's 'The Disaster Artist'. In summary, I do not think that 'The Room' is good movie, it's the exact opposite but what makes the film so great is the fact that they were trying so hard to make a good movie. Wiseau wanted to make a thought provoking and dramatic picture, but it turned out to be a perfect example of a disastrous piece of art."

I say majority because the only flaw that this movie has is it's length. It's too long, waaaaaay to long. The last 30 to 40 minutes are a drag to sit trough and you just want it to end. They could've easily done that too since there are a lot of scenes that repeat themselves or are completely pointless.\n\nOverall i'd say it's worth checking out if you're in for some dumb entertainment that you can watch either alone or share this wonderful experience with a friend or two."

As ridiculous as that film is, it does help shed a light on the backstory of Wiseau himself.\n\nAs perplexing and morbidly fascinating that Mr. Wiseau is, I cannot shake the feeling that this guy just got lucky. Where he (and his money) came from is still a head-scratching mystery, but casting him or The Room in any sort of light that paints it as purposefully bad, ironic or even artistic is just plain wrong (I saw the awkward character interactions of The Room compared to the works of David Lynch and whilst I drew my own similarities with the surreal or awkward moments, the directors are quite obviously leagues apart). If there was no such thing as meme culture, there would be no career for Tommy Wiseau, and he would most likely just be another dreamer who had a stab at Hollywood and then fell into obscurity.\n\nI mean no disrespect to the man, as The Room is incredibly entertaining despite its deathly pace and repetition. I could just happily go through my entire remaining existence in this world without ever seeing this film again."

With an interesting backdrop on both the man and the film the stars aligned and crashed in this sterling display of mundanity and bad acting by the lead character.\n\nWith scenic San Francisco as the background, a long haired, world weary, craggy-faced, d*****y guy making big bucks (typical) is engrossed with a homely gal and does everything for her. Problem arises when his object of affection is smitten instead by his handsome and fruity-looking best friend. And so a tale as old as time unfolds with laughter, fist fights, a gunshot and a football thrown back and forth.\n\nWhat really sets this film apart and consigns it to the bottom barrel of \"so bad it's good\" is Tommy Wiseau's truly awful acting. With his funny accent and barely altering facial expression it's not just ham, it's the entire pig itself. To watch the scene at the end of the film where his character has a \"breakdown\" is a chuckle for the ages. Coupled with the amusing sex scenes and you know this is amateur hour, bad amateur hour. The film isn't bad as a whole as the acting of the other actors are competent and the script is typical. With its clear lighting (which is how films should be shot mostly; a rare credit to Wiseau for that!) and odd combo of awkward acting and flat dialogues the film is a throwback to '80s-'90s soft porn flicks with their glitzy backgrounds and Razzie-inducing performances.\n\nA film much ballyhooed for being considered more bad than it actually is, \"The Room\" has since it's gravity-proving release been celebrated in film, books, reunions, spoofs, games and what have you elevating Wiseau to cult stardom which he's milked for all its worth. For some laughs and to be witness to one of the strangest individuals one can come across onscreen, this is a room with a view."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would never have learned about this movie, had not it been for James and Dave Franco's \"The Disaster Artist\" (which remains among my favorite movies). And tonight, this movie received a celebratory theatrical showing, as today marks 20 years since it opened (roughly 4 months before I was born), and I went to see it at my local theater.\n\nThe film tells the story of Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau), a successful banker, who's a month out from marrying his girlfriend, Lisa (Juliette Danielle). However, Lisa is unsatisfied with everything he gives her, so she starts sleeping with Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero), behind his back. She also gets Johnny drunk, and then starts lying to everybody that Johnny hit her. From there, it's clear that nothing will ever be the same for Johnny again.\n\nThe film's lack of quality is made instantly clear by the visuals alone; specifically, the ugly and garish sets, the awful, unnatural lighting (this movie was shot on 35mm and HD digital video at the same time), the awful camera angles, the heavy use of incredibly unnecessary establishing shots of San Francisco, and the shocking amount of blurry, unfocused shots. The editing is incredibly messy, and there are loads of continuity errors. Furthermore, most of the characters' costumes are gaudy and ugly. Johnny's signature outfit, especially, is a visual cacophony. But visuals aren't everything, of course. In addition, the sound editing and mixing is horrible, bordering on incompetent. The movie is loaded with bad ADR jobs that sometimes don't even sync up with the characters' mouth movements (Johnny's especially), and seem to have had no noise reduction used on them at all aside from Johnny's (sometimes you can hear hissing when a character speaks!).\n\nThe acting in this movie may be some of the worst acting I've ever seen, especially from Tommy Wiseau, the writer, director, producer and star of this movie, as well as Greg Sestero, who plays Mark. As Wiseau's incredibly weird accent makes it instantly clear as Johnny, English is not his first language, hence the bizarre and often juvenile dialogue, especially from Johnny. The script is also pretty repetitive, with almost everybody saying, \"Oh, hi\", or \"Don't worry about it\", in literally every scene. There's also story threads that come and go, especially the infamous bit of Lisa's mother, Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), revealing that she has breast cancer (and jarringly calmly at that), which is forgotten about within two seconds.\n\nAlso, the characters are not only all unlikeable, they are very bizarrely written. For instance, Johnny laughs fondly upon hearing a story from Mark about how a girl he knew got beaten up for having more than one guy, and ended up in a \"hospital on Guerrero Street\". Lisa's motivation for cheating on Johnny also changes every two scenes or so. As for Peter the psychologist (Kyle Vogt), who disappears two thirds of the way through the movie, he's totally inconsistent, with his opinions on Lisa changing depending on what the scene calls for.\n\nAnd to cap it all off, there's the music. Mladen Milicevic's score for this movie is completely overwrought, messy, and never seems to match the tone of any scene, dragging the bad sound design down even further. And let's not forget the truly awful R&B/pop songs that accompany every disgusting, unnecessary sex scene.\n\nAll this comes together to form a movie so laughably horrible, that it ends up being incredible. All by itself, this movie is terrible in every single way, which is why I give it a 1. But I watched it tonight in a movie theater with my parents, and several other people, and it was ultimately a VERY fun experience. I recommend it to any theatergoer, because it's enjoyable when you're laughing along with other people!!! Otherwise, if you're watching it at home, you're just wasting your time.\n\n(Last edited: 11/13/24)"

If you want weird and bizarre, try _The Bold and the Beautiful_ when they had their demonic possession episode series which is infinitely more entertaining than this. Hipsters are a social cancer.

        "review_title": "Oh, hi movie! (Quoting Tommy Wiseau). This \"movie\" is so bad that it almost doesn't seem real. But, is it still worth watching?",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Room\" (2003), oh boy..... Where in the world do I begin? This \"movie\" has found a spot on my list of the top 10 worst films I have ever seen. Boring and confused storyline, dreadful acting, cheap special effects, dull sets/locations, and a predictable generic soundtrack. The story is actually based off a novel written by Tommy Wiseau, who is responsible for the existence of this \"movie\". He couldn't get the book published. Huh, I wonder why? So, he resorted to getting his novel made into this train wreck, oop, I mean, \"movie\". If the \"film\" is any indication to how the novel is laid out, then we can see why no one would help him get his book published. The story is basically a love triangle between main character Johnny, his fiancee Lisa, and friend Mark. Now at first glance, that just sounds like your typical every day love triangle plot. But I assure you, it's a lot more than that. A lot more than that! This \"movie\" is littered with subplots that don't add up, additional characters that contribute nothing to the story, so on and so forth. I guess Tommy Wiseau is a big Zack Snyder fan; who is the true king of unresolved subplots! If it wasn't for the unnecessary plot holes, then the story would have somewhat of an impact. Even though it's your typical love triangle story told over 1,000 times before. Another thing, just look at the \"movie\" poster, it looks like a poster made for a horror movie. Since when was \"The Room\" ever remotely classified to be a horror film?! As far as the acting goes, it's just as abysmal as the storyline. Tommy Wiseau is, by far, the worst actor in this \"movie\". The rest of the actors are just as bad as well, maybe Tommy Wiseau's presence just rubbed off on them? In this \"movie\", he plays the main character, named Johnny. But that's not all he does for this \"film\". He also wrote, produced, executive produced, and yes, directed this \"film\". Every other actor ranges from just plain bad, to lackluster. However, there are two actors who do look like they're actually trying. Greg Sestero as Mark doesn't do that bad, but he's still substandard. There is one actor who puts on a great performance, Dan Janjigian as Chris-R. He is, without question, the best actor in this \"film\". Ironically, he wasn't even a professional actor at that time! He never had any training to be an actor, just wrap your head around that. The person with no acting experience puts on a better performance than everyone else. Something doesn't seem right there! The special effects are just as cheap and generic as you would expect. Honestly, I've seen better effects in movies made back in the 1950's! The sets/locations are dull and boring, and you can tell that the majority of the scenes were filmed in a studio! But, the exterior scenes aren't too bad, as it's filmed in San Francisco. All of the exterior shots of the city are the true saving graces for this \"movie\", but even those can actually get repetitive. They somehow made California boring! How is that possible?! Finally, we have a boring and cliched soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. Not only is the soundtrack lazily edited, but it's just boring. The only part of the score I remember is the opening credits theme. I'm sensing a pattern here, that some of the worst movies have the best opening sequences, in order to try and fool the audience that it's going to be a good movie. Yes, I do understand that all movies need a strong opening to give a good first impression. But they seem to always forget, the rest of the movie has to be good as well! \"The Room\" is truly, the epitome of how not to make a movie. It should be required viewing for film students in college, so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie, to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. To end my review, I'm going to just say this. I know you'll think I'm crazy, but \"The Room\" is seriously worth checking out, it is one of those bad movies that you have to see to believe. You will not believe your eyes, it's so bad, that it's surprisingly kind of good! It has gained a cult following, and it is popular for all the wrong reasons. If you're going to watch \"The Room\", I suggest watching it with someone else. Then, it'll be much more fun to laugh at! To Tommy Wiseau, the disaster artist, let me just ask you this: what in the world were you thinking? \"You are tearing us apart!\""

I have seen better acting from primary school kids and the production values make you really wonder why this need 6 million dollars to make. The errors in this movie are incredible and all this seems like it was made just to prove how not to make a film.\n\nAll this ends up making a movie which made me cry constantly for all 99 minutes of pure rubbish. Some of the scenes make no point, but all of the mistakes make it better. I watched this film about 20 times in 2 weeks and could watch it every day for the rest of my life.\n\nThis is hands down one of my faviroute movies, and is for everyone who watches it, if you are looking for a good movie to watch on a night in with friends this is the one. you MUST see this movie.\n\n100/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "With a movie about the making of The Room coming out, I thought I'd break down and watch it. I cheated and watched it with RiffTrax, though, in case the unintentional comedy aspect failed on me.\n\nThe movie is a fascinating curio that is inept to a level that is hard to even describe. It's not just the broad strokes, like the inane story or the hanging subplots or the abysmal acting. It's also the moment to moment directorial choices. For example, in a scene involving a loan shark, Lisa gets upset and reacts with over-the-top emotion. But in the cutaways to the actor she's talking to, his emotional tone doesn't jibe and it's not clear they are working from the same script. This is pretty common in the movie.\n\nIt's not just that director/writer/star Wiseau has no concept of the language of film but that he doesn't seem to understand how people work. He's like a robot who has tried to figure out human interactions and failed abysmally. There is not a moment where anyone does anything a real person would do in the same circumstances. None of the characters make sense, none of the actions make sense. While famous bad-film-director Ed Wood seemed to understand what a movie was supposed to look like, even if he couldn't make it happen, Wiseau appears to have lived alone in a box his entire life.\n\nWell, not quite, because one gets the impression that Wiseau is mad at someone he dated. Lisa is basically a psychopath, suggesting that Wiseau thinks women are just plain out to get him.\n\nWould this have been funny without RiffTrax? I'm not sure. Some things, like the plentiful, tedious, *endless* sex scenes, are painful even with jokes in the background. Other times I could see where in the right mood I would laugh at the terribleness of it all.\n\nAnyway, *with* RiffTrax it's pretty fun, although I thought they were being unfair to the actress playing Lisa, who was undeserving of the body shaming lines."

        "review_detailed_main": "Terrible movies flood our screens every year. Some will make you want to demand your money back or simply tear your eyes from their sockets in a bid to end the suffering, but chances are, once it's finally over, you'll never think about it again. There are plenty of terrible bad movies, but great bad movies - those that truly stick with you - are in an incredibly short supply. There's a real art to creating something so jaw-droppingly bad, so head-scratchingly awful that you start to question your very existence. Tommy Wiseau's The Room, commonly referred to as the Citizen Kane of bad movies, has this art perfected. When the film trickled into selected theatres back in 2003, nobody could have predicted the impact it would have. Nobody, that is, apart from narcissistic writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau.\n\nOnly Wiseau undoubtedly had visions of being showered with admiration and awards, even timing the film's release to qualify for the Academy Awards. Instead, The Room quickly developed a reputation as a side-show, screened regularly as part of the midnight movie circuit where audience members would shout the movie's memorable catch-phrases and hurl plastic cutlery at the screen. Wiseau has since explained that The Room was always meant to be a black comedy and never intended for it to be taken seriously, but that's about as believable as the director's claims that he was born in America. In fact, nothing about The Room is believable, from the wobbly-looking sets and wooden actors to the stilted dialogue and painfully long sex scenes. When you discover that this actually cost $6 million to make - somehow funded by Wiseau himself - you'll be wondering how the hell it ended up looking like an Australian soap opera.\n\nWiseau plays Johnny, a wealthy banker who seemingly possesses no character flaws. He has the appearance of a weather-beaten vampire with a head full of tar-dunked hair and a voice that resembles Christopher Walken if the King of New York actor was born in Eastern Europe and had suffered a stroke. His \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) has grown bored with Johnny and infatuated with his handsome best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Despite pleas from her mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) to stay with the man who will take care of her financially, Lisa seduces Mark. After a night of drinking, Lisa falsely accuses Johnny of hitting her (\"I did not hit her! I did naaaht!\"). But being the optimistic, all-round great guy that he is, Johnny doesn't let this get in the way of emotionally supporting his young neighbour Denny (Philip Haldiman), the man-boy orphan who Johnny treats like a son, or to throw on a tuxedo for a game of catch with his buddies.\n\nThe Room resembles a 100-minute sitcom episode during which one or two sets are visited by a roster of minor characters that in no way resembles real life. Sub-plots, such as Denny landing himself in trouble with a gun-wielding drug dealer or Claudette's revelation that she has cancer, are introduced only to be never discussed again. Rather than exploring the characters by actually giving them something to do other than walk into a room and offer mundane advice, Wiseau would rather give us no fewer than four extended sex scenes, three of which involving the filmmaker's bare arse thrusting against Danielle's stomach. Scenes play out on rooftops and alleyways that are clearly sets with a green-screen backdrop, raising the question of why Wiseau didn't simply shoot on location. But thanks to endless establishing shots of San Francisco landmarks, we know that they're definitely not in a Los Angeles studio. It would be easy to talk about The Room for hours and not even scratch the surface of just how strange yet utterly fascinating it is. See it, hate it, and then love it. And tell your friends to do the same."

When people think of a movie that is so bad, but still feels the need to tell other to watch it, it's this movie. If you can enjoy a film that's so bad it's good, then give this movie a watch; you won't regret it. I actually had to take breaks between the scenes because I was laughing so hard at how awful it was. The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Juliette Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Nobody in this movie is known today for other projects aside from this. Not one person in this movie was good, but Tommy Wiseau is on a whole other level of bad. Not only does his dialogue not make sense in the scenes he is in, but his facial expression and tone don't make what he is saying. What make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong. Overall, the fact that \"The Room\" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent. .5/5"

After seeing the performances you'll obviously start speculating about what happened, and personally I think the realization that this was made by a fellow human as a passion project is a gut punch on its own considering the reception it got.\n\nI've seen many people rate this movie as a 10 or a 9/10 but I don't see it. The first half hour is pretty funny but after that the movie just drags on for what seems like forever. I think a lot of the reviewers have forgotten that as most of us experienced it through YouTube clips and reviews, we didn't have a full viewing, which blurred the judgement of many."

You can rate some scenes at a 7, but some of them hit you so hard you are left crying out \"12 out of 10!!!\" The acting is atrocious, the pacing is horrific, the unresolved subplots leave a bad taste in your mouth, the diolauge is first grade material, the writing just doesn't make sense, the choppy camera work is heretical, and the sex scenes... oh the slanderous sex scenes... the FOUR slanderous sex scenes. This movie hits every wrong you can put into a movie without missing a beat. But, I'm in love with it.\n\nMy friend and I love to critique movies. We discuss what scenes could have been changed, what stories could have been tweaked, what plot points could have been done differently, and we thought about fifty different things to move this movie from it's current rating, to at least a 6/10. After further discussion though, we would change not one thing about this movie.\n\nSome would argue that tweaking the movie would change it from being \"So bad, it's good\" to just mediocre. Though I agree, I dont agree this movie is \"So bad it's good\". I would argue it's bad. Theres nothing good about it. It deserves to be the worst movie ever made. I felt no investment in the characters, the plot, the story, etc. Yet, I found myself invested in the characters, the plot, the story, and everything in between. I don't know what's happening.\n\nThis is not some flick that's too dramatic, thus ends up being a comedy, hence making it \"So bad it's good.\" No! There's much more to it than that. You're drawn into the movie, you become mesmerized, it's philosophical, it's beautiful... it's magical.\n\nI'm probabaly here, but there is only one comparison that comes to mind that us humans can ponder to existentially relate to the vibes this movie exudes. That is, the final stage of Death and Dying: Acceptance. It's ugly, it's unnatural, but we let go and find peace in the relief.\n\nCinima is definitely a hobby of mine, and love discussing it. As a daily user in this website for years, this was, I believe, my first review. I'm glad I saved it for this one.\n\nWell done, Johnny. *Wipes tear* well done."

        "review_title": "An infamously atrocious cinematic blend with bad acting, bad writing, and overall bad execution spirals into an unusual appetite of \"so bad it's good\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "More often than not, when Hollywood falls into the misfortune of slapping audiences with a bottom-of-the-barrel cinematic atrocity, the final fate is it spirals into obscurity with virtually everyone forgetting about its existence within a matter of a year (maybe less). Then there is rare films such as 'The Room' that succeed at achieving the strange feat of soaking the audiences with laughter for how horrendous it is in quality. That is where Polish-born director Tommy Wiseau (or wherever on Earth he was born, who knows?) and his friend Greg Sestero come in. After a longtime struggle to sell their script to major studios, it was up to this duo to come up with their independent black comedy. The results are something initially unsurprising: a disastrous, slipshod, horribly acted slugfest that spent the following ten years growing an unusual cult status from audiences who relish in laughing at the final product for how wildly inept it is. In short, it is a rare cinematic pain- inducer that everyone is willing to withstand. So the story here follows Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau), a San Francisco banker who is on his way to marrying his long-time girlfriend Lisa (played by Juliette Danielle). What the poor sap doesn't know however, is that Lisa has grown bored of him and decides she is not in love with him and has unexpectedly fell in love with his best friend Mark (played by Greg Sestero). Although Mark is initially reluctant, not wanting to soil his friendship with Johnny), Lisa is too persitent and pulls him into a romance that soon sends everyone's lives in a downward spiral.\n\nThis film completes the handbook of how not to make a cinematic picture: horrendous acting, despicable excuse of a script, production values that would fit best for a middle school play, and dialogue that is just flat out bad to the core. If you wondering about the story, well, that's pretty much of an eye-roller as well. But Tommy Wiseau's mysterious distortion of artistic value evokes the mystery of how one can make such an atrocity and somehow provide a oddly fresh source of laughter. Wiseau, spending the entirety phoning in a mawkish performance and delivering his lines with total lack of authenticity, puts on the show with his goofy chemistry with Juliette Danielle. But once Lisa's plan to disavow her engagement with Johnny takes action, that is when the unintentional hilarity ensues. Each scene taking a place on the rooftop with the San Francisco, tacked in sloppy green-screen effects, has moments of \"so bad, it's good moments\" spectacle. Nearly every other scene, however, slips into the cracks of \"so inept, it's just bad\". That is not even including Wiseau's braindead way to filming and editing each scene, especially in the overlong sex scenes in which we witness repeated footage of Wiseau's nude back. Secondly, how often do you go to a friend's house and find pictures of silverware in the living room? Now that is just silly. Above all, the events that transpire are too short of substance in terms of execution the point where even the unintentional hilarity factor has difficult to dig up.\n\nThe Room may indeed fit perfectly in the category one of the worst movies in cinematic history, but in its own special way. Regardless, the level of ridiculousness still falls too shallow to uphold a proper \"good because it's bad\" spectacle. It is more of just plain bad and not enough of funny bad, which is simply disappointing to say the least."

A couple of the actors do their best with what they have to work with but it's very little. It's really hard to say what Wiseau's greatest weakness is: his acting, his writing or his directing. They're all awful. This movie must have gotten its 9 Metacritic score purely out of sympathy. I am, however, looking forward to watching \"The Disaster Artist,\" if only to enjoy how it's possible to make a good movie about making a bad one."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most infamous bad movies there are. They're still showing this in select theaters, a bit like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Not because it's in any way a good movie - it's all things conceivable, but not that - but because it's such a good movie to sit through with your friends and riff on it.\n\nThe wannabe magnum opus of its director/writer/producer/executive producer/lead actor, Tommy Wiseau, The Room is the story of Johnny (Wiseau), his fiancee, Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero). It's a story about how Lisa suddenly becomes bored of Johnny and cheats on him with Mark. And all the bizarre and bad things that happen because of it.\n\nAnd when you put it like that, it actually sounds a bit boring. So just what makes this movie so fascinating, and admittedly fun, to watch? The execution. And the fact that Wiseau actually had a budget for this, but had no idea what to do with it. The sets are decent, they use professional cameras and lighting, there's even some green screen utilized. Put this is all used to film one of the most egregious student films there is. The dialogues are laughably wooden, the acting even more so, there's way too many badly filmed sex scenes, there's like a bazillion continuity errors and plot points, it's pretty clear they accidentally cut out some key scenes, and the ending is so over the top melodramatic that it's glorious.\n\nA student film, in a nutshell. But one filmed by a man at least in his late thirties. (We actually don't know when Mr. Wiseau was born, or where. There has been speculation. The word extraterrestrial might have been mentioned.)\n\nWatching this film is a prolonged exercise in asking the question \"Why!?\" and learning to cope with the fact that there are no answers. And that can be a lot of fun, in a baffling way.\n\nDefinitely worth watching. Yes, it's bad, but it'd be hard to watch this film without knowing that. And when you go in with the right expectations, you'll most probably enjoy yourself."

The Metacritic score pretty much sums it all up: 9 out of 100, which establishes The Room as one of the lowest scored movies ever, and I have to agree with critics this time around.\n\nIs this movie any fun? A few chuckles admittedly, primarily from the leading actor/director/writer Tommy Wiseau's monotone acting/delivery, plus that gif-worthy line \"You're tearing me apart Lisa!\" Nevertheless, these moments are too inadequate to make up for long sequences of mind-numbing dialogues and confounding interactions galore in this movie. If you're bent on watching this out of curiosity, or merely to better understand James Franco's The Disaster Artist, I suggest you fast forward through it within 5 minutes so as to save your precious time."

It makes me laugh for at least 90 of the 99 minutes. It is just one of those films that you can watch and watch and watch and it never gets old! Tommy Wiseau (the writer, director, producer, tea lady, raver and cheesy quaver)claims that the film was meant to be exactly how it is..... Aye, right Tommy! The film is funny because clearly it was meant to be serious, and it turned out to be a joke. After starring in this film, i'm surprised that any of the actors managed to get another job. To put it simply, watch this film, reflect on it and then pass on the good word... oh and don't forget to look out for the spoons and the cancer."

I do believe this movie is worth watching, it does have some unpredicatable things and for most part it's a very funny and unique film. You should atleast respect the creator as he alone wrote/directed/procuced/starred in this movie at the same time and all was made from his own money, no support.

Or else the kids from the remedial English class got their hands on a camcorder and decided to make an internet sex tape, and the aliens from Contact were watching that...\n\nIf anybody has a better explanation for how a movie like this, a movie with no conception of human behavior or interactions on any level could exist, I would love to hear it. Even the worst movie makers manage to hit a correct dramatic note every once in a while by sheer statistical accident. But here, the writing and acting manage to fail with such unerring consistency that it is almost an achievement. Words such as 'surreal' do not begin to describe the experience of watching this movie. Its sheer terribleness on every possible creative level exceeds description. If you took ninety minutes of clips from a South American soap opera, spliced them together in random order and got blind street junkies to come with dubbed dialogue, you would still have a more coherent drama. The Room is so totally bad for every moment of its running time that it becomes a master class on cinematic ineptitude. The dialogue is awful, yet the actors still manage to make it seem much worse than it is by mistiming lines and giving inappropriate responses throughout the movie. The pacing of every scene, every exchange, seems off. And despite a reported budget of $6 million (??!) everything looks cheap and hurried, like a film class project that was left to the last minute.\n\nThe story construction is so inept that almost nothing that happens pushes the story forward, and virtually none of the plot threads get resolved. In fact, most of them are mentioned once and never come up again. Early on, for example, the mother casually discloses that she has cancer, and that is all we ever hear about it. This however is the film's secret virtue. When no plot point is important or connected to anything else in the movie, the viewer is free to play connect the dots.\n\nFor instance, Johnny's announcement that he failed to get a promotion at his bank shows his underachievement in the financial world. As financiers are sometimes called 'big swinging d*cks', this could be hinting that Johnny is underachieving anatomically as well. This would explain Lisa' perpetual dissatisfaction with him. Or perhaps Lisa' attitude is actually outwardly redirected self-loathing over all of the Weight Watchers meetings she has been missing. Mark's perpetual surprise over how Lisa's undressing indicates that she wants sex and not something else could be masking his own disappointment that she wasn't handing him her clothes to put on for some cross dressing role play. Such disappointment would go far in explaining the sternness of Mark's resistance to her chubby charms. Danny's drug purchase explains his apparent disconnection from reality throughout the film. The kid is clearly on goofballs. Has the mother's cancer spread to her brain? Memory impairment might explain why she keeps having the same conversations over and over. These are all ripe food for thought, and The Room's arthritic pacing gives the viewer plenty of opportunities to toss them around like footballs thrown by guys in tuxedos."

His people worship him and why not? He is good to his people. He treats them respectfully. He gives them all the encouragement and friendship they require. In Wiseau Land, he has been the elected king 687,327,921 and a half times now! And while, yes, his movie is VERY indulgent and self centered, it's charming and oblivious. He really does see himself as this all-American, perfect without fault Johnny character. He wants us to perceive him this way, and I say, we should. Why the heck not? He's not hurting anyone and I think we owe him for all the quotes, memes and laughs he is providing us. Now I will admit that the movie is not for everyone. Heck, it's literally just for Mr. Wiseau---but it's noteworthy, to me, if just for the fact that someone said, \"Ah dun care wha any bahdy say! Ah will make dream movie! People, they use me; they lie to me and I dun care any more---oh, hai Greg!\". Tommy made his dream come true; put his stupid heart on the line and succeeded in his failure!

I first encountered this movie as a teenager, and it was a riot. I laughed at the iconic scenes and found it hilarious. But rewatching it for probably the fifth time as an adult, I find myself wishing for more from the cinephile community. There are so many more interesting \"so bad it's good\" films than The Room, and it's a bit disheartening that this one has such a strong reputation when films like Miami Connection are out there.\n\nWhat gives The Room its lasting power is the bizarre, yet unforgettable presence of Johnny, played by Wiseau himself. Whenever he enters a scene, it's like a manic breath of fresh air amidst softcore porn scenes and pithy melodrama. You can even tell that some of the actors think the whole thing is ridiculous. This is especially clear in long takes, where their facial expressions shift between lines, as if they can't believe the scene they're in. I first noticed this during the infamous alleyway football scene, where the \"boys\" toss around a ball while barely concealing their disbelief.\n\nRecently, a production designer mentioned that the digital backgrounds for The Batman (2022) were inspired by the rooftop skylines in The Room. I can see that-those rooftop scenes do have a certain unintentional grandeur behind them. Wiseau recently released his follow-up film, Big Shark, but this time he seems to be in on the joke, which makes for a much less interesting result.\n\nWhat truly gives The Room its staying power is the sincerity behind it. Wiseau really wanted to make a good movie. It's shot on film, even though in 2003 many low-budget projects had switched to MiniDV. There's an original soundtrack, and an attempt at craft, even if it didn't work out as intended. I just hope that The Room's fandom is open to expanding their horizons because there are countless hidden gems like The Room waiting to be rediscovered and embraced by a new generation of viewers."

Indeed, there is something so pathologically wrong with The Room that somehow you can't quite help but applaud it while at the same time feeling like you must take a shower. Central to the film is Tommy Wiseau; the man in charge of the production. When exploring the background surrounding the film it can be noticed that Wiseau went to extreme lengths to make certain that this film be created. He wrote it as a novel and somehow managed to raise $6 million for the production of it. In fact practically every story I hear surrounding the making of this film is hilarious.\n\nThis film is Wiseau's centrepiece, it feels as if it's his life's work. Yet, he doesn't stop at purely making it, he stars in it too. Wiseau plays the role of Johnny, an Angelic figure devoted to his \"future wife\" Lisa (who is perhaps one of the biggest enigmas to ever appear on the big screen). Johnny is certainly something special; without him this film would not be what it is. He is the central orb in which the rest of this tragedy collapses around. He is perhaps the most complicated character ever created; some believe he is from Croatia, Belgium, Norway, Finland and I've heard Denmark too. Whatever country he is from, he certainly isn't American as Wiseau has claimed. Heck, I still wonder whether he's even of this world. Whatever the conclusion, Johnny is perhaps one of the greatest characters to ever come into creation.\n\nThe entirety of this film is almost as if it was written by someone who had never been part of any society. The whole thing makes no sense, it's almost nihilistic in the way that it redefines the framework of rules in film. Though, it has been claimed by the staff to be deliberately terrible. This was something quickly admitted to. However, I'm not truly sure that it was intentionally this awful. I think that there was a fair bit of effort put into it, certainly by Wiseau. Whatever the belief, this film manages to do everything horribly wrong, nothing about this, not one scene was something that I thought was lucid. It is a burning trainwreck of awfulness. But amongst the rubble it leaves you amazed at the sheer level of ineptness that you have just witnessed. It leaves you with a need to watch it again. Overall, The Room is a piece of genius that only a severely mentally ill person could ever create and pull off to the level that Wiseau has."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room, the 2003 film by Tommy Wiseau that she both directed and starred in, has carved a place in popular culture for reasons other than those it probably meant. A theatrical tale of friendship, love, and betrayal, it's often heralded as one of the greatest \"so-bad-it's-good\" films ever made. Instead of being emotionally compelling as its makers intended, The Room is a mad dash of absurd speech, pointless story twists, and strange acting that makes it wonderfully entertaining and unpleasant. Johnny (Wiseau), a prosperous banker, is at the heart of the narrative when he learns that his fianc\u00e9e Lisa is having an affair with his best buddy Mark. The film continues, and though Johnny loves her, his world falls apart, which in itself is illogical because the characters are not given sufficient depth to make sense.\n\nThe most infamous part of the picture is Wiseau's portrayal of Johnny, a figure who has become legendary in the world of bad movies. His strange language, fake line pronunciation, and extreme mood swings have made him one of the most famous characters in film history. Wiseau also wrote the script, which is full of old-fashioned, odd, and humorous phrase twists, such as the well-known \"Oh hi, Mark\". These scenes have become self-sustaining and ingrained in The Room's culture because they are so unexplained and out of context.\n\nEven with its narrative and technical problems, it is these very shortcomings that add to the enduring appeal of the film. It has become a cult classic, and people attend midnight screenings just to laugh at the utter ridiculousness of it all. In a live, interactive environment, audience members commonly quote lines, hurl plastic spoons, and celebrate the chaos that is the movie's existence. Rarely does a film's very badness elevate it to the level of cherished aberration. Despite being a celebration of all that can go wrong with filmmaking, The Room manages to turn into a celebration of all that makes movies remarkable."

The very concept of romance may be ruined\n\nI think this movie was written by an alien whose entire knowledge of humanity comes from watching late night broadcasts on Lifetime.\n\n...With dialog by a Mexican soap opera writer via bablefish.\n\nHas anyone in this movie seen a child before?\n\nTommy Wiseau is clearly not human. Something this deep in the uncanny Valley must be a robot covered in human skin. And not the fresh kind.\n\nThis may be the first time an announcement that someone has cancer has produced a chorus of bad laughs.\n\nThis movie handles serious issues like lines on a checklist. The more the better, no matter how awkwardly you cram them in.\n\nI think everyone in this movie is functionally retarded.\n\nOh my goodness they're playing \"catch.\"\n\nI think the editor just had a seizure.\n\nWho brings a football to a wedding party?\n\nEvery conversation feels like it's cobbled together from random snippets of sound tests.\n\nThere is no reason for any of the scenes in this movie to be in this movie.\n\nI take it back. Everyone in this movie is retarded and on laughing gas.\n\nI have seen better fights in preschool.\n\nAnd now the sound just disappeared. The main character is lying on the floor dead and the preview to another movie is playing on the speakers.\n\nFinally, I wish to say that forcing audiences to look at Tommy Wiseau's bare ass should be considered a crime against humanity."

You can tell there was a lot of money behind the film despite the tragic product that was made. There is a reason that James Franco made a film called \"The Disaster Artist\" based on the making of this totally inept film. It's because the film was truly a disaster of magnificent proportions. I speak about this film with some degree of contempt purely for the fact that money (a precious commodity) was wasted to make it. It has its moments of being funny purely because its so bad, but even those moments wear thin."

What can you say about it, it is without doubt the worst acting that has ever been put on screen. Not one word he says through out the entire film will make you believe a thing that is going on. Yet at the same time, it's just so damn entertaining, my favorite scene is when he is having his tantrum towards the end of the film.\n\nThe dialog in this film is also so strange it makes you think, how could a self respecting actor/actress agree to do such obvious bulls**t. But, at the same time, that is what makes it so interesting, I want to keep watching, it's hilarious.\n\nThis film actually gets points for how bad it is. God, it had me in stitches.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room is literally the Citizen Kane of bad movies. The acting is terrible and lots of subplots. But, before I watched this film, I heard somewhere on YouTube and saw the title \"The Room\" so I assumed it was just some crappy horror film and forgot about it. I had no idea who Tommy Wiseau was, until The Disaster Artist came out. So as you can guess, I got curious. And I watched the film. It was NOT what I thought it was. It was just so weird and odd. It's not just Tommy Wiseau who's odd, every actor in this film seems odd.\n\nThe film is about a successful banker named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) who live happily in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e, or \"future wife\" Lisa (Julliete Dannielte). Until she gets board for no reason, and cheats on him with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestro). From there on, nothing will be the same.\n\nThis is one of those films where it's so bad it's good. And I am a big fan of this movie and can't stop watching it. Tommy Wiseau himself has stated that this film was always meant to be a comedy, so I guess it was never actually meant to be taken seriously.\n\nNow, I've talked a lot about the bad stuff, but let's talk about the good stuff.\n\nI think the reason why people still watch this film is because it brings people together. All over the world there's midnight screenings of it and people love it and laugh together and throw footballs to each other. It's very funny and I highly recommend it.\n\nWhen I watch The Room today, and don't see a funny cult classic. I see a reflection of an odd but very talented man who had a very clear vision and wanted to share it with the world. I think one thing I love about Tommy Wiseau is, he dosen't care what other people think, and I really respect him for that. So I'll end this review with a quote by Tommy Wiseau.\n\n\"You can laugh, you can cry, but please don't hurt each other\" - Tommy Wiseau"

It was not realistic, and was not committed to being absurd or surreal either. The acting was some of the worst I have seen in my life. The sex scenes were unnecessary and even comedic, drawn out, and my God, reusing footage (some called that symbolism for the love being repetitive, but I just call it lazy filmmaking. There were other ways to show that). Random 'plot points' are brought up, and never mentioned again (like 'We're expecting!'), and the sets were so amature (a dude fell at one point and the walls shook mad, there were green outlines on actors from the green screens... just make it stop). Overall, the film was a joke. It was an art house flop. Only watch it if you are at a midnight cinema, and can throw spoons and footballs at the screen. My local theatre plays it once a month so people can get drunk and yell lines at the screen. It is hilarious because it is so terrible."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Despite a seemingly 'positive' review, I rated the movie a 4, and for three reasons:\n\nquoting \"Tootsie\": 'God forbid it lost its status as a cult failure\n\n\nit's a little nod to Roger Ebert who gave four stars to what he believed were the great movies, the film is indeed bad in a great way\n\n\n\n\nI heard and read so many good things about all the bad things in Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room. But if it didn't really encourage me to watch it, I still checked on the 'classic' moments from Youtube and my curiosity was fully satisfied, I knew the main lines and catchphrases and I could see why the film had became such a revered (or reverse) classic, but I didn't care about watching it as much as I didn't care about \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", morbid curiosity is something I lack for that matter.\n\nIf it wasn't for James Franco's release of \"The Disaster Artist\", an adaptation of Greg Sestero's book chronicling the apparently disastrous making of the film and how an ambitious project turned out to be the \"'best worst movie ever\" made, nothing would have raised my curiosity. I suspect there are many viewers who're going to watch the film before checking on Franco's. It's like a rebirth for Tommy Wiseau and a definite entrance of \"The Room\" as one of these movies known for the wrong reasons, but known nonetheless. The ways of Hollywood are unpredictable and many stinkers have achieved more fame than 'classics'. \"The Room\" is one of them. Paraphrasing a slogan from Eddie Murphy's \"Boomerang\": it stinks so good!\n\nTo call the film 'bad' is an understatement, you could sum up the story by saying it's about a man who loves a woman or a woman who loves a man, but they're not the same, it's also about a kid who owes money, a thug who wants it badly, a drug deal, a mother who has breast cancer, a girl who wrongfully accuses her fianc\u00e9, I mean, future husband of hitting her but he insists he did not... in fact the film is beyond the idea of 'being about something', most of these subplots have no set-ups and no resolutions whatsoever, they just happen without even having a reason to happen, it's like mixing up the idea of cooking with throwing ingredients on a saucepan and waiting for something to \"happen\".\n\nThere's indeed a sense of anarchic disdain to any screen writing requirement, a succession of bits as random as possible that whether it's intentional or accidental is besides the point, it's bad in a genuinely genius way. And don't get me started on the acting. The film made me believed there are three schools of acting: good acting, bad acting and \"Room\" acting, Tommy Wiseau is a school by himself, he recites his lines as if he had just learn them phonetically, he doesn't look straight in the eyes, his mood changes suddenly, his lines are punctuated by the weirdest laugh ever and start with \"Oh, Hi!\" so many times it'll certainly inspire some drinking games.\n\nButWiseau finds his match in all the actors who act is they've been picked like Homer Simpson when he became the monorail driver. The actors have no experience and just give enough conviction to convey the right ersatz of emotion, but the effect is all the same, it's laughable. You don't laugh because they act bad, but because you know what you're supposed to feel and you're baffled because they don't even try, and I guess that's the film's secret. Indeed, there's a sparkle lighting that movie and making it immune to sheer disdains, it's like we laugh with it but not at it, as it seems unbelievable that none would be aware of how bad it is.\n\n\"The Room\" rises below the idea of great movie, it's bad but make you care about how bad it is, and not every great film becomes a classic, not every great film inspires a movie about its making, much more, there are so many movies trying to be 'great' and falling flat, it takes some guts to make a film that doesn't even try to be great and succeed gloriously."

To the point, I was doing chores and having a friend to come over to help me continue throughout this movie. I took a total of 8 breaks throughout watching because I really could not watch it in one sitting. I guess you could say the acting was below average. I do not know if the acting portion was ironically or ironically conveyed, but I did not like it as well. Every interaction that I had to see was just so weird. It was like robots talking to one another. Or like NPCs dialogue in a cutscene for a poorly made videogame. I really do not like trashing movies because I feel that I am not credible to do so. I just believe that this film is just not good. And I do not see myself recommending this to anybody in the near future or at all.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is easily the worst 'thing' that I've ever sat through. Me and 7 of my friends were having a movie night yesterday and my friend Stephen brought this with him, claiming \"I don't know what this is and apparently no one on the planet does so we should watch it.\" There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.\n\nThere was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question \"why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to settle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?\" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.\n\nWhere do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasise, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting school at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.\n\n\"We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life\" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.\n\nThere are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics watch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of IMDb's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these uncomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.\n\nThere are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.\n\nI wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it. I wish to never see Tommy Wiseau in anything again, if he even is in anything else and if he is, there's something wrong with this world."

Any film with four sex scenes that isn't a porno deserves to be considered one of the worst films of all time. They're so monotonous and pointless. There's this one scene where a guy tries to kill this one guy which goes nowhere. The characters all get tuxedos so they can...play football? What? It is so dreadfully boring. We see Johnny fight this guy. It stops, but then he does it minutes later. Why is this happening? None of this means anything.\n\nThis film is dreadfully monotonous to the point where I really just wanted it to end soon but at least I was fortunate enough to download the Rifftrax version for it. It was so hilarious especially with how Disembodio wanted to talk through all the sex scenes. This was a movie that I had to have the Rifftrax audio with, because I knew it would be too horrible for me to do without it. This also ended up being featured in what many people consider to be the Nostalgia Critic's best review. Tommy Wiseau himself didn't like people mocking his movie. He shouldn't have made it so bad.\n\nWith Rifftrax, I really liked, \"I hate you guy who looks like me!\". Another great one was, \"First, death to all patio furniture!\". There was also, \"I'm not feeling good today\", \"Why?\" with the riff, \"I saw my fianc\u00e9e naked\". I also loved, \"Another underwear conversation related tragedy!\". Call me immature, but I thought, \"He's being a big baby\" was great with the joke, \"Should see him in his diaper, ow!\". The money is well worth it. 1/2*"

When starting the movie I was amused to see Tommy Wiseau's name appear twenty times in the opening credits. I knew I was in for a treat as soon as Wiseau said his first line, \"Hi babe\". Then we got a gratuitous sex scene that lasted way to long, then we saw Lisa talking to her mother about how she doesn't love him anymore, then she cheats on Johnny with his best friend, and soon I noticed a pattern happening in the plot. Gratuitous sex scene, Lisa talks to mother, Lisa cheats with Mark, rinse and repeat. Eventually the story does go somewhere, without flagging myself for spoilers, let's just say it has an unintentionally hilarious grand finale. Although Wiseau is the most hilariously awful actor, because of the repetition of plot, and the super cynical nature of this movie I didn't like it as well as other bad movies."

WHY? WHYYYY?????\n\nWhat a story mark.\n\nThe characters in this are so poorly written, the cinematography is so bland, the lighting is so flat, the direction is so awful, the acting is so disgusting and Tommy Wiseau is so un-American that I think this should be screened in Hollywood Theatres.\n\nNow."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Room\" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we follow a man's life who is a successful banker and lives happily with his fianc\u00e9e in San Fransisco. After sometime she changes her behavior to him and also tries to seduce his best friend. Everything changes from that point the relationships between them won't be the same again.\n\nI have to admit that I watched this movie knowing what is all about so, I was prepared for it. After watching I understood why this movie is considered the best worst movie of all times. The plot is very simple because there is not a plot or connection between the scenes and you have to figure out many things by yourself in order to cover all the plot holes. About the interpretations now, Tommy Wiseau who played as Johnny the successful banker was the worst by far but extremely funny on his role or maybe in his real life too, Greg Sestero who played as Mark the best friend of Johny was equally bad with him and of course Juliette Danielle who played as Lisa, Johny's fianc\u00e9e was a bit better than them. It has to be mentioned that the direction which was made by Tommy Wiseau who was also the producer of it was simply hilarious because you could not understand what was going on in this movie or why is this so bad.\n\nFinally, I have to say that \"The Room\" is a bad movie but if you have a bad day at work etc just watch it and I am sure you are going to laugh a lot and you feel a lot better when it finishes. Don't have high hopes or expectations from this movie and you aren't going to be let down by it, watch it and just laugh."

Since then I have hosted over 8 Room screenings at my house. My friends and I can't stop quoting it and singing the songs. We have learned so many lessons, such as how to play football in small spaces, the powers of persuasion and seduction, the art of interior decorating, and finally how to catch your cheating lover. In all honesty, this isn't the prime example of exemplary acting, writing, cinematography, directing, musical composition, or editing, but as long as you have a good group of friends, a couple of skotchkas and a great sense of humor, you will have fun watching the movie.

Of course, the dialogue is abysmal, the sex scenes filmed in an out of focus fashion that we can only ever be truly thankful for, and the soundtrack is so cheesy that the whole thing just engenders audience participation on quite an unprecedented scale. This is garbage; there is no other word for it - yet it is eminently watchable (after three bottles of wine and some i/v gin). Carolyn Minnott is wonderfully earnest as mother \"Claudette\", too. It's amateur in just about every way, but funnily enough that might just be the reason it has achieved cult status. Aim very low, and you will still be setting your sights too high!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After many at home viewings of THE ROOM and one particularly awesome theater experience - and by awesome I mean experiencing a movie with audience participation in a way I had never before encountered: audience participation that genuinely enhanced the experience of watching an already immensely entertaining work (and that's a rare kind of awesome). I can only conclude that THE ROOM is my personal favorite film to be experienced in a group setting, my favorite film to introduce to people, and probably just my favorite film to sit down and watch all on my lonesome.\n\nFirst, what it's all about... It's a story about a man named JOHNNY who is a good person living in a world of devious people. His good intentions and simple, sweat dreams of a happy life begin to fall apart as those around him abuse his good nature; his loyalty, his giving, charitable spirit, and most painful of all his manipulation at the hands of his love Lisa. His betrayal through the sudden onset unfaithfulness of his beautiful bride to be is the driving force of the room: A good person surrounded by such undeserved pressures results in a film that is ultimately a view into the emotional and physical destruction of the character JOHNNY - an everyman, of sorts - as his friends, his lover, his job, and finally his grip on reality betray him.\n\nIt's a dark film, but with many light moments as interesting, quirky characters drift into THE ROOM and JOHNNY's life, bringing with them unique personal situations, problems, and other glimpses into young, modern urban life in America. These flashes of brightness and Americana drama serve as a backdrop to the exacerbating suffering of our Hero.\n\nTHE ROOM is a story of betrayal and loss, weaved in to a world of colorful, compelling characters. It is the saddest drama; it is the blackest comedy; it is the saddest love story. It's a lot of things, all of which you should see. Once you are 5 minutes into the film, you cannot turn away. It's a museum quality example of independent film in the United States.\n\nAnd yes, I should mention something of the acting, writing, sets and such. The performances and staging are poor compared to studio films. But the experience is incomparable in any context. Go buy this movie at AMAZON, setup a THE ROOM party night and experience the work for yourself."

The screenplay & dialogue are even better pushing the limits of seventh grade drama. Armed with a blind cinematography and tri-pod supported by a one legged dwarf the film shows real life situations in a raw and entertaining manner. All the characters are loveable and enjoyable to watch, especially Denny a lifelike teenage puppet with the sensitive heart of gold. The character \"arch\" goes all over the place like a rocket rollercoaster too confused to stay on the track but entertaining none the less. I loved this movie, it may sound like I am being cynical but really I am not! This is tommy's first movie and by golly it is fun (just as long as you don't take it seriously). I think that this film will definitely find an audience and a large cult following. I recommend this quirky \"dark comedy\" drama sitcom play movie to anyone who loves to laugh and enjoys a good time. his movie gives amateur filmmakers hope for the future. Thanks Tommy, you taught us to laugh and love again. 9 3/8 stars!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room has been highly criticized for several years since it's release in 2003, and has become a cult film among many film fans. The film as a whole is quite unique and lives up to it's hype of \"so bad it's good\". The Room features acting that is noticeably bad as the actors rarely show proper emotion as you can tell as if they don't know what it is they are doing. As well as the dialogue (consisting of \"Oh hi\" and \"my future wife\", along with others)\n\nWatching this film as one would know it's not good makes the viewing better. There is a lot of unintentional comedy in this film coming from the characters, the situation and overall chemistry and random unneeded sex scenes. The Room is quite funny in that aspect and is funnier than many recent comedies of the last few years. Although not labeled a comedy and more so a drama, though some claim it as a dark comedy- which makes sense.\n\n=== As a rewatch 01/20/18' the Room remains a highly entertaining and unintentionally funny film. Having revisited this film from after watching the Disaster Artist, there is much in which that film did in which we see here in the room. As have already pointed out, this film was meant to be serious but within the characters' acting and overall lines, awkward sex scenes and other bizarre happenings, this film is more content with being a dark comedy. Better on a second viewing with more content of paying attention. For another rewatch 04/28/20' and a couple years later, the Room still holds up as an unintentional dark comedy filled with bizarre scenes, dialogues and an overall aspect which makes it a unique watching experience."

And there are a lot of them.\n\nMoving the plot along happens while our non-sensical and under explained characters interact in the most awkward way.\n\nI was prepared for a bad movie but at least expected it to be funny.

But the selfish and scheming Lisa has fallen completely out of love with him after seven years, and she starts to think exclusively about number one. Now thinking that she loves Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), she sets out to seduce him. And, despite the advice of others in their circle, she's in absolutely no rush to tell Johnny the truth.\n\nThis movie certainly became a legend in its own time, even if for all the wrong reasons. Its absolutely ridiculous (but oh so quotable) script quickly entered the public lexicon: \"Oh hi Mark.\", \"You are TEARING ME APART, Lisa!\", \"Ha ha ha, what a story, Mark.\", etc. The fact that this script is so cheesy is compounded by a lot of cheesy acting, as well, with Lisa's mother (Carolyn Minnott) a hoot as she tries to harangue Lisa into staying with Johnny for financial stability purposes. That said, the movie is never more amusing than when the inimitable Wiseau is on screen.\n\nOne can believe that Wiseau started this effort with serious intentions, trying to examine the importance of trust and transparency in relationships & friendships, but the silliness of the plot & dialogue just sink the whole thing. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing; people quickly came to embrace \"The Room\" as a modern classic in terms of \"so bad they're good\" movies.\n\nA poorly-made clunker with a hilariously melodramatic music score and a couple of really bad songs, \"The Room\" is ideal viewing if one is in the mood for a lot of laughs and has a lot of beers at the ready. It's THAT daft.\n\nFive out of 10."

Brilliant acting! The costume design is out of this world phenomenon !!!!!!!!!!!! My only gripe with the film is that it is too short! Why not make it a four hour film so we could all enjoy the fantasy for even longer? Come on Tommy! Do better! Can't wait to see Best F(r)iends!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Perplexed, unresolved plot holes, coupled with exceedingly desolate acting, to the tedious tune of a mundane, out of place score, The Room is quite possibly the worst film ever made. However it could also be the most prodigious fabrication ever to grace celluloid. Is Tommy Wisseau, the star, producer, director and egocentric narcissist behind this creation, an idiot savant trolling us all, or merely a halfwit dunce who can't distinguish the difference between creating a film, and the malodorous odour that vacates his anus? Technically-speaking, this 'film' is brimming with ignominious blemishes, from nonsensical editing to a complete absence of any sort of character development. The generic plot involving a woman cheating on her partner with another man is just yet another stain on this technically-dreadful piece of film making. Yet what draws the countless numbers of cult followers, the numerous screenings worldwide and extravagant publicity surrounding The Room? Is it the captivating and perplexing appeal of the outlandish and elusive Tommy Wisseau, whose origins lay unknown to this very day? Are the fans simply entertained by how implicitly bad the film is? The reason The Room may quite possibly be the worst best film ever created, is because every single aspect of the film, subtle or not, is characterised by the poorest of film-making standards, from the movements of the characters to the situation and setting of the scenes. Mr Wisseau could not have deliberately created a film this mind numbingly awful, as that would have been near impossible. Go see this, you won't regret it."

Okay, that's a lie, it's his acting that makes for problems understanding. Probably the best SBIG element is his acting, but the writing is a very close second. As unintentionally funny as this flick is I can only give it a grudging good review because of the interminable sex scenes that make me want to claw at my eyes. Just saying.\n\nJohnny is such a good guy. Everybody just looooooooves him. Even the teenage boy from the sixth floor wants to jump his bones. I mean, he does, he just jumps right in the middle of Johnny and his fianc\u00e9 as they romp fully clothed on their bed! And when he does the couple just laugh as if that's the cutest dang thing. Except of course Johnny sternly tells the kid to get lost on accounta there's sweet loving afoot. The whole movie is replete with scenes that never in a million years would ever happen twixt people, which is a kind of joy."

Citizen Kane has nothing on this baby. Tears are falling on this keyboard thinking about all the passionate and groundbreaking scenes and lines such as YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA! and many other treasures.

The movie really is lacking on a plot simply because you don't know what anything is going to lead to which makes it that much more exciting.\n\nI recently saw a screening of \"The Room\" in Austin, TX. This is where I met Tommy who was surprisingly shorter than the film portrays. Not only did I like the movie but Tommy as a person is a pretty down to Earth kind of guy. If you ever get a chance to go see a screening of this film and meet the man who created it, I would highly recommend it. Even if you have watched this film 20 or so times. The screenings can be compared so something like Rocky Horrer screenings. The audience can interact with the movie which makes it a great time."

What makes this film awfully charming is the dialogue. The acting is awful the camerawork sucks and the direction is terrible.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've finally discovered this movie because of the release of The Disaster Artist which is about the making of this film and the fact that one of my local cinemas has screened this film for one hundred months in a row.\n\nThere are movies that are so bad that they are genuinely entertaining like the vivid and weird Samurai Cop. Other films are so bad that they are genuinely horrible and don't have anything going for them like the vapid Hobgoblins. The Room is actually a mixture of both types of bad movies. The first thirty minutes of the film were extremely hard to sit through and basically just consisted of poorly shot soft porn scenes. However, the final hour or so was so absurd with numerous strange subplots and a certain raise in tension that it kept my attention until the end.\n\nThere are a few elements that I genuinely like. First of all, the camera work isn't too bad if compared to numerous contemporary low budget flicks with shaky camera perspectives. Secondly, Juliette Danielle isn't only nice to look at but has a certain appeal as confused sociopath and careless femme fatale. Thirdly, Tommy Wiseau's acting skills, even though they are wooden, definitely have a memorable and unique touch and aren't like anything I have ever seen in my life. Fourthly, the movie's soundtrack blends in very well. I wouldn't call it great but it serves its purpose in the different scenes.\n\nThe other elements are so bad that they keep my attention. The acting skills vary from below average to bad. The dialogues are so thin, repetitive and wooden that an average elementary school student could have come up with something more intriguing. The main story could be described in three sentences but takes more than one hour and a half hours to unfold in a painfully slow development. The numerous unnecessary subplots going nowhere are cringe-worthy oddities that turn out being unintentionally memorable. The decorations and settings look cheap, fake and misplaced. The overlong sex scenes look so unreal that they are actually everything but exciting.\n\nAmong the biggest oddities are the random spoon pictures, the main character's friends making love in his living room for no apparent reason, the emotionless dialogue about breast cancer, the numerous random football scenes and the two fake scenes involving characters tripping and getting injured. My favorite part is however the scene in the flower shop with the overtly quick exchange of senseless dialogue lines. This scene alone shows everything this film is about: a random scene with an unimportant side character, weak acting skills, bland dialogues, ordinary settings and unintentionally funny improvisation.\n\nThe Room might have several purposes. It shows us how not to make a movie. It's a great party flick to watch with your friends to switch your brains off. It's a welcome distraction from your everyday lives. It's bizarre, goofy and almost surreal in its very unique style. It's a movie you won't ever forget. These are perhaps unintentional accomplishments that most serious films however fail to achieve which is why Tommy Wiseau still deserves some serious respect for his project.\n\nDespite its numerous obvious flaws, it's a weird experience you won't forget anytime soon which is exactly why this disaster of a movie became a cult classic. The sad thing is that Tommy Wiseau put so much passion into this project that I would honestly recommend watching this movie over any exchangeable contemporary superhero sequel flooding the world's cinemas. The Room is one of those movies you should have watched once in your lifetime for all the reasons stated above. I'm sure I will watch it again with a bunch of friends after having just discovered this film on my own this week."

It most certainly is up there.\n\nThe dialogue is perhaps the most ridiculous, nonsensical ever committed to film. In some places it just doesn't even match with what is happening on screen leaving you completely bewildered but in a state of amusement for sure. The infamous \"I did not\" scene will have you both roaring with laughter and shaking your head at the ludicrous nature of it all.\n\nThis film is full of bizarre & random scenes such as playing football (American) in a tuxedo, excruciating long and unrealistic sex scenes, absurd conversations with friends, nonchalantly discussing illness and that hideous out of place laugh that made me fell nervous and uncomfortable every time it sounded.\n\nThe acting is in the premiership of dreadfulness. I cannot believe that these people were paid for doing such an awful job \u2013 there is certainly hope for us all yet. Nothing is said with any passion or commitment to the project. Everything is said matter-of-factly straight from the script pages.\n\nSo is this film \"so bad it's good\" or \"so bad it's hated\"? Truth be told it's neither and is that rarity of just being plain bad. It is however definitely worth seeing to delight in its absurdity.\n\nI'm not an expert in film or cinematic techniques (as you can undoubtedly tell from this review) but just a guy who watches a lot of films. Whilst it is true that this is an awful film in its acting, writing, production and direction, it is incredibly difficult to be too harsh for one reason; Tommy Wiseau. Here we have a man, who despite not being the most talented has achieved something most of us never will \u2013 by making this film he has followed his dream and there is something heart achingly beautiful in that most illusive of human endeavours."

The fans were not fans...They were acolytes of Tommy Wiseau and his vision. The dialogue is at most time a grammatical nightmare and the acting would make some Oscar winners cringe. The Set and special effects look like a school play. But the message. THE MESSAGE! Thesehoesaintloyal and neither are your boys. Its a movie you have to watch knowing its going to be bad. But in comparison to a Jerry Bruckheimer ego stroking this is a work of art."

Tommy Wiseau playing Johnny, the film's lead, delivered a performance which was awkward, over the top, and intriguing. His line delivery was impressive. This film was an absolute dread to watch but he was very talented nonetheless. The dialogue was awkward and nonsensical and it made it memorable. Scenes meant to be serious turn out hilarious due to the bizarre script and even more bizarre acting. There were some plot holes here and there as well. The supporting cast added their own brand of weirdness to the mix. Lisa brings her own strange energy and the character Denny is a whole different story. In conclusion, this film wasn't that good. It reminds me of a film I watched when I was a kid, \"Fred.\" Both films kind of suck but they kept me interested and engaged. Overall, this film was an experience that I'll look back at fondly."

There are some hilarious lines because it's all just nonsense. It's amazing that this movie got made at all. Of course it's a 1/10 if we grade it seriously. But gosh darn it it's like a 9/10 for the pure entertainment I get from how badly made this movie was. I guess Tommy really made solidified a new way of filmmaking: make it so bad that that is how people will love it and be entertained. I'd you don't know, Tommy meant for this movie to be serious.

This is probably the best screenplay and camera-work ever,and the performances are such which cannot be described. the only flaw with this movie is you cannot watch it in the theatre,because u'll laugh so hard that you might miss the next godly scene.

Nowadays though watching the Room in a Cinema is a completely different experience, a sea of people all in on the joke, it's just mesmerising. Believe me if you ever get the chance to go to a screening I highly recommend it, you won't regret it. Right from the moment Tommy first appears on the screen the film is utterly shambolic, so many weird moments, so many pointless establishing shots, dialogue that no human being has said or ever will. If this was aimed as a comedy it would be a complete dud, the unintentional laughter that comes from what was supposed to be a serious film just makes it. Wonderful."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room... directed by Tommy Wiseau... I don't need to say anything else about this movie. It basically speaks for itself. It's the most notorious indie-drama of the 2000s and it's production resulted in co-star Greg Sestero to write the novel 'The Disaster Artist', chronicling the making of 'The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies'. And now The Disaster Artist is getting its own movie; directed by James Franco, who will also play Tommy Wiseau in the film; additionally, Dave Franco will play Greg Sestero. And The Room actually deserves a movie based around its legacy, because this film has a cult following like no other and a warped-beyond-comprehension fandom that embraces the film's unintentional campiness. Basically, it's an ironic masterpiece that's so bad it's amazing!\n\nThe movie has dialogue that makes even the worst screen writing seem like the works of Robert Towne and Orson Welles; it's especially funny here because Wiseau actually cites Welles as a massive inspiration on his work. And... Tommy Wiseau has set such an admirably unique low-bar for indie-cinema that its effects on the indie film industry inspired lesser filmmakers to pick up their wits when making their passion projects. If Reservoir Dogs set the bar for quality and smart indie-cinema, then The Room set it for belief- suspending campiness full of WTF moments and nonsensical subplots that would inspire the likes of Birdemic, A Talking Cat and Cool Cat Saves The Kids. And The Room started this absurdity.\n\nThe Room; it's like an alien trying to figure out how character drama works without realising anything about natural human behaviour or character. And that alien would be a very 'special' one."

The acting is atrocious and the storyline and film style is tangential and unfocused. I can see why a film was made by James Franco and co essentially mocking the process this film went through to be made. I don't think Tommy Wiseau to this day realizes this!

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't often say this, but I believe sometime it's important to watch the bad movies so that you can appreciate the good films even more. I had been holding out on watching The Room for a long time, but upon the release of The Disaster Artist, I felt it was the right time to divulge into the madness. And make no mistake, the film does not disappoint. This is easily one of the worst films ever made, if not the worst. But unlike many horrible films I have seen, there's a certain amount of undeniable enjoyment here. I know Tommy Wiseau has come out and said the film was purposefully comedic and should be considered a \"dark comedy\", but there's no way most of this film was this intentionally bad. Either way, there are so many memorably awful and funny things to come out of this. First off, unless it was just my copy of the DVD from the library, but it sure seemed like the words spoken and the timing of the characters mouth's moving were not linked up for most of the film. But that's the only major technical issue I noticed with the movie. Speaking of which, how in god's name did this film cost 6 million dollars to make? There's no action, shouldn't be any special effects, nor green screen scenes (though apparently Wiseau did actually do some of that). Why would this film cost that much? An even better question may be how the heck he came up with 6 million on his own to produce this? At any rate, The Room is one of the most fun mistakes Hollywood has ever produced. I'm already looking at YouTube constantly for these short clips from the film that make absolutely no sense to fulfill my entertainment for that particular moment. It's no wonder why James Franco was able to come up with an entire film worth of ideas and moments to make The Disaster Artist a success.\n\n0.5/10\n\n(.5 for the mere fact that this film is memorably atrocious)"

It's bizarre directional choices , camera angles , flimsy dialogues , exaggerated acting are all part of it's charm. It's probably the most quotable movie you will ever watch.\n\nI definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It must be experienced at least once in your life. You might even appreciate a lot of skills which we take for granted in any other movie.\n\nDon't watch this movie alone but get your friends together and prepare to have a great time.\n\nTruly the Citizen Kane of bad movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first review for IMDb and of course, I want to review something special. Then again, how can it be special, when \"The Room\" has been analyzed, reviewed and thinkpieced to death already?\n\nMusic had its own \"The Room\" in 2016 with Corey Feldman's \"Angelic 2 the Core\": a work so utterly and baffingly bad yet driven by an unexplainable determination - and overconfindence - of its maker.\n\nThis is a 1/10 if there ever was one but at the same time, it will make your life richer, it will entertain you every single minute of its runtime. I don't if you could make a film this funny if you set out to do it. And it's a communal experience: You haven't really lived until you threw \"Anyway, how's your sex life?\" randomly into a conversation with friends, greet each other with \"Oh, hi...\" or reacted to something with \"Hahaha, what a story!\" (Unfortunately, I don't have many friends who know the film, so for now.... I did naaaaat.)\n\nI could recount the story here but it's incoherent and irrelevant anyway. The film lives and breathes through its bad scene setting, plot holes as big as the Earth and the worst acting ever. Tommy Wiseau manages to keep his dialogue, his body language, his tone of voice and his facial expressions strictly seperate from one another. I would say it's like watching amateur theater if it wasn't so insulting to amateur theater. This is the bible of drunk/trash watching and if you like that concept in any regard, you HAVE to see this film."

I love it! The plot, which revolves around a love triangle and the friendships, is melodramatic and overly simplistic, but that's part of the fun. The dialogue is only hindered by Wiseau's accent but hell, we're not all Brad Pitt!\n\nIt's the perfect movie for a movie night, offering laughs and awkward moments that bring a smile to your face.

I couldn't look away the first time I saw it. One of the reasons we love comedy or horror is that we're not the ones being laughed at or chased by a killer. This film has both, comedy of absurd with the horror of the most extreme side of the scale of terribleness. This is a must watch best worst film of all time."

If you watch this movie twice, knowing what to expect, you will find it a completely different experience.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Room is a film directed, written, produced, starring and likely catered by fame-seeker and wannabe cultural icon Tommy Wiseau. Johnny (Wiseau) our Dramamine swilling protagonist is a seemingly perfect human being who lives in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Danielle). He exercises regularly running and playing catch with neighborhood urchin Denny (Haldiman). He also goes to his job to do business stuff. One day, Lisa wakes up realizing she no longer loves Johnny and seduces his best friend Mark (Sestero). All of the couple's mutual friends think Lisa's actions are despicable while Lisa's mother (Minnott) believes Johnny is the key to Lisa's financial security and she shouldn't call off the wedding. That is about as much plot as you can gleam out of this impossibly contrived film which aims for the melodrama of Dallas (1978-1991) but ends up feeling like a two act play written by second graders.\n\nThe Room is considered one of the worst movies ever made which, after a very brief first life in theaters, has become a midnight screening staple and so- bad-it's-good classic to eye-rolling hipsters and giddy schlock fans. Boasting inept direction, screen writing, cinematography, lighting, acting, special-effects, editing, et al., The Room is essentially a master course of what NOT to do when it comes to film-making. Yet despite the film's almost willful ignorance to straightforward storytelling, the film has an appeal that defies logic. Like watching the hypnotic gaze of an esurient asp, The Room puts you in a trance and forces you to sit through the entire f***ing thing; from it's softcore porn bedroom scenes to it's woman hating living room scenes.\n\nI had the pleasure of sitting through this movie among the right crowd and found myself laughing often and hard. The film's artless bubbling; every moment of amateurishness was done in just about the worst way possible allowing the audience to become flabbergasted by it all. Wiseau has said that his biggest influences for The Room were films like Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and the collective works of Elizabeth Taylor, Tennessee Williams and Alfred Hitchcock. In reality the film is more an ugly-looking amalgam of everything an Eastern European immigrant would assume appeals to an American audience including extended moments of alley way football.\n\nOne would need to watch this affront to celluloid countless times before they can truly discover how a movie like this could be so popular among certain crowds. Perhaps one place to start looking would be Wiseau's absolutely appalling performance as Johnny. Unlike the other \"actors\" that flood the screen, Wiseau doesn't just approach the script with amateurish drudgery. His idiosyncratic delivery, clumsy blocking and confusing chatter reaches new heights in gleeful, over-the-top nuttiness. It feels as if Wiseau was sent from another planet to make a movie as a test to see if they can assimilate. If in the years to come it's discovered there's been a They Live (1988) meets The X-Files (1993-present) season 9 type conspiracy, one would only need to see The Room to discover where it all started.\n\nThe Room stands outside of time and space and certainly outside of the history of cinema. It's a movie that defies logic; a movie that proves quite entertaining if given the right circumstances but if slightly less overwrought would have been completely forgotten. Wiseau has appeared at many viewings of the film and bolsters his inflated ego as a purposeful disaster artist who revels in sardonic satire. I personally don't believe him for a minute. The frantic, neurotic emotional core of The Room is arguably the only thing about the film that felt genuine. That and two characters' uncomfortable obsession with chocolate. Seriously guys, get a room."

It is an abject and aggressive failure on every conceivable level: costumes, score, acting, script, editing. And yet you must see it! Tommy Wiseau, the director, is a finger-painter who thought he was creating the Mona Lisa and accidentally drew the world's funniest and most wildly popular picture of a willy.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to rate any creative endeavour based on how well it achieves its intended goals and that's why, with a very heavy heart, I must award The Room one solitary star. This star is awarded for the act of existing, and I present it out of sheer charity. If enjoyment could only be derived from an appraisal of technical skill, the only thing worse than this train crash of a film would be watching it on a crashing train.\n\nBut if you were to rate the experience of this movie it would get ten stars. Easy. The Room is unintentionally one hundred of the most riotously fun minutes out there and will propel you full-force into a state of hilarious insanity."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, of course I've seen this film before. This review is kind of just for the books, because I've decided to write my cult film essay on it, so I had to rewatch it.\n\nAnd you probably already know what I'm going to say, including, but not limited to:\n\nThe acting is pants throughout, from everyone, nearly all the time, but especially the auteur himself, Tommy Wiseau.\n\nYou could cut out something like two thirds of what passes for this film's \"narrative\" to no effect, because it is casually dropping new plot points and characters that go nowhere and are never heard from again right up until the final scene.\n\nIt's so poorly directed that I wouldn't be surprised at all if 95% of Tommy's directing was him saying \"okay, now big emotions! Very good, hahahaha\", followed shortly by \"Action!\", and there are absolutely zero interesting shots, unless you count the times that the camera was out of focus.\n\nThe soundtrack is godawful, sounding straight out of a 1980s straight to video porn, or maybe a 2000s straight to television romcom. Either or.\n\nThe dialogue is...perfect.\n\nThe sets are janky, never feel like what they're supposed to be, and feel like they'd fall apart if someone sneezed near them.\n\nThe characters all act like what a seven year old who somehow knows exactly what things like sex, cancer, and psychiatry are thinks grown up life is like.\n\nAnd the pacing is as slow as a wheelchair on a gravel beach, mostly because of the aforementioned narrative being mostly comprised of characters being introduced and then forgotten about for long enough before the ending to make this feature length.\n\nAnd I absolutely adore it. Seriously, this is one of those films you have to see to believe. If you haven't, don't look up anything else about it. Just go watch it now, because I promise at the very least it will make you feel...something.\n\nFor me, it soothed the fears I sometimes have of wondering whether I'm too nice/harsh on other films, because when I think about it, a lot of films, even if I think they're bad, do get a lot of things right, or at least competent. I don't tend to mention things like sets or pacing, but that's because a huge amount of films get those things right, so much so that sometimes I feel like I take it for granted. It takes a film this stupendously inept to remind me that if a film does get those things right, that's at least worthy of a little bit of praise.\n\nAnd on the other side of the coin, sometimes when I worry I'm being too nice for a film for having, say, characters that are at least consistent, even if I don't like them, I can think back on a film like The Room to remind myself that, no, that is in fact worth a little bit of credit.\n\nAnd sometimes when I worry that I should be getting on with other work because deadlines are on their way, I can think back on everything I've written here so far and stop dragging this review out."
