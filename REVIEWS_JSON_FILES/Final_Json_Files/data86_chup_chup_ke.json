Surprisingly full mileage is not taken out of the roles of Paresh Rawal and Om Puri. Kareena looks stunning , ravishing and lot of ...ings and her chemistry with Shahid works for the movie. Now a few bad points. Shahid carries his role single dimensionally. Chup Chup Ke is a movie in which many people are surplus to the requirement. Neha Dhupia is wasted and so are Anupam Kher, Sushma Reddy, Om Puri and Paresh Rawal. Asrani and Shakti Kapoor are just a shadows of their former selves. Sunil Shetty looks tired and type casted. But the biggest let down is casting of Om Puri as a Gujju. Sushma Reddy looks unpalatable sans make up."

Kareena Kapoor was very good in the film, even though i am not a big fan of hers she is very talented and can go far in her career, that is if she picks the right roles. I also liked Anumpam Kher and Shakti Kapoor too also, they were very funny in the film.\n\nThe music is very good in the movie, my personal faves were \"Dil Vich\" and \"Hare Hare\"i really recommend it to everyone."

But for a Drama subject, i don't see why there were so many unwanted characters. It makes one confused at some point in the movie.\n\nThe performance were okish by everyone except Paresh Rawal and Rajpal Yadav who were outstanding as always. Shahid Kapoor has a long way before being called a good actor. Kareena Kapoor had a surprisingly small role which she surprisingly performed well enough and she looked very cute and......reddish. Neha Dupia was good too.\n\nCatch this on a DVD and watch it with family. Its a clean movie."

        "review_title": "The good news is that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in this film. The bad news is that everyone else does",
        "review_detailed_main": "The good news is that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in this film The bad news is that everyone else does\u0085 the problem is that they don't just talk but shout, scream, shriek, screech and yell.\n\nChup Chup Ke continues Priyadarshan's stint with loud comedies. The good news is that this Priyadarshani film has a story to narrate (unlike Garam Masala). The bad news is that this time again the story is a Hindi adaptation of a Malayalam film named Punjabi House (unlike Malamaal Weekly that was his only original Hindi attempt)\n\nHowever the story is interesting enough. Jeetu (Shahid Kapoor) is drenched in debts that he is unable to payback. So he attempts suicide by jumping in the sea only to be caught in the net of fisherman Bandya (Rajpal Yadav). Bandya's master Gundya (Paresh Rawal) in turn has taken heavy loans from Prabhat Singh Chauhan (Om Puri). As a loan security, Gundya keeps Jeetu as a deposit at Chauhan's house, who fakes to be a mute and deaf guy. Chauhan's niece Shruti (Kareena Kapoor) who is actually mute falls for Jeetu. Confusion seeps in the story when Jeetu's ex-fianc\u00e9 Pooja (Sushma Reddy) comes into picture.\n\nThe good news is that Priyadarshan's brand of humor is not as bland or slapstick as David Dhawan's recent films. The bad news is that it's not as credible or tongue-in-cheek as a Hrishikesh Mukherjee or a Basu Chatterjee film, either.\n\nThe movie starts with a bang getting straight to the point. The director doesn't waste time in establishment of the characters. Right from the first scene, the story of the film keeps moving ahead, thereby keeping your interest alive. Priyadarshan doesn't experiment with the treatment of humor though, going on with his trademark style of comedy. The characters play out loud and to the gallery. Another problem with the Priyadarshan brand of comedy is that he stretches the humor in a scene a bit too much and doesn't know where to stop, thereby making it repetitive and monotonous at times. However thanks to some well-written scenes and Neeraj Vora's dependable funny one-liners that range from the witty to the corny ones, the film does succeed in making you laugh.\n\nOne more bone of contention is that the genre of the film is not just focused at being a comedy. That lasts for the first two hours after which the genre shifts towards drama. After a good dose of laughter in the first half, you don't feel like changing moods with the subsequent on screen emotional outbursts. And while Priyadarshan handles the comic portions of the film in a larger-than-life manner, his treatment of emotions is very much natural. (Not many might remember Priyadarshan as the director of touching emotional films like Gardish, Virasat and Sazae Kala Paani much before he molded himself as a comedy specialist). Conversely, how one wishes it were just the opposite in this film i.e. the comedy to be more natural while one could overlook the heavier side with some passable artificial emotions.\n\nThe fluctuating genres very much remind of Priyadarshan's Hulchul that too turned intense in the last one hour. Moreover the family setting and characterizations of Suniel Shetty and Kareena Kapoor seems to be directly derived from Hulchul.\n\nPriyadarshan has a standard team of actors like Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Om Puri, Asrani, Manoj Joshi and Suniel Shetty with whom he extracts fine work. Paresh Rawal is getting repetitive though you love to see him repeat the act. From being a serious actor, Om Puri has already made a transition into the comedy arena with \u00e9lan. Rajpal Yadav yet again goes over the top, but somehow in this film, this actor steals the show amongst others thanks to the best scenes and lines that he gets. His timing and expressions add to the effect.\n\nLike his team of actors, Priyadarshan also has a standard team of technicians in his film like cinematographer Tirru and art director Sabu Cyril. Sabu repeats the typical pillars-in-the-garden set design for the song sequences. The white color in costume designs is consistently maintained throughout the film to impart a pure look to the frames.\n\nThe good news is that Himesh Reshammiya composes the music of this film. The bad news (for some) is that he even sings some of the tracks here.\n\nAmongst other actors, Shahid is quite efficient. Kareena looks gorgeous and since she doesn't have to mouth a single line in the entire film (not even in a dream sequence), you are saved by her otherwise over-expressive dialogue delivery skills. In fact Neha Dhupia gets more scope and she makes the best use of it. Sushma Reddy is restricted only to some 4-5 scenes. Suniel Shetty is getting typecast in these kinds of roles playing the aggressive and protective brother. Soon he might become a substitute for Jackie Shroff.\n\nOverall, Chup Chup Ke isn't as silent as the title suggests. However despite it's loose (or loud) ends, it still manages to be a good family entertainer."

This one is a little similar, however, this film is so very funny. I had to rewind some scenes just to laugh again. I have never seen a film that made me to laugh so hard.\n\nBest of all, those funny scenes don't seem to be contrived. they are so natural. The actors are so good at it. Rajpal Yadav was the best. Indian movies tend to be more than two hours long with an interval. Most of the films lost its momentum in the first part. I very much enjoyed this film, I actually didn't mind that this film was so long, because they keep showing funny scenes one after another.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely watch it. It will make you laugh so hard. Too bad, the storyline is mostly fit with the Indian society. Otherwise, I totally hope that Hollywood can make one based on this.\n\nShahid Kapur, he can really dance. there was one close up scene showing his teeth, he needs to see a dentist to fix his teeth. I suggest that he should use electrical toothbrush."

Proving that mixing these two genres is very much possible. Heck the Malayalam movie was so good any person who's watched it, would still stop whatever they're doing to get another glimpse of scenes from the movie if some scene from the movie happens to be played somewhere around them.\n\nSo why was this movie so much worse than the Malayalam version? Well, let's see what changed, shall we? Pretty much the only thing that changed, was the cast. Actors in the Bollywood version was so horrible, it's incredible. In fact, the only person who acted well in the movie was Kareena Kapoor. Shahid simply did not do a good enough job adapting to the character. Not to an extend that is expected of him, who's otherwise a brilliant actor.\n\nNot even the comedians were able to pull of the brilliant Comic breaks that was scripted for them.\n\nBollywood has evolved into an industry people seek to join for it's glamour, and nothing but the glam and money. These days, it only has a handful of good actors. While the rest are popular only due to glam and gossiping. Shameful!"

When I saw Chup Chup Ke with my parents, I kept laughing just because my father was howling in laughter and I fond the movie funny. But when I saw the movie alone again, I did not find it funny at all.\n\nParesh Rawal got too repetitive in his manners and behavior. Shahid was an epitome of over acting. He looked weird rather than humorous playing deaf and dumb. Rajpal Yadav kept playing his usual role as a side kick who is made to do a lot of silly acts. I liked Kareena's acting as it was natural and, thank god, she did not talk throughout the movie. While the Gujarati family, which had Om Puri and a couple of hundreds of people, really addled my mind. I don't think we have wrestlers in Gujarat who keep fighting. Its normally done in the North. And instead of playing Garbo, the family celebrates singing Hindi songs and dancing as if they are Punjabis. I mean, in the beginning, most of the members of the family are shown as if they do not know any Hindi, and in the second part, all are shown singing in Hindi.\n\nThe second half of the movie was terribly dragging as members of the family kept weeping all the time. The film had too many characters and so, it became a complete mess.\n\nOverall, it is a bad movie. So I give it a 4 out of 10."

The climax is not a typical Priyadarshan comedy climax as this film itself is not entirely a comedy genre but more of a romantic drama genre laced with comedy hence you get a serious drama ending rather than those comical mindless endings .\n\nThanks to the legend Neeraj Vora, the comical scenes are spot on! Priyadarshan was at his peak when this man was giving him company sadly he's no more. Priyadarshan must be genuinely missing him.\n\nThe film's cast has almost all the regulars of Priyadarshan film except Shahid Kapoor and Kareena . Kareena's role is unique as she has no dialogues as she is plays a mute girl. Rajpal Yadav however is the star of this film with the best comical scenes given to him. No doubt this man has been the go-to man for Priyadarshan in almost all his comedy films and this is followed by Paresh Rawal who also does a great job in his comedy. Suniel Shetty is in a more serious role here unlike other comedy Priyadarshan films . Rest others like Shakti Kapoor, Asrani, Anupam kher etc have done good.\n\nThe film does get a tad slow and boring when the comedy starts to fade out in the 2nd half. This is where the film kinda breaks apart but then it is made up in the climax."

The two are comic geniuses and are the saving grace of this film. Kareena comes in much later in the film and has a small, but obviously very important role. Shahid and Kareena give good performances. Neha Dhupia was a bit disappointing. After some comedy, the movie once again shifts gears to a serious mood, and by that time the movie becomes a drag. Songs are lame except for \"Dil Vich.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Story line- The hero is in love with Girl A. He meets her 'chup-chup ke' \u2013 hidingly....because the money lenders are after his life.\n\nThe hero is under heavy debts, he drowns and is picked up by a poor boat owner \u2013 who uses his boat for fishing. Anyway \u2013 the hero lands up in the house of a rich man. The rich family keeps the hero as their servant and since he was somewhat deaf and mute (but actually he was fine \u2013 just pretending to be deaf and mute so that he does not have to go back to his own locality where the money lenders will all jump on him!)they gave him small odd jobs to perform.\n\nIn the same rich and affluent family, there is a girl (played by sex-siren Kareena \u2013 who was actually just mute not deaf). So her cousin finds that a new domestic male helper has joined who is also mute! The love story starts! Wow! What an idea sirji!! Whoever has written this utter crap story! OK there is a twist in the tale too \u2013 no rich and affluent male was ready to marry Kareena because of her handicap! So all the family members were looking for a suitable groom ...and were unable to find one! Like..... Are you kidding me!? Such a rich female ..plus beautiful and fair too - who will get a huge dowry with her \u2013 Indian families with sons will fall at her feet and lick it for the rest of their lives! There are many such educated but not very well off families in India who would do anything for getting a bride from a rich family...watch Saavdhan India episodes if you have doubts! Anyways, she falls in love with the guy who was hired as a domestic helper in the family. Later the beans got spilled and the Girl A \u2013 with whom the hero was actually in love comes to now that he was alive. When she confronts him, it was already too late \u2013 he had accepted rich and mute kareena \u2013 who was obviously much prettier than the Girl A..and was about to marry her! I mean why wouldn't he \u2013 he would be able to live happily ever after as a rich man and will even get rid of the money lenders! Girl A was dropped as a dead fly from the milk! End of story Conclusion- I have often heard that there are families \u2013rich and affluent \u2013 having huge palatial houses...make the servants render sexual services too! Like fatso wives...whose equally ugly and fatso husbands pick-up (call) girls from the streets for a 'quicky' \u2013 or even visit brothels or \u2013 if a wee bit more rich \u2013 then they book a hotel room and sleep with the females engaged in escort services.\n\nProbably this is the reason why kareena's cousin introduces her to the newly acquired helper...at least she could taste...love..making?...since no one was marrying her? Btw. The fact that the females of the house sleep with the servants, drivers, gatekeepers..etc. is known to the males of the family \u2013 it is a 'you are OK, i am OK' relationship \u2013 the males eff around outside the famels eff around inside...since they are cultured and ethical and traditional \u2013 they eff indoors and not hire gigolos! Problem happens when dull headed males watch such films \u2013 if they reach some such house- as domestic helpers - where females are sleeping around and game...then things are under control...but if such dumb fools reach a decent, righteous household and try to act fresh (the film after all showed the possibility of the daughter marrying the helper...so such concepts raise expectations as well huh)- then hell breaks loose!...the helper gets beaten by the men of the family first and then by the cops \u2013and ultimately he gets the criminal label for the rest of his life!"

This is a family movie, nowadays people are selling nasty stories in the name of comedy. Priyadarshan should definitely come up with a sequel for this movie. The story had a good plot, and very good supporting actors who performed better than the lead roles. The songs were also a big hit back then and it's still not boring at all. Most old movies get boring after a point, especially when you're watching it in 2023 but this one doesn't bore you at all. Totally worth spending 3hrs on this movie! Please make it available on Netflix and Amazon prime too."

Very poor direction, how could Priyadarshan do this?\n\n3. Huge underutilised cast.\n\n4. Very very bad acting . Shahid doesn't know how to act.. unimaginable that a director like Priyam took him as main lead.\n\nGod is great and an old saying that \"Bhagwaan meherbaan to gadha pehelwaan\" fits perfectly on him. Near Zero acting skills but doing good even now. Sushma Reddy is poor and wasted. Rajpal Yadav has repeated the same act in so many movies that it is repeatative. Khatta Meetha, Bhool Bhulaiya, De Dana Dan, etc. Anupam Kher is wasted."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a huge fan of Priyadarshan. I like almost all his movies mainly because of the comedy factor and great punchlines that are still remembered. Chup Chup Ke was also one of the best in terms of the comedy. The storyline is set in a Gujarati family. For that, some characters are written in a bit stereotypical way. Coming to the performances, Rajpal Yadav and Paresh Rawal were the ones who are remembered the most in this film. Such great actors they are. Even now also I laugh at their scenes from this film. Shakti Kapoor was also great in this film. Shahid Kapoor's character was too one-dimensional. Didn't find him that great in his role. Asrani and Om Puri - they did their parts well. Sunil Shetty looked tired and somehow typecasted(I found his acting same in Hulchul also). Kareena looked beautiful. Shahid-Kareena's chemistry was also a positive point of this film. Neha Dhupia had a meatier and impactful character than Kareena and she had done her role well. Sushma Reddy's role had a very limited screen time. Same goes to Anupam Kher. Songs are also great in this movie.\n\nOverall, an entertaining comedy movie you will really love it. It is frequently shown on TV or available in YouTube as well. Can check it out I have given 8 stars."
