        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson's movie L\u00e9on (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named L\u00e9on who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.\n\nThe performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and L\u00e9on are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.\n\nJean Reno as L\u00e9on gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while L\u00e9on serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.\n\nThe Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie."

        "review_title": "Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece",
        "review_detailed_main": "Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.\n\nIn \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It's in me, I'm a beast!\" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.\n\nHowever Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.\n\nThen of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.\n\nLeon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson's \"The Professional\" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit \"La Femme Nikiti\", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of \"The Professional\" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."

Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.\n\nThe actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.\n\nThis idea continues in L\u00e9on. L\u00e9on was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and L\u00e9on are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.\n\nI always found that until obtaining the \"Version Integral\" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an \"offending\" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.\n\nAnd so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.\n\nStylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. D\u00e9cors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. \"The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar.\" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.\n\nI have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"La Cit\u00e9 des Enfants perdu\". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter."

A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\n\nThis was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.\n\nWhile I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while L\u00e9on does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material."

Gary Oldman was phenomenal, and this was Natalie Portman's first acting credit, and she did so well considering how young she was. But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda's relationship.\n\nMathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn't do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It's clear that this film is a reflection of Besson's own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing."

Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of \"La Femme Nikita\" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, \"The Fifth Element.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or \"hit men\". They're the standard \"badass\" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). L\u00e9on, however, flips this clich\u00e9 on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.\n\nL\u00e9on begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.\n\nLuc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for L\u00e9on, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. L\u00e9on is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, L\u00e9on also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.\n\nJean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.\n\nNatalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.\n\nIn comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.\n\nThe plot of L\u00e9on is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, L\u00e9on is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a mystery to me why \"The Professional\" is rated so high here on the IMDb...#62 as I write this. To be sure, there is much to admire here. But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.\n\nLet's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second \"Star Wars\" trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.\n\nOh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He \"chews up the scenery\" to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.\n\nIn order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.\n\nOf course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?\n\nAnd speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.\n\nThe biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to \"adopt\" a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.\n\nWhile watching this movie I was often reminded of the film \"Taxi Driver\" which deals with many of the same themes. \"Taxi Driver\" is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. \"The Professional\" does not."

Having used IMDb a lot recently, I checked out Leon. It was kind of heart warming, having a great deal of my memories of this movie from the previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading the comments.\n\nIt is a glorious film. One that I've not been able to forget for all the best reasons. I think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms a movie i.e., editing or cinematography, and you'd be hard pushed to find fault.\n\nWhat makes this film Extra Special however, is the emotional 'ballet' taking place throughout the film.\n\nMy emotions were pretty much assaulted by a gang of joy/sadness/hate/fearful anticipation/love/empathy/shock/horror/hope.\n\nIt's one of those films.\n\nI adored/respected/loved Leon (I still watch nearly every film with Jean Reno in).\n\nI fell in love with Matilda. I've watched everyone of Natalie Portman's films since too.\n\nI was already a fan of Gary Oldman. This film just added extra glue to that bond. He made a brilliant sociopath, in direct contrast to Leon's (anti-)sociopath.\n\nI occasionally feel for a character (or two if it's a great romance), but it's very rare for me to be drawn into three so very different people's intimate lives so easily.\n\nIt's a shame there are too few films of this calibre."

Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way that's both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?\n\nThe American version (\"The Professional\") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw \"Leon\" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.\n\nIf you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.\n\nMy only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldman's single dimensional evilness."

The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.\n\nThere is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.\n\nThe acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman, who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!"

        "review_title": "A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date",
        "review_detailed_main": "I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.\n\nJean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.\n\nOne thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.\n\nThe second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).\n\nSo, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clich\u00e9s, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over."

Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkward\u0085\n\nSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with L\u00e9on rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is L\u00e9on's lover.\n\nThankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from L\u00e9on. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).\n\n6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie in the theatre in 1994 and I really like it then, but at the time I wouldnt be able to tell you why. The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO, in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.\n\nFirstly, the theme of the movie - Isolation and Redemption - The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone (mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she had)The characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.\n\nSecondly, the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied, beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice, she says to him \"Is life always this hard or just when your a kid?\" Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.\n\nThirdly, The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The close-ups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.\n\nFourth, the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes, I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.\n\nFifth, the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield - The bad cop - what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.\n\nSixth, Luc Besson, director, writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50% of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience - his film depended on her and he was a little worried, no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.\n\nAll I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10, of course."

Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.\n\nThings I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells. Especially if you throw a slight nudge of pedophilia in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Its a film where you just feel pure raw emotion as if you're the character or if you're seeing it first hand in person. A film with such a perfect selection of a cast with such underrated actors such as Jean Reno, Natalie Portman debuting in her first ever film which launched her acting career, Gary Oldman, and so many others. A film with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Its a film that's meant to be experienced through emotion, not through explanation just like Leon whenever you would see his character's facial expressions of what he would feel, like the amount of strong emotion behind it, is incredible, especially towards the end of the movie where you'd expect it to end off in a happy ending but it ends sadly. It can't be described fully in words, just through your own heart & emotion, especially with how perfect the film was, like there's no flaws with it. It's a film filled with strong emotional, action-packed storyline and soundtracks that honestly make you feel sad for Leon and Mathilda as if you're a part of them. Jean Reno truly nailed the performance like hes so underrated, and it really shows the amount of talent Natalie had which started her career in one of the greatest films of all time like all the roles were nailed perfectly. Its just a masterpiece. Not only that but this movie didn't have much of a budget either, and it turned out to be so successful and one of the greatest films of all time, which you can't deny, its something that everyone agrees on, like it or not, it is. Luc Besson the director literally nailed it & also proved how even at the time you didn't need that need such a huge budget to accomplish these things, and what an era it was, and what a big name for European Films if not the greatest European film, in comparison with American films that need such a big budget to accomplish the effects, it really shows the difference between the two as all thats needed is raw emotion. Such a masterpiece, a film like I said filled with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Truly unforgettable, memorable and much more. I honestly wish it got more credit that it was unfortuantely given, it honestly deserved so much credit, especially an award for Jean Leno and his performance. Such a perfect selection, such a perfect story, film, and of course music selection. One of the few films where you experience raw emotion, and feelings."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Leon: the Professional' is a movie that follows a young girl (Nat Portman) who's family (father and brother) is killed in the wake of a drug deal gone wrong, and subsequently, taken in by a neighbouring assassin who teaches her his trade. While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies\", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10"

For the longest time I didn't feel like watching this movie because I felt like I've already seen it too many times. But God Damn! I loved it when I was 9, and since then I've read plenty of books, and experienced too much of what life can offer. All that made this movie beyond incredible for me to describe in the true richness of emotions I felt.\n\nFirst of all, I do think it's better than Nabokov's Lolita. And I am Russian, so trust me, it means a lot for me to say that. Lolita was incredible for the first half, but this movie kept at it the whole time. Have I mentioned it made me ball my eyes out too? Definitely a better love story than Lolita.\n\nThen, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her.\n\nNow, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though.\n\nTo that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "N.B. Spoilers within. Part action/thriller, part character study, \"Leon (The Professional)\" is a sure-fire bet for lovers of both categories. The story is about the meticulous hit-man and determined loner Leon (an amazing Jean Reno) and the precocious 12-year-old Mathilda (the equally amazing Natalie Portman) who crashes his party. They are vastly different from each other, separated not just by wide gaps in age, culture, and experience, but by their basic psychologies.\n\nLeon runs a strictly one-man show by sheer will and by necessity: it allows him to survive and flourish. But as bottled up as he is, he is marked by tragedy and sorrow. These feelings he keeps tightly compartmentalized, which makes him so successful as a killing machine. Enter Mathilda, the product of a wholly dysfunctional home, where she was regularly beaten and abused by her drug-dealing father and loveless family. Despite this, she is by nature a strong, hopeful, and highly intuitive girl. The movie throws these two together and lovingly documents their emotional journey toward each other.\n\nAll of this is skillfully woven with Leon's violent line of work, providing the film with some spectacular action sequences. It gets even better when the savvy Mathilda joins Leon on the job, giving her a sense of purpose while forcing Leon to join the human race, or at least one headstrong member of it. The movie really succeeds when it goes deeply into the emotions driving each character. Mathilda, after all, is just discovering love and sexuality, which she presses on Leon, the object of her newfound desires. As for him, Leon can barely stand this nuisance at first, but gradually becomes the caring father figure she never had. The more she gets under his skin, the harder he looks into himself to do the right thing for her. This whole process becomes incredibly touching. You root for these two oddballs; they flesh out a unique love story.\n\nMeanwhile, Leon and Mathilda are up against one of the stranger villains of the 90s, the malicious D.E.A. agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman: he scores again). Stansfield is also an oddball: he is outrageously high-strung (always being pampered and brought back to reality by his fellow nasties), he pops weird pills, and rambles on about Beethoven to his soon-to-be-dispatched victims. In any case, he is a creepy, ruthless dude.\n\nBesson keeps the tension high for much of the film, letting go only long enough for the occasional scene where Leon and Mathilda have some time alone. (The two actors really shine here.) Otherwise, the film has a running undercurrent of menace and unpredictability. Compassion and cruelty weave continually in and out.\n\nThe film's climax is gripping, and the do-or-die moment when Leon and Mathilda say goodbye is positively heart-wrenching. The two have come a very long way. A good word should be put in, too, for the always dependable Danny Aiello as Tony, Leon's boss and a father figure himself.\n\nThis is a smart, highly enjoyable film \u0096 tight, focused, and personal. It's a rush for the senses and a gratifying story of memorable characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "(This review is based on the extended version)\n\nLet me start off by saying that there are aspects of this film which are very good. The action sequences are thrilling, the cinematography is appealing, and the atmosphere is intriguing. Jean Reno as L\u00e9on is great. Danny Aiello as Tony is great. Natalie Portman is also fantastic, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.\n\nNatalie Portman was 12 years old (give or take a year) when this was filmed. She portrays a 12 year old girl named Mathilda. Throughout the film, she wears skimpy, tight fitting clothes, and repeatedly expresses her \"love\" for L\u00e9on. Although L\u00e9on acts as somewhat of a father figure to her, she makes it clear that she doesn't just see him as a father figure. To put it simply, Mathilda, a very troubled 12 year old girl, wants to bang this middle aged man who is her caretaker. Badly. And this movie isn't subtle about it.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time that a young girl had inappropriate feelings towards an older man. The problem is how this film never really addresses the inappropriateness of it. L\u00e9on rejects her advances rather lamely, and never explicitly does so for the right reason (SHE'S TWELVE).\n\nLet's not forget that the director of this movie dated a girl when she was 15 years old, and got her pregnant at 16.\n\nThere's more that can be said about how gross all of that is, but there's more to complain about so I'll move on.\n\nGary Oldman's character is a cartoon villain. He's silly. His performance is good, but his character is so over-the-top that it's laughable.\n\nThe plot is quite simplistic. That's not horrible in and of itself, but this film is a sandwich of a basic revenge story (that's the bread) and a very inappropriate love story (that's the filler). There's a lot more filler than bread, too."

How else could a virile man happen to start crying watching an action movie? How else could a sophisticated man fall in love with a child? Or a tantalized pacifist's soul feel itself falling into murderous frenzy? With the means of his cinematic language Luc Besson sneaks under our skin, ignoring any mental or emotional barriers. During the movie our eyes our not the window to peek at our soul but the gateway to enter it. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and the Dieffenbachia realize the story so frankly and straightforward that the brilliance of the story completely blends into the authenticity of the impression. I face a work and do not dare speak a word about it. It is. L\u00e9on is the Movie."

She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to L\u00e9on's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. L\u00e9on the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.\n\nDirector Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day."

The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite Ms. Portman later feeling uncomfortable about her role in this film, her portrayal of a violently orphaned 13-year-old is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nAfter her dysfunctional family is killed by a rogue DEA agent and his cadre, young Mathilda seeks refuge with the affable hit-man living just down the hall. As she rings the doorbell, she breaks down and starts crying as it finally hits her that her little brother has just been brutally murdered.\n\nAnd so begins a relationship of revenge, healing and mutual affection between two very lonely people. Besson pulls no punches in revealing Mathilda's emerging sexuality as Mathilda begins to fall in love with her reluctant guardian. But unlike the misadventures of an older man and young temptress from Nabokov, the relationship here isn't seedy, cynical or perverse. It is actually quite poignant as the simple-minded hit-man quietly contains Mathilda's amorous advances without withdrawing from her. He is genuinely fond of her and this is beautifully played out by Jean Ruso as he protects and guides, as best as a hit-man can, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nUltimately, this is a love story between two people who can't have each other yet still protect each other in ways both dramatic and sublime. The love is awkward, clumsy and na\u00efve in a gritty and tender way all at the same time. But it is genuine and heart-felt. Very few directors would be able to pull off this kind of story, so this is a bit of a gem -- I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like this again.\n\nI just love this story and Mathilda is one of my all-time favorite characters. Natalie brings a sublimely powerful performance to the screen that you will remember for a long time.\n\nI'm just sorry that she isn't proud of it. She should be. It's a powerful story. Yes, Mathilda is sexualized, but her character, as portrayed by Portman, is so much more than that. We get that. Honest, we really do."

They breath, you breath. They are happy, you are happy. The most special ingredient of this movie is the mixture of emotions the story creates: For a few minutes, one could think it might be an action adventure, but then, there is the mysterious touch which elevates the viewer into another world without being totally surrealistic.\n\nLittle time elapses when suddenly the mood changes again from homely, to funny, and in a blink of an eye, it becomes really dramatic. If you would hear this story in the news, it would sound absurd - ridiculously even. But watching this movie is making count every second of it, enjoying it with an intensity as it would be an adventure experience first hand with great pleasure.\n\nThank you for this great enjoyment."

Where are the awards for this film? How come this film is unnoticed? With all of the amazing acting and great storyline, I am surprised this movie did not win an Oscar! Everybody was fantastic in this film! Jean Reno gives a heartwarming performance as a sad and lonely hit-man or \"cleaner\" named Leon who lives in a secluded world in a apartment complex and Natalie Portman's character Mathilda is the one that shatters Leon's secluded world.\n\nFor this being her first feature film, Natalie Portman gives an amazing and astonishing performance as a troubled little girl with a desire for revenge. Gary Oldman is also fantastic as a twisted, sadistic, and corrupted DEA agent. He is on my list for Top 10 greatest villains ever! The unique love story and father-daughter type relationship between Leon and Mathilda is handled beautifully by director Luc Besson. You will feel so much sympathy for these characters. This movie is the perfect action with a unique love story and unforgettable characters and emotionally charged scenes! Everybody needs to see this movie!"

Danny Aleio is convincing in his caring for Leon. The action sequences are very realistic and not gratuitous. You get a real feel for the city and all its gritty inhabitants, strange that a Frenchman would make one of the best NYC films. The neighborhoods of Manhattan used are wonderful. Natalie Portman is excellent playing a Lolita type character who causes all kinds of problems for Leon."

I will definitely say that it is easily the most overrated movie in IMDb.\n\nI could guess its climax in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The action in the movie is very well done. The saving grace is definitely the climax,the ending is superb and really redeems the movie, which otherwise could have been dull and insignificant.\n\nThe casting consists of Jean reno and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is a 12 year old precocious child who has an immature love for Jean Reno who happens to be a Hit-man. After her entire family gets knocked out by Gary Oldman, he takes her into his wings and teaches her the secrets behind becoming a hit-man or say a hit-girl rather. Amongst the performances only Portman 's worth watching.. Gary Oldman is disappointing so is Jean Reno.\n\nThe movie fails mainly because of its poor character development. The characters are very superficial especially Gary Oldman's character. You are left wondering why they are doing what they are doing.\n\nOverall as i said IT IS HUGELY OVERRATED.....I would give it\n\n7.2\\10.."

Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of \"The Professional\" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."

Leon (The Professional) is quite possibly the finest work by director Luc Besson.There's conviction in this movie, and intelligence. Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus. Even after twenty years, \"Leon: The Professional\" stands as the superlative masterpiece of action filmmaking and has yet to be matched or toppled by any director in the business."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon is an adjustment of what a true modern drama genre is. Luc Besson made a real combustion here. He made a genuinely semi drama-action film which for me definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made. Despite lack of rating from movie professionals, I stated that this movie is one of the most impacts to me. The storytelling installment that this movie had was incredibly powerful, precise, and so freaking deep. It consist of a very strong bond of a little girl to a professional assassin which maybe it's too simple as shape but will plunging the audiences into his childish cry at the time, especially at the ending.\n\nIn the shape of it's plot, I think Leon is one kind of movie that have a similar plot structure as Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\", but had a different style in movie making technique and how the way the story of the plot untold. Most people said the strong point of the genre was It's action. Not for me, It was the drama which intensify the whole movie. Firstly, the director wanted to slowly generated a strong bond of It's two leads. Then in the end, BAMM.. Everythings disappeared, everything destroyed, just in short period of time. It possessing a deep desperation feeling into the audience. Audience want the happy ending because of the caring and daring reason (which accumulated expeditiously because of the two lead's strong performance, especially Portman), but the real fact that Besson was brave enough to change the way of the old happy ending style implementation. Suspense skill from Besson was perfect, giving the audience to wish the ending they want, but unfortunately It's different, It's freaking sad and painful. I tear to pieces. That's what I feel when watched Leon, I had very similar feeling from City Lights (which ending's strong point was It's uncertainty of approval), two of them (the ending) had very strong impact to audience (all age range from my experience asking other older and younger people).\n\nDespite of harsh critic of It's Pedofil issue, I definitely still appreciate Leon so much. This was one of movies that truly inspire me. Leon is the true and the most bitter-sweet movie ever made."

This was the first movie with Jan Reno starring I watched. He became one of my favorite actors with his \"simplicity\" of acting and being the good bad guy. Gary Oldman was brilliant with his mad behavior and strong powerful playing. The little Natalie was the \"icing on the cake\" and she was as good as it was Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.

He I feel sees her as the family he has never had. She obviously has a crush and sees him in romantic way, which he doesn't encourage and struggles to cope with!!! its these unexpected twists in the story and clever sub plot that makes the film stand out from the crowd. its a modern classic and needs 10 stars.

I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I\u2019ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.\n\nThe movie carefully drew the picture of the characters in the opening 25 min. In the art of killing, L\u00e9on is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, L\u00e9on.\n\nThen the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it\u2019s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like. There was this fascination and perfect chemistry between the two characters. It looked so freaking real and deep that you are taken away in the skin of the characters.\n\nThe cast & acting was perfect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerdict: 10/10.\n\nPerfect. Memorable. Repeated viewings recommended & watch the uncut edition to enjoy the true potential of the movie. It still holds as my favorite movie after 14 years of existence. Never gets old. Glad to see it is gaining its due respect with time and still climbing the ladder in IMDb Top 250 ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, released in 1994, still rates right up there with the top films of the action genre, and it seems like it hasn't aged a bit. I happened to catch this one the other night on a pay channel, and it was right after Matilda's family gets killed. I was immediately glued to it, even though I have seen it a few times before. It is a riveting and suspenseful film, and it scores in all departments. The style and pacing are second to none. Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve. They need to, because it's films like this one that make movie watching the truly rewarding experience that it should be. This is for Matilda!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching this movie when i was young. It was one of those movies that I could watch everyday after school. The action was thrilling and I always wanted to be like Leon, a stone cold bad ass with a heart.\n\nAbout 20 years after I first saw The Professional I watched it again and it was awesome. It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term \"silent killer\". Gary Oldman gives a masterclass performance as the main antagonist and Natalie Portman gives a performance that makes one question is she was truly a teenager or if she was older. The plot is intriguing and the pacing keeps you engaged, the stunts are believable and the action sequences will put modern movies to shame. The music is incredible and the characters have depth and humanized.\n\nWithout giving out any spoilers this is a film that works in every perceivable way. An A+ for me"

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson's Leon is blessed with so many qualities that it not only excels in its crime-thriller genre but also in the general art of cinematography.\n\nThe french director stays simple in his brilliance, to deliver an intense but deeply human thriller. Filming is subtle and intelligent, with discreet special effects that give the movie a feel a realism. The composition is tight : the 110 minutes leave time to deliver a good plot, generous action and excellent character development.\n\nThis is achieved by the excellent actors portraying the three main characters. Gary Oldman expertly becomes the butchery obsessed, corrupt DEA agent. Natalie Portman is a revelation playing 12 year-old Mathilda. She shows the complexity of a strong charactered abandoned girl in a seemingly effortless performance. Jean Reno is extraordinary as Leon, the killer who lives a life of paradox, between the violence of his employment and his apparent naivety. The unlikely formation of a link between the two latter characters is the heart of the movie, where the young girl gives Leon a taste of life.\n\nLeon is an exceptional film : combining suspense and drama, subtleness and brilliance, Luc Besson signs a masterful jewel of cinematography."

The end is very emotional and very satisfying. (8/10)\n\nActing: This is were the movie has its biggest strengh. Natalie Portmans breakthrough, the performance that causes George Lucas to cast her for the biggest stage you can get. And that with 12 (!) years. You cannot believe it but it is true. She's without a doubt the star of this movie! The other cast members are doing their best and I mean it, they are very good, but they cannot reach the masterclass acting of Natalie Portman as Mathilda. (10/10)\n\nVerdict: There is nothing more to say, this movie is a must watch. I've been waiting for a long time to watch it on a streaming service It's on Prime Video right now so go and watch it!\n\n(8/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched Leon The Professional and I'm a little perplexed as to why this film has such high ratings. While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.\n\nIt's one thing to ask the audience to suspend disbelief but this film takes that to a whole other level. It goes so far out of the realm of possibility in places that it becomes more of a fantasy/sci fi film than a crime action film. Also what was up with the music? It was always totally inappropriate for the scenes. It was just completely off and awkward. I really wanted to like this film. I have generally been a fan of Luc Besson's other films and I'm a fan of the cast. Unfortunately this movie was a real challenge to sit through. Now there were some redeeming moments. I liked the little moments that established Leon's character. How he drinks milk, cares for his plant, and sits in the dark. I liked some of the little moments between Leon and Mathilda. There were a few good action beats. However none of these positives are enough to give the film the kind of rating that it has here on IMDb. The film is average at the very best. It offers no intelligence or soul to it's story. The concept could have worked if it was done correctly but sadly it wasn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie simply put is a cinematic masterpiece. Rarely does a movie get me to... practically sob unstoppably almost from beginning to end, but this one did. Every detail is licked, the music not only flows along with every moment, but adds a good deal of content all on its own.\n\nLuc Besson, unlike most directors nowadays it seems, has an excellent take on child phychology, right up there with Stephen King himself. A child is shown here not as a fragile creature in need of constant looking over by adults, but more like a member of a society like any other red-blooded American. The fact that kids are susceptible to practically all the dangers that adults are today is portrayed in the movie very well.\n\nThe movie does not have scenes that attract attention by asking the actors show weakness, to cry, to express feelings with words, but everything is done in situations, music, and cinematic tricks of different kinds.\n\nThis is not a movie to make one feel gooey and tender on the inside, but rather to provoke a spurt of emotion that hides inside every one of us. Not the kind that's felt by watching a romance flick. This is something different. Modern movie makers have quite a few things to learn from Besson. Movies like this one can change our skewed outlook on life and... make us born again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson, director of La Femme Nikita, introduces us to the kind- hearted assassin Leon, in this tense thriller. After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, \"I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,\" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good."

After seeing, actually during, this film I knew little Natalie was on her way. Such a natural presence and delivery is a rare thing. It's as if she had been living this part for her whole 11 yrs. And Reno gave us his best role ever. The King of Badguys has played many great characters, but Oldman is on fire here. The guy could be the best villain to ever hit the screen. I think back to some of his bad guys he's played, and those movies wouldn't be the same if he wasn't a part of them. The soundtrack is also tremendous, and the closing song by Sting really defined the whole film. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and would have done nothing different. Luc needs to get part II started fast! The story lines are endless. Just noticed that Natalie Portman has two 8.6 IMDb scores with Leon and Black Swan. Not too shabby in this day and age"

The film, in its gritty, dark, back room kind of feel moves those who watch it. Its almost like seeing a baby born, as you will see both main characters (Mathilda and Leon) be almost reborn into the world with something that they've never experienced before: binding love.\n\nThis sounds sappy, and frankly if I had read this I would think that it was a pitiful clich\u00e9. It's not. Take it for what it is--a beautiful, moving film. You cannot grasp its depth until you experience it in full."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson's \"Leon\" AKA \"The Professional\" ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his \"La Femme Nikita\". The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this)\n\nLeon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as \"Mathilda\" the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.\n\nMathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot.\n\nThe story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin).\n\nDirecting A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound/Music A+\n\nVery highly recommended."

        "review_title": "Still one of the more quotable, entertaining, touching and flat out enjoyable films I've ever seen.",
        "review_detailed_main": "L\u00e9on is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why L\u00e9on is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering \u0096 IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope \u0096 at its core, L\u00e9on could be seen as exactly this.\n\nThe film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clich\u00e9s and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.\n\nThe ingredients work in L\u00e9on. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage L\u00e9on (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Bj\u00f6rk song \u0096 it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.\n\nBut this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on L\u00e9on's door \u0096 the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.\n\nThe film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with L\u00e9on himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a caf\u00e9 run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of L\u00e9on are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money.\n\nBut the following scenes of L\u00e9on happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to L\u00e9on's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is \"always like this\", this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for L\u00e9on \u0096 she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that L\u00e9on was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.\n\nThe villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that \"we were doing our job\" hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds \u0096 they are not to be messed with. L\u00e9on is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same \u0096 Besson has made few English language films but there will always be L\u00e9on."

Is the uncut version only on DVD or is there a US version that someone is keeping secret from me? If so, where can I get a copy? Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film. With regards to other comments on the the 'sexual' nature of Leon and Mathilda's relationship, I'd like to think it was innocent, pure love and a lack of a decent father figure in her life, but I may change my mind when I see the uncut version!"

        "review_detailed_main": "So why now, after first seeing this movie on its original theatrical run 27 years ago at London's Odeon, Kensington High Street do I suddenly feel the need to write a review of a movie I've since watched countless times? I guess it was receiving the 4K blu-ray of the movies as a birthday present and sitting down to watch it again that was the catalyst but in all fairness, I should have done it a long time ago..\n\nI'm going to assume at this point that nobody reading this hasn't seen this movie. If, by some quirk of fate, you haven't...well, stop reading now and go and watch it, that would be a far more productive use of your time. Given that everybody else reading has seen it, I just want to make a couple of observations on this remarkable piece of work.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious thing about this movie is absolutely NO WAY would it get made today. Hollywood's woke mafia would pretty quickly see to that. The pitch meeting for a proposed movie in which an orphaned and therefore vulnerable twelve year old girl and a middle aged Italian immigrant hit man enter into a dubious relationship would be a wonder to behold - I'd pay to see that! The movie itself is in no way problematic in this respect, with Leon himself being more of a 'child' than Mathilda is. Still, the issue is an obvious sticking point...\n\nI can remember leaving the theater 27 years ago with my friend Tim and, for most of the drive home, he remained quite - most unlike him. After a while, he sheepishly said '...I found that girl attractive. Is that a problem?' to which I laughed and said reassuringly 'you were meant to, that's the whole idea!'\n\nAll these years later, Leon remains Luc Besson's finest work by quite some way. I enjoyed 'The Fifth Element', 2014's Scarlett Johansson-fronted Sci-fi romp Lucy and even the B-movie mediocracy of Anna. Nothing the man has done before or since matches the artistry of Leon. Story, casting and execution came together perfectly on this movie, the stars were aligned. I don't give marks of 10, that's perfection. Perfection doesn't exist and so I'll go with a 9..."

Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action, with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately, in the third act, Besson allows the violence to take over, leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market. Still, a sleek and handsome piece of work, entertaining, mature and straightforward, with terrific performances by Reno and the shockingly unself-conscious Portman. *** from ****"

        "review_title": "A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Leon: The Professional\" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. \"The Professional\" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is\u0085 old\u0085 like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff\u0085 expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all.\n\nThe best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as \"Leon\" are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, \"The Godfather.\" Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. \"The Last Don\" didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it.\n\nThis takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated."

I feel like even though Gary Oldman's character is a bit over the top, he still makes him as believable as possible. But, the stand out is obviously Jean Reno. Amazing as ever. Just a perfect roll for him. I must have seen this film at least 20 times, and every time I catch some little nuance that I missed in the past or just see something differently than I had before. It is just a great, if not underrated movie, and not only worth a viewing, but many. You surely will not be disappointed, and if you somehow are, give it another chance to grow on you.

        "review_detailed_main": "It has been a while - and I don't think I had seen the Direcotrs Cut of the movie up til earlier. There is something interesting - well more than something, but let's start from the top/beginning, no pun intended.\n\nThe movie starts off quite out there. It is almost comical - not just how Leon looks (the long coat and generally the way he dresses and walks - influences from the silent era? Quite possibly), but how he but even more so, the bad guys act. There is an air of amateurish and not proffesional vibe in the air.\n\nLeon of course seems to be in control of everything. So much so, that it seems his hand is detached of his body - especially when he has a knife at someones throat. A great dissapearing act commences.\n\nLeon has some very fine action scenes and has some very fine actors too. Take the three main ones - Jean Reno obviously in the main role, but also Natalie Portman as a kid and even more so Gary Oldman as the main villain. More about Natalie and her role in a second, but Gary Oldman is the ingredient that really elevates the movie above others. His performance made this movie work on many different levels.\n\nAnd maybe make you forget about certain things that seem weird in hindsight. There is the strange humor and the incapable almost cartoonish goons (though apparently they seem to be able to work the other side of the law - without consequences). No pun intended.\n\nThe movie also has a weird relationship that builds between Natalies and Jeans character. You may have issues how she connects with him and how she is portrayed. But if you remeber being a kid, a teen, you may remember saying inappropriate things as well. She doesn't know any better - that is the best way to look at it. Otherwise you are making a case agains the movie and what it portrays.\n\nA few years later a still not adult Natalie Portman was still making men go crazy. Beautiful girls - you can see Natalie Portman and you can recognize her. Her performance is magnificent. We came to expect that from her. And I don't think making this movie scarred her in any way shape or form.\n\nThere is the music the movie has and the New York vibes (mostly second unit shots I reckon). Then there is also the late great Danny Aiello. A terrific actor, who is shady, but also loveable.\n\nAnd back to Reno: his grumpy performance really works best. He seems to channel some heroes from the past. Strange he is not able to recognize Charlie Chaplin in a game of guess who. Even stranger still that the young Mathilde (Natalie Portman) does know Marylin Monroe and Chaplin ... especially because she only seems to be watching cartoons.\n\nAs good as Leon is, there are certain things that do not make much sense. Like entering a bulding he has no business being in .. and without much resistence either ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Because this looks and sounds good ... and is the movie that made Reno and Portman the stars they are ... or at least send the on the trajectory they are (still) on.\n\nEdit: Matthilde is cursing a lot - okay? Hopefully you answer with okay, even if that would make Leon angry (if you know, you know)"

He also does his own ironing, drinks milk, and has an obsessive love for a pot plant.\n\nHis path crosses with a 12 year old girl, Mathilda, and when she becomes orphaned Matilda decides to adopt Leon as her guardian, hero and assassin trainer.\n\nIt's a mad plot which shouldn't work, but somehow it does. Largely this is thanks to the terrific performance of Jean Reno, who is utterly convincing as hitman Leon; he's tough, soft hearted, dangerous, vulnerable, ruthless and likeable all in one. Perfect casting.\n\nA young Natalie Portman gives a fine performance too as the clingy but head strong Mathilda.\n\nThrow into the mix a deliciously OTT performance from Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the deranged and corrupt drug enforcement agent who ultimately comes into violent conflict with Leon & Mathilda, and you have the perfect villain too.\n\nThis is a violent film, and at times overly macho, that doesn't quite land its tender moments as easily as it does its excellent action scenes. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is entirely fine when based on sentiment or pseudo parental love, but does occasionally flirt with something more troublingly sexual. The 'dress up' scenes where Mathilda takes on adult characters - although hopefully intended to be playful - are cringingly wrong, and the film would be much finer for ridding itself of any hint of sexualising a 12 year old girl.\n\nPut those uneasy troubles aside (if you can), and its thoroughly enjoyable."

Leon and Mathilda however very peculiar and odd but one of the very lovable and sensitive lead pair ever created.\n\nthe character of Mathilda was of emotionally damaged 13 year old girl who behave like a grown up mature girl,do smoking,filled with revenge and love and above all she is innocent and cute.her feelings can be easily understand by looking into her dysfunctional family.She was neglected by her father,elder sister and mother and due to her protective feelings towards her younger brother,she grown herself mentally or we can say she lost her childhood to become habitual with her harshful life.the dialogs of Mathilda was very mature but you also get sympathized with her and also laugh on her innocence and her naive feelings.Her feelings towards Leon can be easily understood as he saved her and she wanted her revenge through Leon.the character of Mathilda played by very talented Natalie portman she give best performance of her career in her debut.\n\nthe protagonist Leon is also very complex and hard to understand because instead of being a professional killer, he is very good hearted and sensitive.jean reno played the character of Leon and he did very astonishing job because it was very difficult for audience to grew sympathy for a man whose profession is killing people and jean reno successfully accomplished this.Leon is one of all time favorite character for me and one of my favorite line from a movie \"no women no kids\".the feelings and love of Leon towards Mathilda was totally platonic and nothing was immoral and absurd in it.\n\nanother character of the movie who was highly influencing and impactful was of Stanfield who is the antagonist of movie and was portrayed by Gary old man.you will always feel fear and shivering when he come on screen,a total psychopath,i wondered how did he passed the medical test for being a police officer.you will hate him as much as you never hated anyone before.\n\nalso the characters of tony,malky,Mathilda's family and even every small roles in movie were very beautifully and perfectly portrayed.\n\nluc besson directed the movie very well,every thing was perfect with movie.the intensity and tension created during many scenes was unbearable and thrilled us from inside.scenes when Standford murdered the family,the sniper scene at roof,or the shootout scenes at beginning and ending of movie,the scene when Mathilda tried to shoot herself were very thrilling and almost stop my breathing. music of the movie composed by Eric Serra was very pleasant and played very important role for making movie more involving and touching for us.\n\ni really get disappointed when i saw that Leon was not even nominated for any award.i believe that movie should have been nominated for academy for best movie,best director (luc besson)best leading actor(jean reno),actress(Natalie portman) and also for supporting actor(Gary old man) ,soundtrack(eric Serra).it was very unfortunate that movie remained unnoticed due to low publicity among movies like pulp fiction,Forrest gump and the shawshank redemption which was released during the same year of 1994.this movie has every potential to stand along with these movies."

        "review_title": "\"A Dark Dance of Innocence and Brutality\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the shadowy corners of cinema, few films resonate with the raw intensity and emotional depth of \"Leon: The Professional.\" Directed by Luc Besson, this cult classic is not just a film; it's a beautifully crafted dichotomy of tenderness and violence that leaves an indelible mark on its viewers.\n\nAt the heart of the movie is Leon, played to perfection by Jean Reno. He's a hitman with a heart, navigating a life mired in the grim underbelly of New York City. His world is a symphony of sleek, efficient brutality-one where each job is meticulously executed with precision. But when he inadvertently becomes the guardian of Matilda, a young girl played by the fierce and captivating Natalie Portman in her break-out role, his life takes a haunting turn. The bond they develop amidst chaos is both unconventional and heartbreaking, transforming L\u00e9on from a solitary assassin into a reluctant father figure, highlighting the fragility of innocence in a world filled with darkness.\n\nPortman's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. As Matilda, she embodies a mix of vulnerability and fierce determination, showcasing a complexity rarely seen in child actors. Their relationship is both beautiful and problematic, layered with emotional turmoil that challenges societal norms and perceptions of morality. It walks the tightrope between love and an unsettling darkness, making viewers grapple with their feelings toward the characters.\n\nBesson's direction is an artful spectacle-the cinematography creates a palpable tension, each frame dripping with atmosphere. The film is punctuated by moments of explosive action balanced with quieter, poignant scenes that linger long after each sequence. The soundscape complements the visuals, with a haunting score that captures the essence of the characters' tumultuous journey.\n\n\"Leon: The Professional\" also serves as a commentary on the nature of violence and redemption. It poses difficult questions about love and loyalty in an unforgiving world, challenging viewers to consider the lines between villain and hero. The morally ambiguous world of L\u00e9on is a tapestry of stark contrasts, where love can flourish in the most unexpected places, and life can be fleeting and brutal.\n\n\"Leon: The Professional\" is a tour de force that transcends genres. It's a film that juxtaposes the innocence of childhood against the cold realities of adulthood, inviting viewers to explore the depths of human emotion in the process. With unforgettable performances, masterful direction, and a haunting narrative, this film remains a badass testament to the power of cinema, proving that sometimes, the most beautiful stories are born from chaos. This is a film that lingers in the mind and heart, a sophisticated dance between life, death, and everything that exists between them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon: The Professional is an absolute magnum opus of cinema, and gave me chills watching It. Its story is complex and riveting, and its theme echo's the realism of living a lonely, unhappy life.\n\nThis story of a man's journey to be able to find an emotional connection, and new meaning in his life thanks to Mathilda is heartwarming and satisfying.\n\nI have seen nowadays that controversy seems to surround every classic released in the past in one way or another, it festers on destroying what was real, and had a soul, and in this film that involves the connection between Leon and Mathilda.\n\nIn all honestly, people need to open their minds to reality. And see how deep and meaningful people can be. This is what happens in life, and these are the feelings of young people who are affected by traumatic incidents in their past towards mature adults which leaves them a little confused and vulnerable.\n\nIt's a shame that topics like this get sensationalised, but luckily it takes absolutely nothing away from the performances within the film.\n\nGoing off Luc Besson's personal life, the relationships could easily be considered a truer story in a lot of ways that could potentially delve deep into a person's past.\n\nThe language, the scenery, and the dialogue all just seem so natural. It's so relaxing to be visually satisfied to see the personal growth, and development of Mathilda, the good intentions, and the human side of L\u00e9on.\n\nThe devotion you form with the characters is emotionally moving, and the performances show such naturalism in their roles, that it feels like these are ordinary people, having to deal with extraordinary circumstances. It grabs your attention and gives you a sentimental attachment to the story.\n\nThe acting was phenomenal. Gary Oldman (Norman Stansfield) has played a villain that will be remembered for the ages. He was so charismatic, calm, cool, collected, and vile that you detested, and feared him. When he is on screen he captures your attention and draws you in so intently that every scene feels like something sinister is just about to happen.\n\nThis was Natalie Portman's platform to the big time. I have seen her in countless films and always regarded her highly as an actress. But this was something different. To play such a controversial, emotional, and demanding part would be tough for even the best performers and she handled herself extraordinarily.\n\nWhen I rate a film a 10. It means that it emotionally touching, and leaves my mind swimming with many thoughts, theories, ideas and new sensations. And finally, it leaves me feeling the utmost satisfaction or pure joy of being able to see something truly remarkable, and astonishing. I sometimes even dwell on the plot for days or even weeks after the film has ended.\n\nNo spoilers in this review. If you had a choice to watch just one film on your bucket list then Leon: The Professional would be one of my first choices.\n\n10/10."

It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of \"The Professional\" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson's film \"Leon\" is really strong. This is an amazing creative work of a genius director whose style cannot be confused with anything. Besson loudly declares himself to the world with this work, makes the audience be chained to the screens. And it catches everything: the plot, the acting, the music, the atmosphere.\n\nActor Jean Renaud is very famous. His tired look is always recognizable. And here his hero, despite the sadness on his face, goes to his goal, he is dangerous and, it seems, invulnerable. But confidence, composure, lack of pity suddenly crumble into dust when he meets a little girl and gets into her feelings. And the actor perfectly shows how his character is changing.\n\nThis film opened for me one of my favorite actresses - Natalie Portman. Today she is known all over the world. And not without reason. The actress is very talented. And this picture is a great start, which helped her already at such a young age to show an excellent game. Natalie plays little Matilda, a little naive, not knowing the world around her yet, but insightful and, as we see, able to melt the ice even of a ruthless killer. And now these two lonely people find a kind of shelter in each other's company.\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderful, the unique style is sustained. Although all the pernicious boils of society in the form of drugs, murders, crimes are present around the characters, Besson competently weaves all this into the picture, not making a bright emphasis on this, but telling a completely different dramatic story.\n\n\"Leon\" is a great film by a competent director who helped at least two actors show their skills in an extraordinary story, probably even a love story. Everyone will see their own. One thing cannot be taken away - the picture does not lose its relevance today and looks timeless.\n\n7 out of 10."

An expertly crafted story that shows the connection between a young and frightened girl and her hitman neighbour. The beauty of the plot is how as Mathilda teaches Leon to be more caring and kind, she learns from him how to be ruthless and cold. Both actors play the characters brilliantly well, but the highlight is definitely Gary Oldman as the arrogant and psychotic main villain, which is one of the greatest actor performances of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon the Professional (1994)\n\nA tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's \"the best\" without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension.\n\nSo whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.\n\nDirector and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen \"La Femme Nikita\" or \"Fifth Element\" knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called \"cinema du look\" style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the \"Taken\" movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.\n\nIf some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list."

One can understand the real love from relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Why I love Jean Reno is this film, and also I admire acting of Natalie Portman even she is at a young age in the film.

        "review_title": "Weak dialogue sometimes, an awesome film otherwise",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was about the same age as the 12-year-old Mathilda, played by Nathalie Portman, when I first watched this film, and boy, did I drool over this girl, with her choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. What is Director Luc Besson's excuse though? The creators knew what they were doing when creating the sexual tension between Mathilda and our main man Leon, played by Jean Reno, especially given the events in the extended cut of the movie, where the relationship between Mathilda and Leon is further expanded upon. That's ok, Mr. Besson, I won't tell.\n\nInterestingly, even in the extended cut, the relationship between Mathilda and Leon works surprisingly well, without crossing into the offensive territory, because Leon is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life and their relationship is touching and innocent. Nonetheless, this movie would never be made today, given the cultural censorship.\n\nThose familiar with Luc Besson's other works know that this guy is obsessed with showing distressed but strong female characters with guns that get thrown into a harsh male-dominated world. This creates an interesting contrast between tender elegance and masculine brutality. Leon is, perhaps, the best version of this concept. In Besson's \"La Femme Nikita\" it was an adult woman and in his other film, \"Lucy\", the female character is too overpowered, so the vulnerability is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters.\n\nSpeaking of which, Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain might be his best performance. He puts all of himself behind it, ranging from quietly menacing to almost blowing up his vocal chords. Between the 3 main characters, this film delivers captivating performances that keep you anchored in your seat from beginning to end.\n\nPerhaps the single largest problem in the film is the shallow childish mood produced by the writing. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic and cheesy dialogue, which points out the obvious and does not give the viewer anything deep to think about. The dialogue sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy. Matilda talks like no kid of her age would. Take even the title of the film: in the US, the movie is called \"Leon: the Professional\". A title like that evokes an immature comic book about assassins and ninja's.\n\nThe movie looks phenomenal though. It has a peculiar grungy look, which I love. The movie Is supposed to be set in New York, but has a European vibe. Shot in a warm sepia tone, people's sweating faces and cramped apartments with run-down dirty walls combine with Jean Reno's French accent to give this film a foreign look. This makes complete sense when you find out that the interior filming was done in France. It's like New York and Paris were smushed together in this alternate universe.\n\nThe soundtrack mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric drones. Those violins give weight to the dirty reality in which the characters find themselves and you can feel the heat of the city through the music.\n\nThe Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny. The short version is cleaner but far less emotionally loaded, cutting out one especially important heart-to-heart scene.\n\nLeon is a little silly, childish and exploitative, but it is one of the best thrillers with excellent performances and is Luc Besson's best work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hilarious, I have more laughs watching this movie with my friends than anything, think about it: The overly done stupid Milk thing, the whole first scene with things like: Leon randomly being in a vent to kill some guy when he was just on the stairs less than a minute before, when the balcony window closes hes somehow shooting towards it when he clearly isnt on the balcony which means he must be floating in the air in front of the building, him magically appearing and disappearing in a dark hallway in the beginning as well as his arm stretching when he backs up from the fat guy, the guys they try to pass off as D.E.A. (like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious \"AHHHHHHHHHHHH\" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real \"cleaner\" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out"

This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes.

That's original.\n\nOr how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r.\n\nAnd then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives?\n\nThis film is completely ridiculous. What is even more unbelieveable is that so many of you liked it.\n\n2/10"

I loved this very strong and deep movie and it is at the top of my movie list. I hope that every person who can feel as little as I can, by watching this movie, can taste a little taste of the deep feeling that I felt and it doesn't even have a name. But I will say this, this deep sensation isn't supposed to be pleasant, it's just supposed to remind you that you're alive and breathing. And this deep painful feeling, in addition to being close to the door, shows you the deep meaning of human contact with life. Unpleasant like life, but necessary."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's surprising that \"Leon\" is so highly ranked (as of Feb. 2006), as it is so weak in so many respects. There are basically two things that it is trying to give us: (1) great one-elite-versus-many-soldiers-shoot-em-up sequences; and, what would make this movie special, if it worked, (2) a view into a very unusual and interesting relationship, with tinges of father/daughter, of master/apprentice, criminal/partner, and of lover/lover.\n\nIt delivers decent shoot-em-up, but fairly little that stands out much from the vast quantities of decent material of that kind in 90s (and 00s) Hollywood film. If you *love* that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.\n\nOn the other hand, the relationship idea suffers from weak execution. Some of the specific plot and script ideas are to blame, but N. Portman is basically unbelievable, for the most part, and in a boring way. J. Reno is excellent, and there is some \"chemistry\" there, but there were just too many times when the cinematic illusion was broken and I just wanted to roll my eyes---the fascinating premise disappeared and I found myself thinking things like \"man, what a dumb line\". (Nothing as bad as the intimate scenes of Portman/Christensen in the Star Wars movies, which feel like a caricatured rendering of the interior imaginations of an inexperienced fifteen-year-old reading a mediocre discount store romance novel. But that's not saying much.)\n\nSo, I suggest that \"Leon\" does not deserve to be in the company of nearby-ranked action-oriented films (\"Das Boot\", \"Se7en\", \"Alien\", \"Fight Club\") or noir (\"Maltese Falcon\", \"Chinatown\", \"LA Confidential\").\n\nI should add that I believe I saw the \"U. S.\" version; there appears to be a longer version."

He tells Portman she shouldn't use foul language but teaches her how to kill people. What a guy! Oldman, who would play Beethoven in his next film, is horribly over-the-top as a Beethoven-loving psycho DEA agent. On the plus side, the score is nice and the celebrity impersonations by Portman and Reno are amusing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson became the 'it' director ever since he dust French cinema with his 1985 \"Subway\", embracing the 80's as if it was a new millennium, a time where French movies could look American without it being an overused gimmick. And on that level, \"La Femme Nikita\" was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit \"Nikita\", would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.\n\nJean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!\n\nSomehow I like the English title even more than plain \"Leon\" (though \"Le Professional\" was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..\n\nAnd on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.\n\nAnd before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a \"mission-giver\" played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And \"The Professional\" becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and \"Leon the Professional\" shines with its contrasts.\n\nMathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!\n\nThere's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in \"Interview of the Vampire\", both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a \"guess\" game with him. When Mathilda plays \"Like a Virgin\", it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.\n\nIt's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. \"Do you love life?\" he asks. She nods, \"Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care\". Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.\n\nIt is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot."

        "review_detailed_main": "Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, L\u00e9on has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named L\u00e9on in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean \"EVERYONEEEE!\". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a L\u00e9on in their life."

His silent strength contrasts beautifully with the vulnerability of Mathilda, played masterfully by a young Natalie Portman. The chemistry between the two characters is what drives the film, making their bond both heart-wrenching and uplifting.\n\nGary Oldman as the psychotic antagonist is unforgettable, delivering one of the most chilling performances in film history. His unpredictable, manic energy creates tension in every scene he's in, elevating the stakes to an entirely new level.\n\nWhat I love most about L\u00e9on is its ability to mix genres effortlessly-there are moments of high-octane action, but also scenes of quiet tenderness and moral complexity. The cinematography, direction by Luc Besson, and hauntingly beautiful score by \u00c9ric Serra all come together to create a film that is both visually and emotionally striking."

        "review_detailed_main": "What absolutely amazing performances by Natalie Portman, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. And what a brutally honest but realistic portrayal of the life of a young girl from such a despicable family and circumstances. When Portman's character asks Reno's if life is always this bad and you expect him to give her a banal platitude but he says, true to his character, \"Yes, always like this.\" it sets the intense but powerful tone of this film. This all of course is complimented by Oldman's mesmoring insantity with lines such as when his fellow police officers ask him who they should call for backup and he screams \"EVERYONE!\" This is truly a film that stays with you for a lifetime."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies that isn't as good as you remember it being 15+ years ago. Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years. Therefore, I'd say that this flick is still worth the time to watch it if it's on, but it's no longer a must-see, now that we have True Grit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Determinedly, odd, over the top and a lot of fun., This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his \"Dr. Strangelove\" mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure.\n\nSound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon.\n\nGary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique."

The acting, directing and dramatics of the picture are almost there, but not quite. Everything that could be good about this film is limited by faulty writing.\n\nActing: Aiello is great in a minor part, but bad writing kills all the efforts of Reno and Oldman and the twelve year old. Leon's character is very one dimensional, leaving Reno no room to stretch as an actor, unless you count his bad John Wayne bit or his plant stroking. Oldman plays a comic book character, so he can't help being over the top. As for the kid, she leaves an impression but her part is simply not believable.\n\nDirecting: Besson was writer and director, so any positive points one might give him for directing are canceled out by the completely implausible story and unmemorable dialog.\n\nDramatics: There were some very good action scenes, but the \"tender\" Lolita scenes I could do without.\n\nI give the movie a 7 overall."

She was sexualized at such a young age, and she's spoken publicly about how traumatic it was for her. This film should be removed from Amazon Prime, and quite frankly, all of Luc Besson's works should be removed from all streaming platforms. Thank God we've evolved since this abuse was acceptable."

Chilling.\n\nI am lost for words with this movie. Has one of the greatest endings I have seen in the past 10 years of film critiquing, and not once was I found yearning for more plot or suspense.\n\nYour senses are taken everywhere with this picture. Shock, Horror, Empathy, Understanding and Regret. I for one could not see myself becoming intrigued with a cold blooded ruthless killer, but I was. You are drawn into Leon's world and you find yourself trying to understand how his existence in New York has come about.\n\nCoupled with an incredible soundtrack, moody and perfectly pitched for this film, you are staring at perhaps one of the best 10 films in the past 15 years.\n\nClass Act. Bessons best."

He loves her like a Father would love his Daughter. This is one of the few well made emotional aspect movies that I can actually enjoy. It had everything a movie should have, slight humor, emotion, drama and action and most importantly, love. If you can't respect a well made film like this, then perhaps you shouldn't be on IMDb, trying to offer your two-cents on a movie you know nothing of."

Perhaps Reno will once again garner better roles than a French DOI officer battling a giant lizard in New York. But it doesn't matter if they don't.\n\nBy pairing for this masterful movie the two have produced a film which will definitely live on throughout history long after all of the riff-raff-flicks are lost and forgotten. This film is definitely deserving of a place in the top 50 films of all time.\n\nOutstanding performances burn up this stellar flick. If you don't know the show's storyline, here's the short-short version. An immigrant hit-man (Reno) becomes responsible for, and eventually falls in love with a young girl, Mathilda (played marvelously by Natalie Portman) whose family was murdered by a dirty DEA agent (the always superb Gary Oldman) and his team. Our heroic hit-man must protect the girl and avenge her family's death.\n\nMore than just a compelling action drama, the film focuses its attention on the truth of humanity that people are social creatures and need companionship. While at first Leon is cold and commanding towards his young charge, he eventually warms to her more than he wants to admit to himself. When Mathilda's desire for vengeance places her in harms way, Leon's true feelings burst forth in a hail of bullets and bloodshed that would make the Terminator think twice about messing with this man.\n\nThe story is solid. The dialogue is honest and pointed. The action is spectacular. And overall, the direction is undoubtedly Besson's best. This film ranks exceptionally high on my All-Time Must-See list."

There are characters you actually care about, there is a beautiful and touching love story, there's a simple but clever plot, there are moments of superb cinematography and there is plenty of action. Want any more...? There's a great ending too!\n\nLuc Besson is brilliant but he's not faultless. He has only done one other film that I rated VERY highly (9/10) and that's Angel-A. Both films share the theme of having a very unconventional love story at their heart and both are stunning to behold.\n\nPerfect 10/10"

This is not the case, and, it is a sad reflection on American culture that this is what viewers would see. In a similar vein, Disney refuses to release \"Only Yesterday\" as it contains a few references to the dreaded M word. Hello, aren't we over being Victorians?"

I won't go into spoilers but if you believe that when you go give two policemen a headache the whole police-force collapses then this is a great movie. It's just as believable as The Fifth Element but pretends to be much more. If Besson had kept to making a farce it could have been a great movie!

I guess it is because of the great acting by all actors and the fact that Besson has made a really surprising movie with characters who aren't what you would expect.\n\nL\u00e9on is a professional hit man, but he isn't cold hearted as you might think. He's a nice man who doesn't know how to read, who only drinks milk and who's best friend is a plant... Admit it, that's not what you would expect from a hit man. The same for Matilda, the 12-year old girl that he protects since her family was blown to pieces by a crazy Beethoven-loving drug lord. She's only 12, but she already acts like an adult and she wants to become a \"cleaner\" like L\u00e9on so she can take revenge on her little brother's murderers.\n\nThis movie isn't just an action movie or a thriller. It's also a drama with a lot of comedy. You might think this wouldn't work out well, but it does. Don't ask me how, but Besson has made a solid movie out of it that will grab you by the throat from the first minute on, not to let you go until hours after it finished... This is what people call a masterpiece I guess. 10/10."

Jean Reno nailed his portrayal as Leon; a professional hit-man whose relationship (not sexual, mind you) with a young girl forces him to re-examine his inner youth/lost child that his harsh life had robbed him of all those years ago..\n\nGary Oldman was a little over-the-top drama king as the dirty cop villain, but I don't think anyone could have done it better, especially when his character took actions under the influence of drugs.\n\nI believe this was Natalie Portman's theatrical debut, and boy was she convincing! I don't think there are that many young actresses who can vividly portray the emotions and suffering that here character had to go through given the story that played out.\n\nThe cinematography was superb, the effects well done (not overdone), and I'd recommend this movie for almost anyone to see, regardless of preferences!!!!!"

This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw that \"Leon: The Professional\" had such a high rating on IMDb, I had high expectations for the film. However, I don't think it lived up to the hype. While it's not a bad movie, it's not as great as people make it out to be. The movie features Jean Reno playing the role of a highly skilled and efficient assassin. But the plot takes a strange turn when he forms a bond with a young girl and becomes her foster father. It's hard to believe that a ruthless killer would suddenly take on a nurturing role, and even more difficult to believe that he would train her to become a killer as well.\n\nIn addition to the issues with the plot, I also found some of the character portrayals in the movie to be problematic. Natalie Portman's character, in particular, was a bit too much for me. The way she was dressed and act throughout the film made her look like something else, which was unnecessary and inappropriate for a child actor. Moreover, the relationship between her character and Leon was uncomfortable for me to watch. At times, it seemed like the filmmakers were trying to portray a romantic connection between them, which was inappropriate considering the age difference and power dynamic between the characters."

Since then I think I must have seen it more than 30 times ? And every time I have re-watch it, it will seem like I am watching it for the first time and the anticipation is still there, that's how good the movie is for me.\n\nI am excited as after so many yrs, this movie is still talked about.\n\nThe story plot is interesting to watch as it unfolds showing how Leon does his work professionally without having to worry about other things and later how his life is changed by Mathilda.\n\nThe directing is superb by Luc Besson and the music by Eric Serra sets the mood for each scene, intensifying the story.\n\nJean Reno's role as Leon is also superb as it brings out the character of Leon. Jean Reno is a great actor and he is believable in the roles he plays, he can be funny as in comedies (Just visiting) but serious/cool in others (Leon/Ronin/La grand Bleu).\n\nNatalie Portman is a natural actor who holds well in the role of Mathilda."

        "review_detailed_main": "Funny but Natalie comes from natale, thus the birth of Christ, thus Christmas or Noel in french!\n\nSeriously, for her first feature, she got a wonderful gift and was able to give in return a tremendous acting! I don't know for others stars but at her age of 13, she shows that she can cry and laugh and express all the feelings between with an evident talent! That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find \"beauty\" in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.\n\nI think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this \"Big Blue\" with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).\n\nI don't know if a \"Lolita\" vision is acute here but i think that an\n\nlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship!\n\nA unique masterpiece in conclusion all the worth that a sequel seems highly unlikely."

How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl \"adopted\" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing. She more than holds her own in her scenes with Jean Reno, and with Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello, whom I consider among the very best. That is extraordinary."

I suppose giving the girl a place to live was OK. However, to teach her how to kill? Come on! No evidence that she went to school. I could not watch more after an hour and only lasted that long because people gave it good reviews. I assumed something almost intelligent or exciting would happen. Lots of sad music backed scenes of people doing nothing. If one cut out the dull moments, this movie would last 10 minutes, if that. I stopped after the girl professed her love for the killer.

Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description L\u00e9on: The Professional (French: L\u00e9on; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man; Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments."

        "review_detailed_main": "The too-cool-for-words French actor Jean Reno plays the title role, a hitman earning a living in NYC. One of his neighbors is the precocious Mathilda (Natalie Portman, in her film debut), who lives with trashy parents, a foul-tempered sister, and one innocent, her baby brother. Then one day, crooked, psychotic, and pill-popping D. E. A. Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his crew wipe out the rest of Mathildas' family. She finds a safe haven living with Leon, and becomes obsessed with the thought of revenge. She URGES him to teach her the tricks of his trade; with great reluctance, he becomes her mentor and father figure.\n\nWritten and directed by Luc Besson (who'd made a big splash with \"La Femme Nikita\" previously), \"Leon\" is not without its share of problems. For one thing, it can get pretty ridiculous at times; master stylist Besson is not exactly going for gritty reality here. Also, some of the scenes with Leon and Mathilda, who's obviously in TOO much of a hurry to grow up (and who thinks she loves Leon), are very uncomfortable. (This, despite the fact that we can sense that Leon is a basically good man who won't take advantage of her.) It also threatens to go off the rails because of Oldman, whose performance is often quite over the top. (His \"EVERYOOOONE!\" scene has become iconic over the years.)\n\nAll of this said, the film is a compelling combination of dark elements, drama, humor, action (\"Leon\" gets operatically violent at times), and tension. What really makes the difference is that Reno has such presence on screen, and his rapport with young Portman, who likewise gives such a natural performance for a beginner that it's as if she'd been acting for years. Reno chose to play Leon as a simple-minded, almost childlike man, one who dotes on a plant and loves movie musicals, and this makes him quite appealing. They're supported by a number of familiar faces: Danny Aiello as Tony, the guy who gives Leon his assignments, Ellen Greene and Michael Badalucco as Mathildas' parents, and George Martin, Kent Broadhurst, and Robert LaSardo.\n\nMost amusing is the montage of assassinations where Leon and Mathilda are working as a team.\n\nSeven out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Are any of us happy we responded so enthusiastically to La Femme Nikita that we now have to sit through shiny garbage like The Fifth Element and the Professional? Wow, this movie's stupid. The movie begins attempting no nonsense-realism by choosing gritty, not picturesque parts of the city, as well as chucking in the pretty gratuitous murder of a child to make it that much more \"edgy\", and then the movie just becomes an orgy of gun-worship and impersonal murder, strung together by a silly, yet sickening plot, where this mass murderer's (Leon) really kind of cute and avuncular when babysitting this heavily made up 12 year old. Hey, he drinks milk! How bad could he be? And he refuses to shoot women and children! What a guy! I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child. In the course of the plot he teaches this alarmingly sophisticated neighbor girl how to be like him, how to kill strangers. Ahhh. The \"lessons\" he offers her, the tricks of his trade are chestnuts you'd never ever think of like, \"relax. keep your eye on him.\" I would have thought panic and look away, so shows what I know! And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so \"advertised\" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing \"Like A Virgin\" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe. Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy? \"The Fifth Element\" had an equally annoying cute streak. Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur. He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing. They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French. Does the French director not know what French accents sound like? Gary Oldman is laughabale, at best, and that really is almost a compliment, or as close to one as this thing deserves."

His performance is almost proto's Heath Ledger's joker in my opinion lol. Very unique crime drama thriller. Couldn't recommend it more. Especially the directors cut!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon: The Professional, is directed by Luc Besson and released in 1994, is a gripping and emotionally charged crime thriller that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. This film, often referred to simply as \"Leon,\" is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and intense, thought-provoking cinema.\n\nAt its core, \"Leon\" is a tale of unlikely companionship between Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a taciturn and highly skilled hitman, and Mathilda (a remarkable debut performance by a young Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl seeking revenge after her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, Stansfield (a chillingly memorable Gary Oldman).\n\nWhat makes Leon stand out is its exploration of complex themes like innocence, loneliness, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Jean Reno's portrayal of Leon, a morally ambiguous character who lives by a strict code, is nothing short of iconic. His stoic exterior hides a deep well of vulnerability, and the gradual transformation of his relationship with Mathilda is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.\n\nNatalie Portman's portrayal of Mathilda is nothing short of astonishing. Her portrayal of a traumatized and precocious young girl navigating a world of violence and darkness is a testament to her acting talent, even at such a young age. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is palpable, and their interactions are the emotional core of the film.\n\nGary Oldman's performance as the unhinged and pill-popping Stansfield is a tour de force. He brings an intense and unpredictable energy to the screen, making Stansfield one of the most memorable cinematic villains of all time.\n\nLuc Besson's direction is both stylish and gritty, with expertly choreographed action sequences and a hauntingly beautiful score by Eric Serra that enhances the film's atmosphere. The film's pacing is taut, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nThis film is not just a crime thriller; it's a deeply human story about connection and redemption. It challenges the audience to confront the moral ambiguity of its characters and the choices they make. This complexity, combined with outstanding performances, makes it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.\n\nThe film is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Its unforgettable characters, powerful performances, and exploration of profound themes make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally charged cinematic experience."

It's so interesting watching Natalie Portman when she was so young. But you can tell she is incredibly talented. Her character's background story is told in a way that you can really believe that she would be so desperate to want to become a killer, and want to be mentored by a deranged yet kind \"cleaner.\" Definitely watch this film unless the violence is a stumbling block for you."

        "review_title": "Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard",
        "review_detailed_main": "From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.\n\nMany actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate.\n\nLeon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story."

It's hard to believe that she was just a 13 years old girl back then. Prepare yourself to get attached and even fell in love with the main character played by Jean Reno; the heartless hit-man who's a lone wolf will open up along the movie in a very subtle way when he takes that little girl under his protection. Let's not forget about the bad guy of the movie (because every decent movie has one) and what a bad guy! Even if Gary Oldman's really pulls out an amazing performance, it's impossible to hate him.

My rating is 7 out of 10."

It is by how much it shows you moments, dialogs, situations that get into your mind and which you think over and over again after the movie, without necessarily finding a deep philosophical meaning in them. Moments that left you enough of an impression to force you review and analyze them thoroughly. This film gives me what I am looking for. Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world. Stansfield is also excellent as the villain and shows the other side of the coin, that is how easy it is to fall into immorality and how much power that can give you in the system we live today. Go and watch that movie. I promise it will be memorable."

Is one of those movies you love even more when you saw it again. Like a the fifth time you see it you can start appreciating some details, like the music or even the sounds. It reminds me the old action films where you thought everything was very meticulous and done with experts before great technology appeared. Movies like Die Hard, those you appreciate because the story is really original and the characters can trap you and question your beliefs."

When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices."

The acting by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is stellar, and Gary Oldman gives a gloriously over-the-top performance as unhinged antagonist. The direction and editing are flawless.\n\nReno's hitman and Portman's survivor develop a relationship which he initially views as paternalistic and which she eventually views as romantic. This is where the movie treads very close to the vile and indefensible; and while it thankfully never entirely crosses that line it never entirely walks back its implications either. One has to wonder exactly what the hell the filmmakers were thinking, since an entirely platonic surrogate father/daughter relationship would have served the story just as well. The fun revenge/action story is totally undercut by the inclusion of this one bizarre, unnecessary and nauseating subplot.\n\nAnd for those who think the foregoing is just some pearl-clutching, \"reading too much into it\" hyperbole, bear in mind: when this movie was made writer/director Luc Besson was 34 and he was married to a 16-year-old-girl, who he met when she was 12. But they allegedly didn't start dating until she was 15 (and he was 33.) Because apparently 15 is the age of consent in France, and disgusting everywhere else. Odd how these facts rarely get mentioned by sickos in sicko Hollywood's captive media when discussing this movie particularly or Besson in general. But the info is right there on Wikipedia for anyone who wants to spend more than 0 seconds looking into it."

I love the feel of this film, I never felt comfortable for any of the characters at any time, I never really knew what the next frame would turn out to be and in many ways it was a depressing film. I think there are a lot of people out there who could identify with the character of Leon in this film because if its not yourself it could be somebody who just doesn't seem to fit in anywhere apart from one tiny aspect of life as a whole. The story is told in a dramatic and violent manner but because of the subject matter it is entirely in context. Please give this film a viewing and enjoy this stunningly made film."

But outside of that it feels as though the back drop of murder and violence serves as simple action fodder. Nor does it excel in this regard, and since it's less commentary on violence and more violence as a tool for engaging the audience it lacks the depth or excitement you crave from the genre. It is also a film that did not completely know how to end. While I sympathize with writers everywhere on the difficulty of endings, it does not excuse what seems to be a complete lack of effort to tie the story up (or not tie it up, either way it should embrace a certain tone rather then... we'll nothing at all). This is by no means a bad movie, but I find myself enjoying the idea of the film over the film itself."

This odd, dark ambient, added to a lovely romantic soundtrack, gives this film a distinct, perfect atmosphere. \n\n*About the story:* \n\n\"There is poetry in the dialogs, and there is definitely some artistry put in this film. Is very similar to TDK in that aspect. Very good character development, something extremely rare in this sort of film. A few things felt forced here and there, but overall, a good and moving story about a kid growing up all by herself in a totally hostile environment.\" \n\n*And to finish, the acting:* \n\n\"Great performances by Oldman, Reno and Portman. They are definitely the highlights of the film. Oldman is a scene stealer here, with his ultra over the top acting.\" \n\n*Conclusion...\n\nOne of the best crime films of the 80s or 90s."

After watching movies over the years, realized Leon is just another flick made by Hollywood with all the formulas and recipes they use repeatedly to make the mass dumber and dumber. The dialogues were so awful. Both the main actors were unbearable this time around. The so-called anti hero is given a set of activities to make him look villainous... I have watched movies like Godfather, Lost in Translation a number of times. Each time I appreciate the thought process that went into making such movies.

It's brilliantly scripted and directed, and superbly paced...long periods of calm, leading up to bursts of intense action. The humour works well, too.\n\nJean Reno is absolutely top-notch as Leon, the awkward, shy guy who becomes an invisible killing machine whenever he goes to work, and exhibits a sort of childish glee when watching Gene Kelly on the big screen. He's funny, deep, mature and childlike all at the same time, and it's a pleasure to watch.\n\nNat, too, is simply amazing. It's her first movie, and she's only around twelve or thirteen, but I don't think she's given a more accomplished performance since (at least, not in a movie I'm willing to watch). The bit where she's standing at Leon's door sobbing her little eyes out kills me every time.\n\nIt's nice to see Gary Oldman playing a villain for once ;). He's in peak form here, as a linen suit-wearing, pill-popping, Beethoven-loving, ultra-violent sociopath. He's a total nut-bag, but very cool with it. Even when he's slaughtering innocent women and children, you can't help but like him.\n\nOr, is that just me...?\n\nEric Serra's score actually WORKS this time. In some movies I find all that weird, French, electronic stuff distracting. Not here.\n\nI'm trying to think of bad points about this film, but can't come up with any. I guess that says it all really."

Leon starts to teach Mathilda her trade.How to clean??The ending is quite surprising & i was amazed by the screenplay in this movie.It was just terrific.Great work by Luc Besson.Directing is pretty cool.\n\nThis movie is underrated as many of my friends haven't heard of it.But those who have scene,they surely appreciate.The soundtrack too is fabulous adding spice to the movie.\n\nLeon said \"No Women,No Kids\".Truly this movie is for men only.But everyone who watches this will surely become a fan of Leon."

        "review_detailed_main": "I want to start of by saying that I watched the directors cut, so it included a lot of scenes that I did not particularly appreciate, hence only the 7/10.\n\nNatalie Portman is fantastic in her role. To be able to achieve this level of acting at such a young age is something we must truly appreciate. It feels very natural and very easy to her. She was born te be an actress!\n\nSame can be said about Jean Reno's performance. He portrays the character in a very fragile way and he was able to make me feel 'bad' for a hitman. I was emotionally involved with him and I felt for him during the movie.\n\nGary Oldman's best performance as the deranged head of the DEA also adds to the reasons as to why this movie could've been great, but let's talk about the 'bad' now.\n\nThe plot was ridiculous in many ways to be honest. There was no backstory for Gary Oldman's character and it felt weird that he was somehow the head of the DEA as a psychopath. Also some of the scenes just don't really make any sense. The DEA does all sorts of weird things that just wouldn't happen in real life. I don't want to include spoilers so I won't go into detail.\n\nNow why did this movie make me feel weird in a way. The constant subtle hint of a sexual relationship between a child and a grown man (only in the directors cut). Portman is seen wearing very little clothing throughout the film and she even wears lingerie at one point. She also keeps telling Leon that she loves him during the film and Leon never really denies her feelings. He doesn't really give in either but he doesn't fully reject and it doesn't sit well with me. Portman was just so sexualized in this movie and I didn't like it, that's the main problem I have with it."

Intelligent dialogues, strong emotional build-up, fast pace, absorbing atmosphere and a great soundtrack.\n\nBut Leon would be doomed without first class actors. All four main characters are perfectly cast and brilliantly played. Their presence dominates this movie, which by the way has nothing to do with an action flick, it is a masterfully crafted character study. Action is just the extra salt to the delicious cinematic plate Luc Besson is offering to us.\n\nNatalie Portman requires a special praise. This is not only a stunning performance from a 12 year old girl, this is even not only a great performance from an accomplished actress, it is absolutely Oscar material and, judging from her next projects, easily her best role to date.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Luc Besson, Eric Serra and Jean Reno are French. They know how to go past the surface and make a movie with a feeling."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the truly sick movies I own and am embarrassed to say how much I have always liked it....but I have, big-time. This film, with some very sick messages, is uniquely appealing at the same time. To use a popular word of today: it is \"extreme.\"\n\nThe extreme GOOD: 1 - A very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; 2 - A very intense drama at times with tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. 3 - The little girl \"Mathilda\" (Natalie Portman's first role) does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child, and I've seen a number of good ones over the years. It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star. 4 - Despite his profession, \"Leon\" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. 5 - Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. 6 - A very satisfying ending; 7 - Great camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.\n\nThe extreme BAD: 1 - Not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but.... 2 - the latter (on the extended version) gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her ; 3 - Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) 4 - Another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys.\n\nIn the end, though, it's only a movie, just a fictional story and it's job is to entertain....and in that it succeeds amazingly well. Great entertainment in a perverse way."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first Jean Reno film I saw. After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.\n\nThe other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.\n\nNow we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.\n\nNow when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.\n\nFull Plot: Leone \"L\u00e9on\" Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or \"cleaner,\" as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the \"Supreme Macaroni Company\" restaurant. L\u00e9on spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his \"best friend,\"[3] and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.\n\nOn a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.\n\nMathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman \"Stan\" Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant L\u00e9on.\n\nMathilda discovers that L\u00e9on is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a \"cleaner;\" she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. L\u00e9on shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying L\u00e9on's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to L\u00e9on several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.\n\nAfter increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from L\u00e9on's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. L\u00e9on, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.\n\nStansfield is enraged that what he calls the \"Italian hit-man\" has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering L\u00e9on's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate L\u00e9on's apartment. L\u00e9on ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, L\u00e9on creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.\n\nIn the chaos that follows, L\u00e9on sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. L\u00e9on places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is \"from Mathilda,\" then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open L\u00e9on's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.\n\nMathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by L\u00e9on. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune L\u00e9on had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can \"clean\" as L\u00e9on had. Tony sternly informs her that he \"ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!\" Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and L\u00e9on's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with L\u00e9on's houseplant in hand. She digs a hole and plants it, as she had told L\u00e9on he should, \"to give it roots.\"\n\nVerdict: 10/10. Buy the FULL UNCUT EDITION on DVD"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is the story of a very smart and calculating professional killer named Leon (Jean Reno) who ends up with a burden in his arms, a twelve year old girl named Matilda (Natalie Portman). Matilda's fate is almost met when a very crooked DEA Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) murders her family while she is out buying milk - Leon saves her life and teaches her the trade of \"cleaning\". I bought this film before I had even seen it. I did this because of the fantastic reviews it got, and having a real respect for Gary Oldman. When I fired it up the first time... it all suddenly made sense.\n\nThe real story behind Leon isn't the gun play, (which is still fantastic) but the relationship between mature well mannered Leon and sexually inexperienced and unsure, but outgoing Matilda. The chemistry between the two on screen is just fantastic, as Leon starts to come to terms with himself that he really is in love with Matilda. Pedhophila is an issue in this film (though is never shown) and is understandable why some people find it to be a hard pill to swallow (maybe not for Oldman)... but for me, this film is like taking a trip down a road of rocky revenge, heartbreaking tragedy, breathtaking style and substance to die for. See Leon today."

It reflects real life. Perhaps surprisingly, it is in Leon that emotion surfaces more easily, with Mathilda almost carrying the hardened hit-man as well as the film, through a series of punishing tests.\n\nMathilda is irresistible, cute, practical, tortured, sensual, and yet remains entirely innocent. As is the heartless, simple, cold-blooded murderer, Leon. This is artistic, entertaining, depressing, uplifting, shocking, yet always remains beautiful and true.\n\nIt is sad that Portman has never come anywhere near to repeating her performance in Leon, and probably never will. Whatever reasons she may have, it is sad for the fans that she doesn't take on more of these 'gritty' roles. But it's one more reason to watch, be amazed and captivated by Leon."

Anyway....better late than never.\n\nThis is a film that conveys how amazing humans are - from sadistic maniacs to tender hit men. The complexity of the behaviors, the abilities of the characters to make largely believable choices based on their moral codes, and some astonishing performances from some incredible actors make this a film you must like if we're ever going to see each other again.\n\nThe principals give us some incredible performances. Jean Reno as Leon is astonishing. His ability to convey a million feelings with a blink of his eyes, a stiffening of his shoulders, or even the intake of breath make him someone I could watch in anything. I loved loved loved him in Ronin and this has only increased my love of the guy. I'm not gay but if I watch Leon enough, I might soon be! I will have to check out more of his work. His modesty, loyalty, decency, complexity, his tenderness and firmness with Mathilda (Natalie Portman), his steadfastness, and his courage make him one of my favorite movie characters in any film.\n\nI thought I wouldn't need to use any more superlatives for Natalie Portman having watched Heat about 50 times but she was younger in this film and she gives a performance with even more range than she showed in Heat. I'm happy to be able to see her work (even though I thought Black Swan was pretentious, predictable, melodramatic pablum). Her ability to convey anger, fearfulness, tenderness, confidence (I loved her peremptory dismissal of the four boys trying to protect their claim to neighborhood turf), and burgeoning sexuality (fortunately this part of the film doesn't quite take the film off course though I was worried for a second) while most definitely being a kid (she loves cartoons!!!) is amazing. Having said that, the best thing about Mathilda is her resilience. She is a survivor and this trait is Mathilda's baseline characteristic. Portman is just an incredibly gifted actress and her performance here is almost enough to leave me speechless.\n\nDanny Aiello is fantastic as Leon's loyal friend. He is a rock for Leon and asks no questions. He can always be trusted. Aiello conveys the sense of a man who cannot be shaken and is a true friend. He's probably heard it all and yet he's still there for his friend.\n\nHonestly, I thought Oldman was a bit over the top in his role. Obviously he is supposed to be out of control but I thought this was self-parodic, even for him.\n\nLuc Besson is never better at the helm and as a writer. His steady hand is much in evidence in keeping such a wild plot on pace and finding the emotional and moral centers of the film. The script is fantastic - a hit-man with a heart of gold, a precocious tweener, and a psychotic, crooked cop. Really, if you don't like this film, we can't be friends."

When I in 97 laid my hands on the long version (released in Sweden, Denmark, France and a few more places. NOT USA!) I realised that it was my favourite movie and it still is."

Like a good wine, it actually gets better with age. I just watched it with my 13-year old son, a budding film enthusiast, and he just flat-out loved it. Great story, top-of-the-line performances by Portman, Reno and Oldman, wonderful direction. Even the music is great! What more can I say? This stands the test of time and stands proudly among the best ever made. This time around, I was particularly impressed with the artistic mixture of drama, action and comedy. Besson knows exactly where the camera should be at all times to tell an entertaining, gripping and touching story that is both daring and caring. Hard to do!"

The central dynamic is a little odd, though it's nothing compared to what was in the original screenplay, but ultimately turns out sweetly serene and incidentally innocent. The scenery-chewing villain is a little pantomime but menacingly hunts down the duo like dogs, which allows for some great action set-pieces punctuated by pure emotional moments. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Its nice to see another of my personal favorites score so highly with IMDb reviewers! The professional is about a hit-man Leon (Jean Reno) who befriends young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family is murdered. Mathilda decides she wants revenge and insists Leon teach her how to \"clean\". A very touching relationship then develops between the two which is at the center of this amazing film. I really love this movie!\n\nI need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.\n\nThen there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film \"State of Grace\"). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to \"send me everyone\" and the assistant incredulously asks \"everyone?\" to which Stansfield chillingly screams \"EVERYONE!!\"...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.\n\nI don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...\"this is from Mathilda\"...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.\n\nThis is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.\n\nReal nice song by Sting \"shape of my heart\" over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy."

I watched a really cool action film that was better than the rest due to its intricately woven characters and its original storyline. That does not mean its better than DIE HARD and YES it falls in the exact same genre and YES I just compared the two. Overall cool cool cool flick, definitely watch to entertain yourself, but CMON TOP 50? Please this just goes to show the rediculousness of IMDb ratings nowadays... and just so everyone knows I am not bashing this movie it is just sorely overrated on here so I had to voice myself. As my Comcast Cable Company rated it so wisely 2/4 stars! OUCH! sry fans but its the truth! Hey I think its better than 5/10 stars though!... but nothing over a 7 please."

I mean it shouldn't be in the top 40 (or so) films of all time list.\n\nAfter watching Leon I felt rather hard done by, yes the review I've given is good and it's deserved but it can hardly be considered a masterpiece. To satisfy curiosity I suggest it's worth the watch, if only for another spellbinding turn by undoubtedly the greatest English actor of his generation. Not only has Gary Oldman set the benchmark for sociopathic villains, but his touch is so feather light that the eccentricities of each individual movement are as delightfully entrancing as they are wickedly sickening. Yes, admittedly my admiration for the man led me to write this review but only because I feel it important to tell others that this is one of his best performances to date and that it prevents this movie from being forgotten.\n\nI watched the film after seeing a 'Top Ten Gary Oldman Performances' video on the old youtube thingymajigg ('watchmojo' is a very interesting channel, go on... check it out.) and this has led me to scouring the internet for different films involving this guy, and honestly, and fairly upsettingly, I can't think of a better way I could've spent my time. In my, not too sought after opinion, he is the greatest actor I've ever seen and I repeatedly tell my friends ( and I know I don't sound like a guy who has any, but I'm fairly certain that they can be counted as friends ( don't ask them in case I'm wrong )) to study the man in great detail. I mean, they hadn't even heard of him. Anyway, in all honesty, this review was supposed to be serious but I fear I'm losing my way. So on we go...\n\nThe performance of Reno is sturdy as is the support of the majority of the cast; obviously the use of a child acting doesn't fail to annoy, even though the girl in question went on to reach stardom (didn't see that coming). I'm not an expert in direction so I'm not in a place to comment on Besson's job, but he's created an enjoyable film that certainly breaches the norm, so top marks there. I don't know what to make of the French, this film points in their favour though.\n\nI think this conclusion gives me an excuse to compliment G.O. so I will. All I'll say is that if you have the intention/hope/dream of going into acting, or simply just admire this strand of entertainment: this guy's the man to watch.\n\nSorry for going on, anyway I liked it... I suggest giving it a go."

        "review_title": "Natalie Portman was brilliant but some plot-driven decisions seemed off to me",
        "review_detailed_main": "My biggest take from this movie is that young Natalie Portman was a badass. I imagine a lot of people might find Mathilda's character as uncomforting but seeing as she came from a troubling family, most likely with no friends, her character arc makes a lot of sense for me. To some extent, she even reminded me of Wan-Chu, the disturbed girl from Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind (1980), both by looks and violent tendencies. Of course, she's not as destructive and might be viewed as a watered-down version of Wan-Chu, but she definitely wasn't boring and was badass enough for my taste. For me, these kinds of disturbing and troubled characters always seemed more entertaining than your average \"walk-in-the-park\" characters.\n\nEven though the plot is action-driven with a great premise - a young pre-teen girl teaming up with a hitman after an unfortunate demise of her whole family - this movie didn't really go too well with me. I don't know whether it's the lack of the X-factor that would push me over the hump of excitement or the fact that Gary Oldman's character was the only one that couldn't be viewed as just a redshirt character. The movie was exciting to some extent but the over-the-top plot was a bit of a turn-off for me. The ending was emotional but the shootout was a bit ridiculous. I know Leon is viewed as a professional and a threat but sending 200 guys just for him and the way it went down just didn't click with me.\n\nBesides what I mentioned already, I'd like to say that the violent scenes are top-notch and the romance, whether disturbing or not, was cute and kind of shows how easy it is to dream for girls of that age. I don't think there's anything wrong with the cast and their talent, it was just the key plot moment weren't as enjoyable as they could have been. If rating just the portion of the movie before Mathilda went off to the DEA building, I'd rate it way higher, or even if the finale of the movie took place by Leon saving Mathilda from Gary Oldman's character, I'd think the scenery would be greater to end things off."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jean Reno plays the titular character \u2013 regardless of the name on the spine of the DVD \u2013 he is both Leon and the Professional. A quiet intense man who lives a solitary existence of discipline and ritual, honing his skills as an assassin that leaves no trace and carries out his work cleanly and perfectly, a man with only two parameters to his work: 'No women. No kids.' When the family that lives next door in his modest apartment building is butchered by corrupt police after a drug deal gone wrong, leaving only 11 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), Leon has virtually no choice but to literally take her in, lest he break his own rules through deliberate inaction.\n\nIn the days and weeks that follow, impressionable Mathilda \u2013 who feels she is wise beyond her years \u2013 comes to realise the enormity of her situation. This is only magnified when she learns of Leon's true occupation. Of course being no more than a kid, Mathilda hardly finds this news abhorrent, but decides that she wishes to learn the ropes of what Leon refers to as 'cleaning'.\n\nThis leads to a strange new existence for Leon, he cannot force pre-teen Mathilda out into the real world, but allowing her to remain compromises his disciplined existence. The mismatched duo settle in to a 'Daddy / Daughter' relationship, with Mathilda remaining home while Leon heads off to 'work', the issue rapidly becomes that Mathilda rapidly starts seeing Leon as less of a Father figure, and more of a crush\u0085 Seeing that Mathilda is so headstrong, determined and convincing, and that Leon is if anything slightly child-like and has been shielded from normal human relationships, Leon ultimately yields a little and tentatively commits to basic training; something his employer Tony (Danny Aiello) is rightfully doubtful of.\n\nRegardless of suitability or basic ethics, the Leon / Mathilda relationship evolves into a strange partnership, and bringing your (pseudo) daughter to work days take on strange and uncomfortable significance. As Mathilda develops new skills and confidences unbecoming of her fragile years it is more and more evident that her ultimate intent is to avenge the deaths of her family\u0085 Which brings us to Mr Gary Oldman and his role as corrupt cop Stansfield.\n\nStansfield works for the Drug Enforcement Agency in the police force, however his entire unit is entirely crooked. Oldman toes the fine line between over the top intensity and cartoonishness well for the most part, and I guess if you are looking to forgive some of his antics you could always point to the green and yellow capsules that he takes prior to his more 'memorable' sequences.\n\nWhat is undeniable is that the and inescapable routine that the reserved and measured Leon is bound by is an effective counterpoint to the haphazard and impetuous existence of Stansfield. Having initially innocent Mathilda embroiled between these ying and yang characters provides the film with a centre, and the inevitable feeling that all three characters will find themselves in the same place at the same time.\n\nLeon is full of long low key scenes with equally subtle background music, 90% of the dialogue is between Mathilda and Leon \u2013 with a good two thirds of each conversation dominated by the precocious child. These scenes are punctuated by sudden dramatic scenes of violence, especially as the film nears its conclusion and Mathilda finally learns that there are some things that kids shouldn't be subjected to regardless of how 'ready' they think they are.\n\nLeon: The Professional was directed and written by Luc Besson, who has managed to leave his fingerprints on several essential action flicks from the last couple decades, Taken, Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter and Unleashed included. Leon seems to be quite a personal work, and while some of the other works listed are very good and worth checking out, in my mind Leon: The Professional stands head and shoulders above them all.\n\nThis film granted both Gary Oldman and Jean Reno eternal credibility to a generation of young film-goers, and helped launch the career of Natalie Portman. For a moment it almost made me want to buy a skull cap\u0085 Now nearly two decades on I am at odds with the more 'risky' scenes that further the on the job training and 'romantic' aspects of the storyline. I am by no means decrying their inclusion as being abhorrent or immoral, but I similarly don't really see them adding much to what was already an amazing and essential film.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 9 / 10. A simple story about a very non-simple situation, Leon remains an all time classic."

I'm not normally a fan of movies within this genre, so i cast my 10/10 with an unbiased eye. I loved this film, I really did. Leon and Mathilda are both such memorable, endearing characters, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman and Jean Reno. Gary Oldman also plays his part with such ease, fantastically.\n\nThe killing scenes throughout the film are spectacular, and the cinematography is surprisingly stunning. I'm surprised this never won any Oscars or Golden Globes. This is a film that most certainly deserves its 'Cult Classic' label, and is a movie that should be a trailblazer for the genre."

If this little girl doesn't break your heart, you'd better check to be sure you still one.\n\nGary Oldman demonstrates that he is one of the finest actors with his over-the-top portrayal of drug-crazed DEA Agent Norman Stansfield. It has been said better by other writers, but Oldman disappears inside of each character he plays. Most of the people to whom I have shown this film insist that they have never seen Oldman in any movie until I start listing some of his roles. \"Oh yeah, I saw that movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Brilliant, powerful story of revenge...and belonging.\n\nLeon (played by Jean Reno) lives in New York and is a professional hit-man. One of his neighbours, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), is a 12- year old girl with family problems, one of which is that her father is a petty criminal. One day, a drug kingpin, Stansfield (Gary Oldman), kills her entire family due to something her father did. Mathilda turns to Leon for help...and revenge.\n\nExcellent crime drama. Good plot, meticulously set out and executed. Good action scenes too. Not just an action-drama though - there is also an emotional aspect to the movie, and a theme of setting down roots and belonging somewhere.\n\nSolid work by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman (12 years old and in her first movie) in the lead roles. Both these performances are eclipsed, however, by an amazing performance by Gary Oldman as the villain. Pure over-the-top, menacing, evil, bizarre genius of a performance by him. The only disappointment of this movie is that Oldman did not have more screen time."

Leon is a very simple man from a poor background in Sicily, and although highly disciplined, comes across as very honest and caring. The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above. Their relationship leaps off the screen from perfect performances, tugging our heartstrings. Gary Oldman also gives a no holds barred performance to create a supremely twisted character. It all has the quaintness of good child/adult drama whilst sending out regular sparks from orchestrated violence, a tough act to follow."

Never seeing any clip or preview of this movie, I didn't expect this movie to be such a good drama, and all the action came to be a big surprise for me. The only thing I knew was the relationship between Leon and Metilda. And personally I didn't want to see it because I thought, that what they did together would be to graphic(sexually). Though I was dead wrong, they never go overboard with those two relationship.\n\nRight from the start of the movie I knew I was going to love it. All the main characters performances were perfect!

Reno ends up taking her in and helping her avenge her parents deaths.\n\nWhat follows is heart stopping action and a tender love story which never crosses the line into pedophilia. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is magical and Gary Oldman is the perfect villain. I was just blown away by this thriller."

Hardly the traits of an assassin, wouldn't you agree?\n\nLeon is a professional hitman who lives in an ordinary apartment building. His next-door neigbour is an abusive father, who has been stealing cocaine. When DEA boss Stansfield (Gary Oldman) discovers he has been stealing, he cold-bloodedly murders his family. 12-year old Mathilda - who was out shopping - escapes the massacre. On her return, she notices the killings and finds shelter at Leon's apartment.\n\nWith nowhere to go, and wanting to avenge Stansfield, she asks Leon to teach her to become a 'cleaner' - or assassin. Reluctant at first, Leon agrees. And so an unlikely friendship develops between Leon and Mathilda. It is a well written script, and the film has a great score.\n\nI remember seeing 'Leon: The Professional' in theatres back in 1994 when it was released, and thinking it was a bit boring. I was very young at the time and watched it now again as an adult. Having learnt life's lessons, the film definitely had a much greater appeal to me now than it did when I was a youngster. Still, there were moments when it felt the film dragged too much. I understand it was necessary to establish a relationship between the lead characters (no, not as in an intimate relationship, thank goodness!) so we could understand them and their situation better.\n\nDialogue throughout the movie hinted at what the outcome might have been, and it was indeed so. 'Leon: The Professional' is a stylish drama which doesn't offer much in the form of action. This is mostly a character-driven movie. The performances are absolutely fantastic. Gary Oldman, especially, is brilliant as always. This was a career-defining part for Natalie Portman, and the film that propelled Jean Reno to international stardom."

It is a depiction of hope and vengeance, while still managing to tell a tale of love and happiness, it is one of the greatest films put to screen."

The only film that tops it for me is The Shawshank Redemption (click my name above to see my review on that) so therefore for me it beats the likes of my other favourites like The Godfather and Schindlers list. One of the main reason this film is so great is because of Natalie Portmans amazing acting in it, she managed to capture angry, suicidal, vengeful side of Mathilda but also the loving more caring side of her, not many grown up actors/actresses can do that let alone a kid.\n\nIn conclusion I'd say this is a film that all audiences can watch and enjoy."

The action is well shot, and the direction isn't half bad, but it is the pacing that ultimately marred the efficacy and momentum of the narration and robbed me of my enjoyment.\n\nThat being said, I still appreciate the actors for what they have done here. Portman did great; for an 11 year old (she was at that time) child artist, she did a fine job. So did Jean Reno with his laid-back, expressionless role of Leon, but for me, it was Oldman who took the limelight. He was freaking amazing; I wish he had more screen time.

There isn't a young actress out there that could've played that role as effectively as Portman. The emotion she's able to summon from when she's looking for Leon to open the door after her family's been shot, to the entertaining charades game, to the intense scene with Stansfield in the bathroom, truly amazing. You can't help but feel empathy for her character. Vintage Gary Oldman playing the bad guy as the corrupt DEA officer, one of his best performances as an actor. His over the top nature made the film even more entertaining.\n\nFlat out one of the best movies of all time. Please watch the extended director's cut and not the theatrical version!"

To start with, the relationship of Leon, a hardcore hit-man that talks to plants and doesn't relate at all to the world, and Mathilda, a girl that is moved away from her family nucleus to find real love, a paternal figure on Leon. Both Jean Reno and Nathalie Portman seem born to this role, so natural. They feed a bizarre, uncommon couple that lights on their talents and their lateral chemistry. Gary Oldman is a beast, in every single way. He enjoys performing a DEA agent that has very little respect for everything. When he shouts \"Bring me EVERYOOONEEE!\", one can see that his acting is intense, visceral and passionate.\n\nLeon is an excellent story, any way you see it. The script makes us jump into a two side story: an action packed ride and an emotional, story that has never talked so brilliantly about love (but not luscious love).\n\nSee it, its a basic film. I'll give you a nice line to throw you in. \"Death is, Whimsical Today\""

Jean Reno's, Natalie Portman's, and Gary Oldman's acting was fantastic (It's a shame to see a talent like Natalie's wasted on horrible writing, like in Episode I/II. While I enjoyed both of those movies immensely, I hated the dialogue, especially between her and Anakin).\n\nI saw the uncut version, and from what I've read, the US cut (\"The Professional\") removes all of the tenderness between Leon and Matilda. Squeemish MPAA viewers who don't like the relationship between Leon and Matilda removed the film's most important parts (and for worried viewers out there- don't worry, nothing \"happens\", but their love is very well played, and quite believable).\n\nSo anyway- see this movie, but the uncut version, not the US cut. It is one of my all-time favorites (on my top 10), and establishes Luc Besson as one of my favorite directors. If you haven't, also see The Fifth Element, and La Femme Nikita.\n\n10/10 - superb."

Jean Reno seems rather goofy at times even though his character is supposed to be a \"professional killer\". However, the last 45 minutes of the film are very well done. I really began to feel for jean and natalie, even though their relationship was rather odd(a 40 year old man with a 12 year old girl). The ending is probably the best part of the movie, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Overall I give the film a 7/10."

This escene is pretty necessary, otherwise we don't know the real boundary on the relationship, what happened with the gift and why they were sleeping together from nowhere.\n\nThe other one is when Mathilda goes with Leon to Tony, so they tries to make her a Cleaner and the scumbag refuses. There is a reference that Leon says to him something like \"remember the girl from the other day\" and tries to persuade him to give his money to her when he dies.\n\nI'd just like that we don't get watered down versions and everyone can enjoy it as it was intended, without the stupid censorship."

        "review_detailed_main": "Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.\n\nJean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read. He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets. Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a \"cleaner\" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother. Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.\n\nOkay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style. After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial. (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.) After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.\n\nWhat French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment. He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some \"cute\" shots of his very pretty little star. One wants to ask, \"What's a nice Jewish girl (Portman was born in Israel) like you doing in a movie like this?\"\n\nWhat makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot. Some highlights:\n\nThe scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, \"He's not my father. He's my lover.\" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)\n\nReno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).\n\nStansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills. In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, \"This is from Mathilda\" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand... (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review! Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)\n\nOne last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!\n\nOkay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)"

        "review_detailed_main": "IMDb Top 250: 33\n\nI think a big part of why this film was so good is that it could've been so bad. Consider the alternate film this may have been: an icy, one- dimensional hit-man somehow pairs with a bratty young girl to face a drugged police character in this summer's brainmelting blockbuster.\n\nBut it's not that. It came out as Leon: The Professional.\n\nLeon is a special film. It channels classics like Taxi Driver, Batman, and many many New York films but has its own unique identity. Part thriller, part drama, the film is touching and exciting, and reels you in from its stellar first scene and takes you for a fantastic adventure.\n\nThe story, while having the possibility of being off-putting, works. Sure you can question the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (depending on the cut of the film you saw, I saw the International cut and everything was fine), but I found it more reasonable than say the relationships in Doctor Zhivago and Lolita. Anyway, the story- it's original and takes many turns, but stays on track and never slows without reason.\n\nA story only goes so far: the biggest success of Leon is its 3 main characters. Jean Reno IS Leon, I can't see anyone doing any better. As the cold, solitary hit-man who is handed a very different responsibility, we grow to love Leon with his quirky persona of houseplant caring, movie watching and chair sleeping. He is an iconic character with his sunglasses and low voice. His developed duality is remarkable to behold.\n\nLeon is complimented by the fiery Mathilda played by the extraordinarily young Natalie Portman, the smoking, swearing kid who grew up with a tough life. As unbelievable as her choices may seem on paper, I totally got behind her reasoning and never found her to do anything horribly distasteful. The duo of killer father and eager daughter is one of the greatest in film.\n\nThat leaves the sick Stansfield as the target of the duo's revenge. Played by Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of all time, the psychotic, pill-popping shady cop is truly despicable, with his scenes of drug consumption and Beethoven rant to be extremely unsettling.\n\nThe bread and butter of film is great. There are many shots that I found interesting and unique, and the cinematography and editing is all top notch. The music, decidedly the most French thing about the whole film, is juxtaposed to anything happening on-screen and helps make the film's identity, especially in the bonding scenes between Leon and Mathilda.\n\nThere is a double-edged sword about the film. We see Leon's killer side, and we see him as an awkward caregiver, like in the dress-up game. This mix keeps the audience guessing and keeps the film entertaining. It all culminates in a poetic ending that couldn't be any better or more satisfying.\n\nFrom start to finish, Leon is awesome. It has artistic credibility, awesome action scenes, great characters and acting, as well as the brick and mortar that makes film work. I had never heard of it before seeing the Top 250, and I don't know why it isn't bigger. See this film!\n\n9.4/10"

There is a really good cast, the movie is original and this is not like the others action movie because there are not a lot of explosion. I think the relationship between Matilda and Leon is little bit weird because the relationship looks like a couple's. This movie is sad and made me cry. I think its would be a good idea to make a new adaptation if this movie. Thank you Luc Besson for this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "L\u00e9on: The Professional is perhaps one of the finest action films you will likely ever see. The tension builds and builds, the entire film seems to be balanced on a knife's edge. Gary Oldman is superb here, in portraying one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history, in Norman Stansfield. MSM Movies would describe the Norman Stansfield character as \"the role that launched a thousand villains\". The \"Bring me EVERYONE!\" line was entirely improvised by Oldman to make Luc Besson laugh. Funny enough, Norman Stansfield - played by Oldman - who is excessively obsessed with Ludwig van Beethoven. That same year, Oldman would portray Beethoven in Immortal Beloved (1994). In all sincerity Oldman is one of the finest actors of his generation. Gary Oldman is an actor of tremendous range and versatility. He is well known for playing characters that are usually borderline psychotics. He has a great ability to change his psychical appearance and voice to make each character believable and unique. It speaks volumes about his acting, through all these years, to be still cast in high-profile films.\n\nThe film also features a young Natalie Portman, who would beat two thousand other girls for the role. L\u00e9on (played by Jean Reno) is the near unstoppable professional hitman, who reluctantly takes in twelve-year-old Mathilda (Portman) under his wing. The wonderful score by \u00c9ric Serra would provide the relentless intensity the film was trying to convey. Who can forget Stings - Shape of My Heart at the ending? This is easily one of his best written songs and works well at the end of the film. This is a real masterpiece - action with real heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gary Oldman was amazing. The acting in the movie is superb. Young Natalie Portman really shows exactly how good an actress she could be at the age of 13. Since I haven't seen Black Swan, this, to me is her finest performance. Jean Reno as Leon was absolutely wonderful as the two shared some great scenes but the star of the movie, to me, without any doubt is Gary Oldman. There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable. He does that Heath Ledger's Joker type performance and is absolutely amazing as Stanfield, the one who murdered Mathilda's parents.\n\nThe story itself is incredibly movie. By now, its a story that's being done to death with a bad guy falling in love with kids and growing a heart but no movie has ever nailed the idea like Leon. Seriously, the 2010 Despicable Me is the exact same story and is done horribly when compared to this. Leon is far more detailed. I mean, its not like Leon saw Mathilda and just loved her straight away. No! He tried to kill her during her sleep. He gets annoyed at her, he plays with her and he does everything. The way the relationship was executed was phenomenal.\n\nThe characters in the movie are just absolutely wonderful and are extremely detailed. Mathilda is probably the finest child character I've ever seen, as Empire Online have said themselves. I could NOT agree more! There is just so much depth to her and not just she lost her brother and wants revenge. You understand her as a character for some strange reason and everything feels real."

        "review_detailed_main": "Generally speaking, hitmen in Hollywood films are not especially deserving of sympathy. However, this portrait of a hitman, also known as The Professional, is far more sympathetic than most other portrayals of this profession. Jean Reno gives his unforgettable performance as a very hard man to kill along with a very young Natalie Portman, a young girl that the killer takes under his wing. One could easily assume there are sexual subplots going on here, but they would be mistaken. Leon is acting upon his instincts as a father might have in the same given situation. Gary Oldman is wonderful as the over the top cop out to get Leon from beginning to end. Portman does a great job as the young orphan, and shows why she would become a magnificent actress later in her career. Catch this film for the performances, if for no other reason."

I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you enjoy this genre. If not this movie is a simple civil crowd pleasure for some people. If you want romance combined with action/gangster I would advise you to see the above movie (Miller's crossing) or some arbitrary movie involving Gun's and Romance. To my knowledge that can not be done with exceptions of notable movie's you've probobly seen or heard of. The real thing that will leave you crying is the excellent score By Eric Serra who composed movies such as Golden Eye, And The fifth element. Music scores have been notable for doing such...\n\nIf you look at all the comments made you will notice that they are all in favor of this movie. However this movie has gotten several bad rating's by critics and imdb members. The base line is you either care so deeply about this movie it causes you to write a 10 paragraph commentary on it. But then again the movie can concur a wide berth that will leave you saying.. That wasnt so great..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm honestly surprised that this film isn't more well-known that it is, for it is honestly an incredible and well-done movie.\n\nJean Reno is a \"Cleaner\" - a graceful and smooth hitman employed with the Italian mafia. Natalie Portman is a young girl from an abusive household that comes home to find her family murdered and enters Reno's life seeking both sanctuary and revenge. Upon learning what Reno really does for a living, Portman encourages him to teach her the ways of being a professional assassin, and starts her studies under the hands-on teaching of Reno.\n\nSurprisingly enough, there is much, much more to this film than the simple misgivings and actions of a hitman who is forced to care for a young girl. Despite its obvious violent backdrop, the film not only chronicles her growth in his art, but also the bond and relationship that comes between them, not only as adult and child but also as father and daughter.\n\nNatalie Portman only seeks to be cared for while Jean Reno finds his love hard to give, finally culminating in the ultimate sacrifices being paid for each other - sacrifices which only love could bring about.\n\nThe acting is done superbly, with Leon's childlike wonder amidst his very mature profession being played to a T by an incredibly under-rated actor Jean Reno. And Mathilda's child-like habits, yet her adult maturity being performed amazingly by an only 13 year old Natalie Portman, this film definitely is a must see, not only for the superb craftsmanship of Luc Besson, but also for the heart-felt story and its \"star-crossed\" love between the characters themselves.\n\nWith support acting from Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman, this well-done film doesn't receive its due enough, in a time when films have lost what quality such films like these had."

        "review_detailed_main": "Professional assassin L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) ends up with an impromptu foster daughter when he recues Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from corrupt cops who massacre her family while searching for stolen drugs. Mathilda vows revenge and pressures Leon to teach her his deadly trade. Reno is great as the efficient but almost child-like killer, who drinks milk, cherishes his houseplant, learns to read, and ultimately ends up showing his young charge how to kill people, and Portman, who was only 12 when the film was made, is outstanding as a pubescent 'avenging angel wannabe'. On the other end of the gun barrel is Oldman's 'doped-up-psycho-cop' character, but the film has a bit of a fantasy feel to it so his sometimes screechingly over-the-top delivery works (IMO). L\u00e9on and Mathilda's off-beat, asymmetrically innocent relationship is developed beautifully and the story plays out to a great, if somewhat predictable, end. Apparently Besson's original screenplay was sort of a 'Lolita with guns', but Reno and Portman (or maybe her parents) nixed the idea of L\u00e9on becoming romantically entangled with 12 year old Mathilda and Reno was careful to play the part to minimise the chance that the audience would misinterpret the relationship. All in all, a memorable action film (with a great poster) from the '80s. Some of the stories about young Portman's introduction to the world of film make for interesting reading. Note: an extended version exists."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's like Amelie because of the 90s aura, because of the beautiful camera shots filmed in an old New York apartment that could also perfectly be in Paris, because of the colour palette used by the director, because of the amazing, memorable quotes worth keeping, because of Natalie Portman's haircut, because of the way each character is immensely unique, irreplaceable.\n\nIt's like Lolita because, well, that's kinda obvious. In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and Le\u00f3n are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Le\u00f3ns relationship: she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they say:\n\nL\u00e9on: You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda: I finished growing up, L\u00e9on. I just get older. L\u00e9on: For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up.\n\nThen it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting: Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.\n\nBut in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime: all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building? Yet it does, and it's beautiful."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the only Luc Besson film that left me feeling satisfied, I think with his previous films (Subway, La Femme Nikita) and in his two films that followed (The Fifth Element, The Messenger) he focused too much on the look and atmosphere of the film, whereas the story just seemed either too stupid or too rushed to make any sense. With Leon however, he got it right.\n\nLeon (aka The Professional) is the story of Leon (Jean Reno), a lone hit man who lives a bohemian lifestyle, moving from one low rent apartment to the next whilst making his hits. But after his twelve year old neighbour (Natalie Portman) has her family wiped out by crooked cop Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) Leon is forced to take the girl under his wing and eventually both teach the other a little something about life.\n\nLeon is a fantastic action film; it has great characters, brilliant use of mise-en-scene and a chic Eric Serra score. It also has a heart, and at times the scenes can be quite touching, \"I wanna have roots, sleep in a bed, never be alone again Mathilda\" confesses Leon as he must make an important decision.\n\nThe central message also has a lot of importance, as Stansfield says to Mathilda \"It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life\", this becomes clear for Leon, as he realises that this little girl is leading him into a situation that will be hard to get out of. I'd recommend this film to anyone, the final shoot out in the apartment is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen and the three leads (especially Reno and Oldman) are fantastic, and there's fine support from Danny Aiello as Leon's friend and advisor.\n\nLeon is a striking film too often ignored by the wannabe cinefile set who dismiss it as an exercise in style, too caught up with the likes of Goddard to expand their horizons to a new kind of film making. As action movies go, Leon is a cool, fast and unmistakably French affair... 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The story revolves around L\u00e9on, portrayed by Jean Reno, a highly skilled and solitary hitman living in New York City. When Mathilda, played by Natalie Portman, a 12-year-old girl, finds herself orphaned and seeking refuge from a dangerous situation, she crosses paths with L\u00e9on, and an unlikely bond forms between them.\n\nWhat unfolds is a compelling exploration of the connection between L\u00e9on and Mathilda as they navigate their respective worlds. Jean Reno delivers a standout performance as L\u00e9on, skillfully capturing the character's stoic demeanor and hidden vulnerability. Natalie Portman, in her debut film role, showcases remarkable talent and maturity beyond her years, breathing life into Mathilda and conveying a range of emotions.\n\nLuc Besson's direction is stylish and visually striking, creating a dark and atmospheric backdrop for the narrative. The action sequences are well-choreographed and add a thrilling element to the film. Besson also explores the psychological depth of the characters, delving into their motivations and inner conflicts.\n\n\"L\u00e9on: The Professional\" raises thought-provoking questions about morality, the nature of relationships, and the impact of one person's presence on another's life. It challenges conventional notions of good and evil, inviting viewers to ponder the complexities of human nature and the choices we make.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-balanced, combining moments of intense action with quieter, character-driven scenes. The relationship between L\u00e9on and Mathilda evolves organically, creating a sense of emotional investment and empathy for their circumstances.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Gary Oldman as a corrupt and unhinged DEA agent, adds depth and intensity to the film. Oldman's performance is particularly memorable, showcasing his ability to portray complex and menacing characters.\n\n\"L\u00e9on: The Professional\" is not without its flaws, as some may find certain aspects of the story and character dynamics challenging or uncomfortable. However, its strengths lie in its compelling performances, evocative direction, and thought-provoking themes.\n\n\"L\u00e9on: The Professional\" is a riveting and complex thriller that explores the nuances of human connection and the impact of choices made in extraordinary circumstances. With its standout performances, stylish direction, and thought-provoking themes, the film remains a notable entry in the genre and is worth experiencing for fans of intense and character-driven cinema."

But sometimes it really pays off.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that in my opinion, this was one CRAZY movie. But I guess thats why I like it so much. Not a whole lot seemed to make perfect sense, but I guess thats what they were aiming for.\n\nThe best performance by far was Jean Reno as Leon, the lonely professional hit-man, living in a run-down apartment down the hall from a dysfunctional family. Cast out in the family is Mathilda (Played by a young Natalie Portman), the 12 year old daughter who seems to be kicked around by everyone in the family except her little brother. While out shopping, Mathilda's family is killed by corrupt DEA agents, led by the completely insane Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).\n\nAmong many good performances was a unique plot, and many memorable scenes and lines. The music score really helps set the mood of each and every scene. Like I mentioned, I think this is a crazy movie so maybe thats why it stands out. You feel a bit of every emotion here as well.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Leon the professional\" is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing.\n\nThe plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.\n\nThe acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!\n\nAlso a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.\n\nTo sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film)"

It's an outcast's story focusing on a compassionate hitman whose life is turned upside down when Mathilda, a little whose family was shot and killed by the psychotic Norman Stransfield, is suddenly thrust into his life and forcing him to make a change in his blood-soaked life.\n\nIt's a very energetically directed film and this shows Luc Besson knows how to make intimate stories of redemption into something more than the sum of its parts. This film's got cinemtic references, family bonding, regret of the past, and even a little girl trying to find her place in 90s Brooklyn. It's also got some FANTASTIC action sequences too.\n\nThis would have been mundane had it been a movie from Hollywood directed by Brett Ratner or Michae Bay, and it shows that action cinema doesn't need to be beholden to action blockbuster stock characters. This is action cinema with a beating heart and a ridiculously good sense of fun.\n\nLeon's oodles of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon The Professional is purely and simply one of the best films ever made. From Natalie Portman's stunning debut performance, to Gary Oldman's absolutely nightmarish baddie, to Jean Reno's lovable and eccentric protagonist, it's a classic, a piece of achingly beautiful cinema that I could watch on the daily and never get tired of. The three actors are the bricks which make the film so special, and Luc Besson's fluid, sensitive direction is the mortar which holds them together. Portman is simply miraculous in her first film role as Matilda, a young girl whose entire family is murdered by psychotic DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Highly introverted assassin Leon (Reno), takes pity and allows the orphaned girl into his home and his life. Matilda is a strange girl whose specific idiosyncrasies both clash and amusinly interact with Leon's. He is an exile of sorts as well, with a tragic past and not a whole lot going on in his life besides the contracts he carries out for kindly, paternal mobster Tony (a phenomenal Danny Aiello). Leon and Matilda makes an interesting team; she is brash, unfiltered and lively, he is reserved, awkward and deafeningly quiet, resulting in unique character building and bonding that Besson handles wonderfully. Now, there's two versions of this film, because apparently American people can't handle slightly taboo undertones, even when they're handled in a caring and tasteful manner. You definitely want to see the longer, European cut which has some interesting scenes that crackle with sexual tension on Portman's part. Yes, she's twelve years old, at a very confusing crossroads of her life, the stark black and white mindset of a child dissolving into the very ambiguous and complex psyche of a woman. She believes she loves Leon, and he handles her advances in a way that requires maturity and intuition that he never had to begin with, but rises to the occasion. Call these scenes what you will, but there's no denying their esential place in the film's complete story, and to censor them for the sake of prudeness is a straight up crime. Matilda wants revenge against Stansfield and his team, which means going up against his wrath, and also means Portman sharing some incredible scenes with a voracious Oldman. Oh, Gary. This is his final form, the most terrifying villain in his stable, a flamboyant, deranged lunatic that one can scarce believe ever was allowed to be a cop. There's a fairy tale esque feel to the film, where the bad guys do what they want in the urban forest, never in uniform and free to roam, kill and terrorize with the full might of the NYPD at their dastardly disposal. Oldman is the Joker on mescaline, and in fact Stansfield pops mysterious pills from a little casket, when he's not murdering people while listening to Beethoven. He's loud, scary, stylish and animalistic, so intense one feels like his very presence will melt the TV screen. Portman is so superb it's hard to believe this was so early on in her career. In my mind she did her best work right out of the gate, in this film. Matilda is wise for her years, which she uses to mask the gulf of vulnerability residing in her, a hallmark trait found in children from abusive households. The family and friendship she finds with Leon strengthens her as as human being, and we start to see the emerging person she will continue to grow up to be. Natalie displays all of this uncannily well, and is the bruised, beating heart at the centre oft the film. Reno sells the eccentricities (Leon loves golden age Hollywood musicals) and sorrowful resolve of Leon so well, taking a character that is all action and very little talk, and speaking volumes with both body language and silence which, take it from me, is tough stuff. Besson, whether directing a quiet, introspective scene or a balletic action sequence, gives everything a stylized, earthy quality that makes the film stand out amongst other action ventures. You could spend a billion dollars on production design, but it all comes down to the human element behind the wheel, and if you don't have a director, cast and team that has the current running through them to create something special, all those dollars go out the window. This one has all of that, and is a solid gold classic."

Gary Oldham was the icing on the cake in this film, when he told his eventual victim that he could tell he \"didnt like \"Beethoven\", classic.I waited for a part two but am glad they didn't ruin the product by attempting to out due the original."

The plot is like a fairytale for adults, that would never happen in real life, and there aren't people who live like Leon, nor there are 12 years old girls who can come armed with two weapons into police headquarters with main goal to kill a detective. But this is a movie for god-sake, and a great one it is.\n\nIt is very sentimental, but that is just one of the parts that makes it's unique and unforgettable. Character are drawn very sharp in here and we start to care for both lead from the opening sequence of them together - that is because of performances, great and simple script and wonderful chemistry between two leads - this is still i think one of the very best performances by Natalie Portman. Directing, cinematography are great, with some clearly visible style and mood trough the film, which makes it feel like a unique - still.\n\nOverall, \"L\u00e9on\" is great action film with lots of well made sentiments. Performances are amazing by all three actors (Oldman including), but it's Natalie who steals the show. Add craftsmanship which creates this unique style, simple but sharp script and tons of sentimental moments (but not to much) and a bit coming of age story and you will get a mix of superb motion picture, a true fairytale for adults. This is a great picture. Still."

However, not many assassins (or \"cleaners\") come in the shape of 12-year-old girls.\n\nAs Mathilda and her eponymous mentor, Natalie Portman and Jean Reno give complex, sympathetic performances - at least when ranged against Gary Oldman's psycho cop. As the hit-man with a heart, Reno virtually reprises his role from director Luc Besson's Nikita, starring Anne Parillaud as, yep, another trainee hitgirl. Good ideas are worth repeating."

While biting down on the capsules he pops into his mouth prior to executing his victims, Oldman shivers, shakes, crosses his eyes, and shrieks in ways similar to a vampire preparing to sink his fangs into a jugular vein. It's an entertaining comic book performance that is perfectly in synch with a story that, no matter how grim and violent, is essentially a fantasy, one as syrupy and sentimental as an old Shirley Temple movie."

It has a great story line, Fantastic characters like Leon and Gary Oldman's Agent Stansfield and awesome action scenes like the last 20 minutes of the film. This movie is easily the best movie ever, in my opinion, and more people should of rated it higher and who ever out there who rated it only one star is a d@ck head and i hope they get eaten by a giant squid.

        "review_detailed_main": "For a movie to get an 8/10 from me it has to be brilliant. For 9/10 it has to be exceptional. What more can I say about Leon which gets a resounding 10/10? It is without doubt one of my top 5 movies of all time. High praise indeed! Setting aside all the 'arty-fartyness' of the quality of the cinematography, the lighting, acting and directing etc, the fact is it's just a brilliant story. Luc Besson and his cast couldn't possibly have put it across any better hence the 10/10 from me. Yes it is quite a violent movie in parts, and 'shoot em up movies' with lots of blood and gore aren't my preferred genre on the whole. But the balance struck in this movie is perfect. Let's face it, you couldn't make a movie about a wet boy without showing some violence. But so many directors could have gone overboard with that side of things. Instead of which Monsieur Besson and his merry band of players stops well short of unnecessary violence. It's a love story without sex, a comedy without banana skins, a drama without over-dramatisation, and above all else it's a heart warming story of a shy and in many ways insecure man taking care of a young girl living in an abusive family environment. Thankfully not once does the viewer read anything into the relationship between the man and the young girl other than what is there, i.e. mutual respect and friendship. The outro music (\"Shape Of My Heart\" by Sting) was not written for the movie specifically, but never fails to brings a lump to my throat each time I see Leon. Enrich your life, watch Leon!"

Go watch the Prestige or The pianist if you want a movie that is really worth it's 8.5 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leon / The Professional is an outstanding movie!\n\nA question arose as I watched the \"charades\" scene today. Mathilda came to Leon with nothing more than the clothes on her back, and yet she had lingerie to pose as Madonna? I wondered whether the bra & panties may have been left in the \"furnished\" apartment by a previous tenant. Then I arched another eyebrow when Mathilda appeared with a \"Marilyn\" white halter dress, that just happened to be the perfect size for a 12-year-old girl?\n\nOne might speculate that she retrieved clothes from her old apartment, but that seems implausible. Consider this: Shortly after Mathilda moved in with Leon, the pair moved to another apartment. The charades scene precedes the scene where Mathilda visits her old apartment. Are we to believe that Mathilda was able to access a guarded apartment twice after they moved?\n\nJust thought I'd pose the question- I'm no continuity expert, and I've been willing to suspend belief the other 200 times I've watched this excellent film."

Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor who is sometimes overlooked in the commercial aspect of actors. His role in L\u00e9on truly shows the depth of his acting. Be sure to check out the film True Romance, another great movie, which Oldman's character has a short run, but displays his great ability for taking on any role and giving it his all. Overall this movie is one of Luc's best with a similar taste from Point Of No Return. Thanks to all the writers, directors, producers and cast for giving us such great entertainment. Thanks to IMDB.com for all the great resources you have.\n\nGary / Music Station"

        "review_title": "French charm and bloody deaths - perfect mix",
        "review_detailed_main": "The movie Leon is truly one of the best things I have ever watched. A legendary Luc Besson's picture. Even thought it was released in 1994 it is still as topical and urgent as at the first screening in cinema. An incredible criminal thriller about a mastership of the murder, unexpected accidental meeting and an amazing pure love between two opposites.\n\nHow can a professional killer fall in love with a little girl, whose family was killed? Well, Leon, an expert killer, whose life is nothing more but completing one 'order' after another one, played by an unsurpassed Jean Reno, didn't expect this to happen as well. His routine was monotonous when Natalie Portman in a role of a 12 years old Mathilda appeared in his doorway. And this acquaintance changed his priorities and life.\n\nThe best part of the movie is its atmosphere and aesthetic of The Little Italy in New York, mafia and dirty cops, muted colors and Sting's song during the titles, which is still inimitable to these days. Moreover, the French charm and criminal cruel scenes are looking surprisingly good together. There are many details in this movie that made people who didn't even watch the scene like it. One of the main one of them is Mathilda's outfit with red beanie, khaki jacket, black round glasses, which became an inspiration for many members of teenage subcultures.\n\nWhat has to be also mentioned, people love to watch films based on easy basic concepts. The whole movie is a game of contrasts and incompatibilities. A grown man and a little girl, a killer and a blameless child, guns and kids, murders and a friendship, immortal love and death. This whole movie is a confrontation of black and white. That is also its secret of an unfading success.\n\nSumming up, I can't think of anything bad about this movie or things I don't like, so I am just going to say that this movie is amazing and everybody who hasn't watched it yet should do this and those who has already seen it can rewatch it again because it is worth it."

        "review_title": "One of the most under appreciated films of all time",
        "review_detailed_main": "Luc Besson (Transporter, Taken, The Fifth Element) directs the intense visceral and compelling action/drama of Leon, released in the USA as The Professional. It could be called as a karate kid film...except with guns and assassins. I was left wondering to myself at the end why wasn't this film given even one nomination in direction or acting. Now it is considered as one of the best films ever made and is currently at the time of writing this review sitting at #25 in IMDb's top 250 list. At the very least it is one of the finest cinematic experience of the 1990's.\n\nLeon is a \"cleaner\" or a hit-man living in Little Italy. He has learned to suppress emotions and feelings and lives his life in a little apartment working for Tony, a mob boss. His life is turned around when 12 year old Mathilda who lives on the same floor and has been recently orphaned comes to him for help. Leon grudgingly helps her at first but soon discovers his own inner child.\n\nAll the scenes are shot beautifully and the action sequences are well planned. The score works well with the film. The acting is superb especially from Natalie Portman who played young Mathilda in her debut film at just the age of 13. She displays her emotions well with her body behavior and immaculate expressions. She was born with the talent. Jean Reno (Pink Panther, The Da Vinci Code) does a good role as Leon, the mentally slow and emotionally dumb hit-man for whom you start to feel. Making someone feel for a hit-man is certainly not easy. Danny Aiello as Tony also gives a good performance and delivers as required.\n\nGary Oldman does such an intense, quirky, interesting and terrifying role as the corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination. He gives an absolutely electrifying performance and the fact that he improvised one of the best scenes in the film proves his acting chops.\n\nThe film is not for the fainthearted and the action never feels to be artificial or deliberate. The story, while basic, incorporates all the elements for an interesting 2 hours. It's a cinematic success about innocence destroyed and innocence reborn. The cast show that there is no substitute for good acting and you don't need special effects to make a good action film. While the accolades are missing, Leon-the professional is definitely a cult classic."

The film is very well shot and scored, and this, coupled with the performances by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, serves as the movie's highlights. Danny Aiello also does a nice job with Tony's character. However, the basis for the story is too unrealistic. Yes, shady cops exist; however, they don't just get to murder entire families without consequences. It tries too hard to make Gary Oldman's character seem completely insane. He has a very overstated performance. This is what breaks the film for me. It's a good movie to watch with your girlfriend, but very far from cinematic excellence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not every day you see a film that shows, as its opening credits, the actors who star in it, the composer of its score and its writer and director. Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's \"L\u00e9on\". Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.\n\nTaking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after \"L\u00e9on\", all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director.\n\n\"L\u00e9on\" is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though \"Le grand bleu\" takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man L\u00e9on (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job.\n\nThe style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from \"Nikita\") putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character.\n\nYou see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and/or psychological disorders: he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like \"Singing in the rain\". His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie \"Danny the Dog\", shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.\n\nThe other relationship Besson writes and details in \"L\u00e9on\" is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in \"The Piano\") that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being.\n\nI want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so L\u00e9on can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then L\u00e9on does John Wayne.\n\nThis is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's L\u00e9on is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living.\n\nIn that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves.\n\nThe movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like \"Le grand bleu\") and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his."

The problem is that this is not a sci fi movie. These are things that are necessary for a crime movie, especially of this nature. This is not the matrix or some sort of martial arts film. It is a organized crime/hitman movie. And in these movies you expect things to be realistic and believable, not overdramatized and downright silly. And thats what this movie is. It is ridiculously unrealistic and just ludicrous. Nothing in it is believable or makes sense. And I am not talking about in an artistic cinematic way either. I'm talking about the way in which you'd expect a movie to look if it was made by a teenager. This movie seems like it was made my someone who doesn't know anything about organized crime, or the real world, or film making.

Cleaner which also at the start is used ironically.\n\nLuc Besson does a great job to pay attention to all details, and he leaves little space for errors in acting.

Girl teams up with the assassin to take the revenge. Now, the assassin here is 50+ played by famous Spanish actor Jean Reno, the girl is in her teens played by Oscar winner Natalie Portman and police officer is Gary Oldman who always enjoys himself so much when it comes to negative roles.\n\nLeon's strength lies in the unusual cracking chemistry between Jean and Natalie. Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer.\n\nOnly false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.\n\nI am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional. Watch it for its apt cast, great acting, super dialogs and highly emotional, intense, beautiful and subtle moments."
