        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nWhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it's just horrible. It's not \"so bad it's good\", its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.\n\nHave you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.\n\nYou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Don't. Please don't. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those that think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it."

The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE. If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, Don't buy it. It will just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it.

What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: \"Knock Knock\", \"Who's there?\", \"The big stinking man\", \"The big stinking man who?\", \"The big stinking man - is YOU!\". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like \"The Fast and the Furious\" and not a \"no-budget\" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push."

They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay, who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.\n\nOverall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says \"Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in....\"\n\nMy response is always \"Well now you can\""

The situation was utterly ridiculous and the lines were so unfunny I actually felt sad for the actors. Perhaps it was my VCR that made the picture of the film look sloppy but it seemed like it was filmed as a high school project rather than by professional adults.\n\nI was glad when I saw the review of others that I was not alone in panning this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a \"movie\"! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is \"no-budget\" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line \"Take my wife, please\" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in \"Billy Madison,\" the midget in \"Happy Gilmore's\" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in \"Mixed Nuts.\" Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (\"Titanic\") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the \"Rocky\" movies) has a significant role.\n\nThis awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so.\n\nMy score: 3 (out of 10)"

Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see.

It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.\n\n86 mins. rated R for Language."

His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the film's \"jokes\" come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandler's career. Pass this one up at the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time."

I don't disagree with many of the criticisms this film gets - but I don't think it's as bad and devoid of merit as it's caricatured and regarded to be. The setting of a cruise ship is always alluring and glamorous and seductive and pleasing to the eye - as are the girls. True, more (i.e. something) could have been done with the Miss Universe beauty pageant sideplot; not least because Adam Sandler as an aspiring comedian isn't very interesting ... or even convincing. As a protagonist he doesn't win my sympathy at all (he's just as unfunny and undeserving of stage time as the antagonist comic he replaces). Nonetheless, at least the movie HAS a plot, as stupid and uninspired and bare-bones as it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering that Adam Sandler was young and inexperienced, I guess you can't fault him too much for appearing in this terrible film. The amazing thing, however, is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a stand-up comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as well--yet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally, the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.\n\nThe film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly, no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time, he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character, actually, as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants, though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countries--but often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries, let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally, the ladies have no charisma or personalities--they are just eye candy--just bodies to jiggle past the screen.\n\nSo, we have semi-sexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids--this is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name \"Shecky Moskowitz\". Wow, that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs, such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh, and if you are wondering, I did really enjoy many of his films (such as REIGN ON ME, WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER). I just marvel, however, at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.\n\nGiving a film a 1, for me, is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score, as it is unlikable, cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb."

If you even think of getting this movie out do the world a favour and donate the cost of the rental to the red cross as you would be going the movie world a true injustice should you support this movie in any form what so ever, o how I wish I had been warned earlier."

I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I'd stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in May of 1989, this $200,000 comedy farce is really only notable for being the first feature film to star future A-list funny man, Adam Sandler. But before he matured, or was even cast as a player in Saturday Night Live, he starred as a struggling comic onboard a cruise. After his recent string of uninspired, unfunny cash-grabs, it's easy to forget Sandler was once a hilarious comic with some truly great material... sadly however, we get almost none of that in this sorry excuse for a film. Instead, he puts on stupid voices, mugs for the camera, and generally acts like an incompetent goof for the majority of the 97 minute film. The supporting cast includes Tom Hodges, Scott LaRose, Billy Zane, and Billy Bob Thorton - none of whom are the slightest bit memorable. The story plods along to the incessant sounds of a steal drum calypso, bland jazz, and cheap Muzak, also the actual presentation style is curious and inconsistent.\n\nSandler himself breaks the fourth wall to introduce us to the story, immediately apologizing for its \"no budget\", and then he's shelping the viewer around boat like we're watching his personal vlog. But other sequences are conventionally shot, and edited for some reason - I hesitate to guess what director Valerie Breiman was possibly thinking. The lethargic and pointless narrative is worsened by constantly cutting away to Miss Universal confessionals, ridiculous dream sequences, and Burt Young as General Noriega who is actually watching the film itself on VHS, who defends his honor by shouting at the TV, \"We'll see who gets the last laugh, you left over worthless kangaroo vomit!\" Besides being awfully paced, the R-rated movie is really quite uncomfortable and awkward... every scene plays out three times longer than it needs to, almost as if they were deliberately padded so the picture could qualify for \"feature length\". With unrealistic dialogue, and empty characters - this film is devoid of conflict and tension, making it at true struggle to actually sit through. It's no surprise this film presently sits in IMDb's bottom-10 rated movies of all time... it is just so painfully boring, I regretted watching literally every scene. \"Going Overboard\" is a \"Terrible. Not even enjoyable ironically.\" With no redeeming qualities and nary a single laugh whatsoever, it's a wonder Sandler actually managed to have a successful career after piece of GARBAGE."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am going to offer a statement up front as a prologue for this review- I like Adam Sandler. I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.\n\nAdam Sandler's first film, \"Going Overboard\", was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.\n\nAnd today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.\n\nThe film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the \"camera\", or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural.\n\nThe comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the \"villainous\" character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background. It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.\n\nThe acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, \"Dickie Diamond\" is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.\n\nThe direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.\n\nReally, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through. It's literally painful to watch.\n\nI have to give this a 1 out of 10, and that's coming from a Sandler fan. It isn't the worst movie ever made... but it's up (or rather, down) there.\n\nEDIT: (June 8th) I have watched another half hour of the film. My review still stands as is."

Still, there's nothing wrong with that, i was expecting him to make a joke about it.\n\nSo if nothing else, watch this for adam, and the 2 cuban guys. No one else in the movie can act, and i think they did it that way on purpose.\n\nI don't hate this movie at all, in fact, i own it, and i watched it again last night.\n\nBilly Bob Thorton even makes an appearance, along with billy zane and as i said before, allen covert, who was probably unknown then.\n\nbut i do love allen covert. and adam. . .and seeing adam in his eaaaaarly days is refreshing.\n\nSo see this, at least once. Don't watch it expecting a very enjoyable sandler film. watch it expecting to see what you hear adam tell you your gonna see in the first 5 minutes.\n\nto all those people who think this is just a HORRIBLE movie. . .well duh, it was MENT to be. adam tells you its gonna be.\n\nSadly, this move is NOT listed on adam sandler's websight. guess he's ashamed of it or something, i dunno why he would be, maybe cause of his shorts. . ..\n\nanyway, be sure to check this out, but don't watch it in a serious fashion, be light hearted. . ."

Even awful movies I usually watch until the end, but we had to stop it a little over halfway through because it was just THAT BAD. Especially when Adam Sandler was the star, that hurts to say, but not as much as this movie hurt our brains.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Going Overboard\" is a comedy that is part campy, part raunchy, a tad bit exploitative, and completely unfunny. It has the distinction of being Adam Sandler's first film ever, not just his first film where he had the leading role. Unfortunately, it is also Sandler's worst film.\n\nThe only reason you would probably know about this movie is because it received a very wide video release in the mid 1990's, after Sandler had become a breakout star of \"Saturday Night Live\". Today, even though his current movies haven't received the greatest of reviews, he's still a bona-fide movie star, and among the most successful former SNL stars in the show's history. This movie shows, however, that at the age of 22, he still had some work to do.\n\nIf there's any reason to sit through this 97-minute movie that feels a hell of a lot longer, it's to see how Sandler started out as a young, struggling comedian. He obviously took his prior experiences in bombing in clubs, and made his character, Schecky Moskowitz, who is probably not all that different from Sandler himself, a bit more poignant.\n\nHowever, the rest of the film is draggy, uneven, and really unfunny. The story is scattered and one-dimensional, the subplots feel contrived and out of place, and almost everyone in this movie seems as though they try way too hard for a laugh, including Sandler. In fact, it makes no sense that Sandler's character, as a cruise ship waiter, envies the cruise's comedian, Dickie Diamond (Scott LaRose), when he isn't really all that funny.\n\nThe only really good scene is when Sandler, struggling to make his cruise audience laugh, spontaneously meets Milton Berle, who plays himself. I also liked the addition of a laughing track when Berle told his jokes. Ironically enough, it seemed as though the movie did not try as hard to make you laugh when the laughing track played.\n\nThe only other big star the movie managed to get at the time was Burt Young, who plays General Noriega from a country in central America despite not looking Hispanic at all. It's also obvious that his scenes were shot long after the filming on a cruise ship was complete.\n\nThere are also some appearances in this movie from then-unknown actors who made it big later, such as Peter Berg, Billy Zane, and (perhaps most surprising) Billy Bob Thornton. Fortunately, they would go on to do bigger and better movies.\n\nIf there is only one reason to see \"Going Overboard\", it's to show that when it comes to show business, especially comedy, you have to start somewhere. Sandler still had a long way to go in finding his comedic persona. Fortunately, he still comes off as likable in this movie. It's just too bad that the rest of the film could not quite catch up.\n\nSo \"Going Overboard\" is a big miss. Its story and its comedy needed some major work. It being a \"no-budget\" movie, as Sandler puts it in the beginning when he breaks the fourth wall, is no excuse."

I honestly think that if you made a movie starring Jaleel White, Chris Klein and Jose Canseco, and have it written by a blind man who has lost his hearing, you'd still get 5 stars above this movie. I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie as bad as this one. Terrible acting, terrible taste, no plot, no storyline, just ewww...I just can't believe this was approved. I really think I'd rather fly across the country to go see the 3 Ninjas Film Festival then watch this movie in the comfort of my own home. I apologize for being so negative, but this movie is an absolute disgrace."

I did laugh ... yes, when i was thinking about what they were going through when filming this bilge and billy Zane's role as 'Captain Neptune', what the hell is that all about anyway. None the less there are parts of this film you will be thinking what on earth were they thinking and begin to chuckle. The worst part of it is the comedian on the boat, he spends most of times swearing and people laugh because they think its funny, i laugh because he is trying so hard to be funny that he just makes a fool out of himself (same goes for the rock star guy). i only paid 1 pound for this, i wasn't expecting much as id already read some reviews on here beforehand. Its not good and its not the worst film ever (herc in new york), so if you want to see what Adam Sander had to do to make a few bucks before he made it big then check this out."

I have never and will never watch it again however. I don't think you can even pick those yellow stars unless you have seen this movie. People need to understand what the worst is to guage the best...lol. It always comes up in movie conversations and I love reading the reviews on this movie.

As for the plot you shouldn't try to follow along. It's a cheesy 80's flick with some funny moments, nice eye candy and cool cameos.\n\nThis movie is actually pretty funny.

But his efforts are hampered by the obnoxious jerk currently providing the laughs, terrorists working for General Noriega, some Australian bimbo, evil flashbacks of his mother, and a whole lot of other bizarre happenings. How can this be bad?\n\nAdam Sandler is a great comedian and he would eventually hit his stride with films like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, but what we have here is a disjointed mess of potentially good gags and characters ruined by horrible acting and an even worse script. Sandler trademarks such as the numerous flat characters which contribute many of the best lines in his latter films and the silly dream sequences and non-sequesters abound, but they just don't mesh together in any sort of funny or cohesive way.\n\nGoing Overboard was Adam Sandler's first foray into feature length film and an absolutely dismal attempt at that. This movie is so mind numbingly bad its not even funny because of it, its just plain sad to deal with and even die hard Sandler fans will struggle to last the full run time. What a waste."

And sometimes I like to watch a terrible movie just for laughing at his inanity. But unfortunately, this was NOT the case. This movie really bored me to the point that I wanted to left it, but since it's not fair to dish a movie entirely after leaving it, I stuck with it.\n\nThe movie is set on a cruise ship. Adam Sandler plays a lowly waiter and is badly treated by almost everyone. This already makes the viewer sad and it makes you wonder if there are any other characters that suffer this type of abuses (even in real life). At the same time he is envious of a comedian that works on the ship that is painfully unfunny (and I am not joking, he looks even WORSE than Larry the Cable Guy) and it makes you wonder if the guy was crass and obnoxious just on purpose. As for the other members of the cast, we have Burt Young as a general that watches the movie on his TV, Billy Zane as King Neptune, a pointless bit role by a then-unknown Billy Bob Thornton and various beauty pageants with the same amount of personality of a door-knob!\n\nSo, the movie consists of comedians so unfunny that you'll rather hear dogs barking Jingle Bells for a year straight, paper-thin plot, and semi-naked ladies that pass on the screen from time to time. This makes it for one of the dullest movies of all time. But at least this proves that debuting with a God-awful movie doesn't necessarily destroy your career. Adam Sandler debuted with this and he managed to star in good movies such as 50 FIRST DATES, BIG DADDY and CLICK; tho he has also other bombs in his career such as JACK AND JILL (now in the Bottom 100), GROWN UPS 2 and THE RIDICOLOUS SIX.\n\nHowever, I knew that GOING OVERBOARD was bad, but I wasn't expecting THIS level of awfulness! This movie truly deserves all the hate since is cheaply made (with camera work so shoddy that it can give you a migraine), boring, badly acted and unfunny. It's no surprise that this movie has a score of 1,8 and it's among the lowest rated movies on IMDB."

Adam Sandler is 23 years old in this movie and it was 2 years before his SNL time. So I think with the material he had, and everything, that its pretty nice work :) You don't want to expect too much from this movie, cause than you probably wont like it, but by my personal thoughts I think its exactly what I expected of it :) Not everything goes in a straight line but that doesn't always have to be like that. It was funny in his own weird way, But funny though :P So when your going to watch it, don't pay to much attention to the background and acting skills of some people. Just sit back relax and watch laugh and watch more :P"

I wont ramble on for too long about this complete and utter waste of money but i recommend if you see this film in your collection hide it or chuck it out honestly i found this film that bad. I'm glad to see Adam sandler has made far better films than this since such as Big Daddy, thankfully they didn't follow this. On IMDb I'm usually quite generous to films upping their scores to what i think is more than deserved in many cases. 1 is all this film deserves. Adam sandler contributes a truly horrible performance and i really find it remarkable 140 people have given this a 10 ????????? each to there own but the only thing i can say is my 22 year old bro recently broke his leg and started to watch this, after 10 minutes he was watching The day after tomorrow, all that needs to be said."

I have recently written a letter to Mr. Sandler demanding my dollar back as well as another $10 in compensation for the hour of my life he took from me as well as pain and suffering.\n\nAnybody who wants to say that this movie is so bad that it is good, is out of their mind. This movie has entrenched itself very firmly in the traditional bad category. Production value sucked, Adam Sandler apparently had not figured out how to be funny yet.\n\nThis film is a train wreck comparable to watching a 12 year old on a webcam trying to recite Shakespeare monologues, but not being able to pronounce or even clearly read the lines, much less act them out. Even worse, You would have to sit through an hour of that kid doing this. Maybe you could laugh it off for the first 5 minutes, but for the next 55 minutes there is nothing left except the pain your eyes and ears must endure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Since my freshman year of high school, I have been one of the world's biggest fans of Adam Sandler and his work. I heard his first CD and from then on, I was hooked. So naturally, when I heard for the first time that he was starring in his own movie (Billy Madison), I got all my high school friends together, and we all went to the theater to see it. I loved it and was forever hooked on everything Adam. I collected every film I had ever seen him in for years to come; First on videotape, then later, on DVD. Then I found a website called IMDb.com where I copied a list of every motion picture he had been involved in (Producer, Actor, even Cameos), and proceeded to complete my collection. This brought me across a movie entitled Going Overboard. After purchasing the movie at a 2nd hand video store, I sat down and was subjected to the smelliest piece of cinematic excrement since Rubberface, to which I think this movie holds more than one similarity. The movie assaults the viewer with dull comedy which is apparently supposed to be funny because it is so bad. In my opinion, a good comedy needs no plot, or maybe more accurately if your situations and characters are funny enough, it doesn't matter what your plot is. (For an example check out Harold and Kumar go to White Castle or \"Dude, Where's My Car?\".) This movie's plot would have done just fine had the comedy been there to back it up. However, as it is, the ridiculous plot is actually dragged further into the abyss by the awful one liners delivered by the finest comedian of our generation. In my opinion, it is a shame that Sandler didn't have the sense to pass on this opportunity. In his defense however, if you had a chance to star in a full length motion picture, no matter how crappy the script, could you pass it up?"

I like pretty girls in bikinis just as much as the next guy, but I really dislike it when they are put in a film without having any sort of purpose.

I have also had the pleasure of viewing some of Adam Sandler's most popular films. And I can honestly say (and I'm getting very emotional as I type this) that Going Overboard is perhaps the best film I've seen and probably will see. I've heard so many bad reviews on this film. Most of which were incredibly harsh and cruel. How can a complete MORON hate one single scene in this magnificent film? I dare...no..I CHALLENGE you to find another film that comes even CLOSE to the wonder that is Going Overboard. Keep in mind that I've seen just about every other Adam Sandler movie and this one is far superior to Happy Gilmore. In fact, it makes all of his other films look like crap! Heck, it even makes Avatar look like crap!!! I challenge James Cameron to even ATTEMPT to match this movie. I wouldn't even try if I were him because it would just be hopeless. Overall, I was honored to have seen this film. It was every bit as funny and as clever as Caddyshack or any other comedy. Why it wasn't nominated for any awards is beyond me. It deserved way more awards than The Dark Knight I can tell you that much. You, as a human being, owe it to yourself to view/own this movie. I PROMISE YOU it will be worth your time and money. God bless the director, actors, and everyone involved in this film. You all hold a special place in my heart.\n\nPS: If you believed any of this review then you have severe brain damage. This is quite possibly the worst film ever made and I beg you to stay away from it."

The 97 minutes that I spent watching this movie were torturous. Turns out that this was Sandler's first starring role in a film, and after having seen it, I'm more than a little shocked that he was ever given another opportunity. I mean sure, I only spent five bucks on it, but I couldn't help but think of all the better things I could have used that fiver on. Maybe a foot-long sandwich at Subway. Perhaps I could have given it to the bell-ringing Santa that had been standing in front of the entrance, even though his breath smelled like a combination of beer and Cheetos. In retrospect I think the five-spot would have even been better used as a Kleenex instead of using it on this movie. Avoid it at all costs. This movie earns its title as the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Consider yourself warned."

It was so bad, that I couldn't watch the whole movie in one piece. I saw it in two pieces, and still found it difficult to keep watching.\n\nThe only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because there is a rock song in the movie that wasn't so bad (although very bad play-backed), otherwise there is no reason to give this movie a star at all.\n\nIf you want to see a movie from the IMDb bottom 100, have a try, but otherwise please stay away from it.

What I mean is, I understand Adam Sandler in his first movie, okay I get that. But what about Peter Berg, Billy Zane, Milton Berle, and last but not least a cameo by Billy Bob Thorton?? Strange but true...I don't get it. Also, what is with Rocky's manager as Manuel Noriega?? This whole casting process, and plot were just off. There was also the guy that is in all of Adam Sandler's movies as the bartender as well. Someone must have either a extremely strange sense of humor, or just plain crazy."

But if actors want to improve their craft based on constructive criticism: stop doing the stupid voices. It isn't funny. How studios back some movies, one can only guess. This movie is one of five that I just stopped watching because it was just that bad. Sadly, this is the only \"comedy\" I have turned off 15 minutes in (I waited 20 minutes for Date Movie).

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Adam Sandler but it's hard to believe he became such a success today when his early career was like this. It really is not his fault though, it's just simply down to bad writing. Stupid, horrible, delusional writing. This movie could probably be seen as 'The Young Ones on a Cruise' but even the Young Ones were funnier than this. This really is not a comedy. A Comedy makes you laugh or maybe even smirk. This film is more of a.... torture device. The Characters were bland, the story didn't make sense, the directing was absolutely shocking and the person who wrote this should be assassinated.

He keeps talking directly to the camera, turning it into one of those (The main character knows this is a movie, movies), which I think is an ineffective comedy tactic.

Other scenes that are out of place include a surreal dream sequence with Schecky and Dickie Diamond, a scene where Schecky and Bob break into song for no good reason, and Billy Zane's appearance as King Neptune.\n\nIf there are any bright spots, they'd be the willingness of the movie to poke fun at itself at times, Scott LaRose's vulgar turn as Dickie Diamond, a foul-mouthed comedian with a taste for incest jokes, and a cameo by Milton Berle.\n\nPay attention or you might miss them: Allen Covert as a bartender and Billy Bob Thornton as \"Dave\" , a rude audience member.\n\nOverall: A not so funny comedy. If you're interested in seeing Sandler's early work, watch it. If you're looking for laughs, this movie probably isn't for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I might as well briefly explain what I enjoyed about the film to get it out of the way. For one, I enjoyed the two terrorists who were sent to board the ship as they seemed to be having a lot of fun. Also, I'm generally a sucker for dreams, hallucinations, and other scenes which occur in a character's head and, while those scenes weren't great per se, I enjoyed a couple shots in them, like the overhead shot of Sandler in a straight jacket and the darkness surrounding the boxing ring. Finally, I suppose it was cool how the frame narrative was occurring at the same time as the seemingly present day cruise ship scenes. That's about all I can say about this film though as I disliked just about everything else. Bad comedy films usually have a few jokes here and there which I find clever, but virtually every single joke in this film missed the mark for me and made little to no sense. The few jokes which did make sense weren't particularly clever and were below average or competent at best. Given the opening scene, the film is clearly aware that it's a bad comedy film, but this scene actually does the film more harm than good. We're clearly asked to root for Shecky, but since his jokes are just as bad as Dickie's, it makes it hard to care about his outcome. In addition, virtually every single actor in this film (Adam Sandler, included) lacked charisma, minus the aforementioned two terrorists. I would've been fine if everyone gave hammy, over-the-top performances as this might've gotten a few laughs out of me, but virtually everyone here didn't seem to be having any fun, nor did they appear to be into the film. Finally, with the exception of a few shots I mentioned up above, the camerawork wasn't that good either. The (unintentional?) Dutch angles looked godawful, some of the camera angles were so poor it was difficult to follow scenes of characters simply moving around, and the chase scene at the end was overlong and humdrum (Sandler changing his shirt in the middle of it was nice though). So yeah, just a really awful movie which is a strong contender for the worst film I've ever seen."

He gets all his old buddies and make a movie based on a stupid 1 page plot or a bought 60s script for cheap, then he set the movie where he planned to spend his next vacation..a waterpark in Hawaii or something, then he gets all the sponsors he can muster so the movie becomes a 90min long commercial.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not really sure how I ended up on the Going Overboard page here on IMDb - but I decided to read all the comments after I saw it was on the Bottom 100 films. I had remembered hearing this film was AWFUL but after reading comment after comment about this being the worst film EVER - well - I just HAD to see it. Luckily Netflix has it on Instant Queue...time to see how awful it is!!!!!! Of course this is EARLY Sandler - early around is his time on the awesome Ken Ober show Remote Control on MTV. And from the git you know the film has NO budget - they are making a film based on what they have with no real script to speak of. For some odd reason - while I think the film does move kinda slow - I do find parts of it quite funny.\n\nThere's a great cast - as most people mention. I'm not sure how they got Burt Young or Milton Burle. Of course the rest are very young in the film: Billy Bob Thornton had just moved to L.A. a couple years before and was taking any roles he could get. Billy Zane and Peter Berg get to join the fun - as does frequent Sandler collaborators Allan Covert & Steven Brill. I found it GREAT that Sandler's best friend on the boat was Tiny from Revenge of the Nerds 2. God bless you Tom Hodges! Anywho Sandler is a very young guy working on a bad cruise line. He's very awkward, not happy with his job as a waiter, and dreams of being a comedian. The comedian onboard is a hairy, loud guy who Sandler abhors. He mopes around the ship trying to raise his confidence by talking with his friends.\n\nNOW - I've been on cruises - I think the creepiest part of this film is Sandler moping around looking at couples as they kiss. Of course the character is 'sad' - but if I was on a cruise ship and saw this mopey waiter lurking around eyeballing the guests I would report him. That's just me - but then again I'm trying to analyze Going Overboard as most others have - which is probably the downfall.\n\nIs the movie bad? Sure. But as someone who has watched LEGIONS of bad movies I really think this isn't too bad. It's great to see this early collab of Sandler, Covert, and Brill - and fun to see other Hollywood greats like Thornton and Berg so young. If you go in expecting Billy Madison or any Sandler past 1994 you will surely be disappointed. Actually...if you are MOST people you'll be disappointed. For me? It's no Mr. T in The Toughest Man in the World - but then again what is???"

It was rated 1.8! So we thought this will be quite funny to watch.\n\nThe film is about Schecky Moskowitz (Adam Sandler) who wants to be a stand up comedian, but he can't become one because he works on a boat and nobody! will give him a chance on stage.\n\nThe film shows Schecky Moskowitz trying to write jokes and become a successful comedian\u0085.on a boat. I'm not going to lie this film isn't amazing but, I do recommend to go to TESCO and buy it for one pound, or rent it if you want to see a young Adam Sandler doing his first film and you may as well see it if you are an Adam Sandler fan. We rated the film a 4 because we did get an odd laugh now and then, which is the odd thing because it's mostly the hidden jokes which gave us the laughs."

The irony is that not only is it the routine that Schecky himself picks up as a comic within this \"film\", but also exactly what Sandler's routine has turned into in real life and in the rest of his meritless filmography. The overuse of the same jokes with no payoffs and its eerie similarities to the other films in Sandler's career (despite him not being a producer/director on this) is just a testament to his consistent mediocrity. He has not progressed as an actor or comedian in any way since this disaster, and anything that he's in that happens to be good is because of the director or its premise (Punch Drunk Love for example makes a mockery/parody of Sandler's personality in a satirical way that totally works).\n\nHow Sandler's career picked up after this is a total mystery. The guy is talentless. Utterly and pathetically talentless."

The movie is particularly funny every noun and then and the jokes that are not hilarious are just funny and sadly some were not funny at all but it does not matter cause their funny jokes are more often. I think Adam Sandler did a very good job as the waiter and the bit where the plot gets so out of hand is just so damn funny ( last 5 minutes) and the bit where he is explaining how the earthquake cost them no money was also in the good jokes section. Also the terrorists are funny as well but sadly do not play a huge part in this funny, funny film. Overall fans of Adam Sandler will enjoy this film as it is first movie and you can really see how he became as funny as he is. I rate this film 54% for keeping me amused while being pretty hit and miss. So grab some mates and grab some beers and just watch a good movie starring Adam Sandler as his good old self. GO ADAM SANDLER AND THE WHOLE CREW IN THIS GREAT FILM YOU GUYS ROCK. Also to those out there who do not like this movie I think it is because you were expecting too much out of Adam Sandler's first movie cause in my opinion it is not as good as his other stuff but is definitely better then a lot of other comedy's out there and I even think it is funnier then Click ( not really but probably 3 quarters there. Thats my 2 cents from LacTheBod. I do not know maybe one day this will be respected as it is meant to be, as a comedy just made to introduce Adam Sandler to it's expecting audience. If you did not like this you have to high a standards as it is better then some new movies out there."

I watched it with a friend a while back and then tried to rewatch it with a different friend this time\n\nHe said please shut it off in the saddest tone I've ever heard about 10 minutes in\n\nI have finished this movie before but this movie is worse than anything I have ever, it is vile, it is not funny, it is torture\n\n0/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "We know that Adam Sandler can genuinely act when he wants to. We know, despite abundant evidence to the contrary, that he can be funny when he wants to be. Yet how his career ever survived this movie is a great mystery. If I were a less generous person I'd have shut the movie off before the opening credits finished rolling, and it was only a masochistic sense of commitment that allowed me to continue watching with each subsequent and very frequent urge to give up. Rare, fleeting, infinitesimal fragments of cleverness are far outnumbered and overwhelmed, and forgotten as quickly as they come and go, in the midst of unending, unfunny, tiresome crassness, boorishness, anatomical and gross-out jokes, sex jokes, toilet humor, sexism and male gaze (women in this are nothing but meat for male consumption), and the insistent choice of breaking the fourth wall. Every now and again a line or gag comes close to earning a smile, but the good feeling fades so swiftly that one is forced to wonder if it was ever there to begin with, and this is to say nothing of jokes that punch down, that haven't aged well, and which were never appropriate in the first place, or bits that are drawn out for far too long. Frankly, I thought I was aware of what I was getting into when I sat to watch 'Going overboard,' and still I'm astounded by just how incredibly, peerlessly dull and obnoxious it is.\n\nThere is no entertainment to be had here. Absolutely none, zero, zilch, nada. There might have been one or two points where it was so awful that it almost inspired mocking laughter, but that was the nearest it came to inspiring anything that could be described as positive feelings. I've never previously come across the name of writer and director Valerie Breiman, and after this I'll make a point to avoid anything else she's been involved with; likewise for credited co-writer Scott Larose. (There's no need to make extra effort to avoid Sandler's films, I pretty much gave up on his \"comedy\" years ago.) Any compliments that might have been reserved for the cast, or for the contributions of those operating behind the scenes, are obliterated in the face of what Breiman and Sandler would purport to give us. For all those pictures that are referred to as among \"the worst ever made,\" I often find myself incredulous, for they are nowhere near the bottom of the barrel that I've witnessed time and again. In this case, I'm shocked beyond belief that the same label hasn't been more commonly appended to 'Going overboard,' because this is desperately, atrociously tasteless, witless, simple-minded, low, shallow, uninteresting, and downright vacuous. I don't know if I should feel bad for those who got roped into this, or despise them for agreeing to participate. I do feel bad for the kitten that shows up for a few seconds though - they deserved more time on-screen, in any other movie.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you are, or what your preferences are. I have to assume that even those who are diehard fans of Sandler, who find to be riotous those later features of his that are otherwise routinely lambasted, would be appalled at just how feeble and wearisome this is. Even if you're a fan of someone on hand, there is no reason whatsoever to watch this. I say this in full awareness that I, too, got sucked into watching out of ill-advised curiosity. Well, let me speak plainly: I can confirm without a doubt that all the worst things you could possibly read about this 1989 title are absolutely, 100% true. It's garbage even by the standards of other garbage's garbage; it's the rubbish that the Junk Lady in 'Labyrinth' would cast way without a second thought. If there is any good to come of my viewing experience, please let it be that at least one person attains the wisdom to avoid 'Going overboard.' I beg of you - do not let my misery be in vain."

I knew from the first moment Adam Sandler broke the fourth wall, it was going to be even worse than I thought.\n\nThe trivia says that this movie was written in 3 days. Cast in one day, and shot in 6 days. From concept to completion was 3 months. The quality of this movie really reflects it. Adam Sandler was asked to be in this movie about a week and a half before it was shot, before it was even written. That doesn't surprise me one bit. Everything about this movie appears rushed, ultra-low budget, and apparently used all first takes of each scene. I do understand that this movie was made in the 80's when B movies were popular, but there's no reason this movie should have been made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't watch this movie. Seriously, just DON'T! I don't care if your a die-hard Adam Sandler fan. After debuting in something this appalling, it's nothing short of miraculous that he even had a career at all. Even moreso than Arnold Schwarzenegger after starting off in \"Hercules in New York\".\n\nSandler stars as an aspiring stand-up comedian named Shecky Moskowitz who works as a waiter aboard a cruise ship named \"Ocean Spirit\". On board, he completes with the ships comedian Dickie Diamond (Scott LaRose). After Dicky accidentally locks himself in a bathroom and is presumed dead, Shecky takes his place and inexplicably succeeds as a comedian. Later, in an unnecessary sub-plot, the main villain named General Noriega (Burt Young) seeks to kill one of the models, Miss Australia, for insulting him and sends two of his men crew to hijack the ship, forcing Shecky to save the day with the power of laughter.\n\nFirst of all, the film runs on a shoestring budget that Shecky himself informs the audience via breaking the fourth wall. All the effects are amateur at best or pathetic at worst, especially the camera work. A group of high-school film class students could have done better than this.\n\nThe characters are boring or obnoxious. Dickie, despite being the alleged better comedian, is as much an annoying, talentless, jerk as Shecky. In fact, the lack of real humor from either so-called comedian is only worsened by a few moments of gross-out humor, such as seagulls defecating in obnoxious people's drinks, Shecky's low brow urinate joke, and a rock star with a serious case of meth mouth. Yuck!\n\nThe only remotely good part of this flick, besides all of the beauty queens providing eye candy, was the song \"Girlie Girlie\" by Sophia George being played several times, even though it was wasted on this mess. There's also a few notable cameos, such as a heckler named Dave (Billy Bob Thornton) who rightfully tells Shecky he has no talent as a comedian, and King Neptune (Billy Zane) who gives Shecky a pep talk. Those are the only reasons I gave this a 2 instead of a 1.\n\nIn the end, the film is nothing more than a pathetic mix of foul language, annoying characters, gross out/toilet humor, and unfunny jokes that'll leave you feeling disgusted and angry at having wasted your time watching this. I certainly did, even though I couldn't bear to even watch the entire thing."

All his other films such as 50 first dates,billy madison,the waterboy,anger management,big daddy,happy gilmore and others were on the whole very good. Although a lot of critics would disagree with me.\n\nGoing Overboard has no proper plot lines apart from a underprivileged steward (adam sandler) trying to be funny. He is actually funny but not in this movie which is no budget which he did clearly state at the beginning of the movie. He recognised that it was a crap movie which it is. But that was before he got funny."

His first movie, \"Going Overboard,\" may appear to be bad to the average Joe person. But not for die-hard Adam Sandler fans! This is one of those \"So Bad It's Good\" movies that keeps every movie person glued to the television set! Also, who (refering to us guys) doesn't like the ladies, huh? So the next time you're at that store where you're greeted by an old person in a blue vest, and you need your laundry stuff, cheap clothes, Doritos and Coca-Cola, and a cheap boom box, don't forget to dig into that $5 bin and find this movie! It'll make you prepared for more of his movies, like \"Billy Madison\" and \"Happy Gilmore\" (or should I say \"Happy Madison?\")"
