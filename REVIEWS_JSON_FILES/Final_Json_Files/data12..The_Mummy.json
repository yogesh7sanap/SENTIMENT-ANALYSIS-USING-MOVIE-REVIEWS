        "review_detailed_main": "One of the biggest blockbusters to come out in the summer of 1999 was an Egypt-set action thriller starring Brendan Fraser. While the film was pretty campy and over-the-top, it worked well and resonated with audiences. Fast-forward 18 years and we have a film of the same title - 'The Mummy' - only starring Tom Cruise in the role of Nick Morton, a treasure hunting renegade who stumbles upon a 5,000-year curse.\n\nThe only problem is, this film is far inferior to the original. Whether it's Cruise's schtick not jiving with the plot, or the lackluster CGI, or the wooden script, it's hard to say. There's really nothing thrilling about 'Mummy,' as everything feels borrowed, used or broken - nothing is shiny and new. Even fresh faces like Jake Johnson and Sofia Boutella aren't enough to up the excitement factor, and vets like Russell Crowe come off as looking to be in need of a paycheck rather than delivering a performance to be happy with. The action sequences are boring, the \"comic relief\" is far from funny and the acting itself is nothing to marvel at.\n\nCruise can usually find a way to make his films at least somewhat entertaining, but he fails here. There is no chemistry between any of the characters, including Nick and his love interest, Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), so the onus is really on Cruise to shoulder everything. In this case, it's an insurmountable task.\n\n'The Mummy' is a half-hearted attempt to revive a franchise that started strong and has since faded, so it's likely it will be put back in a sarcophagus."

        "review_detailed_main": "If #TheMummy is supposed to be the beginning of Universal's ambitious Dark Universe that showcases their classic monsters in one big shared cinematic crossover, then they're off to a terrible start.\n\nThere's probably only a couple of sequences that somewhat thrill, the rest are just a continuous string of one poorly written, poorly acted and poorly executed scene after another. It feels more like sitting in a dentist's waiting room as opposed to rockin' on a roller coaster ride. And Tom Cruise is just wrong for this role, a huge case of miscast. Perhaps they should just press the reboot button again.\n\nSofia Boutella plays an evil ancient princess imprisoned in a tomb deep beneath the unforgiving desert. When a couple of treasure hunters and an archaeologist awaken her in our present day, she returns to life to reclaim her destiny while at the same time unleashing unimaginable terrors in this new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters. Co-starring Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson, directed by Alex Kurtzman.\n\nThe concept of what the writers and director Alex Kurtzman is trying to present to us with \"The Mummy\" is nothing new, in fact it's quite predictable, but the biggest problem about it is that along the way from point A to point B, they fill it in with moments that just don't work. And it gets even more frustrating when they bring it up again the second, third and fourth time as if shoving it down our throats would make it better. The jokes fall flat so much so you kinda feel sorry for Jake Johnson who clearly wants to make some effort as this film's comic relief. There are also parts that are just absolutely pointless and unnecessary. The characters including Dr. Jekyll frequently draw conclusions out of their butts. I do think \"The Mummy\" is what happens when the story is forced to serve the visual spectacle instead of the other way around. That said, rising star Sofia Boutella is a marvelous choice, she exudes that thirst for power effortlessly in addition to being incredibly seductive.\n\nBut of course, just as expected, instead of it being a movie about Sofia Boutella's The Mummy, it becomes all about Tom Cruise, who as I said earlier is just awfully wrong for this role. I understand that the studios probably think that banking on a A-lister would translate into box office results, but fact of the matter is outside \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise, Cruise just doesn't fit anywhere else anymore. The character that he plays here is is a thieving treasure hunter, much like Nathan Drake from \"Uncharted\" games, but all you see on the screen instead is special agent Ethan Hunt desperately trying to be someone he's not. By the end of \"The Mummy\" you're going to have second thoughts about anticipating the next installment of this Dark Universe, and you're going to want to wish Brendan Fraser had still been around.\n\n-- Rama's Screen --"

I'm honestly more disappointed because of the bad reception this got that they shut that down.\n\nI definitely think Tom Cruise was not exactly the right pick for the leading actor in this movie, though. Not saying he wasn't terrible, but all I could think about was it feeling like a Mission Impossible movie.\n\nThe one thing about this movie I would have loved to see more of was Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; he was fantastic!\n\nTo wrap things up, personally, this is nowhere near as good as the Brendan Fraser remake, and everybody knows that, but I certainly don't think this movie deserved all the criticism it got.\""

        "review_title": "An outright disastrous start for any Universe",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Mummy\" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their \"Dark Universe.\" Yeah, that's right. Those re-shoots that 2014's \"Dracula Untold\" went through to tie into a Dark Universe; those don't matter now. That 2010 Benicio del Toro \"Wolfman\" movie; also doesn't matter.\n\nIn a world where Universes are becoming more and more of a thing, Universal seems determined not to let this monster mash-up of The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde and more slip through their fingers.\n\nAnd they're also not skimping out on finding A-list talent to help sell the whole thing. So far we've heard Johnny Depp, The Rock, and Javier Bardem's names being thrown into the mix, plus Russell Crowe is already here as Dr. Jekyll.\n\nThat last one I think is really cool by the way because while so many others have been portrayed by the likes of Gary Oldman and Jack Nicholson's, Jekyll's best portrayal in the past 20+ years has been ugh\u0085.David Hasselhoff.\n\nBut now let's talk about \"The Mummy\", specifically that old trilogy with Brendan Fraser. There's no doubt director Stephen Sommers lucked out with that first film and there's also little doubt Universal wants to move away from that overall cheesiness here. The question is can they still go serious but also have fun at the same time?\n\nAnd say what you will about Sommers; the guy was a C-grade filmmaker who got a kick out of a cheap thrill but at least you could say he committed to it. This new Mummy is just a wrong-headed disaster.\n\nThe set-up is pretty much the same as the older Mummy film although here it's a woman played by \"Kingsman's\" Sofia Boutella. She's Ahmanet, an Egyptian Princess who wanted power, sold out to some powerful entity for eternal life, and paid for it by getting entombed.\n\nUniversal of course is also putting it's faith in Tom Cruise, who plays an Army Vet prone towards treasure hunting. He and several others find Ahmanet's sarcophygus but while bringing it back to be examined, the plane goes down over London and a bunch of strange things happen that they learn can't just be coincidence.\n\nThis is Cruise just being Cruise here. He gets to run around a lot doing his \"intense face\" all while an attractive woman half his age is along with him for the sexual interplay (more on her in a moment). Yeah, there's discussion about his character growing something of a conscience as this goes on but it's pretty perfunctory.\n\nPlus having the Mummy be a woman after Cruise's body so she could plant her demon God inside of him and they can reign as King and Queen; this seems more like it falls into being of one of Cruise's aging vanity projects than on acting skill.\n\nBoutella gets very little to do otherwise but try and be seductive while waving her hands in a threatening manner. Otherwise auto-tune does the rest.\n\nThe Cruise character's love interest is an archaeologist played by Annabelle Wallis who looks like she just stepped out from a Paris fashion show into an archaeological dig. Did I believe her as an archaeologist? No. Did I believe she could spell it? Sure. Either way, it doesn't matter. What does is that she and Cruise are DOA in their scenes together.\n\nNo character makes much impression here, including Crowe's Dr. Jekyll who's maybe in the film for 20 minutes to explain stuff so simplistic, silly, and predictable that it hardly needs explaining at all before the film rushes through his particular ailment.\n\nFor some reason screenwriters David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie think more explanation is still warranted though and in that they couldn't be more wrong. For something trying to feel new, it's remarkably easy to tell where all this is going.\n\nTheir biggest crime is what they do to New Girl's Jake Johnson, a funny actor who they turn into the Dark Universe's version of Jar Jar Binks in only five minutes. He comes in and out of the film at really odd intervals, either screaming dialogue in the hope of making it funny or giving us yet more exposition we don't really need.\n\nAdd to that first time action director Alex Kurtzman is a disaster. The action sequences look haphazardly thrown together, just cartoonish and unbelievable, while a spoiler I won't give away about the Tom Cruise character makes them even harder to give a crap about anyway.\n\nThe fights are stiff and uninteresting, and the special effects are either forgettable or look just as hokey as they did in the Brendan Fraser movies. The plane sequence we saw in the trailer looks pretty decent but hey, you've already seen the most decent thing in the movie, why pay to see the rest.\n\nOverall this is not just a bad film, but a film that has no idea what it even is. It wants to resurrect classic monsters, but isn't the least bit scary. It wants to take it in original directions, but winds up being an ultra-serious, dull version of the 1999 film. It's silly but not funny, it's a lot of commotion but no excitement, it's a Mummy movie that if the ending of this can even be believed, thinks it's something totally different. This is a worse start to a Universe than King Arthur was.\n\nIf you liked this, check out more of Craig James Review on Youtube"

Cruise's character was likable, and while his arc wasn't that deep, it didn't really need to be. The mummy actress impressed me more than I expected, since I didn't really like her that much in Kingsman. People said that this spent too much time setting up the following movies, but I didn't think that was the case. There were small seeds planted, but save for the ending and lack of background for Jekyll, this felt self contained enough. Overall the movie had some fun action sequences and decent characters, and made for an enjoyable popcorn flick. I do not regret watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy has had countless iterations of the character grace the screen for the better part of the 20th Century. With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.\n\nThe story is absolute crap to put it as lightly as I can. It is plotted so on-the-nose that you can't have anything left up to your imagination except for some scenes of violence that may have been too much for a PG-13. Outside of that, everything is spoon fed to us as the audience. Instead of making you feel like you can keep up, the movie treats its audience like we are stupid and still expects us to continue watching. Honestly, I almost walked out at certain points, it got that bad. Especially during the scenes with Crowe's Jekyll, which are so heavily plot oriented that you can't get a feel for his character and when you get the chance to, it fails, crashes and burns.\n\nThe cast is surprisingly strong on paper but director Alex Kurtzman fails to utilize them in roles that best suit them. Tom Cruise is really the only cast member that fits the part which, when considering what genre we're talking about here, is a horrible thing. Courtney B Vance, who delivered an awards caliber performance in American Crime Story, is watered down to nothing more than a mere walk on role. Russell Crowe is so obviously doing the film for the paycheck, it feels like he isn't even acting and he is just reading queue cards.\n\nAs a fan of the cast and the 1932 original, I was left completely disappointed by everyone here. Director Alex Kurtzman, who went from directing a small indie to all of a sudden directing this big bombastic action summer blockbuster, feels out of his element here and misses the beats of a good action movie and completely neglects everything that could make a great horror film. The Mummy is by far one of the worst blockbusters in recent memory and stands as a major misfire for Universal's Dark Universe and Tom Cruise."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is quite enjoyable. I'm not sure why it's getting so many bad reviews. The action is fast paced and the acting pretty good, plus it avoids most of the major structural pitfalls that plague the monster movie genre. There were some flaws, which I will mention later, but first the strong points:\n\n\"The Monster Always Dies\". One big structural problem with monster movies is the lack of suspense. In the end, the monster is always vanquished. Any suspense revolves around the hero discovering the monster's 'fatal weakness' just in time to save the heroine. In some cases, as with the 1999 Mummy remake, the resolution is telegraphed so early and so strongly that you grow board waiting for Brendon Frasier to wade through all the special-effect laden cliff hangers to finally win the day.\n\nThis remake handles the problem in a very creative and unexpected way by first making the monster venerable almost from the start and then secondly by introducing another antagonist who turns out to be equally threatening to the hero. This builds suspense as the protagonist is threatened from multiple sides.\n\nUltimately all this climaxes in a completely unexpected ending that I honestly did not see coming; something really unique for a monster film. It may, in fact, be this ending that contributes to the negative reviews since strictly speaking it violates the hallowed monster flick formula most people have come to expect.\n\n\"Damsel in Distress\". Another tiring issue with monster films is the obligation to service the inevitable damsel-in-distress theme. Again, Mummy 2017 takes a unique approach by making Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis effectively co-equals protagonists. Sometimes she saves him, sometimes he saves her, often with a good deal of humor in the role reversal.\n\nAll-in-all a movie worth seeing, but of course there were some flaws. Character development is kept to a minimum; only enough to service the plot line. This contrasts with the 1999 Mummy which excelled in wonderfully interesting characters who, unfortunately, were deployed in the service of a mundane and predictable plot. Other flaws include under use of Jake Johnston as the comic relief and a serviceable but uninspiring performance by the heroine Wallis. Had she matched the charisma brought by Cruise's performance it would have added a whole new dimension to the movie. In general, though, I liked it and am interested to see more of the 'Dark Universe'."

The first thing you should know is that this has NOTHING to do with those movies and are completely unrelated. This is a re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of movies but with a whole new agenda. This time Universal are making these films to link in with all their other monster movies, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman etc so comparing it with any other Mummy film before it like the critics keep doing is utterly pointless.\n\nThe movie is a high entertaining fantasy horror film, its not the glossy action comedy level of the Brendan Fraser films, its darker and a lot more violent but still full of spectacle and a decent amount of humour that doesn't completely dominate the dramatic content as many film allow these days. Only Disney's Goofy or Loony Toon's Wild E Coyote can take the level of battering Tom Cruise gets in this movie and still stay standing. The Mummy is an exotic beauty who can hit like a Mack Truck. There are elements reminiscent of An American Werewolf in London (1981) and Lifeforce (1985) that forge this version of the Mummy and Russell Crowe's Dr Jekyll makes his glorified entrance half way through to remind you this is a shared monster universe so expect more of the same.\n\nQuite simply you either like this sort of stuff or you don't, if you listen to critics they'll convince you this is the worst movie ever made, it's not. It's actually really good fun and nothing more, it won't suddenly change your life and have you buying movie merchandise like a Star Wars film or Marvel franchise flick but it will entertain you if you're not already going into the cinema armed with a critical gun ready to shoot it down for daring to star Tom Cruise like the average Hollywood critic and their anti-Tom Cruise agenda."

But at the same time it's not a dark somber thriller on the verge of horror, and also it's not really an action-adventure with funny quips. It's also not a low-mid budget monster hunting action-thriller.\n\nThis movie is a rushed Frankenstein monster, you can clearly see that. It starts with an action-adventure vibe with jokes and snarky characters, then it suddenly turns into a pg-13 horror-thriller and then to a monster horror then into a disaster movie and then into some kind of dark drama but then comes back into the same beginning with jokes and quips. I can easily imagine producers telling the writers \"Just make it happen, the charts say people want this, this and this! Don't worry about it, they will eat it up.\"\n\nThe problem with this movie (goes for all similar ones) is that it is supposed to be the first movie in a Cinematic Universe. But! They do things in a way much different from Marvel. They want to create what Marvel created, but Marvel made movies which could stand on their own. You could basically start to watch Iron-Man 2 and you wouldn't really feel like you do not understand it at all. Or even Iron-Man 3 (which is after Avengers!).\n\nBut going into this movie, you are force fed that this is a cinematic universe. You are introduced to so many characters which are obviously supposed to have bigger story arcs in later movies, and in all of that cinematic universe introduction, there is some random Mummy plot thrown into the mix, so that something could hold all of these loose ends together. There are just too many unanswered questions, and too many seemingly random characters. It feels like you are already watching some later movie, maybe the 5th one in this whole cinematic universe, and this one just happens to have a mummy in it.\n\nCaution: Do not turn this film in to a drinking game where you take a shot every time you miss Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. You'll be dead in twenty minutes. I give this film three points for technical competence and for Sofia Boutella as an awesome female mummy."

I guess 50 million in profit world wide is chump change to these people. One thing is clear as always. If your going to do another in the same genre, you better get more than 15 years over the deal, so its new in people's minds. Anyone with any commons sense at all would know this. And to spend 327 million on it, is beyond insanity. Unfortunately, audiences that liked it will be deprived of one by such short sightedness. As well as the critics weird dislike of Cruise. Personal dislike of an actor in real life, regardless of how uncouth it is, or in speculation of motivations in production, has NOTHING to do with a movie. To me, the story is everything, and its a good one, with effects that merely emphasize it, which is always my criteria in whether a movie is good or not. Sofia Boutella is riveting in this role, especially in the way her unconventional beauty is emphasized by her extreme talent. Its her and Eva Green, who are at the forefront of this type of great young actress of the future. There is no prejudice here. I rate it as I see it, and not with any preconceived notions. Its worth the watch."

Going in with no expectations except for those of the terrible reviews, we were all pleasantly surprised. Our first comment to one another when the lights went up was, \"Why all the bad reviews, that was a fun ride?\" There are so many movies that are worse, and get better reviews, because they don't have TC in them.\n\nBut then, Oblivion got terrible reviews, Edge of Tomorrow did poorly when they were released - and in retrospect, those movies hold up just fine and have found their audiences. Don't forget that Bladerunner got terrible reviews when it first came out (not that I'm comparing The Mummy to Bladerunner, just saying critics don't always get it right.)\n\nHey, I think Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher was an awful idea, too, but that doesn't mean he can't have a good niche as the unlikeable hero who is going to get redeemed somehow, whether he likes it or not. People think Tom Cruise has worn out his welcome, they don't' like his religion, whatever - I get it. He still makes reliable action films and isn't afraid to play a guy who is a very reluctant hero, if he's even a hero at all. I, for one, would watch the next installment of The Mummy."

The film editing keeps the action flowing, even if the plot occasionally stumbles into campiness. Its strength lies in its nostalgic homage to classic monster movies and the allure of uncovering long-buried secrets. The music sets an eerie tone, and the cinematography captures the exotic locales and breathtaking set pieces. \"The Mummy\" is a delightful escape into the realm of cinematic adventure, a reminder that sometimes, the past should stay buried, but our fondness for this adventure remains as timeless as the pharaohs themselves."

Populated with super beings, over which none will claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already. It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.\n\nCinematically it means tons of CGI, and every kind of monster the script writer could find in the archives of Universal St. and some from other cinematic archives too. It was a bit much when they tried it on 2004 with Van Helsing. And Hugh Jackman never repeated that mistake. So Tom Cruise is here to take his place. Truth is, we should've seen it coming. Tom Cruise must've wanted to be Superman all these years, but even he knew he wasn't physically suitable so he relented into an endless list of action heroes that were borderline super beings but not actually super. Thing is, he's not getting younger, and the idea of doing his own stunts is getting less and less practical, so Tom Cruise found the ultimate solution, he went in and made himself a god.\n\nYes if you do want to watch it, you need to do more than just suspend your judgment. You'll have to kill it and make sure it doesn't come back to haunt you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite concerns (such as whether Tom Cruise would fit), 'The Mummy' did have potential. Some of the previous 'Mummy' films, particularly the instalments with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee and the 1999 film, wasn't crazy about a few of the Lon Chaney entries and 'Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' was a mess. Unfortunately, so is 2017's 'The Mummy'.\n\nBefore anybody jumps down my throat and accuses me of following the crowd, an accusation that is becoming tiresome and ridiculous and says more about the person making the accusation than the people they're attacking, as said 'The Mummy' did have potential and personally really wanted it to work. This is also coming from somebody who does find herself many times agreeing with critics, but has just as many times gone against the grain, thinking that negatively received films are not that bad while acknowledging their faults and also thinking that acclaimed films are not that good while acknowledging the things it does right. Usually am very encouraging and try to be perceptive, do not take pleasure in bashing films that don't do anything for me.\n\n'The Mummy' is such an occasion where to me the critics are on point. Not irredeemable but is lacking in almost every department. Its best things are two good performances. The best performance comes from an imperiously chilling Sofia Boutella, doing such a good job with what she's given to work with, and Annabelle Wallis does decently with relatively little. Some of the scenery is striking and some of the photography is slick and stylish.\n\nSadly the rest of the cast do not work. Tom Cruise is embarrassingly miscast in a role that both doesn't suit him and is long in the tooth for, he also feels out of kilter in the setting. Russell Crowe phones in his performance here, looking miserable and awkward and not making anything of his lines. Cruise and Wallis' chemistry is non-existent. Then we have Jake Johnson providing irritating and very poorly placed comic relief.\n\nNot everything works visually either. The way 'The Mummy' is photographed and edited can be too frenetic and the special effects veer on the cheap. The music is generic at best and Alex Kurtzman's direction is muddled and without any kind of soul or a sense that he knew what to do with the film's tone.\n\nOne of the worst aspects of 'The Mummy' is the dialogue, full of clunky exposition, unfunny and childish humour and often a clich\u00e9d shambles it's laughably bad. The story is dull, disjointed and confused, while also tonally a complete mess. It tries to be comedy, action and horror, too many elements, and fails at all three. The comedy is sporadic and none of it is remotely amusing let alone funny. The action is completely lacking in excitement and choreographed in a scattershot and leaden way. The horror elements have none of the chills and scare factors, hurt by its predictability and being unintentionally funny. The ending is one big anti-climax.\n\nIn summary, a complete mess that fails in almost every department apart from moments of good visuals and two above serviceable performances. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

These reviewers are looking for \"artsy-fartsy\" in places where they should just be looking for fun.  Such is the case with THE MUMMY.  I heard horrible review after horrible review from these critics questioning Universal's decision to make this film and wondering \"what was Tom Cruise thinking\".  I can tell you what he was thinking -\n\n\"Let's make an entertaining action/adventure popcorn flick\".\n\nAnd that is what this film is.\n\nThe opening film in Universal Studios \"Dark Universe\" - THE MUMMY kicks off an adventure featuring the classic character...wait for it...The Mummy.  Future films will feature...I would assume...The Werewolf, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, The Invisible Man, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc...(you get the picture).  Chasing them is Russell Crow as Dr. Henry Jekyl (and, of course, his alter ego Edward Hyde).  Into this world comes naive, narcissistic treasure hunter Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) who unwittingly unleashes an ancient Egyptian Queen hellbent on bringing evil into the world.\n\nPretty standard stuff, right?  Well...Mr. Cruise does this sort of thing better than just about anyone in history and he steps right up for this film.  The action sequences are fun and effective, the dialogue is snappy and the characters are interesting enough to keep our attention.  I would give kudos to first-time feature film director, Alex Kurtzman for keeping things going, but he isn't really new to this.  He is a veteran writer and producer often working with JJ Abrams, so he knows a thing or two about making popcorn flicks.\n\nI mentioned Cruise's ability to perform in this sort of film - and he does it well.  Most of the other boxes are checked - and checked well.  Wise-cracking sidekick?  Ably filled by Jake Johnson (TV's NEW GIRL), good looking female Doctor/Scientist who works and argues alongside Cruise?  Well played by Annabelle Wallis (TV's PEAKY BLINDERS).  Mysterious person hunting unimaginable monsters?  In walks Russell Crowe(!) in his best work in quite some time.  Unbeatable Villain?  Strongly portrayed by Sofia Boutella (the \"Blade Runner\" villain in KINSMEN).  Good story?  Check.  Good to Very Good Special Effects?  Check, check and check.\n\nAnd...of course...it sets us up to enter this \"Dark Universe\" in future films.\n\nI, for one, am looking forward to future entries in this Universe.  I have a lot of popcorn to eat.\n\nLetter Grade:  B\n\nA solid 7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

        "review_detailed_main": "What are you doing Universal?\n\nPerhaps that's not the right question. You're making your Dark Universe franchise which is your answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe except instead of superheroes you have monsters. That's cool and given the history of monster movies of the past, it makes as much sense as any cinematic universe. Your goal was to start this universe with 2014's \"Dracula Untold\", but you changed your minds when that movie was (rightfully) poorly received. So, now you're going to try to start this franchise off with this new version of \"The Mummy\". Hell, you even got Tom Cruise to star and Russell Crowe to co-star as Henry Jekyll, undoubtedly being set up for his own solo movie.\n\nHowever, the kicker here is that \"The Mummy\" is actually a worse movie than \"Dracula Untold\". \"Dracula Untold\" was a generic action movie with a Gothic setting and tone. Was it the right way to treat a Dracula movie? Of course not, but at least it was cohesive and had a clear point to it's existence. I cannot say the same for \"The Mummy\".\n\n\"The Mummy\" begins in England, where a secret tomb is discovered and we see news broadcasts telling us all this speculation about what this tomb could be. Then, the movie begins again giving us the origin of this film's titular mummy Ahmanet, played by Sofia Boutella. Then the movie begins for a third and final time showing us Nick Morton (Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) looking for artifacts in Iraq. You might think such a location would be a setup for a commentary on war but you'd be wrong. The Iraq setting only provides some incredibly poorly cobbled together action. For some unfathomable reason, the heroes find an ancient Egyptian tomb...in Iraq. To the filmmaker's credit, they do at least think to bring up the question; they just neglect to answer it. If this movie's goal was to make \"Kong: Skull Island\" appear to be a deeply intellectual thinkpiece by comparison, then mission accomplished.\n\nSay what you will about 1999's \"The Mummy\", at least it was a fun movie despite it's many flaws. 2017's \"The Mummy\" spends time pretending to be horror and other times pretending to be action. David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie are listed as screenwriters for this garbage fire, which is baffling considering the talent they've shown in the past. I am less impressed with director Alex Kurtzman who is primarily known as a writer for such films as \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", \"\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\", and \"The Legend of Zorro\". My opinion of him is very simple, without some sort of hand to guide him like JJ Abrams, his work ends up being rubbish. \"The Mummy\" has done nothing to dissuade this opinion. What's worse, Universal hired him to work on other stories in their Dark Universe. So, my original question still holds merit. Not in that I am unsure what Universal is doing, but I don't think they have any idea how to successfully reach their goal.\n\nSo, what are you doing Universal?"

Annabelle Wallis also played the Tom's, somewhat, jilted girlfriend, as you would expect any slightly used person to feel. The cameo part that Jake Johnson provided ..very.. subtle but none the less, semi-slapstick humor. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Russell Crowe. Russell is an actor and was paid to do a job, which, on screen,...was not given time for much character development (perhaps in a sequel). The action and graphics were superb and because we go to a Tom Cruise Mummy movie to see a Tom Cruise Mummy movie,... if you're a fan, then you don't want to miss this one on the big screen. Enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a bit biased because I love stuff like this, although I never watched the original movies. This has been my laptop's wallpaper since high school-I've always loved it. Sofia Boutella's makeup and costume as Ahmanet were stunning. It might not reflect well on me, but I developed a crush on her after seeing her in this movie lol. It's only years later when I saw people were disappointed in this movie so i watched it not with the best expectations. So i was kinda looking for flaws.\n\nAt first glance it's shocking Tom Cruise is in it. Probably there for the action element. This feels more like a fantasy action-adventure film first, then everything eerie second. The poster and makeup give a bit of a misleading impression in that sense. But like horror movies, this one features protagonists who fail to grasp all the warning signs and omens indicating that what they're exploring might not be the best idea.\n\nIf I could change something about the movie, I'd have it take on a more serious and darker tone. Maybe extend the runtime because some of the humorous scenes were genuinely enjoyable. For instance, the \"I thought there was another one\" line cracked me up. Wouldn't cut that out.\n\nThe movie didn't peak well either; the third act felt lackluster and underwhelming. A darker tone might've helped that, like if the sandstorm had brought in more mummies and the movie spent more time wreaking havoc across actual London instead of just in the sewers. Increase the stakes, always felt like heroes would save the day.\n\nTom Cruise should have had some visible bruises after the crash,, despite the explanation given. At least dirt, he woke up looking like he just stepped out the shower. However, during the fight scenes, the bruises he sustained looked more realistic, with an actual swollen face rather than just makeup. Also, everyone seemed strangely oblivious to Vail not looking normal.\n\nPlot-wise, it felt too coincidental that a massive tomb in London and another Egyptian tomb in Iraq were discovered simultaneously. I wish they had spent more time searching for the artifacts too, maybe with Ahmanet herself not knowing their exact location, leading her to a destructive search. It felt like she was underused as a villain and had far more potential. Felt like a real terrifying character but written for a child friendly movie.\n\nIt sucks when a franchise with potential doesn't come to fruition because the first movie didn't deliver. The movie misses the mark and I remembered it better than it actually was, but I still see why I loved it. I'll keep my Ahmanet wallpaper on."

Nothing more than a poor remake of the last mummy movie. Tom Cruise didn't fit in well with this movie. Why does Hollywood insist on putting out these cheap remakes?

Sit back, grab your favorite drink and snack, shut the heck up and enjoy.\n\nWhile NOT, what a lot have come to expect from Tom C movies, the added humor, the unexpected \"oh crap, RUN\" moments gave this movie several nods from this old movie fan. Always on his game, Russel Crowe....just hammered his part. I loved it yet, I was a bit shocked at THAT particular \"character\" being inserted in this movie? Hmm. Still and all, it took nothing from it. Annabelle Wallis was an unknown name to me when I first saw this, but she gained a fan, immediately and I've searched out more of her work since. A fine actress, indeed and a great addition to this movie. Someone made a great move choosing her for Jenny Halsey! Nothing need be said about Jake Johnson. The guy just cracks me up, every time I see him and WHO ELSE could come close to portraying our evil Egyptian princess, Sofia Boutella??? If they even tried, fans would probably revolt!\n\nThe nay-sayers, I'm told, have all but killed the idea of the second (and third?) series that could have blessed us with hours of great entertainment.......just because \"I wanted it to be what 'I think' was authentic\", and can't have a single change in outfits, or bloopers that I \"had to\" spend my time searching for (instead of just watching the movie. My, my. I would seriously find life a chore if I chose to pick everything apart that I saw.....because I've yet to see anything in this world in 7 decades, that is perfect. I give thanks for what I see and enjoy every hour of it. To the critics, I have a differing opinion. While I am NOT an easy sell......this one gets a solid \"9\" from me. God Bless."

Russell Crowe is a standout name too. However, sadly, the film gets progressively worse throughout the 110 minutes.\n\nThe premise kinda just falls into itself, with any interest disappearing pretty quickly. The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome, as does all the comedy in the film in truth - there's a few chuckles, but nothing laugh worthy. The zombie vibe doesn't fit, either.\n\nWhat also doesn't help is the fact they're blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort, which they put too much focus on. I found the effects hit-and-miss, I feel like they could've used more practical stuff rather than relying so much on CGI - for the make-up et al. at least.\n\nCruise leads ably and does a decent enough job - he has done far greater of course. Crowe never really gets going in my opinion, though does have a couple of cool to look at scenes late on. Sofia Boutella is alright, as is Annabelle Wallis. A meh for the cast.\n\nNothing diabolical, but a fair distance from good too."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy franchise has been struggling lately. Ever since the original 1999 movie was released, the movies have gradually gotten worse. The first \"Mummy\" was slick, well made and entertaining; the second was your typical B/C movie, not the worst but far from the best, and then with the third installment it was clear that Hollywood had given up on the franchise and wanted one more pay-cheque.\n\nSkip forward to 2017 and we appear to have something just as good as the original. Sure, for some, the flashy visuals may seem like a cover-up for the (occasional) uninspired dialogue, however, there is no doubt that a lot of money was invested in making this film look good, and it sure delivers on that aspect (even with The Scorpion King setting the bar very low, \"The Mummy\" (2017) still looks pretty amazing).\n\nTom Cruise stars, which to some may be a turn-off, but I think some credit is due here. Tom has made a name for himself in the M:I film's, and with his performance in \"The Mummy\", he shows audiences that perhaps it's not too late to make a name for yourself in a different franchise. He's not the best actor in the world by any means, but he does the job and he does it well enough for the film to be taken reasonably seriously.\n\nI think that it's important to remember that you're not seeing anything ground- breaking with this film; it's not going to have the same impact as the original Mummy title and it certainly isn't going to steal the show at the Oscars, but it has its moments of adrenaline-pumping action, well-crafted visuals and smart dialogue.\n\nSome of this 1hr 47min Egyptian-fetish flick feels a bit clunky, and the story is all too familiar sounding (disturbing an ancient evil which comes back to wreak havoc on everyone), but when you consider that there have been worse Mummy films, 2 to be exact and that Alien Covenant hasn't exactly set the bar for reboots particularly high, The Mummy has its entertainment value, it has its action and suspense, but it also has some cracks in its sarcophagi which will, hopefully, be ironed out when they inevitably make another of these in 2 or so years time.\n\nNot the worst, not the best, but definitely worth watching for a few thrills.\n\nParental Guidance: Some scary scenes, moments of moderate fantasy horror and bloody violence, language (15+)"

It felt that Russell character was being restrained to not overshadow TC! Why?\n\nIf you have not watched any of the previous Mummy films you may get some enjoyment out of this version though I don't hold out much hope. With so much money spent on this film it's hard at times to see where it was spent.\n\nSorry but very disappointed with this version and it ranks up there with the poorly executed The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008)."

Yet a couple of days ago sitting at my desk I start seeing a flood of negative reviews about The Mummy. So I read, and I read, and I continued to read words such as horrible, terrible, worst Tom Cruise movie ever, etc etc. So I decided to go to the movies today and just see this apparent train wreck of a movie. I sat there and was willing to accept what ever apparent \"garbage\" they threw at me. I mean I managed to stay through the entire Suicide Squad and I have to admit that was a mess, horrible in my opinion because they tried to cram way too many leading rolls down my throat.\n\nSo after watching The Mummy do I agree with the premature flood of angry reviews? Reviews I was almost forced to endure on my many devices as if a global event was happening. I was told The Mummy was not good, not good at all in many words. Well the truth is the critics lie and apparently bullying a movie out of the box office is a live and well.\n\nI was actually quite happy with The Mummy. I liked Nicks character played by Tom Cruises who I felt was believable for a fun summer action movie. I enjoyed Jenny, co-star Annabelle Wallis who fit the roll well and did not annoy me like some actors can when it comes to 'running and screaming'. I sat through the entire movie and at one point I actually was looking for something to complain about. I personally did not like Russle Crow as Jekyll because I felt, in all honesty he was too fat for the roll. Sofia Boutella did a great job as the main villain. I could feel her feel her rage and madness and at one moment she made me jump. Guess the 3D helped there.\n\nSo, what I have learned is never believe a movie critic until you see the movie for yourself."

Instead of a sympathetic yet creepy antagonist this \"monster movie\", focuses on a somehow even worse version of Suicide Squad's Enchantress fighting a tired digitally de-aged Tom Cruise in a final act that shamelessly rips off the 80's dumpster fire Lifeforce but is strangely even worse. You can clearly tell that the script was stitched together by six different people desperate to appeal to a committee of idiots, that shouldn't be running one of the oldest and most influential studios to the ground, thanks to the ceaseless simple exposition, failed humor and disgusting pandering to a foreign market. When Tom Cruise's age is closer to that of the mummy's than his obligatory love interest you know your movie is a stinker."

I like all of the Transformer movies for example...just dumb fun can be entertaining for an afternoon.\n\nActors, who I believe are much better than what is on display in this movie, seem to be going through the motions much of the time. This film is a complete waste of Sofia Boutella and that isn't because I think she has great range as an actress, she's okay and is great to look at, but because it appears they signed her on just to expose her most carnal attributes.\n\nTom Cruise has reached a point where he is just retracing steps he's already taken in film. Edge of Tomorrow was typical Cruise and entertaining while The Mummy is typical Cruise that fails. It is important that his style mesh well with those around him in a film and that didn't really happen in The Mummy.\n\nI have to wonder how low the public ratings would be on sites like this if the Scientology crowd wasn't attempting to jack up the votes? Thankfully the near future has Cruise returning to his roots in Mission Impossible and another Edge of Tomorrow feature.\n\nSpend your time in the theater this summer watching anything else and save The Mummy for a rainy day on DVD if you feel you have to see it for yourself...or at least find a corner of the theater away from any other viewers. You'll most likely be browsing the internet before it is over no matter where you watch."

Not that he couldn't portray a thieving grave robber given the proper chance, , but he's not given any. At least not in a way which I think is suitable for him.\n\nIn my opinion Cruise is at his best in slower scenes, where he's allowed to act, but there are none of those in this movie. Instead the director goes for sped up scenes, with the dialogue quickly dished out without much acting at all - and this makes Cruise look out of place. Almost as if the movie is played on fast forward, but he's not. It's awkward. But I blame the director and the casting crew, not Cruise.\n\nBesides of that I think The Mummy is a pretty entertaining summer flick. Not as great as the Brendan Fraiser-movies I loved as a teen, but still descent enough. The female mummy is great; I love mean women. And although most of the plot is quite predictable I was happily surprised with the ending. I did not see it coming, and I liked it.\n\nLooking forward to a second installment of some kind. Hopefully a slightly slower paced second installment with a few action scenes less and a bit more acting on between."

Lately, I've been using what I call the RESURGENCE scale to evaluate films since INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE is the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years (and we see a lot of movies). THE MUMMY is nowhere near as bad as ID:R. It's too long, has a number of disjointed scenes, and steals liberally from a number of other films; however, that being said, the origin of this movie is an interesting variation on all the mummies that have come before (my favorite remains Hammer's 1959 version). The screenwriter introduces some clever new mythology that I found intriguing. If you are worrying about spending money on it,see it during a bargain matin\u00e9e if your theater has one."

But I do know that the first one was mysterious and also, badass.(Brendan Fraser was the sh!t) But considering that this is not an actual reboot, we owe to the film maker to consider this as a separate movie and not compare it to the previous version.(Although I recall a little book from a certain movie in one scene *wink wink*) The jokes in the movie were actually funny so a plus point for that. The action was fine, another point (or half a point). Story? Ehhh, it was fine for what it's worth. Acting? What you'd expect from the cast. Good and professional.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I read that they are doing a reboot of the popular Mummy movies (which I totally loved the first one and enjoyed the second one), I was truly excited. I know that Brendan Fraser might not be the best option of doing the movie again, and I was of course psyched by the fact it would be played by Tom Cruise who was still in prime condition to play action movie. But it appeared that the movie became totally something different. this one felt too much altered.\n\nAfter reading some more information of the movie, I realized that this was supposed to be the start of something called Dark Universe where they would share with monsters in other universe in the future. I for one felt that the introduction towards the universe was a little bit too much emphasized. As we were hoping for a movie focusing on the Mummy, the part of the universe became a less pleasant surprise. My personal opinion is that it would probably be a lot better had it been done the way the shared universe was introduced in Kong: Skull Island, which was done in the post credit scene and hence the focus of the movie was still about King Kong.\n\nDo not get me wrong though, the movie did provide us a lot of entertaining and intense scenes. My wife literally screamed in some scenes that gave us shocking moments. What I do not like was once again the trailer of the movie revealed too much information, even the surprising scenes were shown as well which totally reduced the element of surprise when we see the actual movie. Another thing, this movie did not have any post credit scene at all despite my hope there would be one. I guess whatever they wanted to highlight, in future movies were already mentioned before the end credit scene.\n\nComing to other aspects of the movie, the special effects of the mummy was great, the CGI was cool, the sound effects were nice (I saw this in studio with Auro 11.1 system). Jenny's character in here seemed to be too stiff and felt like a person with no expression and unfortunately did not seem to have believable chemistry with Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise was pretty good in the action scenes and also quite charming (though I still think Brendan Fraser was more suitable in this role). Sofia Boutella was pretty convincing as Ahmanet, Russel Crowe was cool as ever and my personal favorite character was Vail played by Jake Johnson, who provided the much needed humor.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking for an entertaining action adventure movie, this one was a good choice. But if you are hoping for a real movie about Mummy, then it would be best to watch the original 1999 version. Oh ya, you also need to keep an open mind if you want to enjoy this movie, especially about the Dark Universe. And if you have not watched the trailer to the movie at all, then please do not do it so you can enjoy the movie better.\n\nFor my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

I think it doesn't do enough of any single one and the overall mix was disappointing.\n\nAs you'd expect the film is all about Tom Cruise - I think other than the introduction he was in every single scene of the film, front and centre. When in truth the Mummy was by far the most interesting character in it yet barely featured in comparison. And for a film with such a big budget, why were so many of the CGI scenes hidden by shooting in the dark where one was barely able to see what was even going on? It's usually a trick played by low budget movies so no excuse for it here.\n\nIt's not awful, but it is disappointing. It's like a poor imitation of Indian Jones (the original 2) or a Suicide Squad without any of the fun."

With two powerful actors Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, this movie falls just short in being a sharknado without the intention on being one! I still had hopes during various parts of the movie. For instance the opening part when Cruise is seen running firing his SCAR rifle in a desert backdrop, could it be an Uncharted(Playstation) like adventure? - No! Okay then come the pyramids, yaaay...wait is that some bad CGI? I mean they are making a 'Mummy' Movie and cant they put together at least a proper pyramids setting?! Russel Crowe, Yay...Dr.Jekyll,Yay...but wait you swapped his role from being hideous with an overweight McDonalds customer asking to choose his happy meal toy!? The CGI was very impressive - all cast in the movie were CGI which looked sooooo real, the soundtrack reminded me of 1 million action movies which releases every year made in Hollywood for audiences abroad, Tom Cruise's acting moment was when he flies around inside a jet about to crash..it was more like an extended cut with CTRL+C and CTRL+V. I can say in a heartbeat that this is definitely my favorite movie this year, OK that was just gas on my chest...Nevermind - Don't you ever consider watching this, the movie will suck your happiness like a demontor with Tom Cruise like cute face.Annabelle wallis is cute, so 2 stars."

She was perfectly cast and her acting was great.\n\nBut I feel like this started out as an idea during a meeting and everyone got so excited about the idea that they didn't put enough time in writing a full story and script. The script feels a bit bland, and it feels like there are some plot holes in the movie. I wish they would've gone a little deeper with the story instead of focusing on the FX. At some point they even tried to bring in a bit of comedy which felt very out of place. You want to see this movie to get scared, not to laugh.\n\nOverall, enjoyable but don't expect too much"

I'm not a very big Cruise fan, but even I had to sympathize with his attempt to take any of this nonsense seriously.\n\nIf Universal really wanted to reboot their original monster horror franchise, they really couldn't have started out worse. Remaking the classic Karloff horror film (also brilliantly redone by Hammer Studios in 1959, and at least made entertaining in the first reboot with Brendan Fraisier) by essentially making a Transformers film with a mummy instead of a morphing truck is a death-knell.\n\nThis does not bode well for future Universal remakes... especially since this film includes a ridiculous appearance by Dr. Jeckyll (Russel Crowe just looking for a paycheck).\n\nI predict, at most, one more film in this ludicrous and pathetic Dark Universe series... if that."

The film is filmed beautifully and the special effects are 1st class.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falls flat afterwards. Halfway through the movie I started to get annoyed with 2 things:\n\n1. Tom Cruise has been miscast, terribly miscast! He plays his part a bit like playing Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible, but much less sympathetic, much less passioned. I have never really found Tom Cruise to fit for more darker roles, but he doesn't even bother trying with The Mummy. I never seen somebody first awakening from the dead and then hearing he is cursed with so little intrest. I can go on about everything that is wrong with Tom Cruise his performance, but you get my point. I would have much preferred Brendan Fraser from the 1999 movie to be in this film again!\n\n2. Which direction do you want to take with this film? Did anyone involved in the proces actually know? It is certainly not scary! I aint funny neither. And exciting? Nope, not even close. The story is predictable, unoriginal and full of loose ends. One example: Russel Crowe does a creditable acting performance as Dr Jeckyll, but his role is not deepened and is more reminiscent of an aftertought.\n\nIn conclusion, given the large film budget and the reputation of the 1999 movie that was on stake, this film is a very big disappointment. Therefore only 3/10."

Towards the end I was actually looking at the time on my phone to see how much longer I would have to endure this. Acting, plot, storyline, CGI and script were all poor except for Tom's acting as he always tries to give his best but his sidekick Annabelle Wallis couldn't be any more wooden, she is really bad in this movie, no charisma or personality and you don't care if she lives or dies. Russell Crow is awful and I am surprised he even bothered once he had seen the script. The scene where the mummy's zombie helpers are attacking the ambulance had no menace about it and I've seen it done so much better in the Walking Dead series. I cannot believe that Universal think that this stinker is going to impress anyone waiting for the Dark Universe series of movies to arrive. I want my money back."

I also liked the 1999 Mummy movie, where Frasier was a forgettable hero, kind of like Cruise here, but I really enjoyed Arnold Vosloo's performance despite the lackluster script.\n\nAnd in the end this is what makes this mummy film just as mediocre, the script. It's attempting to jumpstart a Dark Universe franchise much like Ahmanet resurrects dead people, as incomplete soulless zombies. There is no flesh in it, just bones and rotten clich\u00e9. I mean, even Cruise was probably cast in this because he played much the same character in Edge of Tomorrow, a vastly superior film, BTW.\n\nI don't think Universal realizes that their biggest competitor is a British TV show called Penny Dreadful that was better than what they can ever do in movies and still was cancelled.\n\nBottom line: I enjoyed it. It wasn't the train wreck I was expecting. However, Crowe was completely wasted in the film (he is a New Zealander, damn it, not English!) and even if Tom Cruise performed well, his material was weak and his story lame."

This year marks the debut of the new Dark Universe with the release of \"The Mummy\". How does this movie hold up? Eh, I've seen better; then again, I've seen worse too.\n\nPlot: Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), some sort of soldier/mercenary/treasure hunter (honestly, does it really matter what he is?), unearths an Egyptian tomb in the Middle-East and accidentally frees Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who seeks to use him to bring an evil from another world into our own. Even with the help of the monster-hunting organization Prodigium, headed by Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (Russell Crowe), Nick's fate as well as the world hangs by a thread.\n\nFor this film, I kept my expectations low as well as an open mind when faced with this new film series as it did show potential. Some ideas were cool like Dr. Jekyll being in charge of Prodigium (fitting given his character and Crowe gives the best performance by the way), how this rather attractive Mummy shows off her powers, and nods to the other Universal Monsters and previous Mummy incarnation. The film also offers some decent action like the airplane scene and maybe one or two little scares. However, those are really the best the movie has to offer. The main characters aren't particularly interesting nor offer any surprises (Jake Johnson in particular annoyed me and had little purpose), the humor is hit-or-miss, the romance unearned, and there's nothing truly thrilling throughout. There's also a point where the Mummy starts speaking English and it's never elaborated on how this was accomplished, just one of those distracting things.\n\nPerhaps the biggest flaw is that the second-third of the film is dedicated to world-building, detracting from the title monster that is supposed to be the central conflict. This is a mistake \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\" among others made, sacrificing telling a complete story just for setting up sequels (thus earning a great deal of criticism and often leading to franchise cancellation), something both Marvel and the Monsterverse have largely avoided.\n\nIn short, \"The Mummy\" offers minimal entertainment at best. It doesn't fail at establishing a shared universe as much as others like \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", but it also doesn't offer more than being just an action-adventure film and one that lacks any real charm at that. For now, the Dark Universe is on shaky ground."

It kept cheesy one liners to a minimum (at least until nearer the end) and was actually quite scary in parts! It had a nice dark feel throughout and i was really impressed by the mummies / zombies, the direction was very clever in that shadows were used effectively and the movements of the creatures were genuinely disturbing at times. A lot of people are saying that Cruise isn't suited to the role, i agreed for the first minute but as soon as i adjusted and got to terms with the fact that this was not the old mummy series i appreciated his performance and thought he he played it well. Some other great performances within the film as well. In summary This film is fun, action packed, scary and even occasionally funny. You can't ask for anything more when it comes to a Saturday night popcorn session. I recommend giving it a whirl and deciding for yourselves!!"

(Sorry, the joke's probably more effective in spoken form.) Actually, an ancient princess (Sofia Boutella) is awakened from her crypt, and it's up to Tom Cruise to release the world of her danger, with Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe, Jake Johnson and others helping. Cruise didn't get to become a box-office star by being coy. He prefers to do event movies: epic and offering something that others don't, be it visuals, physical tricks, or storywise. This is why you see him in leading role usually once a year \u2013 epics need time. (Except, actually, this year, with \"American Made\" following in August.) In \u0084The Mummy's\" case, it's both visuals and tricks that should draw the people in. The 110 minute movie has plenty of furious action and some massive setpieces to get people their money's worth. The only troubled note is that critics don't seem to heart it \u2013 39/100 in Metacritic and only 25/100 in Rotten Tomatoes \u2013, with Rolling Stone calling it \u0084monster fail\", for example. I'd like to be more generous because I think the result is actually pretty entertaining. Despite the efforts to make everything look as badass and epic as possible, it's still a fun B-movie adventure at heart. They don't aim for any direct comedy, but the leading character can be clueless enough, and the events unpredictable, to earn a few smiles and winks along the way. For example, the moment of swimming underwater with a few unexpected followers. Fearing to spoil something for someone, I will not go into details, but: I also really liked mummy's servants. How they come alive, how they move and look, how they are dealt with. True, there are obvious influences to some famous videogames, but they still look fresh and creepy. And by fresh, I mean not generic. Cruise's acting seemed surprisingly cheesy at times, but this is probably intentional, and what do you expect from a monster movie anyway, eh. And this pretty old guy \u2013 53 when the filming started \u2013 can still kick ass! No reason to stop being action hero. Not that he's planning. If there's one big problem, then it's the tiresome final act which gets concerned not with properly leading the story to conclusion but creating a movie franchise for future. It goes on a bit too long and made me feel a bit exhausted. \u0084The Mummy\" is the first title in the so-called Dark Universe, or Universal's competitor to Disney/Marvel's and Warner/DC's ever- expanding world of comic-book- characters. Universal plans to bring many of its classical horrors back in cinemas, starting with \u0084Bride of Frankenstein\" and \u0084Creature from the Black Lagoon\" both coming in 2019. \u0084The Mummy\" is not probably the mightiest kick-off they could have hoped for, but I kinda like it. Which is more than I can say about this recent mummy series starring Brendan Fraser. I always found it generic and too obvious."

A greedy, selfish, destructive, slimy character. Every bad quality of his archetype but none of the good. How are you supposed to root for this guy to succeed?\n\nThe movie has serious tone problems, whipping between excessive Michael-Bay-style chaos, spooky zombie horror, and... comedy? What? The dialog here isn't even necessarily what's funny, either; in fact, most of the banter between characters feels more desperate in an obnoxious way. Instead, the movie has a number of slapstick gags, and not all of them feel entirely intentional. At one point Tom Cruise gets flat-out uppercut 20 feet in to the air, Mortal Kombat style, and it made me burst out laughing. I'm not sure I was supposed to; it's hard to tell if it was meant to be intentionally funny, or if they were trying to make a monster look powerful only for it to read as cartoonish.\n\nThe hooks in to their proposed \"Dark Universe\" are transparent and bad. The movie's plot is already kind of thin, with the titular Mummy herself spending most of the narrative making Tom Cruise hallucinate unthreatening nonsense, yet the middle of the movie wastes time on a big bloated crossover detour so they can hint at all the other movies they were planning for this franchise. Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time to talk about his secret society of monster hunters and \"curing evil\" that ends up giving The Mummy an awful sort of Super Hero Origin Story feel to it. Tired of those? You'll be tired of this. It eats up a good 15 minutes (or more) and poisons a movie that could have used that time to better tell its own story.\n\nAnother unintentional laugh came when Russell Crowe, with salt and pepper gray hair, unironically calls Tom Cruise a \"young man.\" Cruise is actually older that Crowe, but his character is still written like he's in his 20's or early 30's. Cruise himself is roughly more than twice that age. Ouch.\n\nThe end result is flimsy and messy at best. The final moments before the credits roll may as well be somebody winking directly in to the camera saying \"We have six more of these planned. See you soon!\"\n\nNo, probably not."

Afterall Tom Cruise does a pretty decent acting job in every movie hes been in right? wrong! Thirty minutes in, and you're already deciding if you should cut your losses,and leave or carry on. I mean how bad could this film get? wrong again! Just when you thought it was safe Mr Russell Crow decides to let loose an accent that is so bad, it makes the one he did in Robin Hood seem like a Richard Burton masterpiece. This has to be one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. I have never seen Tom Cruise this bad since the infamous sofa incident, I can't decide if hes playing for laughs or if someone has slipped him a Mickey Finn. Annabelle Wallis, and Sofia Boutella provide the love interest, and Mummy,and while they wont be wining any awards for this film, both put in more effort than Mr Cruise,and Mr Crow. This movie is about a Mummy, and like a Mummy, it should be buried,and forgotten forever!"

        "review_detailed_main": "We now live in a world where a movie about Aunt May was considered as a Spider-Man spin off by Sony at one point, as just about every studio is desperate to create their own shared cinematic universe. Universal's 'Dark Universe' sounded like a fascinating idea (and to some extent still does), but The Mummy is definitely nowhere near the opening act Universal hoped for when deciding to kick-off the series a few years ago.\n\n'The Mummy' actually has far more scares than I thought, but also far fewer high-octane action scenes than one would come to expect from a Tom Cruise led film. In reality, the movie lies somewhere in the middle of an action-horror, and that's where the film's flaws tend to reveal themselves. Although Universal has been planning this universe for years, it doesn't seem like they knew the right tone to set for the set of films. I realize going the rated R route would be a bigger risk financially, but I think there could have been more done creatively instead. Why make a Mummy film if it's just going to be a safe action thriller with nothing new to add to the lore?\n\nAlex Kurtzman, who has done some great work in both writing and producing in the past, was given a big task with directing The Mummy as his second feature film. He's not entirely to blame for the blandness of the script and direction, but he certainly didn't add anything refreshing to the long running franchise. In fact, pretty much every aspect of this film is just okay. But that isn't the type of film you should lead your entire franchise with. You should come out wanting to see more from the universe. I'm not opposed to seeing films like The Bride of Frankenstein, The Creature of the Black Lagoon, Dracula, or The Invisible Man, but they need to re-establish a more fitting tone going forward.\n\nThe cast is likable, as expected. Sofia Boutella continues her streak of blockbuster success (after Kingsman & Star Trek) and does well as the creepy and seductive titular character. Annabelle Wallis is serviceable as a scientist of sorts to Dr. Jekyll's (Russel Crowe) Prodigium. And Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. The only character I felt to be out of place was Chris Vail played by Jake Johnson. He always seemed to be popping up at the wrong place and wrong time in this movie. Perhaps proposed as a comedic relief character, Vail's comedy never lands, and I hardly think it was because of Johnson's acting.\n\nOverall, I think The Mummy is a missed opportunity for Universal and their hopes of a new universe. With nothing new to add, grim tone, and a bland story, The Mummy isn't the beginning to Dark Universe I had hoped.\n\n+Acting\n\n-Tone\n\n-Dull\n\n5.0/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Did I read that right? Universal Studios is planning to remake all its legendary monster-movie classics from the 1930s in the next couple of years? \"The Mummy\" is only the first of a new series, and titles like \"The Invisible Man\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" are already in production? As a fanatic admirer of old-fashioned horror stories, I know I'm supposed to feel enthusiastic. But as a cynical critic and a heavy adversary of CGI-effects, I just know the revival of this monster cycle will only result in fancy-looking but substantially void and boisterous action vehicles full of atrocious computer effects and popular actors that are hopelessly miscast. I went into watching \"The Mummy\" with an open mindset, but my fears nevertheless got confirmed rather quickly.\n\nThe plot and screenplay are all over the place. Literally, in fact, as the film takes place in Iraq, Egypt and the London Underground. How can there possibly be Egyptian tombs in Iraq and London? Why is Dr. Jekyll investigating mummies and ancient Egyptian mysteries, even though he still hasn't found a remedy to permanently annihilate his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde? Why does Tom Cruise look more mummified than the real mummy? Cruise is more than 20 years older than his love-interest, but behaves like a spoiled and pimpled teenager most of the time. He depicts his characters as if he's starring in another installment in the \"Mission: Impossible\" or \"Jack Reacher\" franchise! The running gag with Tom Cruise's dead and gradually decaying buddy Vail is blatantly stolen from \"An American Werewolf in London\". On the positive side, I'm glad the titular monster is female, for a change. Princes Ahmanet definitely is one bad mother, and her background story at the beginning is easily the atmospheric and narrative highlight of the entire film. Admittedly there's a lot of violence, gore and special effects, but it's all computerized - as feared - and thus not the least bit unsettling or shocking. Even \"Scooby-Doo\" cartoons, or those childish mummy flicks starring Brendan Fraser, looked scarier than this.\n\nOkay, I realize I sound like an old and embittered sourpuss here, so why don't I just board my time-capsule and send myself back to the 1930's?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd read the bad reviews, but thought \"Hey, it's Tom Cruise - how bad could it be?\"   The answer is, \"Pretty bad\".\n\nIt's an ominous sign when a film starts with a voice-over (even if done by the sonorous tones of Russell Crowe). Regular readers of this blog will know I generally abhor voice-overs: it invariably belies a belief by the scriptwriters that they think the audience are too damn stupid to join up the plot-dots themselves. Here we portentously walk through the ancient Egyptian backstory of princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella, \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\"; \"Star Trek Beyond\") cursed to become the titular Mummy. We then skip forward to the present day and the film settles down, promisingly enough, with scavenging adventurer Nick Morton (Cruise, in Indiana Jones mode), discovering a lost Egyptian temple in war-torn modern-day Mesopotamia that for the sake of the world should have stayed lost.\n\nBut after an impressive plane crash (with zero G scenes filmed for real in a \"Vomit Comet\") the plot dissolves into a completely incoherent mush. With B-movie lines forcing B-movie acting performances,  the film lurches from plot crisis to plot crisis in a similar manner to the comically lurching undead Zombie-like creatures that Ahmanet has sucked the life out of.  (After 110 minutes of this, I know how they feel!)\n\nWhat were actors of this calibre doing in this mess? When I first saw the trailer for this, and saw that Cruise was in it, I thought this felt like an unusual career misstep for the megastar. After seeing the film, I'm even more mystified. Nick Morton is supposed to be an immoral bad guy. Immoral bad guy?? Tom Cruise?? Nope, you lost the audience on that one in the first ten minutes. Cruise, who is STILL only a year younger than I am (damn him, for real!) is still in great shape and must spend ALL his time in the gym. There must be a time soon coming though where he gets to a \"Roger Moore in View to a Kill\" moment where these action hero roles just no longer become credible anymore.\n\nAnd what was Russell Crowe, as a famous / infamous (yes, both!) doctor from literature doing in this? His character's involvement in the plot was almost completely inconsequential. In fact his 'affliction' only serves as a coincidental diversion (how convenient!) for bad Mummy- related action to happen. His character has no backstory and seems to serve only as a backbone for Universal's \"Dark Universe\" franchise that this movie is supposed to launch. (Good luck with that Universal after this stinker!)  Surely it would have made more sense to have the first film in the series to be the origins story for Crowe's character and the organisation he sets up. This would have made far more sense.\n\nAnnabelle Wallis, who is sweet and \"only\" 22 years his junior, plays Cruise's love interest in the film and equips herself well, given the material she has to play with. However (after \"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\") she must be kicking herself for not picking the 'right' summer blockbusters for her CV.  \n\nThe main culprit here is the plot, which again is mystifying given that the writing team includes David Koepp (\"Jurassic Park\"; \"Mission Impossible\"); Christopher McQuarrie (\"The Usual Suspects\", \"Edge of Tomorrow\") and Jon Spaihts (\"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\", \"Doctor Strange\").  A poor script can sometimes be salvaged by a good director, but here we have Alex Kurtzman, who has only one other directing credit to his name. And I'm afraid it shows. All round, not a good day at the office.\n\nBrian Tyler did the music (aside from the Danny Elfman opening \"Dark Universe\" fanfare) but it comprises what I would term \"running and jumping music\", with few discernible leitmotifs for the characters breaking through.\n\n\"Was that supposed to be funny?\" My wife's reaction after the film sums up that this really is a bit of a stinker. Best avoided.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)"

He isn't believable in the movie, and should be replaced if there is ever another Mummy movie. Personally, after sitting through this one, I hope they bury the story and let it rest in peace."

        "review_detailed_main": "An entertaining terror/adventure movie with thrills , visual overkill and bombastic special effects . It starts with Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) who comes across one particular tomb with hieroglyphs , leading him to realize what this means . Through flashbacks, Jekyll tells the story of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). She was a cunning warrior who was ready to succeed her father , the Pharaoh Menehptre . Along the way , an opportunistic U. S. Army reconnaissance sergeant, Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and an archaelogist (Annabelle Wallis) , inadvertently set her free , some 5,000 years after . Then the ancient Egyptian princess , though safely entombed in a crypt deep beneath the unforgiving desert , is awakened from her crypt beneath the desert, bringing with her malevolence grown over millennia, and terrors that defy human comprehension. Now, Ahmanet, the all-powerful vessel of destruction, thirsts to fulfil her destiny in our current day , as tragedy befalls present-day London. Things go wrong when the cursed mummified wants to resurrect his loved sweetheart . Welcome to a New World of Gods and Monsters !. Ancient evil returns !.\n\nIt is a silly and cheesy fun that nothing to do with the 1932 classy The Mummy (1932) by Karl Freund, starred by Boris Karloff , nor modern retelling The Mummy (1999) by Stephen Sommers with Brendan Fraser , being this The Mummy (2017) a very free , loose rendition to the vintage film . In fact , this is a simple and plain entertainment with no much sense in Saturday matinee tradition . A loudy and crowded retelling marred by its abundant Computer Generator FX and excessive digital visuals . It displays a great number of weird events and scary appearances as spooky skeletons , chillng tombs , terrifying Zombies-alike , astonishing mummies , flesh-eating monsters and anything else . Stars Tom Cruise giving a mediocre acting , he's miscast as U. S. Army Sergeant Nick Morton , a reconnaissance soldier who becomes involved into terrifying adventures . He's well accompanied by a good cast , such as Russsell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , Sofia Boutella, Courtney B. Vance, Annabelle Wallis , Jake Johnson, among others.\n\nThe Mummy (2017) fails really due to a twisted and unconvincing screenplay by the usually presitigious David Koepp , Christopher McQuarrie , Dylan Kussman and director Alex Kurtzman himself. It displays a thrilling and eerie musical score by composer Brian Tyler . Likewise, it packs an evocative and colorful cinematography by cameraman Ben Seresin . The motion picture was regularly wriiten and directed by Alex Kurtzman , and it has a number of flaws, failures , shortcomings and various non-sense scenes . Alex is an American filmmaker and screenwriter , specially known for making science fiction works. He directed \u00a8People Like Us\u00a8 and this panned 2017 reboot \u00a8The Mummy\u00a8 starring Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella. He wrote \u00a8Transformers 1 and 2\u00a8, \u00a8The Amazing Spider-Man 2\u00a8, \u00a8Star Trek\u00a8, \u00a8The Island\u00a8 and \u00a8Cowboys & Aliens\u00a8.

The Mummy offers good acting, special effects, and an effective story-line.\n\nThe only \"problem\" with the movie is its title. Just by associating itself with the Mummy title you go back expecting it to the Brandon Frasier title that we all love. \"Curse of Ahmanet\" or something similar would have been a more effective title. The other area of improvement is the run-time. By today's blockbuster standards this is a relatively short movie, clocking in under 2hrs. There were areas that could have been expanded, such as detailing the life of Ahmanet in ancient times. I would like it if the story continued through sequels, as there is more that can be explored with the content. I'm not talking about other \"Dark Universe\" movies. What would enhance this movie further would be the development of characters/plots through a direct sequel.\n\nIt is an entertaining title, but could have been improved through more character development and better use of a beautiful Egyptian setting."

The storyline was jagged, no fluidity to it.\n\nOh sure it had some good moments (and some funny ones) and the special effects (not so much in your face but always there) propped it up but without a good story there is only so much that special effects and A-listers can do.\n\nThe end was somewhat of an anti-climax and left the story very much open to continuation. Let us hope that the next film learns from its past mistakes.\n\nI was disappointed in it as it never met expectations and proves that having A-listers does not guarantee success. I suspect in time both Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe will have wished they never featured in it, definitely not one of their best moments."

I can imagine about the title, that is simple, straightforward, and not so surprising. The title is \"The Mummy\", so basically the mummy that will lead all the plots. In fact, you will believe me and you can write review after watching it, that the mummy is not really a central of the plots. Yet, the unnecessary appearances of the mummy, which is a lot to happen. Well, I really do not know whether the Director is really learning about Egyptian history, but the movie shows the mummy has the power somehow like a zombie. This is the weakest part of this movie. Mummy is not definitely a zombie! You can figure out also the figure of the mummy. She is not so scary, even for me, Indonesians or Thailand's ghosts are more scarier. Besides, Tom Cruise here is not playing smoothly, from beginning to the end. There is no serious talk, nor surprise scenes, nor romantic comedy, as he habitually played. The role of Russel Crow himself is also not so well. The movie can go, without the role of him. The other thing that I want to critic is about the ending. Wow, you will be disappointed. In brief, this movie is not a must-watch. This is a boring movie. You can watch later. Sorry, Tom Cruise. You can be better."

They and an attractive archaeologist (Annabelle Wallis) fly Ahmanet's sarcophagus to Britain when all hell breaks loose. Russell Crowe is also on hand.\n\n\"The Mummy\" (2017) is the reboot of The Mummy trilogy of 1999-2008 and the first official film in Universal's Dark Universe franchise, which reimagines & updates the classic universal monsters. The producers flirted with the idea of \"Dracula Untold\" (2014) being part of the Dark Universe, and the epilogue of that movie set in the modern world suggested this, but the idea was dropped. While \"The Mummy\" garnered $410 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted it.\n\nI found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s-40s of the previous trilogy; it prevented it from being the same-old-same-old. I also didn't mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt, e.g. northern Iraq and England; even Hammer's version from 1959 started in Egypt, but quickly moved to England. I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing. So the flick gets points for NOT being one-dimensional and hackneyed.\n\nI enjoyed it for the most part, although it coulda been more compelling in the latter portions. It has the same spirit of high adventure of the 1999 movie mixed with gothic horror (including creepy zombies) and a bit o' comedy, but not too much. While the curious inclusion of Dr. Jekyll (Crowe) smacked of pushing the new franchise, it didn't ruin the viewing experience. And winsome Wallis doesn't hurt.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in England; Burbank, California; and the Namib Desert, Namibia.\n\nGRADE: B"

        "review_detailed_main": "What were Universal thinking putting out an exceptionally poor product such as this from an inexperienced director known mostly for mechanical scripts? This movie is a lesson in how NOT to do virtually everything.\n\nTom Cruise is a woefully miscast here. This is not a character that fits him and this is not a genre he belongs in at all. It seems that Universal just rushed this nonsense into production as soon as he signed up without painstakingly planning it in advance. If this is supposed to be the first of a shared universe they could not possibly have started it off with a worse movie than this.\n\nThe Brendan Fraser Mummy movies were fun adventures with mild horror and a sense of high escapism. They were tightly directed and attractively shot with scores by Goldsmith and Silvestri that even managed to generate their very own successful low-brow spin-off series. Universal already had their shared Mummy universe.\n\nThis one...ugh! Besides Cruise being miscast I will stick to just two huge problems we have to suffer with this 2017 reboot. First of all the script is one of THE absolute worst examples of modern movie writing. Even worse than anything Lindelof has done. The dialogue is so head-bangingly poor that it defies belief. In my review of Alien: Covenant I said that the dialogue was so bad that it made the earliest of Scooby-Doo episodes look like Masterpiece Theatre. I thought that Alien: Covenant might represent the worse of the dialogue that might offend my ear drums this year. Sadly, no. The Mummy is EVEN WORSE.\n\nMany scenes are assembled with appalling voice-overs explaining what we are seeing. We don't need this. A competent director would use a visual narrative to guide the audience. Even Paul Anderson is capable of this. Not Kurtzman. He is so unable to bring this movie to life (pun intended) that he feels the need to turn the descriptive words into actual dialogue in case we are not smart enough to get it.\n\nNewsflash! Audiences do not like being condescended to. If you treat us like we are stupid you will not get a favorable response.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the poor dialogue is an attempt to make this more appealing to foreign markets who can paste their own nonsensical interpretation of the story over the uninspiring images. If this didn't sound bad enough they repeat themselves over and over and over and over too. I swear we saw the same flashback happen about three times. If you actually go see this then pay attention to Tom Cruises lines. All he says for the entire movie is \"Huh? Wha? Who? Where? Wha? Which? Huh? Buh? Wha? Who?\" His character Nick Morton (a lame gag if you dissect it) comes across as a senior citizen suffering from Alzheimer's. Or maybe Cruise had no idea what movie he was in and was genuinely uttering these words of confusion.\n\nSecond - the cinematography. Oh my good heavens...it's appalling. The darkness has been turned up in post-production (no one here had the ability to actually create an atmosphere in-camera) to the point where you have little orientation most of the time. Couple this with very bad editing and you'll struggle to find a sense of place or geography in most locations. There is a scene in a...thing, I'm not sure what it is, where Ahmanet is sucking the souls (or whatever) out of a couple of British bobbies. I have no idea where they were supposed to be. Was it a sewer, a pit, a dry dock, a graveyard, a river bank? No clue. I had absolutely no idea what I was looking at.\n\nThe clunky, cumbersome, clich\u00e9d components that are crudely clumped together to create this crapola are the most basic, childish fantasy tropes you can imagine. This is the kind of trash that barely passed for stories in 80s kid's cartoons. Universal are actually passing this off as a tentpole summer movie in 2017? They expect this to be acceptable for the start of an on-going franchise? It took SIX writers to come up with this?\n\nIf you are a fan of the Brendan Fraser series, worry not. It seems that Universal are not erasing those movies and are keeping it in continuity with this one since it features the book of Amun-Ra. However, its presence will just remind you that you could be watching a better movie.\n\nDespite my complaints (and many others I won't torture you with) I didn't hate this movie. It could have been scary and exciting if a better director and better writer were pulling the strings. This should have been low-key, it should have attempted some kind of modesty instead of arrogantly declaring itself the start off a new franchise as it seems more like the 2003 bomb The League of Extraordinary Gentleman than it does its own self-contained movie.\n\nA complete misfire and I can't recommend it at all. Skip it."

No character development just a couple of loud mouthed military wannabes who are clueless in the profession of arms. Then magically they find a tomb and have an archaeologist who couldn't make in through my 3rd grade science class much less a believable professional archaeologist.

The film lacks any horror or scary elements and has zero sense of fun. Russell Crowe is wasted and we only catch a glimpse of what his character can do. The Mummy is missing for chunks of the film and we only have the various exposition to know that she is after Cruise. Full of plot holes and wasted story elements. You kind of wish Sommers was asked to helm the reboot."

It didn't really on pure jump scares, or ridiculous over the top CGI action sequences, there was a nice balance to the whole film and the story, although could have included a little bit more of the faux history depth still came across well.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy impressed me with its spooky horror, top level stunt work and spectacular direction.\n\nThe storyline follows Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), who finds the crypt of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) and flies her crypt via airplane when things go amuck. She is awakened and then controls Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) to crashes the plane. He crashes the plane to curse Nick who wakes up despite the plane crash. Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) then hunts down Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) who is also looking for Princess Ahmanet and is the only who can cure Nick. However, when Ahmanet is fully formed, Nick needs to stop her from destroying London and goes to extreme levels to defeat Ahmanet and save Jenny (Annabelle Wallis).\n\nTom Cruise is versatile in his presentation of Nick Morton who cheats people because of his own selfishness. In the battle scenes, Cruise excels in his stunt work. Sofia Boutella as Princess Ahmanet is creepy, especially as The Mummy. She really suits the character of a princess relentless seeking power. Jake Johnson as Chris Vail provides comedic relief. Annabelle Wallis as Jenny Halsey clearly presents determination in tracking down Princess Ahmanet. However, she still falls to the trope of damsel in distress. Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll is my favorite character because he impressively presents the transition of his character.\n\nThe direction by Alex Kurtzman is splendid. The pace from scene to scene is superb and kept me at the edge of my seat. My favorite scene is when Ahmanet attacks London. The special effects are outrageously impactful. My only problem is that the movie's finale is quite anti-climactic. Despite this flaw, Tom Cruise fans will rejoice at this movie.\n\nThe movie's message is, even if you cheat others, you can always change to be selfless. Nick, though a thief, finds himself in the ultimate selfless sacrifice to save mankind. I give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 because of its intense horror. The movie releases in theaters on June 9, so check it out for one fast-paced thriller.\n\nReviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

I am critical of his private life but I can set him apart from movies he is in and nevertheless enjoy them.\n\nThird of all I went to the movie with low expectations and was looking to enjoy \"a guilty pleasure\" not a nutritious art house flick that I could brag about seeing.\n\nThis addresses the concerns I noted in positive reviews of this film.\n\nIt was awful, and I mean it had almost no redeeming features whatsoever.\n\nCGI was fine. 3D effects minimal. They were especially weak in dark scenes.\n\nThe film was highly edited and there was lots of CGI acting really never entered the equation. It was fine in the sense that criticism would be strictly based on whether you like these stars or not. I would agree Cruise had no special chemistry with his leading lady but that was the fault of the story and script.\n\nThe script and story were the worst I have seen in my memory, I contemplated leaving several times but I was too lazy. truly egregious. And I don't mean \"a story abut a reincarnated mummy is so silly\". I mean \"the story about a reincarnated mummy was the best story line and they should have stuck to that\".\n\nYou have been warned. A shame. Because if it had been no better or worse than \"average mummy shocker\" I would have been more than satisfied.\n\nAdvice to Universal: your Dark Universe idea needs CPR, get better writers and story lines or you are headed for failure.\n\nHow anyone could have seen the last five minutes of the film and not realized this movie needed to be re-worked, I don't understand.\n\nWow.

        "review_title": "Missed Brendan Fraser.",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's not the best sign when you miss Brendan Fraser(not hating on him, actually like some of his movies).\n\nWhere to begin\u0085I watched most of the Universal Monster films from the golden age of cinema. Being born in the 90's and growing up in that era I checked them out through Blockbuster and recall being fascinated by them(Yes Blockbuster, that should give you a good idea about my age). So with that being said, I was intrigued and had high hopes for Universal's Dark Universe.\n\nSadly, the Dark Universe is not off to a good start. This film promotes itself like a Mummy film, but it hardly has any Mummy in it, well not enough at least. It does have glimpses of potential, but it's more like a commercial for the audience to let us know that Universal has a plan for their Dark Universe. It's trying too hard to build a universe and trying way too fast. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, some of which are talented writers.\n\nAlex Kurtzman is a bit of a hit or miss a writer, but I do enjoy some of the films he has written. This is his second directorial feature and it definitely shows. While the action is decent at times, it's mostly framed up close and you don't really get to see much of it. Not to mention the dialog is also incredibly dull and choppy.\n\nSofia Boutella, the Mummy herself starts off promising, but then it falls apart as the movie progresses. While very acrobatic, and visually looks cool, she never came off as scary or creepy like Arnold Vosloo's performance in the 1999 film. If we're comparing there are moments of Vosloo's Mummy in the 1999 film where he's used in a creepy and scary manner. She's also not as compelling as Boris Karloff. She has a set of powers, and at times they are displayed to good effect, like raising zombies from the dead, but I never felt a sense of danger or any stakes involved. That really has to do with the fact that she spends most of her time either trying to seduce Tom Cruise or being a prisoner to Russell Crowe's Henry Jekyll. The fact that this event takes place within a span of two or three days tops didn't help either. Again, if we're comparing to the 1999 and 1932 version, they felt like a long event as opposed to being quickly wrapped up here with this film.\n\nRussell Crowe is a great actor to get whenever you need exposition. He delivers them with ease and his Jekyll/Hyde moment is a highlight to me. He is like the Nick Fury of this universe as he runs an organization called Prodigium. Through him we also get a lot of reference of what is supposed to come in the future. The rest of the cast Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson are just there. Wallis plays the typical love interest also providing exposition when the film needs it. As for Johnson, it's interesting because they tried to do something unique with him, but it ends up falling flat. That has to do with the fact that no explanation is given to why his character ends up a certain way at all.\n\nLastly, I haven't seen a movie in a while that really doesn't know what to do with Tom Cruise. This film misuses him in the worst way. His character Nick is just all over the place and one noted. Cruise's films lately showcases his ability to do action and the film does have two or three cool moments, including the scene underwater where he has to swim away from zombies, but it never really uses him to the full advantage for one big spectacle moment.\n\nThe idea of a female Mummy had me intrigued. A shared universe with Universal's classic monsters had me intrigued, and with the actors that they have casted, I was all in. When I heard about this announcement, however long ago it was, I was really hoping that this wasn't just purely a cash-grab, and based on the interviews I've seen of Alex Kurtzman it seemed as if he was genuine about this project and the future. While he may have meant it, the film however is a pure example of how not to make a corporate film.\n\nEvery studio has jumped the bandwagon on cinematic universes due to Marvel' success. I believe the difference is that while Marvel is corporate, they have people who care about their property and telling a good narrative. Sure they had their misfires, but they had patience and took their time with it. Universal approached it as if the audience wanted a cinematic universe for their classic monsters, but in truth(aside from me and maybe a few others), I don't think many people did.\n\nAside from a few amusing moments and some flashes of what could be a cool universe, it's disjointed and incredibly dull. Should the Dark Universe move forward I would hope that it picks itself up properly and deliver.\n\n5.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy has gone through some different phases during its lifetime, from its humble horror roots in the 1930s with Boris Karloff to its campy fun thrill ride with Brendan Fraser.\n\nNow comes Tom Cruise to usher The Mummy into a new era, and for a film that's supposed to kick-off the Dark Universe, a cinematic universe of classic monster icons, it could easily have been a disaster, a just reward for Universal's presumptuousness for thinking it could match the likes of Marvel for cinematic universe-building.\n\nInstead, while it's not without its flaws, The Mummy has some interesting twists and turns that make me want to see how they develop it from this point forward.\n\nIn the latest re-brand of the classic franchise, Tom Cruise plays the dapper Nick Morton, an Army reconnaissance officer with treasure- hunting ambitions, dragging along his sidekick Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) into a dubious plan to raid an Iraqi village swarming with insurgents of its antiquities.\n\nWhat they discover is nothing anyone expected: the long-lost tomb of Amonet (Sofia Boutella), an ancient princess robbed of her birthright who sold her soul to the Egyptian devil and lives again to wreak havoc on a modern world.\n\nOn the surface, this film seems to be clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, with the usual casual banter between the lead action hero and a love interest with not a whole lot to do (Annabelle Wallis filling this role) and random undead beings chasing our hero from one set piece to another.\n\nHowever, this film shines in what fills the space in between clich\u00e9s, such as the inevitable comic relief, Jack Johnson's Vail, who pops in now and again to provide good-natured humor without overstaying his welcome. Also, Ruseel Crowe's character, the head of a secret organization protecting the world from supernatural threats, fills a clich\u00e9 but provides an interesting preview of what is to come (I can't give his character name, as it would spoil the surprise).\n\nMost importantly, Sofia Boutella's re-imagined Mummy, while fulfilling clich\u00e9 monster badness, adds a certain amount of depth to her performance that propels this movie in ways that you may not expect, or if you do then at least in a manner that's satisfying rather than eye-roll worthy.\n\nFinally, it's the promise of what can be that makes this film so intriguing. Going into this film, I was skeptical as to whether or not this film could deliver on the same caliber as Iron Man for launching a cinematic universe. Now, I am intrigued by how they are going to deliver on all the teasing they do in one sequence through a vault of artifacts (also, be on the look-out for a blink-and-you-miss-it Easter egg to a previous Mummy film at about the half-way point).\n\nIt's not a great film, especially given its propensity for huge time- jumps that have to be explained with fragmented dialogue as to what happened during thousands of years-worth of history.\n\nNevertheless, The Mummy is a satisfactory launch of the Dark Universe, and I am curious for more."

Because the critics now-a-days (who are run by social media) choose to keep people of some groups (such as activists, PC people, and Artistic viewer, etc) happy by hitting the ones who try to entertain people, on their heads with a shovel.\n\nSo I would say its a fun film to keep yourself entertained for 2 hours of this summer. If you like a pop-corn flick with a shallow story and lots of action in it. I'd say go for it.\n\nNote: The way I see it, with these critics taking over the internet which a place everyone is hanging out these days, the film industry is going to reduce down to nothing but a production house which produces films which does not have any opinion for itself."

The worst being when Tom and Anna were sitting in the \"secret lab\" romanticizing. The movie production must have been rushed because over 90% of this film uses itself as more content. No back story, terrible acting, and even worse not even a sense of nostalgia to any of the old films. HORRIBLE absolutely F***KING HORRIBLE. <--- if I could bold this I would."

His chemistry with Annabelle Wells goes nowhere, I just wanted to roll my eyes at her every time she's on camera. Sofia Boutella is a pretty good villain, and effects are not bad. Russell Crowe is pretty descent in his role, but the film itself never seems to know what it is, although it appears to know, it fails at horror and adventure film."

Just when you thought that nothing new might come of an old story, (and an old movie reel-1932), the ever-imaginative mind of Hollywood comes up with an almost new riff on an old line...or maybe not. Tom Cruise, recently stirring up sci-fi and horror genres, after previous more notable efforts as hot-shot pilot, or military lawyer, etc., now gives us the average guy v a horrid, haughty hottie, aka The Mummy, a movie that no one was waiting for. If you saw the trailer for the movie, a sarcophagus being hauled in a large transport aircraft, then you saw the most compelling scene in the movie. Aside from the hot mummy girl writhing in sexually suggestive scenes, or using her powers to forcefully show the vengeance of a woman scorned, there is little that is entertaining in this flick. Watch the 1930's version, or even Hammer Films 1950's take. Both are superior films to this modern remake."

This is a monster movie, and yet you enlist Tom Cruise, one of the biggest action stars working today? All the trailers pointed to this being the next Mission: Impossible, more so than it being a horror movie. So I wasn't sure how they were going to make it work. And, overall, I think they struck an appropriate balance. There are certainly explosive action sequences, and these are excellent in terms of their execution. But I don't think The Mummy loses sight that it's ultimately a horror movie. There are a lot of horror motifs, but it is always infused into the action. I think it really worked to establish an appropriate tone for the movie. One may assume from reading this that I really liked this movie, but I don't. It has a lot of problems. The story is incredibly weak. There were a lot of writers involved in this one movie, and it certainly shows. It's really a mess in terms of storytelling, and the overall script is just poor. There were so many scenes dedicated solely to pointless exposition. Not just a passing couple lines, but straight minutes of characters simply explaining everything you need to know about what happened before and what is about to happen. It was so spoon-fed, as if the filmmakers didn't believe the audience was capable of wrapping their heads around the concept of the movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I was expecting this movie to be total garbage.\n\nSecond, this is definitely intended as the first of several Universal monster movie remakes, which will all take place in the same universe and have some degree of crossover. Some not too subtle nods to Jekyll and Hyde, Dracula, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Could have been more that I missed.\n\nThird, this film strays quite a bit from the original Mummy film and Fraser's Mummy movies.\n\nI was very worried about this movie. I'm a big fan of the original Universal monster films, and I was afraid that this would be another 2010 Wolfman. Thankfully, this time, the filmmakers hit the sweet spot - the movie fits well with modern audiences but pays homage to the original Universal monsters. It's not a fantastic movie, but it excels at what it is: an action monster romp and the introduction to the monster cinematic universe.\n\nThe film differs quite a bit from the original: it is set in modern day, and the mummy is female. The mummy being female doesn't change things that much, although the back story is changed quite a bit. I enjoyed the new back story and found it more interesting than the one in the original film and in Fraser's. The modern day setting added something fresh: let's not forget that we have seen 3 mummy films set back several decades in Egypt.\n\nTom Cruise plays the same sort of character that he always does, but it wasn't offensive here. Sofia is great as the mummy. Jake Johnson is enjoyable and funny, but thankfully doesn't overshadow the darker tones of the film. Russell Crowe is a treat. The other characters are serviceable.\n\nWithout getting too into spoilers, this new cinematic universe seems off to a great start. The concept of monsters in the modern age is handled mostly seriously, but with the occasional humor - this topic can't be taken completely seriously after all. It isn't as dim and grim and depressing as the DC universe seems to be headed, but it is more serious and gritty than the Marvel films.\n\nA pleasant surprise. Don't expect it to hold to the original film or the Fraser movies and you'll enjoy it. And with any amount of success, there will be more monster movies to follow."

This is pretty much a chase, reveal, chase chase, fight film - and it's enjoyable to not make me want to leave the room. Some parts had action, some had fun, some where good chuckles. There wasn't that much depth that you had to concentrate or know backstories, it was what it was, but saying that, people with a keen eye could get a lot more from it (take for example the easter eggs pointing towards future Dark Universe films).\n\nI won't compare this to the 90's Mummy film's as they are clearly a different entity (and I thought they were too cheesy anyway).

        "review_detailed_main": "I am quite disappointed with this movie, the mummy series brought out a feeling of adventure and joy for me. That was ruined in this movie, not only with casting Tom Cruise but, the layout of the story line.\n\nWhy on earth would one cast an actor, that has solely based his career on action packed drama and shooting at every turn. Into a role that has been portrayed as humorous, playful and saving the day role. A film that was based around a family, that was brought up on the archaeological curiosity for the Egyptian treasures. He brings out all the wrong elements, taking away the attention from the true sense of it.\n\nThe Dr. Henry Jekyll is a nice touch but, it was lost in casting the wrong person. It would have been better to have introduced him, in a manner that would have given the monster themes better credit. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, made better sense of the monster theme then in this film. It is a nice connection, and I would like to see it played out better in sequels but, not with Tom Cruise.\n\nThe way that the archaeological knowledge (that you see in the previous movies), was played out in this film was so bad and frustrating. I would imagine that an archaeologist would cringe at the very thought of watching this movie. There is too much missing from this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy (2017) - The launching point for Universal's 'Dark Universe' is, at best, an average action flick. Cheesy one-liners and pure convenience mar what could have been a successful introduction to this new franchise.\n\nI thought the studio's idea to bring back the classic monster movies was a little out there. But when they started getting A-list talent involved, it got me really interested. Tom Cruise in The Mummy, Russell Crowe as Jekyll & Hyde, Javier Bardem as Frankenstein's monster, and Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man? How do you not buy in to something like that? I can only hope those other movies can learn from this one.\n\nAs is often the downfall of potentially good films, this one suffers from being indecisive when it comes to tone. The main culprit is Tom Cruise's sidekick, played by Jake Johnson. While serious events are happening around every other character, he for some reason thinks he's in a late 90's comedy. His lines, and his character overall, are a big distraction. In a movie that has magic, mummies, and monsters, this guy's character was the most unbelievable element of the whole thing.\n\nSofia Boutella, however, was quite strong as the titular character. I hadn't gotten a whole lot out of her from the previews, but she was by far the standout. The lore that they introduced with her character was a driving force for the film and she played it perfectly. The writers did a solid job of making her sympathetic while also straight up evil.\n\nOn the surface, The Mummy is essentially an Egyptian episode of The Walking Dead. Yes it's entertaining, but we're ultimately just spinning our wheels. I only wish the movie had fully committed to the handful of darker moments that were peppered in. There's a great horror movie under there somewhere- the editor just couldn't find it."

Anyway, I thought this attempt by the studio to start their announced \"Dark Universe\" movie genre was an inauspicious start, to put it mildly. I guess some of the special effects are passable, and there are a few short bursts of okay action. But the movie's few merits are bogged down by its many shortcomings. One big problem I had with the movie is that there is far too much comic relief. Some comic relief would have been okay, but the movie not only goes overboard with it, it's not particularly funny to begin with. This overabundance of humor may be why a badly miscast Tom Cruise seems befuddled and unsure of what tone to play his character. Not only that, he and the rest of the cast are burdened with a script that simply does not make any of their characters interesting or worth caring about. In the end, the movie makes the Brendan Fraser \"Mummy\" movies seem like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in comparison, and it's no surprise that Universal has apparently put the Dark Universe franchise on hold."

Many things also weren't explained very well and the 'in movie exposition' was too convenient.\n\nWasn't Tom Cruises best work either, he was a pretty typical Tom Cruisey character but worse than other movies I've seen him in, he's getting a bit old to play the 'playboy'. The female leads and side character dude were probably the highlights.\n\nWorst part about the movie was the ending. Don't make a movie that will resolve/explain itself in a sequel, when the first movie hasn't proved its actually good. Maybe you have ideas in mind for the sequel and thats cool, but The Mummy basically feels like one story broken up into 2 movies. Super random and just leaves you unsatisfied at the end.\n\nDon't have a tone of positives except that it did a solid job at being a typical 'B' movie\n\nIt had a few almost thriller like moments so maybe avoid if you scare really easily."

        "review_detailed_main": "It definitely has a lot of flaws and it can feel like a generic Hollywood blockbuster at times, but it's fairly competent and has some good action. It has two major problems right up front: 1) this is supposed to be the start of Universal's new \"Dark Universe\" shared universe, dredging up its classic monsters for the studio's version of Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. This doesn't exactly sound like a good idea, especially with these being action movies and not horror flicks. 2) Tom Cruise stars, Tom Cruise has creative control and he wants it to be another Tom Cruise movie. Tom Cruise! Just had to say it once more to satisfy Tom Cruise's ego. This is also just a bad way to start a new franchise, especially one in which Tom Cruise is probably not going to pop up in every future installment. \"Tom Cruise movie\" is just not the way to go with the initial film in your franchise. So, yeah, this film definitely has elements at odds with each other. It still kind of works, in my opinion. Tom Cruise is certainly getting past his sell-by date and I think another star may have worked better, but he's not bad and he can still do action stuff, like the thrilling plane crash showed prominently in the trailers and the many, many chase sequences. The monsters are pretty decent, too. Nothing you haven't seen before, but pretty cool, jerky undead monsters. And Sofia Boutella is quite good as the main villain. Jake Johnson is also kind of fun as Cruise's sidekick, often used for comic relief. As a huge fan of Johnson from New Girl, I love seeing him in these movies even if he doesn't belong. Russell Crowe is also very good as, well, it's easy enough to see on the IMDb page but let's just say he's the major expansion of the Dark Universe in this film. Annabelle Wallis isn't bad as the lead actress, but she doesn't have all that much to do. My major gripes with the film are its clunky opening exposition and especially the way it ends, which is just kind of confusing. Obviously it was going to end going towards a sequel / the expanded universe, but I could have used a bit more info here. Very low expectations paid off well for me, and I certainly wouldn't unabashedly recommend it, but I definitely had fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Mummy\" (PG-13, 1:50) is the first film in Universal Studios' modern Dark Universe franchise. And why not? There's a lot of money to be made taking characters and properties with an established fan base and turning them into a string of modern feature films. Marvel Studios has its Marvel Cinematic Universe, Warner Bros. has the DC Extended Universe and Disney has Star Wars. Universal's plan to get in on the game? Updating the horror, suspense and science fiction movies that they've held the rights to since before movies could talk. As the silent film era waned and talkies replaced them, Universal released classics such as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (both starring Lon Chaney, Sr.), followed by \"Dracula\" (starring Bela Lugosi), then \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Mummy\" (both with Boris Karloff). Universal's original Dark Universe series continued through the 1950s, with several other monsters \u2013 and sequels to their more popular movies. Then there were sporadic cinematic appearances of these characters in early 21st century remakes, such as the underrated \"Dracula Untold\" (2014), \"The Wolfman\" (2010), \"Van Helsing\" (2004) and, of course, Brendan Fraser's \"Mummy\" movies (1999 and 2001). At Universal, in the mid-late 2010s, a plan emerged and the umpteenth\u0085 incarnation of \"The Mummy\" is the first step. The studio gave Tom Cruise the task of doing for their Dark Universe what Robert Downey, Jr. did for Marvel, Gal Godot (finally) did for DC and J.J. Abrams did for Disney.\n\n2017's \"The Mummy\" is the first in which the title character is a woman, and it's true what they say: Hell hath no fury like a woman mummy scorned. Or, in this case, denied the throne. In her fictional backstory set in ancient Egypt's Middle Kingdom, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) is next in line to rule Egypt, until the pharaoh's new wife gives him a son. Ahmanet retaliates by killing all three of them and making a deal with the devil, whom the ancient Egyptians called Set. This god of the desert, storms, disorder and violence gives Ahmanet super powers and all she has to do is sacrifice her lover by stabbing him with a special knife so Set can inhabit his body. But before she can complete the act, she is captured by the palace guards and then transported 1,000 miles away to Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) where she is mummified and buried alive in a large underground cavern, surrounded by statues of gods to guard her, hieroglyphic warnings of danger if her tomb is disturbed and liquid mercury, to weaken her evil powers.\n\nCruise plays Nick Morton, a former soldier who is now a soldier of fortune, stealing antiquities for personal profit\u0085 Indiana Jones without scruples. Nick is in war-torn Iraq with his partner in crime Chris Vale (Jake Johnson) looking for the legendary tomb of Ahmanet. They find it, with the help of a map that he stole from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), (after sleeping with her) and a well-timed, well-placed U.S. military air strike called in to disperse armed insurgents. When Jenny catches up with Nick and sees what he has unearthed, she demands that an Army colonel (Courtney B. Vance) use one of his helicopters to lift Ahmanet's sarcophagus out of its resting place and put in on a plane to fly it to London. On the way, Chris becomes possessed by Ahmanet's evil, a flock of birds flies through the cockpit and the plane crashes, with Nick still aboard. Yet he survives. British scientist Dr. Edward Jekyll (Russell Crowe, prepping for a Dark Universe movie of his own) tells Nick that Ahmanet has chosen him to help her and Set take over the world. Then, Ahmanet escapes, chaos ensues and only Nick can stop it.\n\n\"The Mummy\" is as dumb and ridiculous as it sounds. It doesn't have the scariness of Boris Karloff's films or the fun of Brendan Fraser's. This one's attempted scares come from its visual effects (which aren't much better than in 1999's \"The Mummy\") and its attempts at fun come from misplaced whimsy in the characters and supposedly comedic moments and lines that aren't very funny and are so frequent that they distract from the main plot, which is supposed to be tense and frightening. Screenwriters David Koepp (writer of several hits over the previous few years), Christopher McQuarrie (another successful screenwriter, who also directed \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation\" and \"Jack Reacher\") and Dylan Kussman (a career actor, co-writing his first movie) throw together elements that have worked in recent horror and superhero movies, but they end up with a confused mess of a story.\n\nDirector Alex Kurtzman (a long-time writer and producer who is directing his first major movie) can't seem to make sense of the script either\u0085 or strike any kind of reasonable tonal balance\u0085 or give his actors any kind of direction that makes their characters likable or even believable. Clearly trying to follow Marvel's template for its uber-successful MCU films, this movie instead flounders worse than the early Batman and Superman movies of the DC Extended Universe. Unless Universal quickly finds its equivalent of \"Wonder Woman\", the Dark Universe franchise is in trouble. In this version of \"The Mummy\", Ahmanet was buried for 5,000 years before she emerged, every bit as disagreeable as before. I'd suggest burying this movie for 5,000 years, but it probably wouldn't get better with age either. \"D+\""

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE MUMMY' was Alex Kurtzman's directorial debut, and stars Tom Cruise, Sophia Boutella and Annabelle Wallis. After unearthing an ancient Prison, Nick Morton(Tom Cruise) is chosen by an ancient, mummified princess(Sofia Boutella) to be the body of the God of Death. With the help of Jenny(Annabelle Wallis) and Henry(Russel Crowe), he must find a way to stop the curse before he becomes the God of Death.\n\nI'm sad to say that the 'Dark Universe' is not of to a good start. That is sad to say because I really like some of the ideas and characters in this movie. Tom Cruise tries his best to make it float and keeps the hamster wheel spinning. Russel Crowe is awesome as his character(who I will not spoil for you!). There are a lot of interesting concepts in this movie that I will be very interested to see expand in future installments. Despite all of this, it's a messy, incoherent mess that has very little other than Cruise and Crowe keeping it alive.\n\nThe plot of this movie is very clustered and very little thought went into it. They shoehorn a LOT of exposition in to the movie. I will honestly argue that 10% of this movie's script was exposition. That doesn't sound bad but that is still 12 whole minutes of screen time wasted. I get setting stuff up but when the first scene in the film is setting stuff up, you know you've messed up. They also try to set up their 'Dark Universe' which would have been fine if they didn't focus so much on it. This should have been called 'Dark Universe' and in tiny print 'featuring the mummy' because that is what it is; a feature length commercial for this new universe and that is not okay. The film comes first; not the world.\n\nNow that my gripes surrounding the 'plot' are out of the way, lets concentrate on the cast. As stated before, both Cruise and Crowe do great jobs and carry the movie. Sadly, they are not the only two characters. Sophia Boutella was very weak as 'The Mummy' and was about as bland and generic as villains come. Her motivation was nonsensical, she lacked any real threatening qualities and she was a side character in HER OWN MOVIE. Annabelle Wallis was also really weak as Jenny and, to paraphrase the late great Roger Ebert 'I don't believe her and Cruise were even on the same set, they had that little chemistry'. Again, not his exact words but I'm borrowing the phrase nonetheless.\n\nThe cinematography for this movie is meh at best. It was well shot, I will say that, but the editing and lighting and everything else was so poorly done. The effects were sub-par and didn't look in the least bit realistic. The costume design was pretty lazy and generic but the set design was very inventive and cool.\n\nSome of the action in this movie was fine. Some of the comedy worked. Some of the horror worked. That is actually the best way to describe this movie. Some of everything worked but not enough to make the movie great. Alas, as much as I really wanted to like this movie, I can't say I recommend it and I'll rate it a pretty generous 4 scenes-of-overly-complicated-exposition-and-stupid-explaining... out of 10, purely for Cruise and Crowe alone."

Personally, I believe these so called \"critics\" blew it way out of proportion and basically didn't give it a chance all because it was Tom Cruise as the hero instead of Fraser and Sofia Boutella as the villain instead of Arnold Vosloo. It was a fresh reboot and gave us a good look at Jekyll and Hyde (played by Russell Crowe). But, hey I can't change others opinions on this movie. I enjoyed it. It was an exciting and adrenaline rush movie, good bit of action and Tom Cruise was great as was Boutella and Annabelle Wallis. It's a shame though that because this movie failed in box office, Universal had to cancel it's \"Dark Universe.\""

The trendy thing to do in Hollywood now is to create several movies that tie loosely together, so why wouldn't Universal attempt it? Well, they shouldn't have, and making more would be a huge mistake.\n\nThis movie is terrible, in literally every way. Imagine if Underworld and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had a baby, and you have this movie.\n\nThe story is a mess, and the portrayal of the story is somehow even worse. It is filled with plot holes and scenes that go nowhere and defy the movie's own timeline. The characters are not believable and they have absolutely no connection on screen. It seems every actor jut wanted a paycheck. Cruise is getting lazy, for sure. Crowe's Dr. Jekyll is (to say the least) found wanting. Though some have said that the girl who played the so-called Mummy was excellent, I don't see it. She was simply being sex appeal while painted grey.\n\nThe humor falls flat, as well. You can't help but compare it to Brendan Fraser's Mummy; that film was absolutely excellent despite what it lacked in convincing cgi.\n\nSpeaking of which, the effects in this movie were trying too hard. Worst cg spiders ever, and that's saying something. The zombies that the Mummy uses move in ways that I know are supposed to be creepy, but they just come off like a 90's video game cut scene.\n\nSimply put, this movie isn't worth anything. It should not have been made. It would be entirely forgettable if it wasn't so freakishly awful. Pathetic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This incarnation of \"The Mummy\" solicits no sympathy from the audience. She brings the curse upon herself intentionally for selfish reasons. There's no clear explanation as to why that was necessary to obtain her goals, nor the consequences of her not completing a ritual.\n\nCruise takes up the majority of the screen time, and his character only serves as a target for the Mummy -- though there's no explanation given as to why the Mummy couldn't target someone else or even what exactly the consequences are of her catching or never catching him.\n\nOther characters are brought in to tie into the upcoming Dark Universe movies, but they serve little purpose in the film other than to act as shadowy agents that know about dangers such as the Mummy. They take a page or two out of Hellboy here, but it's just dropping hints of a larger world we'll see in later movies.\n\nMostly the movie is chase scenes, fight scenes, and poor attempts at humor. There's some semblance of a plan the Mummy has and some hand- waving at plans to prevent her from succeeding, but the movie is mostly action and chase scenes without much tension, horror, or suspense. I didn't even get the sense that there was a time frame for stopping the Mummy or for the Mummy to capture the \"hero.\"\n\nI much prefer the first Brendon Fraser Mummy. He was a cursed star- crossed lover of a princess, rises and steals parts from people to make himself whole, then tries to conjure the spirit of his beloved into the body of another using a book of spells... and there's a real sense of danger, horror, and suspense. There's tension in that time is running out for the heroes to translate a different book of spells to defeat him in time.\n\nThis movie was not a BAD film. It was disappointing because it was a missed opportunity, but I did enjoy the film. It was good, but not great... and a remake meant to launch a franchise should be great. This misses the mark, and I think that's why it gets so many harsh reviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rarely do I see a clear 'winner' of 'the worst film of the year' because I manage to avoid so many beforehand. However 2017 brought us a film worthy of that 'honor': It's the new \"Mummy\" rehash with Tom Cruise -- the most incompetent, mindless, brain-numbingly god-awful pretense of a movie experience I have seen in a decade or more. Directed as if he didn't even know what his own film was about, Alex Kurtzman has set a new standard of pointless action nonsense, attaining not a single minute of interest as frenzied drug-induced creatures dart into the camera like jack-in-the-box zombies while a bored-silly Sofia Boutella plays a third-rate Cleopatra turned goth. All the filmmakers connected with this turkey should be permanently sealed in a mummy case, or just have to sit through this film even once, a worse punishment.\n\nHere is a true story: as the end credits of this smelleroo began to crawl up the screen, I actually stood up, faced the audience, and shouted out in anger, \"This is by far the biggest piece of (expletive) I have seen in a movie theater in years!\" No one dissented and a few applauded. Do you know how bad a film has to be for me, usually a somewhat gentle soul, to resort to something like this in public?\n\nI could go on and on about how rotten this celluloid piece of baloney was, but why? This would just waste your time and mine. But maybe the saddest thing about this moronic \"Mummy\" was Russell Crowe posturing some silly Jekyll and Hyde caricature without an ounce of sincerity or credibility, evincing an embarrassed expression on his face as if he didn't want to be recognized. Considering his beyond-awful performance here (as well as his Javert in the elephantine stinker of 2012, \"Les Miserables\"), this once great actor seems to have made a decision to gut his entire career. What's next on Crowe's filmography: an amateur nudie flick? But take it from me; this stinker gives new meaning to the Curse of the Pharaohs. Avoid this bomb as you would the flu."

The flick then settles into its own odd mix of over-blown action, broad comedy (that rarely lands on both feet but also rarely annoys) and darkly-lit horror. Incidentally, it's the 'scary' moments which work the best, though the amount of horror in relation to everything else isn't balanced too well. The piece is mostly trite, the story being stupid schlock worthy of many a sigh right until it's semi-open ending - which is almost certain to leave you rolling your eyes - but I can't deny that I had some fun in a 'B-movie' kind of way. It isn't badly filmed, either, with some decent cinematography and relatively convincing visual effects. I think its been put through the wringer slightly too harshly, as there are plenty films worse than this released in 2017 alone, but you can see why audiences would start to be tired of studio mandated movies made only to kick-start 'cinematic universes' with little thought to their quality or underlying passion. It's not terrible, though, and probably worth a watch once if this is your kind of thing, but it isn't as good as most of the previous 'Mummy' titles either. 6/10"

It's hard to tell whether this movie falls flat because it has miscast the Cruiser, or because it fails to capitalise on his charisma by surrounding him with b-grade trimmings. The first act is thrilling, opening with a rip-roaring set piece full of bullets and explosions before culminating in a spectacular free-falling aircraft sequence that sees Cruise and co-star Annabelle Wallis perform some mightily impressive stunts. But from there it is all downhill, and at a rapid rate. The tone and atmosphere shift dramatically, going from Indiana Jones-esque perilous delights to non-spooky Gothic terror that maximises its dreariness by hiding under a gloomy colour palette. Going hand in hand with the awfully drab cinematography is a sudden over-reliance on cheap CGI, the herky-jerky undead are tremendously off-putting for all the wrong reasons, whilst the London-destroying climax is a pure mess of pixels. The presence of a plethora of screenwriters is felt too, the main plot is disappointingly rote\u2014especially considering Universal are hoping this kick starts their new intertwined monster universe\u2014and the film's internal logic is flimsy at best, resulting in many of its own rules being broken for the sake of easy narrative progression. Cruise is in default enthusiastic mode, which enlivens proceedings sporadically, and Wallis is a likable hero full of pluck, however Russell Crowe is wasted as a shadowy task force leader and Sofia Boutella is reduced to hissing and shrieking as the eponymous ancient princess. The promising start demonstrates the potential The Mummy had to deliver a rollicking good time; unfortunately it only serves to highlight just how dull and unsatisfying the rest of the movie really is."

There's some horror or thriller moments to it but in the end The Mummy is an action movie and with Tom Cruise as the lead we shouldn't have expected anything else really. Tom Cruise does what he is good at and that's shooting action flicks.\n\nThe reviews had been bad for the movie and didn't therefore expect much of the movie and perhaps that was part of the enjoyment that i found in the movie. The cast of Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella and Jake Johnson were good and Annabelle Wallis was solid at least but wasn't given that much opportunity to work with in my opinion. We have both Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe in a Mummy movie, try to put that thought in your mind when you think back at Brendan Fraser's the Mummy. The acting caliber is there but did Russell Crowe really fit inside this movie, he's clearly there to set-up the Universal's Dark Universe, but this have to be one of Russell Crowe worst performance in a movie.\n\nAlex Kurtzman might not have been the best person to start of this Dark Universe but i be damned if i wasn't entertained in watching this movie. It has flaws for sure but the chemistry between Cruise and Johnson in the beginning i though was top notch. Tom Cruise always manages to work great with comedic talents, we see that in the Mission Impossible franchise with Simon Pegg. It wasn't the start that Universal wanted for the Dark Universe but we can't doom it just yet. Marvel and their MCU didn't start of with the best movies. Sure Iron Man 1 was damn good, but The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 were kind of lackluster, so there's hope yet for Universal's Dark Universe.\n\nScore: 2.9/5 (Solid)\n\nwww.filmtvnow.wordpress.com"

The heroine is a truly charming Annabelle is a beauty that one falls in love immediately.Good choice of the director. The hero Tom Cruz finally had to do true sacrifice that sets for yet other Mummy Series to come in the future and I am expecting those future movies to be far more thrilling than this introductory piece. Can't wait for it. Supporting actors in lead roles like Crow, Johnson and many more have done a great job. Viscous but also sad in a waybut also true to the mythical ideology. I thought it was a great movie and a different kind of movie creation for Tom Cruz. I give it a 7.0"

The acting in the film is compelling and with a professional such as Cruise I would expect nothing less. The film even stars Russell Crowe as Dr Henry Jekyll which is a fitting addition in a film filled with ghouls and monsters.\n\nAlex Kurtzman did a good job in directing the introductory movie into the 'Dark Universe' \u2013 which will be Universal's addition to the on screen cinematic universes. Kurtzman brilliantly combined elements of the horror genre with the action genre to give audiences a really fun and well paced flick.\n\nThe use of special effects can often overshadow the story in films like these, but I was pleasantly surprised as all the effects used help to further the plot and look really impressive.\n\nOverall, I am excited to see what happens next in the story and I also look forward to seeing how Universal continues to expand their cinematic universe. I would give the film 7 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone longing for the monster films of old with a modern twist."

The storyline follows an ancient Egyptian Princess whose rule over Egypt was stolen from her when she was brutally murdered over a power play. Fast-forward to present day and her crypt has been disturbed and she has been released as a powerful sprit of sorts. One man will try to stop her and save humanity. This movie is directed by Alex Kurtzman (People Like Us) and stars Tom Cruise (Top Gun), Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Sofia Boutella (Atomic Blond) and Annabelle Wallis (Annabelle). The storyline and premise for this is poorly executed and Tom Cruise was a frustrating hero. It's really too bad because the special effects and villain was delivered very well. However, the greatness of the Mummy movies really weighs heavy on this and causes this to fall flat. With some better execution and writing this could have been better, but fails to live up to \"The Mummy\" films of the past. I would score this a 4/10 and recommend skipping it and watching the originals."

The film liberally steals ideas and images from all across the genre and, dysergically strings them together in a tedious, incoherent CGI-driven pastiche. Cruise, who plays his usual wisecracking uber-competent rascal, is in almost every scene, which is just as well as the rest of the bland cast are stuck playing trite, 2-D throw-away characters. The special effects are technically well-done but there is no coherence or logic (a sandstorm in London?), suggesting the scenes were written around the effects, not vice versa. The film was to be the first in \"Dark Universe\", Universal's attempt to build a mega-franchise based on their stable of iconic celluloid monsters. The first in the series was supposed to be 'Dracula Untold' (2014), but that was panned and subsequently disowned, and 'The Mummy' may be the stake through-the-heart/villagers-with-pitchforks/silver-bullet for the entire concept.

Even today's young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television. Comparing this to that, there's nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D. In my opinion, they should have waited another decade.\n\nIt was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film. I mean the character designs. Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession. Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand. The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England, but the plane crash down. Since then, an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men. Fighting against it, followed by how the story ends comes in the later parts.\n\nWhen I first heard about the reboot, I said oh no! Hearing about Tom Cruise's involvement, it became double no! Actually, he was good in the film, but the film was unnecessary at this generation. Even though it did good at the box office, it was considered a decent run. But the studio has a bigger plan, that you would know if you watch the film, that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long. If needed, it would add more in the latter. I feel that's a bad idea right now. Watching it one time is not bad, but no special at all.\n\n5.5/10"

Why would they conclude that, why didn't anyone react to that etc.\n\nIt's silly how they couldn't get the humor right. There were very few jokes that landed. Some felt on the right track, but needed some polishing and a retake. I'm even ok with no humor for such a movie, but not with failed humor."

Just a no brainer action film relying on so so CGI and a miss cast Tom Cruise still trying to prove he's still young enough to be the all American action guy. Russell Crowe, an actor not afraid to look and act his age tries to lend a bit of dignity to the proceedings as Doctor Jekyll, but looks as though he's wandered onto the wrong set. Maybe Universal should have thrown the Wolf Man and Creature From The Black Lagoon into the mix as well, and gotten this whole sorry Dark Universe thing out of the way in one hit? This one could never hope to stand up against the far superior originals, Boris Karloff's classic 1932 film, and Hammer Films 1959 version both blow this one out of the water for Spooky Atmosphere and storytelling! At least the Brendan Fraser trio of a few years back had enough humour to pass as send ups of the genre, but even then, if you want a real laugh you can't go past the Abbott & Costello one!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not gonna lie: I didn't see this movie in theaters and for a few reasons. First, the trailers did not sway me much. Second, this was intended to start the Dark Universe, a cinematic universe, in a similar fashion as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, intended to revive/reboot the Universal Monsters franchise; this disappointed me because Dracula Untold, which I did see in theaters and liked, was going to be the film to start this series, but when it didn't do as well as hoped Universal canned it in favor of having The Mummy be the launching pad. Third, the negative reviews certainly didn't help much, as I heard things from reviewers that really made me doubt that the movie would be any good. So, I waited until it was released for home media and rented it from Family Video not too long before the month of October, and the most shocking thing, while taking all those previous points into consideration, was that I actually liked it, and after watching it a 2nd time during the holiday season I still do. Now, it's not to say that this is a great movie, 'cuz it certainly isn't, but it's a fun action-adventure film that was just in an unfortunate position which I'll get into shortly. With all that said, let's talk about The Mummy, shall we?\n\nFirst of all, the cast is actually good. Tom Cruise is a lot of fun as Nick Morton: I like how he's not the most noble guy, or even that courageous, who let something loose that was never meant to be let loose by his own actions. The film tries to give him an arc where he goes from basically Nathan Drake from Uncharted if he was a straight-up dick to more of a hero; I feel like the arc could've been done a little better or at least had a little more time to develop, but it was a neat idea for a hero's journey that was executed just fine. Since Tom Cruise is his own stuntman, he brings a lot to the action scenes and it's really fun to watch, whether it's seeing him tumbling and floating in a plane that's going all mayday or seeing him get into physical combat with scary monsters. Annabelle Wallis does okay as Jenny; nothing great 'cuz the character doesn't have much depth, but she does fine. Jake Johnson as Vail, Nick's sidekick, has some funny lines and banter with Cruise that works; they take a turn with this character that's certainly taken wholesale from another (better) movie, but it was a turn that I didn't mind that much. Russell Crowe, a great actor, is a lot of fun to watch as Dr. Henry Jekyll, who runs the organization called Prodigium which tracks down, researches, and/or destroys anything supernatural or considered outlandish in the real world (sorta like S.H.I.E.L.D. from the MCU except they deal with monsters); Jekyll also has a monster of his own inside him: Mr. Hyde, who does show up at some point in the film and that leads into a fun sequence between him and Nick Morton (Cruise). But, the standout in the film has to be Sofia Boutella as the Mummy herself, Ahmanet, who seeks to use Nick as a means to put Set, an evil Egyptian god, into a vessel to basically rule the world after making a deal with the god due to being denied her place as the next-in-line to be the pharaoh of Egypt; Boutella is great in this: While Ahmanet can be seen as merely an ancient evil who seeks revenge, the actress brings a lot of emotion to the role, the makeup on her is amazing, her performance emulates a hypnotizing and seductive feeling that has you drawn in by her to where there's even a slight nuance to the character herself. I even own a Funko Pop! figure of Ahmanet, that's how much I liked Sofia Boutella and her character in this movie.\n\nThe story, while nothing special, isn't badly done at all. People say that it was convoluted and hard to follow. Convoluted? A bit, yeah, but not that much more than what we see in most blockbusters, I guess. Hard to follow? No. The plot is pretty much a variant of the Brendan Fraser Mummy from 1999, with certain plot points changed and the setting being updated to present day, so not that hard to follow, honestly.\n\nThe action scenes, directed by Alex Kurtzman, are actually pretty well-done. The plane sequence is great, the sequence where Nick and Jenny are being attacked by Ahmanet's zombie followers while driving in an ambulance is well done. The last 3rd of the movie is basically a series of action scenes/set pieces back-to-back, where there's no time to breathe really, going from Prodigium where Nick fights Mr. Hyde to a good chunk of London where Nick and Jenny try to evade Ahmanet, all of which was entertaining.\n\nNow, the flaws with this film, aside from the plot and execution of such being just decent, lie in the movie's approach in tone and its attempts at world-building. While it is fun to see some Easter eggs to other Universal Monsters, all those Easter eggs, as well as a big dump of exposition on what Prodigium is, come up at a certain point where the movie really does slow down, even to where it takes quite a bit of focus away from the Mummy who is supposed to be the title character. But, the movie's biggest issue is its tone: It's all over the place. Now, a movie juggling multiple different tones isn't a bad thing as long as it's executed well enough, but this movie's execution in juggling the different tones that it has is not very good; the movie would go from being serious and scary to funny, even within the same scene, and in such an abrupt transition, thus making it a bit of a jarring experience despite how fun the movie is.\n\nNow, with all that said and done, is The Mummy 2017 a bad movie? No, at least I don't think so. It's a fun flick that just seems to have been the victim of a studio's misguided attempts at pushing a franchise down people's throats and trying to copy the success of Marvel without really understanding why so many like and/or admire the MCU, thus resulting in things looking pretty grim for the Dark Universe before it even got off the ground. It's such a shame, too, because I didn't want this to fail, but it is what it is and all I can do is say that I still like The Mummy despite the happenstance. If you haven't seen The Mummy 2017, it's worth checking out; just don't expect it to be mind-blowing."

It doesn't even try to sneak him in.. and even if he was just an accent it may hf ave worked, but a major scene in the movie requires a direct confrontation with his alter ego. All that aside, it sours a really great adventure movie.. almost like Indiana Jones Lite. A great cast, a few jokes, and some pretty impressive effects, even a nod or two to the 90s remake. It was such an enjoyable movie soured by blatant crises promotion and greed."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Mummy\" is the third telling of the classic \"Mummy\" story and this time stars Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, and Jake Johnson, and while in Iraq, the thief discovers the tomb of a mummy from ancient Egypt and unleashes its hell into the world. I was in no way excited for this movie. I really enjoyed the first two Brenda Fraser Mummy movies-- \"The Mummy\" and \"The Mummy Returns\"-- but totally hated the third one of his \"Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\" That was by and large a straight atrocity to cinema, so I went into this hoping it would at least be better than that one, and luckily it is, but that's about it. This movie is okay, it's just fine. It's one of those movies that you would see if had something else to do and needed time to kill.\n\nMy biggest issues with the movie are the screenplay, tone, and visual effects. The screenplay tries to do so much in so little time. There are so many plot threads in this film it can become tiring following all of them, and it feels overstuffed. There's these visions Tom Cruise is seeing, there's this thing with Jake Johnson, there's this Knights Templar scene, there's this dagger with a jewel on its hilt that is totally not the Dagger of Time from Prince of Persia (seriously its the exact thing), there's Russell Crowe and his character, and of course there's the mummy stuff. This movie is 110 minutes long, and with everything they tried to cram into this movie it felt they were trying too hard to jump start a cinematic universe all in one movie, which to me is what led this movie to be overstuffed.\n\nThis movie is completely devoid of character development as well. Tom Cruise delivers a good performance and further proves that he is still an action star, but his character is not fleshed out. We just know that he's a thief and he awoke a centuries old mummy. Jack Johnson has literally nothing. Russell Crowe is probably the most developed character of the bunch, but even then he's overdeveloped for me in this movie. Annabelle Wallis' character... she came out of nowhere. What is her character?\n\nAs I've stated, Tom Cruise was good. It wasn't best performance, but he was functional and serviceable enough for me to actually somewhat care. For me the standout was Sofia Boutella as the Mummy. I think she is really an underrated actress. She's not gonna win any Oscars or anything, but she played the mummy very convincingly, and she seemed really dedicated in her performance.\n\nThis movie just didn't know what it wanted to be tone wise. Did it want to be the campy, action adventure, light hearted movie that the first two Brendan Fraser movies were, or did it want to be this dark, horror, scary suspense movie that the original was like. It's kind of somewhere in between. There's a lot of humor that doesn't land in this movie when the movie is trying to be a fun action-adventure, but then isn't too scary when it's going for the other end of the spectrum. It was just somewhere in the middle and it fell flat. The action scenes were somewhat fun. I will lie if say i wasn't entertained while watching them.\n\nBut while watching them, it's the visual effects that really distracted me, especially in the third act. That scene from the trailer where the mummy is a huge giant in London, yeah, the effects there weren't too great and really looked cheap. Also something with Russell Crowe's character that made me wanna laugh. His face literally turned black and blue and veins were protruding from his face, it looked like his face was ready to pop. It was really jarring. Speaking of Russell Crowe... other than The Nice Guys, since 2010 he has stopped caring. He's like Bruce Willis. He's Russell Crowe playing Russell Crowe. It's been bothering me for almost a decade now.\n\nThe movie wasn't atrocious like \"Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,\" was, however if I'm gonna watch Mummy movies I'm gonna watch the first two with Brendan Fraser and skip this one unless it's on cable TV or Hulu at 4 in the morning, and never touch Fraser's third one. It think it's \"fine.\" It's probably the best Mummy movie we are going to get at this point, which kind of disappoints me because I like monsters like this. I really wish \"Dracula Untold\" was part of this Dark Universe because even though that's not a good movie, I do enjoy watching that movie and had a lot more fun with that than I did with this. This is okay, a disposable summer blockbuster that will entertain some but not most.\n\nI am going to give \"The Mummy\" a C-\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review and if you have the chance check out my video review over on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUa1K2ujfbk"

        "review_detailed_main": "It goes without saying in today's world that film studios seem hell bent on creating the next big cinematic universe. Ever since the success of Marvel Studios has come about through the MCU, we've seen the likes of Warner Bros. try similar with the DCEU, both made up of a multitude of films that intertwine with one another, and now Universal have joined the party with the Dark Universe. With the vast array of classic monsters that Universal have at their disposal, the Dark Universe really does have great potential and they've gone to one of the classic monsters with The Mummy.\n\nWhen Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) awakens the ancient Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) from her tomb in Iraq, her terrible powers are threatened to be released upon the world.\n\nThe Mummy is an utter mess, unsure of whether it wants to actually tell a story about an iconic movie monster or just setup the Dark Universe it takes place within. Either way, The Mummy fails in delivering anything worth shouting home about. It'll be quite interesting to see where Universal take their Dark Universe from here on in however, they could have done with making sure its opening film was at least competent.\n\nThe story and screenplay don't really match up either. This is a universe I'm guessing will be aimed more at adults considering its 15 rating here in the UK, though you wouldn't think that with some of the childish moments that come about in the script. There's one standout action sequence in The Mummy, and it's the much talked about sequence in the crashing plane which they shot in a zero gravity environment. The rest of the action is rather forgettable to be honest, including a very dull finale that lacks any sort of adventure this film should be full of.\n\nComing to the performances, The Mummy features the worst Tom Cruise performance I've seen in a while. He's normally an actor I can depend on to give a solid performance however, he just doesn't deliver here. He's the big star of the film so I knew he was going to get a lot of screen time but I didn't expect it to effect the impact Sofia Boutella has in the titular role so much. Boutella showed she can be a fierce adversary in Kingsman yet she spends most of The Mummy living in Cruise's shadow. Jake Johnson makes for one of the most ridiculous and irritating characters of the year while Russell Crowe gives us one of the funniest cockney accents ever in the dual role of Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde.\n\nWith the Dark Universe now setup and some future films already announced, my only hope is that they can get better from here. I mean, they surely can't get worse, right?"

We then shift to \"England, Present Day\", where a large crusade burial chamber is discovered while constructing a new subway link. Then we flash back to ancient Egypt and the story of Princess Ahmanet. AFter that we shift to \"Iraq, Present Day\", as we get to know Nick and Chris, who are keen on finding artifacts for resale on the black market, and in a parallel path we are also introduced to Jenny, a British archaeologist. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest firm from producer-director Alex Kurtzman, best known for having (co-)written a number of big budget action movies (including The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Star Trek Into Darkness, etc.). Here Kurtzman reboots the Mummy franchise, with Tom Cruise as the front person. Cruise is omni-present in the movie, and in virtually every frame. I went to see this based on the tantalizing trailer which made it look like an incredible action movie with over the top stunts. And indeed there are a few of those scenes (best one is of course the airplane stunt, featured prominently in the trailer, which comes about 20 min. into the movie. Alas, after that, it's mostly CGI that dominates the film. No to mention the plot, which is as paper-thin as it is nonsensical. The supporting cast includes a small role for Russel Crowe as...yes, Jekyll/Hyde, I'm not kidding! \"The past cannot remain buried forever\", warns Jekyll early on. British actress Annabelle Wallis, who was in another big budget movie earlier this year (\"King Arthur\"), plays Cruise's female sidekick Jenny. I went to see this with my 30 yr. old son, and he was equally disappointed with the movie. \"I'm not sure what exactly the problem was, but it simply didn't jell\", was his comment to me as we were leaving the theater.\n\n\"The Mummy\" opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but just okay for being on opening weekend. If you like big budget action/adventure movies that are heavy on CGI, you may like this, or not. I love most of what Tom Cruise does (already looking forward to his next one \"American Made\", whose trailer played before \"The Mummy\"), but I felt let down, to be honest, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this. Viewer beware."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the opening salvo for Universal's Dark Universe, \"The Mummy\" is every bit a non-starter. It does nothing to generate the overarching wonder needed to propel such an effort along - no unique settings, no unique story elements, and no broad cast of characters an audience might clamor to know better. What there is, is Tom Cruise. He's a peculiar choice to lead us into this intended universe, as he's already fully associated with the M:I franchise and is much too established to \"grow into a role\". He's Tom Cruise. Full stop. Expecting \"The Mummy\" to rank near the top of a filmography as extensive as his is just setting it up for failure.\n\nYet, \"The Mummy\" somehow, someway...works. Not in the way that the Universal powers-that-be intended, but more in the mold of a cat-and-mouse psychological thriller. Cruise plays slightly against type, as a rapacious soldier/treasure hunter trekking around Iraq with good buddy Jake Johnson in search of antiquities, while contributing just enough to the war effort to stay under the radar. When the two happen across an ancient Egyptian tomb courtesy of a tip stolen from straight-laced archaeologist Annabelle Wallis, they think they've got the find of their lives.\n\nWhat they get is cursed, as the tomb houses power-mad princess Sofia Boutella, who swiftly settles on Cruise as the linchpin for her evil plan and transforms Johnson into a spectral ghoul meant to guide Cruise her way. Building toward the inevitable confrontation, the film eschews the outre swashbuckling of its predecessors and opts for a lower-key approach. Cruise struggles with the mental connection Boutella has initiated with him, along with his own dissolute nature, as he struggles with the very physical zombies left in the temptress's wake. And this temptress is a formidable one; Boutella is a dangerous, yet delicate, presence that's a fair change-up from your average monster.\n\nPerhaps even more curious than Cruise's presence here is that of Russell Crowe, who's aboard as the leader of an underground monster-hunting organization. It's the film's big try at world-building, and it must have sounded better in principle than it works in practice. It might go without saying, but this organization is full of people who aren't particularly good at their jobs. In the end, it's one more stumbling block for Cruise to negotiate. We do a get a rather enjoyable fight scene in the bargain, though.\n\nThat and the other action sequences are handled capably. Cruise performs with his trademark breakneck energy and owns those moments above any others. Admittedly, that's not difficult to do when his character's curse has him staggered and moon-faced at pretty much all times else. Plus, there's a (well-advertised) plane crash scene that's a genuine pulse-pounder. This is all well-balanced with a bizarre strain of dark humor that runs through the proceedings, and should have been played up more. Much of this is courtesy of ghoul Johnson, who proves a curse isn't enough to shatter a man's goofball nature as he pays repeated homage to \"An American Werewolf In London\". Crowe gets rather goofy himself as he regales Cruise with grandiose exposition, delivered with highbrow matter-of-factness and tongue firmly in cheek.\n\nAll in all, \"The Mummy\" is a diverting lark rather than the slam-bang blockbuster it was built up to be. It's never particularly predictable or lacking for pace, and Cruise remains as watchable as ever. In fact, the film could have benefited from more time to further develop his character, along with Wallis - who's unfortunately relegated to playing a rather generic damsel in distress, despite her demonstration of the chops needed to share the screen with a dynamo like Cruise. Upgrading her role to co-protagonist would have been a smart move. Given the tepid reception, it's hard to imagine this proposed Dark Universe gaining any steam. But, if this pair returns, anything to follow might just be worth a look."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy often feels like a nightmare. Not an interesting or memorable nightmare mind you, but the kind where you wake up mind boggled by the various avenues your stream of consciousness went sloshing around. It's just a mess - a huge, blundering, skin-festering, clich\u00e9-riddled, desperate mess.\n\nThe first sign of trouble occurs before the film even has a chance to introduce us to its characters. The Universal logo inverts its blue/green globe revealing an eclipsed Earth, with \"Dark Universe\" scrawled in big, bold, overly-confident gold letters. The hubris of a promised extended universe is then immediately undone by Tom Cruise's soldier of fortune, Nick Morton and his compromising exchange with franchise female dead-weight Annabelle Wallis. From there the movie sputters on the same broadly drawn characters and sweeping barrage of action set pieces that would have felt more at home in the 1999 Brendan Fraser movie. Yet while that movie played up its clich\u00e9s for cheeky laughs and cheap scares, this one wants you to take in the first twenty minutes like you're sucking down prized Kentucky mash.\n\nOnce the smoke has cleared both figuratively and literally, the movie introduces us to its titular monster, a cursed, soul-sucking Egyptian princess played by a very game and oh so terribly utilized Sofia Boutella. As refreshing as it may seem to have a female mummy, Universal's only real ace in this faux franchise so far, having her play this specific monster with sexual moxie is like asking to make high cuisine out of coprophagia.\n\nBut before we even see her face and can recognize her physical presence, we're forced to experience a farcical amount of brittle zombie attacks and really cheap looking CGI which makes you wonder where the $125 million it took to make this movie went. It clearly didn't go to making this movie look good. Principal photography took place in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England but it might as well have been shot in a hollowed out missile silo for all the under-lit, flat-looking and dull frames that assemble this movie. I was seriously wondering if I was watching a big-budget spectacle or an Underworld (2003-Present) movie.\n\nWhat's left of this quivering mass of insipidness has its neck snapped by the halfway mark. The movie stops cold to fully explore the minutia of Prodigium: The Dark Universe's analog to S.H.I.E.L.D. Only instead of it being a welcome distraction (the best possible scenario by this point), it more or less ends up being a sad reminder that Russell Crowe, the Oscar winning actor of high repute, actively doesn't give a s**t. And yes, Russell Crowe is in this movie and yes he does play Dr. Jekyl/Dr. Jekyl with a Cockney accent and yellow eyes. His choice to play the dual role like a drunken rendition of The Green Goblin is actually kind of admirable if you put the right lens against it - like Jesse Eisenberg in Baman V. Superman Ice Cream (2016) only with slightly less to do.\n\nI'm honestly at a loss at this point. Despite many attempts, not a single major studio has managed to match the chops of the Marvel Extended Universe, and I'm starting to think it's not even possible anymore. The Mummy has thrown both figuratively and literally the elastic man himself Tom Cruise at this problem and the only thing that came out of it is a busy, bloated and offensively dull movie with one of the most disappointing non-endings since Pushing Daisies (2007-2009)."

I grew up watching the old Universal monster movies (Frankenstein, The Wolfman, The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dracula). Those were all my favorites.\n\nWhen The Mummy came out back in the late 90's, I was a bit perplexed. Didn't watch it until I rented it and I loved it. It was funny, it was cheesy at times, and the CGI were not bad back then (although they haven't aged well at all). But it was a VERY enjoyable movie. I have to say, I liked the 2nd one not as much as the first, but the 3rd one was bad.\n\nNow we have Tom Cruise jumping into the foray. O'Connell he is not. Even the gratuitous scene with Cruise obviously naked just shows the aging he is going through. And the chemistry between his character and Annabelle's character is so off, it just defies all imagination. And come on. A special forces man also doing \"grave robbing\"? He'd have been court martialed in a second.\n\nThe CGI was even WORSE than in the second Brendan Frazier Mummy. And the action scenes were hard to watch. And reading how after being on a late-night TV show Cruise invited the entire audience to see the movie and he bused them to it just shows how hard they were trying to push this movie. I think they already knew it was bad.\n\nThe story-line is cheap, not hard to follow and yet they feel like the audience is stupid and they have to explain it all. I had to stop watching it mid-way through because I was falling asleep. I finished it the next day, only to discover there was only about 15 minutes left. Clocking under two hours, it felt like 4. It was that bad.\n\nWhat I really felt like they were trying to do is push this almost like a superhero movie. Are we really going to push the monsters into that direction? As super heroes? So glad I got this from our library. I feel for those that spent money for this obvious mess of a movie. And yet, it apparently is not the end. There are more coming. Ugh."

You never feel a connection to them as they were so shallow without any depth or interesting background. Also the threat just concentrates on a small circle of people and not on a whole scale. Its like the mummy stalks Tom Cruise, and thats about it. Cruise himself was really miscast. It felt like Ethan Hunt fighting off supernatural elements. The role first of all needed to be written funnier and it needed an actor who doesn't take the film or himself too seriously. Cruise tried that but failed. Annabelle Wallis was okay but her character was so uninteresting and it really didn't make a difference for the film if it existed or not. I liked Russell Crowe's Dr. Jeckyll /Mr Hyde attempt and really would like to see a film focusing on that. But even that was ridiculed by director Alex Kurtzman. Sofia Boutella was fine enough in the titular role. Jake Johnson tried too hard to be to comedic sidekick. Anyway, the positive thing about the film is the truly great visuality. Also some of the actions scenes, especially at the beginning were really great executed. Too bad it starts to fail once the Mummy appears. I hope the future films of the dark universe are better and more inspired than this typical Hollywood horror adventure."

One surprising element of this movie is the horror, and that's something the mummy trilogy lacked.

The only thing this movie suffers from is a silly plot, there's approximately half a dozen things that could have been improved in the narrative.

I've seen a lot of movies and reviewed a few of them. But my parameters of a good movie include an emotional connect with the characters, a good story and likable actors. The Mummy (2017) ensure it ticks all those boxes. The CGI is good and action sequences, some of them are breathtaking. This is in contradiction to some of the reviews. CGI is not bad at all. Tom cruise has this ability to make the characters he plays, likable. He's also got a good comic timing and those delivers some of the punch lines really well. Never during the movie would you feel bored. It keeps you at the edge of your seat with all the action unfolding scene by scene. Only felt that face in the sand animation was already done in the Brendan Fraser - Mummy movie so didn't come across as novelty. Loved the sound effects and some of the scenes appear with a bang and do manage to scare you. Having said all that, finding comedy, horror, thriller, action all in one movie, I just cannot complaint."

        "review_detailed_main": "In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much. Being a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror fan I had to watch it regardless of what people said about it of course. I have to say that I do not understand why so many seem to claim it is utter crap. Sure, it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either.\n\nIt is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good. That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after all.\n\nTo me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise. Total lack of charisma. He really do not succeed in his role. He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown into.\n\nRussell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll. I quite like Doctor Jekyll being thrown into the mix by the way. I think his role worked quite well and was well played.\n\nBeing a mummy movie there are of course a lot of supernatural stuff, curses, monsters and action. In general I think it was reasonably well done. The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, was not bad at all.\n\nOn the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress. There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work. I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for him.\n\nBottom line, I did enjoy the movie. As I wrote it is not really bad but it could have been quite a bit better. The good parts were sometimes really good but in between it felt like everyone went to lunch and let the janitors have a go at movie making."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although it certainly has its rockier moments, The Mummy is a solidly entertaining and action packed little creature flick that harnesses some great storytelling elements even if it can't help but be a bit stuffed by the end. I feel this film is criminally underrated, it wasn't anything great, nor was it quite as good as the 90's flick, but it certainly proves to be a worthy adversary and I enjoyed many things about it. The look of the film is fantastic, a haunted gothic daydream that proves to be continually beautiful shot after shot. The GGI can be a bit noticeable at times, but most of the action scene are incredibly well done, and most can be rather intense. None of the actors are great, but they all seem to be having fun with their respective roles. I wish we got to see more of the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, but Cruise does manage to be an entertaining lead as always, and Crowe and Wallis do prove to be fun little side characters. I'm a huge fan of Jake Johnson from New Girl and even from his underrated little comedy Let's Be Cops but he does not fit the vibe of this film, and every time he is on screen, the film shifts its tone to fit him with wonky dialogue that just seems too forced to laugh at. Some of the dialogue in general too can feel a bit forced, mainly towards the beginning, and the pacing a bit slower towards the end. In the end though, I enjoyed The Mummy for what it was, a solid little action flick that creatively reimagines yet another classic story.\n\nMy Rating: 7.25/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film felt like, it was somewhat of a slow burner. The opening scene, which told us of Ahmanet's back story, wasn't all that interesting and just felt like needless exposition. The first half of the film was boring Eventually however, the excitement level grew, thanks largely to some impressive CGI and action scenes. Sofia Boutella was captivating. Whenever she was on screen she had a presence that not even her co-star could compete with. She brought sensuality to the role that disturbingly made a partly decomposed corpse far more attractive than it had any right to be. Of all the actors in this film, she's the only one who can walk away with her head held high. This is undeniably a Tom Cruise movie, as it's built around his usual tropes. Amazing 'Mission: Impossible' style stunts, charming rogue falling for a younger woman and of course there's running scenes. He had no chemistry with his love interest Jenny. I think it's questionable that he's still playing these type of roles. The film would have benefited from a younger actor. Russell Crowe who played Dr Jekll. He hammed it up big time, making the most of his screen time. But would also have been better if he were younger. Overall, the editing of the film is ok but it's the script that has to be blamed. The film's story is subpar, there is no actual flow in the story as well. Technically, the film is OK."

The only monsters missing were werewolves and vampires. Still, the set design and the cinematography are all excellent, and the action sequences are great and there are no quick cuts or erratic camera movements.\n\nAs far as Cruise's performance in The Mummy goes, he's great. It's evident that Cruise is enjoying himself immensely throughout The Mummy, and that enthusiasm really shines through in his performance.\n\nIf you are expecting a Mummy movie like the old Hammer Horror movies or the Brendan Fraser ones, then you might be disappointed, otherwise there are a lot of exciting incidents in this movie, there's horror, there's jokes, and big action sequences. It looks good, it's fun, it's exciting and Tom cruise and the rest of the cast are excellent also..\n\nConclusion- Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, if you go see it with an open mind then you will enjoy it.. I myself had a wildly entertaining time, and I could not have enjoyed it more.\n\nMovie Score: 8/10"

The Dr Jekyll but was also poorly integrated into the story. This was a great concept that was unfortunately executed poorly."

        "review_detailed_main": "So here we go, then, Universal begin their rebirth of the Universal Creature franchise (Dark Universe) with a crack at old bandage features, The Mummy, sadly the result is very average at best. You would think that with so many \"Mummy\" films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us, well, something new to gorge on, but what we actually get is a painfully familiar.\n\nFrom a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work, it's loud, rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage, but Cruise is going through the motions, Crowe is laughably miscast (with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery), while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects work.\n\nIt's neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone, in fact it at times is very dull. There's also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures, a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled, whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancake.\n\nThere's some nice touches, the \"Mummy\" design is sharp (love those eyes), a plane crash is exhilarating and the film's stand out sequence, and the tomb/prison design is neat, but after that you start to scratch around for positives, which in itself tells a story. At least it looks and sounds great in HD, the colours and sub-woofer shakes a treat for the senses.\n\nIt's all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films, but the creators here make that inevitable. Lifting the plot from one of the 1940's films, and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making. It's unoriginal and as an opening salvo for a franchise it leaves Universal with a hell of a lot of work to do to make it work. 5/10"

There were no funny guys in this movie. I missed Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) and Jonathan (the Librarian's brother) in Fraser's Version of the Mummy, those guys were hilarious! This new version of the Mummy's funny attempts were NOT funny at all. When the guys got the life sucked out of them, like the previous \"Mummy\" they didn't die but became Zombies. I hate Zombie movies, they give me nightmares! The Script JUST HAD TOO MANY sensuous scenes throughout the movie. The Mummy Woman is supposed to be buried for 5,000 years so how come she is wearing TONS of makeup? Did she run down to the store and buy makeup or what? Do the producers take us for idiots to believe women just wake up with makeup or what?

Probably one of Cruise's weaker performances, to be honest. Not even Australia's Russell Crowe can save this.\n\nLook, this wasn't bad as far as supernatural action movies, but the modern day setting didn't do it completely for me, and there was none of what made the Stephen Sommers Mummy films so enjoyable: those subtle nods to the audience that to confirm everything is done with tongue firmly in cheek. Cruise just didn't deliver the same excellently madcap over-the-top performance that Fraser did.\n\nIt was always going to be a high bar to vault over, and unfortunately Cruise and co - despite cool special effects - didn't get close to Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo. Just like they should have left the Mummy entombed in all the movies, Universal should have left the Mummy franchise back in the early 00's."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think Tom Cruise is one of the best actors working today. Not necessarily because of his acting skills, but instead, his ability to perform amazing stunts. He climbed the burj Khalifa, he jumps between buildings, he climbs treacherous cliffs, and in the movie I'm reviewing today, he performed zero gravity stunts and dodged real explosives. 2017's The Mummy is a movie I'm mixed on. A part of me thinks it's a fun summer movie, and another part of me thinks the movie is a terrible startup to a new universe Universal Studios tried to create. I've watched this movie a handful of times, and I'm still conflicted with myself. Let's start with the pros of this movie. Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Russell Crowe are really good in this movie. Sofia Boutella especially is really good in this film as the main monster, the mummy itself. There are many great action sequences in this movie that really entertained me. The mythology of the mummy and its history in this movie intrigued me very much. Now let's dive into the cons of this movie. Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson are very weak characters in this movie. Annabelle Wallis is supposed to be the damsel in distress in this movie that gives exposition, and she wasn't an interesting character in this movie. Jake Johnson was the funny sidekick in this movie, and he was super annoying and barely gave good jokes. I found Tom Cruise's character to be funnier than Jake Johnson's character. This movie also resembled the original in ways, and that familiar feeling didn't make the film any better. Heck, the 1999 mummy and the 2017 mummy both have a sandstorm with a face in it. I recently got a 4k blu ray player and some 4k movies to match with my 4k TV, and my dad wanted to buy some 4k movies as well. He bought The Great Wall in 4K, which I heard isn't that good, and he bought The Mummy (2017) in 4K. He said he really enjoys these movies, and I just sighed in disappointment. This movie at times can be a fun summer movie, and at other times, a bloated movie that tries so hard to be original and fresh. I'd give The Mummy a 5/10"

        "review_title": "This new adaptation does not amuse, it does not scare, it does not start a new arc of films well",
        "review_detailed_main": "When Universal Studios decided to start plans for its \"Dark Universe\", in a series of interconnected films of its most famous monsters, similar to the shared universe Marvel, it seemed to be a really incredible idea and of extreme potential. The first film chosen by the studio to start the saga was \"The Mummy\", a new version of the classic of the 1930s and which also won a successful version in 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.\n\nThe intention was already that \"Dracula Untold\" and \"I, Frankenstein\" were part of this shared universe. The quality (or lack thereof) of these films, however, spoke for itself, causing Universal to postpone its project, which, now, in 2017, wins its first official entry, entitled to a name, Dark Universe being shown soon after the studio. Much falls on the shoulders of The Mummy, therefore, the newest reboot of the franchise after no less than nine Universal-only films since 1932 - a figure, therefore, more than established in the popular imagination. Initially, the studio called Andres Muschietti to direct the remake, which later disconnected from the project. After Andres Muschietti left the direction of the Mummy film, Universal Pictures put in the direction of Alex Kurtzman who had also been hired to make Universal's monster movie franchise, which he planned to do in addition to the mummy films, Van character films. Helsing, Werewolf, Invisible Man, among others. Filming then took place in Oxford, Surrey, London and Namibia.\n\nThis new version is extremely contestable. Here, we have fled the first half of the 20th century and see ourselves today. The work begins by telling us the story of the mummy in question, the daughter of the pharaoh who had made a pact with Set, but who ended up being mummified alive and buried far from Egypt. Having finished this story, which works as a prologue to the work, we left for Iraq, where the story begins to unfold. The script had a great risk that the text would show a greater concern for establishing the shared universe than developing its own story and that is exactly what happens. Everything that involves these characters not directly linked to the mummy sounds disconnected from the main plot to the point that we feel as if we are watching two films in one, with entirely dispensable sequences and that add absolutely nothing to the main plot. Do they open the way for the establishment of future films? Of course, but at the cost of expanding the narrative, making it tiring and fragmented. Within these \"extra\" sections, we met dr. Henry Jekyll, played by Russell Crowe, who brings us a really scary approach to the character, but that just doesn't match the rest of the work. It sounds like the movie is paused and suddenly another story starts to be told, making this bridge very bad, we are abruptly introduced to the new, and apparently meaningless, world of Universal's monsters. Not that the integration of a film into a universe is necessarily a bad thing, the problem here is that it should be done in such a forced and anti-climactic way, to the point that, if removed, the plot is not needed at all. On the positive side of this crossover between monsters, it is possible to remove the Prodigium organization and the easter eggs released by Crowe's office. If you still don't know how to work these properties, at least Universal has set it up in a way that allows you to present several other creatures with greater ease. The incongruence of the text starts right at the introduction, with the story of the princess, it is born incoherent from the moment when it is never clear why she needs to appeal to an evil deity, in order to become queen. As well as the mutant personality of the character of Cruise in the plot is discrepant. He can either be a boon to sleep with a girl and steal her the next morning, or he can be a great hero and save this same girl by putting her life ahead of yours. As these changes are not at all subtle or organic, it becomes difficult to believe in the protagonist's motivations and resolutions. Cruise, by the way, does not bring anything new and even shows some tiredness. There is an attempt to insert doses of humor throughout the narrative, especially through the personality of the protagonist, but the script does not seem to know whether to decide which atmosphere to focus on. The result is a film without an identity, which moves through genres without establishing itself in any of them - we have neither a horror film nor an adventure film, but a faulty hybrid of the two. You can say with conviction that the role of \"seductive scoundrel and joke\" may not be the beach of our Hollywood hero. And it's not! Totally out of his comfort zone, Cruise disappoints and probably delivers the worst performance of his career. If Cruise doesn't find his tone, the rest of the cast suffers from even greater deficiencies. Crowe is pathetic in his version of \"Doctor and Monster\", as well as Annabelle Wallis, she delivers a very old-fashioned \"girl\": beautiful, permanently well made up and always willing to be saved by a man on duty.\n\nSofia Boutella is, without a doubt, the best aspect of the film, with a penetrating look that lends a distinguished fury to the antagonist. The makeup work also draws attention, being original and showing a lot of attention to details, such as your nails and the bandages that surround it. In fact, the film trusts this portrait of the creature and soon dispenses with computer graphics in its decrepit form, favoring the work of the actress. When changing the sex of the monster, now experienced by Sofia Boutella, The Mummy puts itself in the position to explore new possibilities and bring a different vision to the tale. It is not what happens. The script focuses more on Tom Cruise's curse and transformations than on ex-princess Ahmanet's dilemmas. Boutella, although well in the film, is here only a charismatic and well-made face, which serves to set the future of Nick, the true protagonist of the film. Were it not for the few moments of suspense at the beginning of the appearance of the Mummy, it would be possible to say that the girl is in the background in history, since Dr. Jekyll also appears.\n\nThe need to do something great, exaggerated, guaranteeing extraordinary powers to the antagonist, but which are only used briefly, without any explanation. Photography, which is excessively dark at certain points, also does not help, devaluing all the work of makeup and production design, since we are unable to see almost anything. However, the feature has production merits. Some scenarios are well explored and it is well filmed as a whole (although a considerable part is lifeless, and the lifeless is not a metaphor for the situation). Highlight for the plane scene: tense, causes dilemmas in the characters and has a busy action, it is worth mentioning the 3D there, just there, by the way.... With more situations like that, the film would gain new life and be much more profitable. The beginning of the plot - at the present time - slips into something like that, at the moment when our heroes are cornered. The first act, by the way, is the best in the film. Basically, until the title character actually appears, the film works in a certain way. The second act is drowsy and the third is lazy - the latter, triggered, the worst.\n\nOwner of some good action scenes - like the zero gravity plane -, full of predictable scares and expressions of astonishment beyond Tom Cruise's bizarre, as well as the star's unexpected lack of comic timing, the new \"The Mummy\" too much failure. It does not amuse, it does not scare, it does not start a new arc of films well and, to make matters worse, it does not surpass in quality any of the several previous adaptations of the same story. Alex Kurtzman's great sin is not to arouse urgency or tension in any sequence of confrontation and danger. The Mummy's own threats and powers have no impact, although the scope of her magic is clear. Kurtzman is unable to represent the power of the character on screen, which has an interesting look, but is limited to resurrecting soldiers and conjuring sandstorms. The twisted start of this new world is due to the poorly structured replication of recipes explored by Disney and Warner, for example, in the cases of Marvel and Godzilla / Kong. The difference is in the command and idealization of these proposals. While some have a signature and care in the narrative and construction of heroes and villains, others think only of emulating a recipe that is not infallible - and that is the case with A Mummy. The production company, which introduced the first effective shared universe of theaters so many years ago, seems to want to shoot everywhere, without hitting any target. When deciding to focus more on external elements than those essential to the quality of the film itself, everything ends up becoming a huge mess, bringing us a tiring narrative, which makes it seem like the work has more than three hours, although it has less than two.\n\nAfter the monumental failure at the box office of the new version of The Mummy, Universal gave up on creating a universe shared with all the classic monsters, including Dracula and Frankstein. The studio initially wanted to bring all the monsters together in a series of films that would link up with the Marvel style. The idea didn't work out and the first two films in this franchise were financially disastrous. Because of this, Universal proposed new paths for the franchise, which will now have isolated films, made by directors with a subscription and no connection between one and the other."

It has a great supporting cast and Sofia Boutella as The Mummy was amazing, glad she was cast as it. Jake Johnson's character in it was funny which added to the enjoyment. You could've taken Russel Crowe's character straight outta there and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. What he was saying just confused me, didn't serve anything to the plot and he was barely shown. It had awesome visuals and was really well made. That scene in the plane was really something to look at,epic. They really shouldn't have shown as much of the fight and action scenes beforehand in the trailers etc. as it gave too much away and had viewers knowing what to expect. While many would say it was a floppy start-off to The Dark Universe, it thought it was a pretty good summer action block good enough for cinema viewing.Having Johnny Depp being a part of the Dark Universe certainly isn't going to help though he's not likable anymore."

So original I was meant to see this at the cinema but didn't get a chance and I'm glad as I didn't wast my money. It was on TV so gave it a watch little disappointed as there hyped this film up when it got premiered. I will get to the point the film was okay it had plenty of action and it certainly entertains you but it's a little boring in some scenes. The acting was good but it didn't really have much of a storyline like the other Mummy's it lacked the comedy parts and found it a little predictable in places it doesn't give you the edge of your seat feeling . It's nothing like the original Mummy's so don't get your hopes up. I have seen so much better films in my time the movie was okay not the best. That's why my rating is a 5. Its not what you think it is that's probably why there is mixed reviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mummy, the first film in Universal's proposed 'Dark Universe', designed to bring together all of the studio's classic monsters, is a colossal misfire, with a totally miscast A-list lead in Tom Cruise and a muddled script that feels like a generic blockbuster action flick rather than a horror movie based on an iconic creature with a huge cinematic legacy.\n\nThe 1999 version of The Mummy also went down the action film route, but at least director Stephen Sommers had the good sense to make his film good old-fashioned, light-hearted, Boys Own entertainment with a charismatic adventurer in a similar vein to Indiana Jones. This latest Mummy movie lacks the fun factor, and Cruise, far too old for this kind of thing, plays a character who comes across as a bit of an arse: he plays insubordinate soldier Nick Morton, who steals antiquities to sell on the black market and who, without thinking, releases an ancient evil upon the Earth.\n\nFailing to learn from the '99 film, which relied heavily on terrible CGI to realise it's titular monster, director Alex Kurtzman also uses digital trickery to create his mummy when it first appears (later, it turns into Sofia Boutella), and the result isn't great. CGI is also employed for spiders, rats and zombies, and none of it looks any good.\n\nNo effort is made at any time to deliver genuine atmosphere or scares, while attempts at injecting humour into proceedings fall flat, most notably the inclusion of Nick's undead buddy Corporal Chris Vail, a blatant crib from An American Werewolf in London, only nowhere near as funny.\n\nAs a result of this film bombing at the box office (and deservedly so), all plans to continue with the Dark Universe were shelved -- a shame, because in the right hands and with a proper horror approach, this could have been something very special for monster fans."

Although all he wants are things he can easily carry with him, his hopes are dashed when he is discovered by an archaeologist by the name of \"Jenny Halsey\" (Annabelle Wallis) who just happens to be accompanied by Nick Morton's military superiors. To that end, she insists that the military transports the sarcophagus to England for further evaluation. Of course, what none of them count on is the fact that this is no ordinary mummy within the sarcophagus and that Ahmanet has plans for Nick which include not only conquering the world but immortality as well. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay film which could have been much better if it had followed the standard mummy outline rather than deviating into a fast-paced action film. Quite frankly, like too many films produced today it had too much action and CGI and not enough suspense or horror-and not even the presence of Tom Cruise or all of the millions of dollars spent on marketing could save it from mediocrity. That said, while this certainly wasn't a bad movie by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average."

The Mummy was released in 2017 and was supposed to be the start of a rebooted franchise for the universe monsters. The Mummy plot synopsis goes as follows, The story follows Nick Morton, a soldier of fortune who unearths the tomb of an ancient princess named Ahmanet during a mission in the Middle East. Ahmanet, who had been entombed alive for attempting to summon the dark god Set, is awakened and seeks to complete her ritual to bring Set into the world. As Ahmanet wreaks havoc, Nick discovers he has been chosen as the vessel for Set. With the help of archaeologist Jenny Halsey and Dr. Henry Jekyll, Nick must stop Ahmanet and her dark plans while battling his own inner turmoil. It stars Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Sofia Boutella, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, Marwan Kenzari, and Russell Crowe. Cruise and Johnson do there best with the material there given but the material they are given is awful. There is no chemistry between Cruise and Vance. The only actor who seemed promising was Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll that lands straight on its face. The writing is bad with every character being flat and uninteresting. The mummy her self is your typical evil villain for the sake of evil. The cinema is fine but that is putting it lightly. The action scenes are good and usually entertaining. Mostly for the stunt work. The CGI is passable but most of the visuals are an ugly grey. The practical effects are impressive and work really well. The editing isn't bad but it's far from great. The pacing is very up and down with it dragging its feet in the second act and tripping in the third. Overall The Mummy is far inferior to the one in 1999 with Brendan Fraser. The main issue with this film is its writing. It focused so hard on wanting to be like the MCU that it forgets to be a good film first. It's bad but a great background movie. Still not worth your time. Watch the one from 1999.\n\n3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well. There was a disappointment! I never was much of a Mummy fan, even back in the day of \"Nightmare Theater\" the mummy movies were adventures in absurdity that even a six-year old boy (me) thought were an assault on my sensibilities. Many disagree, but there ya go.\n\nIn 1999 \"The Mummy\" came out. I didn't expect much, but it was actually a remarkably good film, turning the absurdities of the old Mummy movies into thrilling adventures that would have had the six-year old Bacon amazed (and scared).\n\nThis version carried the weight of heavy expectation based on the talent of the people involved in its making. The ridiculous anti-sexism sentiment of our day appears in the Mummy being a lady. Which is fine and Sofia Boutella does a great job, so I'll forgive them that although in my old, motorcycle hippie world, girls simply don't carry the horrific weight that is possible from a feller. I was surprised to see Tom Cruise cast in this role. He didn't do a bad job but I kept seeing Ethan Hunt, a role he played in a very similar way. I suppose the biggest disappointment was Russell Crowe who planted significant seed of hope, and who, naturally, performed very well an absolutely ridiculous role.\n\nIt was entertaining, fairly well done, but completely absurd. Glad I watched it, but won't be tempted for a repeat."

The awkward jokes land flat, the awkward romance, much of the dialogue is so plodding and predictable \"This is not a tomb...... It's a prison....\" Tom Cruise spends nearly 2 hours being hit but any excitement is drained from the movie as there's just no stakes, no sense of wonder, no class. I really couldn't have cared less watching this movie. The characters never come to life, the story feels like it's going through the motions and its just stuffed with dialogue explaining the plot to you.\n\nOn the plus side the cast try their best, some of the action and stunts are well shot but it's not really in service of a strong script. The scenes set in ancient Egypt were more interesting if I'm honest."

Tom Cruise is better with concepts that have a lot of action in them. For example Mission:Impossible. But he just doesn't fit in thriller or horror type of movies. Some people might feel a different way and that is totally fine! But just in my eyes he's not that good in horror and thriller movies. After all this movie was not good.

So you can pick and choose whether you want to go and see The Mummy at the cinema or not since many film critics haven't gave The Mummy great film reviews and good film ratings."

If they had, they would have noticed right from the first five minutes that Tom was trying to mimic Brendan's character, Rick, from the original film, which felt completely out of character for Tom. I haven't seen Tom in a dramedy since the 80s with \"Risky Business.\"\n\nMoreover, I was puzzled by the presence of top actors who contributed very little to the film. Killing off Courtney B. Within the first 10 minutes felt unnecessary. The script itself was weak, and overall, Tom's imitation of Brendan was a significant misstep. This movie is ultimately forgettable and will never take the place of the 1999 version, which is a classic mummy movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember being absolutely repelled by The Mummy's atrocious offerings back in 2017. It was simply a cinematic blunder, with its ridiculous, incoherent tone that okays in the creepiness but through annoying dialogue and mannerisms, misses miserably to replicate its predecessor's comedic tone. Its screenplay comes riddled with non-sensical and annoying beats, such as Tom Cruise's UNGODLY appeal that even the supernatural cannot resist. Despite these nuisances however, halfway through my second viewing, I found myself questioning these earliest thoughts as the picture resembled actual cinematic oomph. For instance, Sofia Boutella was actually amazing, drawing audiences with her terrorizing and alluring portrayal, worthy of carrying the mantle of Imhotep. The visual effects were just as praise-worthy, heightening the explosions & the ghostly aspects, effectively rendering the sense of undead rising from its premise. These positives were almost convincing, until The Mummy's FORSAKEN closing scenes played out and destroyed everything! The chosen episodes were a travesty, seriously maddening with its unelaborated randomness that renders the entire adventure as a mere facade. These as well ushers a final showdown that deserves to be effaced from memory, depleting Sofia's hard-earned menace and showcasing that Tom Cruise way too wholesome heroism that has long fizzled out. Yes, THAT was one of worst endings in cinema and I was a complete fool for ALMOST falling for its positives aka, death traps.\n\nAlex Kurtzman, what did we ever do to you? You have trampled on our fondest memories from the Fraser-Mummy franchise, and it was undeserved."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not much of a theater goer so I usually wait for most movies to show up on television. This is one of those. I heard all the negative press and read the bad reviews...but its actually a nice little film, albeit flawed.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of Cruise's, but he does do some nice work in the action genre. The Mummy is no exception. The special effects are dazzling, the plot moves along pretty briskly, and the scenery is eerie, creepy and well used. Where the movie falters, IMO, is its attempt to not be a Mummy movie while being a Mummy movie. The Brendon Fraser-led Mummy movies had a time and space about them. They paid homage to Indiana Jones as well as the old RKO adventure movies like King Solomon's Mines. This Mummy movie is set in the present and it lacks any real feel for the genre. It does have creepy moments and a globe trotting feel ALA Indiana Jones, but it never quite rises above the fact its trying to build a universe that doesn't actually exist. I would have been interested to see how they created the Monster Universe because it has so much potential, but the film is a let down in that I never got the feeling Cruise was playing anyone other then Cruise and the same could be said for Crowe.\n\nThe Mummy character as played by the lovely Sophia Boutella was wasted as well. The female character of Anck Su Namon from the 1999 version had more depth and presence than this character. Its a shame because Boutella was so good in the Kingsman film emoting with just her eyes and walk. I blame the director more than the actress.\n\nThe bright spots among the cast were Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson. Wallis could have been a one-dimensional damsel in distress, but she comports herself well and creates a well-defined, kick-ass character. Johnson is hilarious as Cruise' buddy. He comes across as both sardonic and creepy. Both made the movie above average for me.\n\nI'm sad to hear they have shelved the universe idea. I really enjoyed the old movies from the 1930s in my youth. It would have been fun to see how they would have meshed them. Sadly, it doesn't look like it will happen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I admit to being a HUGE fan of the 1999 Mummy, and whilst that may have made me slightly biased going into seeing this film, it definitely was not the soul reason that I received it so poorly.\n\nAt the very opening of this film I was actually intrigued, it opens with the burying of a Knight in the 14th century and then flashes forward to his tomb being found in modern day UK, and to be perfectly honest, I was just impressed that Hollywood was attempting to start this story without any narration. Enter Russell Crowe's character and narration.\n\nUnlike Imohtep, there is no real back story to this Mummy. She was essentially a princess about to lose her throne so she slaughtered her whole family. To do this she first made a deal with Set, the God of Death and became... possessed by evil? Yep, she's evil before she's even mummified, and apparently alive and powerful the whole time that she is buried, subdued only by mercury.\n\nFast forward to present day Iraq (no, none of the main action takes place in Egypt) and Tom Cruise's character attempting to find the coordinates written on a piece of paper he stole from Annabelle Wallis' character. Obviously, they find the place, there is the Mummy, they bring her back to England and everything goes awry.\n\nNow, if you want to know about the powers of the Mummy I cannot tell you as the film never fully explains them, nor her weaknesses. Apparently she has control over all spiders and can call the sands of Egypt to London but can also be taken out by a tranquilizer dart. This even happens twice in the movie, the first time as a way of explaining her burial, and the second in order to stall the plot for 20 minutes whilst Russell Crowe comes back and the existence of the Dark Universe is set up.\n\nAll of this makes for a pretty dull and confusing viewing experience, however, the worst element of the script might be the totally forced and unnecessary love story between Cruise and Wallis' character, as well as the fact that Wallis contributes absolutely nothing to the film. If you deleted her character completely the only thing that would change is the ridiculous ending (and this would only be a good thing).\n\nOn the positive side, some of the action sequences are creative and the film is overall very well shot (as it should be with this budget) and this is where Cruise shines as he is a great action actor. However, any attempts and humour or horror feel completely out of place in Mission Impossible with a Mummy and it was the mix of these two elements in 1999 which made that movie a good watch. This version takes itself way too seriously, and if this is the direction that Universal plans to take with other films in the Dark Universe then it would probably save everyone a lot of time and money if they quit whilst they're behind."

A new plan is in play that is supposedly planned for a while, with the first movie being The Mummy.\n\nUnlike Dracula and Frankenstein, which were based off of novels, the original Mummy had no source material and was produced at around the same time King Tut was unearthed and the idea of curses being scary. Though it was something of a remake of Dracula with mummies, it was a hit an spawned several movies, including the Brendon Frasier centered Mummy franchise. While none of them were really great, they had a lot of atmosphere and carried that mythical tone that the other Universal monsters had. With an all new The Mummy, we'll see if is a good resurrection.\n\nIn present day Iraq, Nick Morton (played by Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (played by Jake Johnson) are scavengers who raid to find ancient antiquities and sell them on the black market. The two accidentally stumble upon a tomb when an airstrike opens it. Nick, Chris, and archaeologist Jenny Halsey (played by Annabelle Wallis) explore it and discover that it's a prison for ancient Egyptians, but mostly for the Princess Ahmanet. The military extracts the sarcophagus and everyone gets on a plane to London, but not only does Chris seemed to by possessed, but the mummy's curse sends crows to take down the airplane.\n\nThough Jennifer was able to get a parachute, Nick ends up going down with the plane, but he miraculously wakes up in a morgue. It's discovered that Princess Ahmanet (played by Sofia Boutella) has awakened, is sucking the life out of people to make herself more human, and has placed a curse on Nick. Nick and Jennifer attempt to get away from this mummy, though are given help by a company called Prodiguim. Though Prodiguim's leader Dr. Henry Jekyll (played by Russell Crowe) insists that Nick's curse can be fixed, the mummy escapes and is intent on making the world hers again.\n\nI love the idea of trying to make the Universal monsters relevant again, but with The Mummy, what a bad way to start things. My problems with it stem not with how the monster is portrayed, but with the people around her. It feels like that The Mummy was written as a Tom Cruise vehicle rather then a monster movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the Mission Impossible franchise and a lot of his work, but not only is Cruise playing himself, but even he seems to be sidelined halfway for Dr. Jekyll.\n\nIt's clear that The Mummy has no idea what kind of movie it wants to be; an adventure, a comedy, a horror, or fantasy. The comedy from the 1999 Mummy movie was campy, at least the whole movie kept a similar tone throughout. A character here might spout a joke while dark horror elements are going on. I wouldn't be surprised if the film had been reshot several times. Going back to the tone, the film was actually the strongest when it was trying to be legitimately scary, with it's use of shadows and dark corners. I respect that they tries to make the mummy a scary character again, but the film needed more focus.\n\nI'll give this movie credit for making the mummy the best character in the whole movie. She's intimidating and her design looks good. Sofia Boutella might have given a performance that rivals Boris Karloff, had more attention been given to her. What's weird is that we get a long backstory of her in Ancient Egypt and her rise to power and eventual mummification, but that all stops the moment when Russell Crowe comes in to build exposition for more monster movies\u0085and it goes on for a half hour before The Mummy resumes its story.\n\nI'll give this four mummies out of ten. While it's not a disaster, its clear that The Mummy has too many cooks in the kitchen trying to make it several styles. If your looking for a simple action movie with horror elements, they are there, but its rarely consistent. Lets hope that Universal can find the right tone they need or there'll be no monster mash in the future."

This movie was bad. It was written for idiots going from exposition to exposition explaining everything that is happening in the movie so slow people can keep up. The actors poorly chosen for their roles, especially with Tom Cruise. Now don't get me wrong Tom Cruise is a weird guy but he is a decent actor... for some roles; this, however, is not one of those roles.\n\nIf anything hopefully this movie shows universal what not to do with the rest of their \"Dark Universe\" or what ever the hell they are calling it. They have such awesome material to work with and they are just wasting it."

A few days later I started it again. I made it maybe 5 mins past where I finished before. My husband watched about half. He had no idea I entered Valinor. The next morning it dawned on me why my skin looked better and I felt rested. My days went by but my nights, oh my nights, I could not wait to get home and turn this movie on. If only it could have lasted as long as blade runner 2049. Sadly the credits have ended. I cannot tell you any true details of the movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "No spoilers, just opinions on the movie's tone, character development, etc.\n\n'The Mummy' could have been so much better with just a few minor changes to the script and a few different choices by the director. It could have had that perfect balance of horror, wonder, and comedic relief that many blockbusters have achieved. Some examples - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981), 'Jurassic Park' (1993), and yes, 'The Mummy' (1999). There is a natural transition between awe and fear and comedic relief throughout these films, and these movies pull you in so deep that you don't feel manipulated. Not so with 'The Mummy' (2017).\n\nInstead, this movie feels forced. Like a mashup of horror movie clich\u00e9s plus bad comedy plus buddy movie clich\u00e9s. It feels like the filmmakers ran out of story development time or script rewrite time or both, then filmed the script as it was. The result is neither original nor scary, which would have been OK if the film was at least fun in some way. It isn't.\n\nAnd why isn't the movie fun? Because the characters aren't well-developed. The protagonist, Nick, is supposed to be a scoundrel of sorts. But we don't believe that because we never see any of his backstory. No character development. The Jenny buddy character is at first unlikable, then snap-morphs into a sympathetic sweetheart. Poor character development. The only character with any backstory is the mummy herself.\n\nTwo more obvious writing mistakes: excessive voice-over narration and TV news broadcasts. Both quick-and-easy ways of bringing the audience up to speed, but they both scream \"lazy writing\". You feel like you're being lectured. Good writing is hard, but it's worth the effort.\n\nAnother filmmaking shortcut: many scenes, supposedly indoors and outdoors, are lit with the exact same diffuse overhead lighting. Obviously filmed on a sound stage. Just a few more fill lights here and there would have created different atmospheres for these scenes. But no, most of the dimly lit scenes have the same stagey look-and-feel. This is the fault of the cinematographer. The cinematographer is also the official lighting director.\n\nSo, if you are a Sofia Boutella fan or a Tom Cruise fan, go see the film. Otherwise just go see some other better film for a second or third time."

The airplane crash is terrific which makes for a good start but it begins to grind down with too much exposition. There's no need for some of it. There is also a desperation to set up the franchise like introducing Dr. Jekyll which only muddles the movie.

It stars Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella and Russell Crowe and is directed by Alex Kurtzman. It tells the story of a man named Nick (played by Tom Cruise) who awakens an ancient mummy which curses him and wants to use him to rebuild the world.\n\nThe movie started out rather good. After a flashback which gives us a backstory, we are thrown straight into action with an incredibly fun action sequence with a very adventure flick feel to it, something we don't see often in Hollywood anymore. Then the plot kicks in and the premise is quite good, it really looked like it was going somewhere (except for too many cringy jokes). It had intense scenes, almost a horror movie feel at times and a freaky villain. But then, somewhere at mid-point of the movie, the whole plot turns around and basically becomes just a set-up for Dark Universe with so many easter eggs and references that are good on their own, but they don't fit into this movie. You can't just shoehorn in all of that and hope for the best. Even though I enjoyed those references, they made the plot feel very messy. And then we are getting to a climax and all of the sudden it's like none of those ever happened. Like we saw another movie in the second act, and then came back to the one we started watching because none of that setting up is brought up again until the very end which made it feel even more shoehorned in. Also, the climax could have been shorter. But still, with flaws it has, it's not a completely bad movie. I had a good time with it, I was very entertained, and the first half was very good (especially the woods sequence, I loved the woods sequence even though the whole movie turns around after that).\n\nThis started out good, it had a decent premise, but then the plot turned into a typical setting-up mess we see way too often these days. No one even tries to make a great movie when it comes to franchise anymore, they look way too much into the future movies. That's a bug in Hollywood that has to be fixed. But still, it was a fun movie, so if you are interested, I say go for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, disregard the \"haters\" of this re-make and Tom Cruise. Please recognize all re-makes are not (& should not) be a repeat of the original script.\n\nThis version has better action, special effects and unpredictability than most of the others. Now I loved the Brandon Frasier series of The Mummy and believe I will enjoy this new set. Yes, I believe it will have a sequel and deservingly so. I will spend the money to see any sequel.\n\nSecondly, if you enjoy Tom Cruise than this is a must-see. Yes, Tom dominates scenes as he is a great action star. Yes, there is always a love/romance angle in his flicks. Nothing more but you can see something possibly growing there.\n\nAnd thirdly/finally, accept the movies for what they are...Entertainment. I and family enjoyed this movie. It even had the wife/daughter jumping at some scary-like scenes which should happen in a monster movie. Some scenes made you smile and laugh but it shouldn't be/and wasn't a comedy.\n\nGood job Tom Cruise as always."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mummy movies date from 1932 when Boris Karloff was first bandaged up. Hammer exhumed several mummies, starting with Christopher Lee in 1959. Then in 1999 Stephen Sommers launched a spectacular new series with Brendan Fraser busily trying to send Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back to hell. The Imhotep movies were strong on CGI, as pacy as an Indiana Jones adventure and full of humour. This new version has plenty of CGI, an uneven pace and heavy-handed humour that mostly falls flat. Sofia Boutella may be sexier than Arnold Vosloo, but his Imhotep had a lot more charisma than her Ahmanet.\n\nThe desperate writers have also transcribed Dr Jekyll from Victorian London to a 21st-century laboratory, but he doesn't add anything to the mix other than make Russell Crowe look uncomfortable at lowering his standards. Tom Cruise seldom chooses a dud role, but here he has: his Ethan Hunt action man doesn't really work as Indiana Jones. The Mummy comes to life but the movie does not."

The pace and the action were thrilling, the effects were immersive and the characters likable and interesting. The rules of this universe surrounding the super nature were full of cool surprises. Sorry (not) that it wasn't full of in your face civil rights patronizing like Wonder Woman, but I think a movie should be judged by the content of its character rather than the number of interest groups it panders to."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really just can't fathom or understand why this movie so commonplace, banal and unfathomably boring. It resembles a mishmash of various episodes of Tales from the Crypt, without coherence, structure, campy fun or even a few jokes here or there. The Mummy is nothing, a movie about nothing, saying nothing about nothing, not even following the timeworn, by the numbers, formulaic script of movies like Tomb Raider, which was at least watchable. It might even be the worst movie ever made; far, far worse than John Carter, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the usual suspects, simply due to its...inherent nothingness, it's unforgivable monotony, which I can only describe as the all too common dream of running from some unseen danger while one's feet sink into the ground, stuck, trapped, helpless, in this case, forced to watch the movie in its entirety, hoping beyond hope it will somehow begin to resemble the Brendan Frasier classic (which succeeded simply by copying Indiana Jones). To put this into perspective, Nicolas Cage's National Treasure is like the Godfather when compared to this purgatory piece of trash. I mean this, really. If purgatory is real, it was be a place where one is forced to watch The Mummy for eternity. I truly don't get it. I'm not a producer, director, screenwriter or actor, but I'm at least aware enough to know how to identify the basic archetypes to a watchable, if not very good movie, especially one with tons of money and famous actors at its disposal (take movies like House of Wax, The Devil's Rejects, Texas Chainsaw, Wrong turn etc.--not masterpieces, but none the less very much fun to watch, because all the ingredients are there: the mongoloid, deformed child, the horny teenagers, the hillbilly kinfolk, the crazy family of psychopaths). What is truly amazing is how the producers and writers, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, were too inept and frankly stupid to understand this very basic concept. If you don't have a great idea, it's verse chorus verse, a no brainer. It's a gripe I have for sure\u2014following the formula to ensure the investment pays off\u2014but in this case they not only didn't follow the formula, it is as though they researched every film that failed and combined all these into one trite, soap opera of a failed blockbuster. Even Tom Cruise surprised me, the guy's not stupid; he knows his movies are over the top, but still makes movies like Mission Impossible, which are so much fun, so much pure entertainment, to watch again and again. Did he read the script? Did he understand what he was signing up for? Was he so obsessed and enamored with the cult of Scientology he forgot to all his experience and training? On principle alone, this \"movie\" should be boycotted at all costs, if for nothing more than for the insult it presents to those who expect at least a minimal sense of escape and enjoyment from a Tom Cruise film. It's the lie that makes me so mad. And the lie is this: my hard earned cash will at least give me some bare enjoyment. And f--k Russell Crowe."

I guess I have to keep tying to meet my character quota so here goes. Don't watch this unless you are willing to give up a couple hours of your life to this mindless waste of money. Who approves these movies to get green lit? Do they think because cruise is in it, it can't lose. Well they lost that bet. Hard pass on this. You will thank me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ok....I enjoyed this film, when I really shouldn't have. Anyone who points out that the similarities between the Cruise/Kurtzman 'Mummy' and the Brendon Fraser/Sommers version, would be correct. There is way too much in common, to the point where many people asked, 'Why do a remake for the 2017 audience?' And it wasn't just Tom Cruise taking Brendon Fraser's place. Jake Johnson takes John Hannah's place as the funny side-kick. Annabelle Wallis takes Rachel Weisz's character as the heroine. It was the good call of replacing Arnold Vasloo's villain with the lusty Sofia Boutella that helped create the seduction pull of this 2017 version. She brought in the male viewers, regardless of what male viewers would admit. And I like any film even better when Russell Crowe is in the cast. Ok....then if the 1999 version and the 2017 version are so much alike, why even like the 2017 version? Special effects ambience and story line had a creepier feel than the 1999 version. The 2017 version simply made more sense as a story. Yes, I know that the sand cloud with the evil face made a comeback, but lots of remakes have been made in Hollywood, and some remakes just turned out better. I gave this film a 9 because it just felt like Egyptian lore and evil incarnate. So in my household, toss away the Brendon Fraser version and keep the Cruise/Kurtzman version. The people who hate this film got polluted by the Fraser 'Mummy' films, or they believe Cruise is socially incorrect and can't stand him. I watched this film on HBO and have it saved for later viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, it's common knowledge that action movies are, for the most part (like in \"99%\") lowest common denominator products - and while this fact isn't exactly great, it's not inherently bad either: there IS such a thing as a well written, all around 'good', action movie. This new iteration of \"The Mummy\" simply isn't one. What it actually IS, instead, is a good summary of everything wrong with (a certain kind of) modern filmmaking and a GLARING example of just how much offensive a (bad) movie can be with its audience.\n\nThere are, mainly, a couple of reasons why this movie is insulting, the first one being that it assumes that you - the viewer - are an imbecile, completely devoid of any ability to understand even the simplest of things or, really, to actually think for yourself. The whole (almost) two hours of run-time are SO imbued in exposition - both through visuals and dialogue, often times together - that it feels like the movie is hammering every single concept into your brain and then banging your head against a brick wall, just to make sure you understand. Every single thing is said, shown, explained, discussed and then repeated and explained again.\n\nThis leads us to the second aspect in which this movie assume you are completely brain-dead: as soon as you start watching, it's almost like you can hear the producers laughing their butts off - they got your money upfront, now they are perfectly free to serve you a lazy, mediocre product that only exists as advertisement for Universal's \"Dark Universe\".\n\nThere's nothing even remotely memorable, here: not even the action or the special effects are worth mentioning and, in fact, are both a bit underwhelming, for this day and age. It's not that they're bad or terrible - they're just unimpressive and not at all inventive. Once again, the thought process here seems to be \"we have your money, we are now free to sell you this crap without even trying to make it good\".\n\nWriting, acting performances, editing, score - there isn't the slightest bit of effort in sight in any aspect. The best that can be said about any of these things is calling them \"bland\".\n\nNow, I don't mean to say that everything must be as good, original, thought-provoking and innovative as the new \"Twin Peaks\" show or that every movie must be an art-house film - as I said, there are 'good' action movies that DON'T treat their audience like a bunch of intellectually impaired sheep, but this isn't the case.\n\nWhat is even worse is that, sometimes, this mindless (other than rather pointless) pop-corn flick tries to address serious, very delicate issues of our time (like ISIS) and it does so in the less respectfully, most heavy-handed, clueless (and mildly racist) way possible.\n\nSo, all things considered: do yourself (and the world) a solid and have enough respect of your own intelligence NOT to go give any money to this insult."

This film has a completely new story which while being engrossing and action packed as you would think of Tom Cruise films does have a certain enjoyment which I honestly didn't expect. Intact to be honest I enjoyed this film far better than Jack Reacher and the latest Mission Impossible!\n\nOne thing which strikes me with all of these films involving super natural powers is the time it takes for then to start welding said powers, as we saw with X Men the mummy in that took the entire film and as far as I saw in this film the MUMMY only called upon her destructive powers once causing a hurricane in London, why?\n\nIn some ways the story got lost for me as it was less about saving the world and too much on how Tom Cruise was going to save himself.\n\nWatchable at the cinema, brain fodder.\n\nGuaranteed sequel."

Still, it was a fun way to pass a couple of hours. Close ups of Sofia Boutella were a highlight."
