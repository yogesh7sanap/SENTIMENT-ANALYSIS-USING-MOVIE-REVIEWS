        "review_detailed_main": "I'm watching this film well after it was released in the cinemas (in fact after seeing both Besharam and Chennai Express) so I know how the film had performed at the box office, and what most people thought of it so my expectations were high!\n\nYJHD does through the typical roller coaster of a Bollywood romance, but where it differs from those that have failed, is that it has the star power of Ranbir and Deepika at the top of their game, alongside lovely music by Pritam and fantastic direction by Ayan Mukherjee.\n\nAyan is certainly one of the top young directors in the industry, and after Wake Up Sid, shows exactly why he holds his mantle piece. This work will go down as one of his finest, even though I am sure he will make many more films.\n\nThis role is bread and butter for someone of Ranbir's stature now. He eases into the role, initially playing the fun going flirty young man, then growing into the serious, yet romantic mature man later. This role is not on the same level as Barfi, there is no comparison, however it's these types of roles that will keep Ranbir competing with the likes of SRK for the romantic king award! Deepika has grown massively this year, and this being the third film (Ram Leela is the 4th) she has hit the industry with a bang in 2013. She looks stunning on screen and plays her role perfectly! Kalki, as annoying as her role, again plays it without any blemishes. Her role reminds you of Zindagi Na Milenge Dobara quite a lot! Aditya seems to be alcoholic of 2013 with this and Aashiqui 2 but does full justice to the role regardless!\n\nAnother massive plus point to the film Pritam's music. It's soulful throughout and adds a lot to the film. Kabira, Ilahi and Balam Picharki are my favourites.\n\nOverall YJHD is a beautiful film with performances that will be hard to forget. It may not win any awards this year, but it will certainly will be a film I'll remember."

        "review_title": "Enjoyable but pretty much a rehash",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ayan Mukerji previously directed Wake Up Sid, his directorial debut, and he did a wonderful job with a film that was both refreshing and very good in and of itself. Just as it often goes with second ventures of promising first-timers, his next film, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, is nowhere as good. I knew nothing about this film when I started watching it except that it was an extraordinary mainstream success. But I was quite interested in watching it. The film is not bad at all, but it just doesn't live up the hype it seeks to generate at its core premise.\n\nThe film follows four youngsters in one of their last trips together before one of them leaves the country. While the film is beautifully shot and is a thoroughly enjoyable watch, it's never more than pleasant, it's never overwhelming, and there's hardly any reminiscence of what the title prepared us for - you'll see none of the youth craze or even youth culture that you would probably immediately associate with this film, and what is lacking at the heart of an otherwise watchable film is the much called-for wild spirit which Mukherjee doesn't manage to capture.\n\nAnd it's not that Mukerji doesn't try. He does. There are some scenes of running through the markets, there are catchy songs and pretty girls, but the script often makes the story not ring true. The only portion where it leaves a mark is in the relationship between the two friends who meet after many years. The romantic tension between the two leads does work to a point, but sometimes it's too polished and fairy tale-like to really be impactful. And the biggest problem, it mostly just feels a rehash of previous films. At points the references to old Dharma (the production company under which the film is produced) films, people, and songs, is really pathetic.\n\nThe film's characters are merely derivative of previous famous characters, and are never given enough depth. Ranbir Kapoor repeats his Wake Up Sid character, and he does it well although it feels he never allows himself to shed all his inhibitions. Aditya Roy Kapur is exceedingly good in some parts and struggles in others, while Kalki is wasted although she is consistently good. The winner of course is Deepika. Again, her character is just a recap of popular characters (Kajol's Anjali in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai; Preity Zinta's Naina in Kal Ho Naa Ho), but she is wonderful, subtly conveying much through her expressive eyes and the tiny, nuanced gestures on her pretty face.\n\nTowards the end, the film grows incresingly fluffy, corny and starry, much to the point of losing the lighthearted nature it sought to define back in the beginning of the show. Heavy music and numerous sentimental scenes are followed by a most shallow moment of realisation on the part of the male protagonist, which is not convincing enough. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is not bad, I have no doubt some would highly enjoy it. Actually I enjoyed it too, I just expected more from this film and was disappointed. Still so, it is watchable and entertaining, with some nice romantic and musical portions."

There are a lot of humorous moments but also a lot of good advice. The theme was not the only great aspect of Yeh Jawaani was the beautiful locations picked for the movie. The cinematography really brought out magic of travel and experiencing new things. Deepika once again displayed her acting genius with a transformation halfway through the movie. The new faces were excellent as well. The casting couldn't have been any better. Because I love traveling, maybe I am a bit biased. However, I do truly feel that it is a movie all youngsters should see. Its not too cheesy or dramatic, a bit for everyone to love."

The best part is, he never borrows from romantic clich\u00e9s that most love stories depend upon and that, in my opinion, is this film's biggest strength. Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... On the whole, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a revitalizing take on romance and relationships. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age-groups. Watch this celebration of love and get mesmerized!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed watching \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" quite a bit, though I'll admit that the story has a few clich\u00e9s here and there that kept it from being better. Still, given that I was watching it while flying across the Atlantic, it was a nice time-passer and kept my attention.\n\nThe film begins with Naina and her mother meeting up with a rather vacuous old schoolmate of Naina. While Naina graduated top of her class and is at the top of her class in medical school, this meeting with the schoolmate left Naina feeling that she's missing something...fun. So, on a lark, she decides to drop everything and head off on an adventure--and she picks the same destination the vacuous schoolmate chose. There, Naina slowly learns to unwind and meets sexy Bunny (he is a man--not some furry--despite the name). They hit it off and seem to be falling in love but one HUGE problem stands in their way--Bunny has vowed never to marry and wants to travel the world and experience EVERYTHING. What's to happen? See the film.\n\nLike the typical Bollywood film, this romance is predictable and there's lots of singing. You can't fault the film for this--this is THE format that Indian films follow these days and very few deviate from this. My problem with the film, and it's minor, was the silly scene were Naina takes off her glasses and instantly people notice how hot she is! What a clich\u00e9....plus my wife was much like Naina when I met her but is hot with and without her glasses! Still, it's fun and worth seeing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amidst the hype, Madhuri's ghagra, the Ranbir - Deepika relationship and others, there was a sense of hope and expectation with this film for me, just because is was directed by \"Ayan Mukerji\". The director of Wake up Sid, which was a film where I really thought of Ranbir as an actor for the future.\n\nThis film has a cast of some young and fresh actors who bring their A game to the table. Specially people like Aditya Roy Kapoor, Kalki, and of couse the ever charming Ranbir and Deepika. Their performances do give a fresh and joyous sense to the film.\n\nComing to the plot, there is nothing you do not expect, A guy who lives a carefree and adventure filled life (Ranbir) and a girl who is like the one friend we all have and know is a book o'holic.(Deepika). This film does not surprise you with the plot or gives a twist or takes unexpected turns, but the actors and the screenplay makes up for it.\n\nLike almost each and every Karan Johar film, this one has that first half fun filled and second half emotion filled plot, if you know what I mean......\n\nThe soundtrack delivered by Pritam is really foot tapping and catchy. Even with the emotional sogs, he does leave a mark. Don't be surprised if you find yourself humming some of the tunes even after you leave the hall. (Specially Subhanallah and Kabira)....\n\nSome of the locations of the film shot in manali which shows trekking are enjoyable...\n\nThe main fault with the film is the plot itself and how it is presented in a clich\u00e9d manner. I don't have a problem with a used plot, but it could have been presented in a way that it does not get boring and too predictable. Guess the makers didn't want to take a risk.\n\nThe characters in this film are well built and we connect to them. Even small roles like Ranbir's parents, Kalki, are well acted and most importantly relate-able.\n\nIn the end this is a film with good acting, good premise, great locations, songs, but does get very much predictable and some times uninteresting. I give it a 7/10"

But d movie falters in the 2nd half,with things getting repetitive,loaded with extra songs.... watch it for the item song,our super cool hero n his flirtatious nature, his emotions, his dance.. with deeps, his simply brilliantly directed scenes with his father(reminiscent of wake up Sid), ones with deeps n what not, dis guy is turning out to be the next complete actor man... Deeps too pitches in with a fine portrayal of a girl who loses all inhibitions n enacts a very lovely on screen pairing with kapoor...Aditya n kalki perform well again n give a a strong supporting cast. Kudos to Mr. Farooq(only 2 scenes) 4 his superb act of a father concerned about his kid but at d same time wishing to let him live his own life ...Also the feet tapping music, soulful Arijit, cinematography n direction... Wat would have worked the most could have been a crispier editing reducing the overall length by say 20 min....."

        "review_detailed_main": "\" Life is short ... live every moment until you regret it \" . Yeh Jawani Hain Dewani is all about friendship , adventure , fun and love celebrating each and every instance that will make you feel alive. The film was close to all these ... however it was the loose screenplay in the later part which plays the spoil-sport.\n\nYeh Jawani Hain Dewani brings you different set of people - A young , energetic , travel-enthusiasts who wants to make big in life, a studious-book worm who is sick of her life and wants to enjoy her life, an alcoholic-drug smitten gamblers who is wasting his life and a cool- rcok chic who is in a one-sided relationship. They all come together in one adventurous trip that will change their life forever.\n\nFrom the director of critically acclaimed WAKE-UP SID , Ayan Mukherji chooses a very different subject but falls into same old bollywood melodrama which we have witnessed so many times before. The first half begins with a bang and has routine song-drama with few hilarious moments but it is the second half which blocks the movement and goes in for a toss. Screenplay is average. Dialogues are decent at time otherwise repetitive. Art direction is awesome ( from the house of Karan Johar), Cinematography is eye-catching. Songs are just about average and nothing much to talk about. It is Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone who steals the show with their engrossing chemistry. i would not say it their break-through performance but it is good enough to pull out the movie from falling into pit. Aditya Roy Kapur goes over the top. Kalki Koechin is superb as Aditi.\n\nYeh Jawani Hain Deewani does not live upto the hype surrounding it. All glitters are not gold. Above average 2.75/5\n\nJoin me on www.facebook.com/Movienomics to read more reviews"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ayan Mukerji's 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is A Decent Light-Hearted Flick! It works till it lasts. If viewed with minimal expectations, chances of you being disappointed are ruled out!\n\n'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' Is The Same Old Love-Story of how Opposites Attract! A nerdish girl falls for a free-willing boy, but loses him when he leaves the country, only to reunite with him 8 years later!\n\n'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is clich\u00e9d & predictable, but it still delivers some charming moments. The First-Hour is smooth, but the Second-Hour could've been shorter. The excessive length of over 2 hours & 40 minutes, needed some trimming, at least by 20-minutes. The Screenplay, which is inspired by many Bollywood Classics, has a certain appeal to it. But i'd like to add, that, the humor isn't clever enough. Ayan Mukerji has taken a complete departure this time. After making the coming-of-age 'Wake Up Sid', he takes a complete turn in 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. He deserves credit for executing the film with style. Cinematography captures the exotic locales with flourish. Editing needed to be crispier. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Music by Pritam is foot-tapping.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Ranbir is dependable, as always. Deepika has emerged into such a fine performer. She's extremely natural & believable all through. Kalki Koechlin stands out. She delivers a fantastic performance, easily her finest to date. Aditya Roy Kapur is likable. Farooq Sheikh is simply outstanding in a brief role. Kunaal Roy Kapur & Evelyn Sharma are adequate. Madhuri Dixit sizzles in an item song.\n\nOn the whole, 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' is a thoroughly watchable film."

The movie has a really big star cast - Ranbir, Deepika, Farroq Sheikh, etc but they fail to stimulate except Ranbir Kapoor and Kalki Koechlin. Deepika's dialogues put you to sleep. Her narration in the movie is extremely weak and is ridden with clich\u00e9s. The story begins with flashback and there are some moments of excitement. Despite beginning with some promise the movie slows in the middle and ends up faltering. Though I enjoyed some of the moments in the movie but overall the screenplay does poor justification to what may have been a good storyline to begin with. The screenplay writer of this movie should really think hard if this is what he/she wants to do for life."

I'm not going to spoil it too much but the plot is simple, four friends and an adventure of a lifetime. Ranbir and Deepika's chemistry on screen is lovely and Kalki is just crack up in the first half. In Aishiqui 2 Aditya Roy Kapoor is seen as a lover boy, but that all turns upside down in YJHD, in YJHD Aditya Roy Kapoor is seen as a gambler that keeps losing money. All the songs are great especially 'Balam Pichkari' and having Madhuri do a item no. was a brilliant idea. Just something i did not like was how long it was and also when Deepika and Ranbir are seen kissing the photography is very close up (you can see every step of kissing). YJHD is DIFFERENT to 'Wake Up Sid'.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10 (but that is just my rating)\n\nsomething i will always remember: \"i want to run, i want to fly, i even want to fall, but i don't want to stop' - Ranbir Kapoor (YJHD)"

The sizzling chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika is the only reason why this movie works. The movie does not have any thing to capture your heart or make you miss a beat, but it entertains you with amazing performances, music, locations and freshness in old drama.\n\nThe 'Badtameez' is unarguably the heart of the movie or the show stopping characteristic of Ranbir Kapoor. For those who wish to fall for Deepika over and over again, the movie could be a good catch. With Pritam's nice music and Balam Pichakari groove to move your body, the movie is surely going to rock your feet.\n\nBut once again beware of the same 'LOVE' climax that would fan off your interest at one point. Climax of the movie is predictable like their crazy journey ultimately reaches its destination 'Love'. The movie doesn't have exceptional plot or story, but it's worth watching one time for the fresh moments it captures. It will give you a \"very little\" cool breeze."

The second half was made slightly better by the stronger dialogue.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is how a movie can be made that's almost three hours long but still gives you the feeling at the end of the day that the allegedly sumptuous meal you've just eaten hasn't filled half your belly.\n\nI'm not going to watch any more coming-of-age Bollywood movies. I'm through with beating the dead horse."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a fan of Indian movies since I've watched 3 idiots and while I was searching for another Indian movie to watch with a genre of romantic-comedy (with the likes of Hasee To Phasee, Jab We Met, Khoobsurat) I came across this movie in one of the suggestions.\n\nAt first I was hesitant to watch this since it's my first time to watch a film starred by Deepika & Ranbir. I've read in some articles that they are quite famous but still I haven't watched yet their movies.\n\nSo it was kinda surprising for me when I saw this film. Yes, it have some cheesy lines and moments delivered by Ranbir but somehow when he delivered it, these scenes became different. It was not cheesy but it became romantic that you watching can't help but smile. :)\n\nThe lead stars have total chemistry! Even though there were scenes that they were not saying anything, but its in their eyes that they were totally expressing it. Through their stares, you can feel the emotion they are trying to convey. Awesome performance by the way!\n\nThe plot also was very nice. You thought that this would happen but the next thing you know, it will be totally different. It was realistic & it showed that sometimes you have to choose between your dreams and the love of your life. That it doesn't mean that if you love a person, he/she will be the one for you and to spend the rest of your life with. A lot of people could really relate to this film. All in all, a very big thumbs up for this movie! If you want a feel good, make-you-want-to-smile-but- also-cry kinda movie then you should definitely watch this. You won't be disappointed. :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating: 5/10\n\nHe takes up a ghissa-pita story, much like his debut Wake Up Sid and tries to turn it around. With the cast so heavily gorgeous giving out performances like its their last, revs up the movie-watching experience only for the first half. The second half sucks and drags a lot with cheeky references and illogical sequences. Overall, the route taken to say an old, short, romantic story, is arduous and infested with clich\u00e9s as it dives into deep philosophy...\n\nTraces of Dil Chahta Hai, Rang De Basanti, Kai Po Che & even Aashiqui 2 is explicit, so is the filmmaking which feels like they have been inspired by Zoya Akhtar. Even the screenplay is timid. The story is clich\u00e9d, yes, and to make it worse, the climax actually works against the film although it is justified for a theme like this. Unpredictability is stereotype here but Ayan molds it for his audience as a fun, frothy buddy flick which actually loses pace when theme of Rockstar & Karan Johar led family ties enter the plot.. Juxtaposed with heavy numbers, life elements, relationships, romance & social conflicts, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani only appeals till midway.\n\nRanbir (who the film is almost based upon with the decisions he has to make as a complelling life of a nomad) & Deepike jazz up the screen with no mistake at all; yet Deepika's sudden shift from a pious, studious dame to her usual party- girl avatar is fishy , while Kalki & Aditya pass, with the script not letting them explore their insights. Kunaal is apt for the role while I still cannot construe what Poornima, Dixit & Rana were doing there. Revealing their characters may spoil the watch. Parental conflicts, much like in WUS is prevalent. Supporting cast (Farooq, Tanvi) is terrific. Music is brilliant and the locations add up to the movie-watching experience. At 165 minutes, the play seems to immensely go out of bounds, but the lead pair try hard and dishearteningly fail to keep us hooked. Emotions are played with and usual jealousy element brought up. Get a life, Ayan!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A feel-good movie terribly gone wrong and is only watchable to the people who are blindly in love, and because of Ranbir. YJHD makes no sense at all and has nothing new to decipher. Enjoy the songs, the journey of a life and faint humor, that's it. 49% Recommended!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nProfanity: Very Mild | Sex: No (Implied) | Nudity: No | Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence: Mild | Gore: No | Smoking, Alcohol: Strong | Vulgarity: Mild | Foreplay: Mild"

It can be regarded as a typical Bolly-wood movie. But if you are a Ranbir fan its a must see for you. Well i liked the movie cause it was fun to watch with friends. Had a great time. So if you want to enjoy this movie gather your friends and put it on and surely you'll have a nice time spent together. In simple words, easy going , funny , at times a little sentimental(Bolly-wood trademark)and enjoyable."

From the beginning to the end we partake in the lives of the main characters and the producers have made a decent job in making the audience intrigued as to what will follow next.\n\nMy only quandary with this, is that the actual story and the dialogues/sense of humour in particular could have been a little meatier as it would have raised the bar for the entire film, or perhaps this is just me, a Westerner, in appraising something Hindi.\n\nAn enjoyable experience overall."

The movie started out at a decent pace but very quickly lost pace and then it dragged on and on and on till I could no longer bear to sit. Thankfully the movie ended abruptly. It was like, OK enough messing around, lets end this movie now! Last but not the least, what was all that alcohol drinking all about? Most characters for most part of the movie have a wine glass or a beer bottle in their hand! Oh, now I understand! This movie was actually a very very long ad for the benefits of drinking alcohol!

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani is a refreshing take on the lives of the youth(of varied types)-their needs,their aspirations,their madness. Inspite of being 3+ hours,it never felt like a long film. It is a movie with a lot of flair,adventure and madness, as you would expect from the title.\n\nThe acting cast is mouth-watering. Ranbir Kapoor as Bunny is brilliant. He plays a character who loves to have all the fun, wants to live life at a fast pace and has this quirky ambition of visiting all the beautiful places in the world. Good job Ranbir, great acting skills and mind-blowing dancing skills that is always fun viewing. Deepike Padukone as Naina shines as an actor and shows she is more than just good looks with a beautiful rendition of a nerdy girl who is looking to break all inhibitions. I think she captured a studious,unsatisfied and conflicted girl perfectly. Kalki as Aditi exceeded my expectations. It was a treat watching Aditya Roy Kapoor who always lit up the screen whenever he was present.\n\nThe dialogues are crisp and some of them pretty deep and well thought. The music and the songs stand apart. I actually felt like getting up and dancing to the tunes of 'Balam Pichkari' and 'Badtameez Dil'. The costumes are good as well. Ayan Mukherjee seems spot on in his direction and execution as well as in the selection of the cast.\n\nWhat is good about this movie is that the approach to many things is fresh and is no clich\u00e9(The ending is kinda inescapable though).The plot seems perfectly plausible. Bunny does not fall head over heels in love with Naina. They pretty much get back to their lives without any drama.It is circumstances that later makes things happen.\n\n' Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani' is definitely good entertainment overall. An enjoyable experience.Go for it."

Honestly I've never been so happy to be proved wrong. Ranbir Kapoor is THE STAR of this film, he gets to show off his acting skills. Technically He is the best thing about the movie. This movie is something more than just being a story about how a guy finds love. It approaches the younger viewers more closely and gives away the secret that I've spent my lifetime searching-\"How to live your life?\". Alright! Lets put the message aside and judge this movie as a form of art. The Dialogues are perfect, Ranbir Kapoor Stoles the show like stealing a candy from a f**king baby, Deepika Padukone is there to represent us as a character to reproach Ranbir Kapoor's character ans she did a good job. Overall I think this film would approach more to the younger audience as compared to the elders because they're about to start their life and they get too emotionally attached. I give this movie 7.9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the director of \"Wake up Sid,\" the star-studded cast and Dharma productions, the expectations are high. Yeh Jawani Hain Deewani falls short on the direction, significantly. The production value is high; the songs, the locales and background scores are all great. However, the story is awful. There is nothing new in the story or the story-telling. Wake Up Sid did not have a new story but the direction was spot on. This movie has unnecessary songs (i.e. Madhuri's song), flashbacks (major set back in direction) and forced emotional scenes. There didn't seem to be any character progression as well. Taran Adarsh (bollywood hungama) raves about the character progression but I beg to differ.\n\nThis movie is fine for the audience who like the ZeeTV romantic shows, who are Ranbir-Deepika lovers or the people who go to movies for the cinematography. But to the lovers of new bollywood, this movie is not recommended. About 75% of the movie is very predictable, moves at a slow pace and illogical.\n\nHighly disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Yeh jawaani Hai Deewani' (YJHD) was on audience's watch-list right from release of its teaser. After all, it was going to mark coming back of Ayan Mukherjee after his awesome debut venture 'Wake up Sid' and that of ex-flames Ranbir and Deepika. Yes, Mukherjee has again come up with an ensemble of young characters, encapsulating madness and dilemmas of youth. As always, without delving much into details of story, lets come to movie-highlights:\n\n\u0095 Starcast: Yes, there is still a lot of fire left in the on (off??) screen pair of the Kapoor boy and Dippy, exhibiting sparking chemistry. Ranbir is as endearing as ever whether be the funky, badtameez, spoof, flirty Bunny or the confused, vulnerable, emotional Kabir. However, the character doesn't come off age as gracefully as Sid does in WUS. Anyways, Ranbir looks lovable in every frame. Deepika looks beautiful (and smoking hot) as both the simple nerd Naina and the transformed doc. Again, her extreme characters too aren't as believable as was Ayesha in WUS. Kalki and ARK (Aditya Roy Kapoor) add spunk and glue to the story. Their presence makes YJHD more youthful and deewana. Farooq Sheikh is endearing enough to moisten your eyes in his short cameo. It's nice to see KRK (Kunal Roy Kapoor) in a cameo with his younger bro ARK.\n\n\u0095 Storyline: Deja-vu! Ayan, this time seems to have gone the Dharma (productions) way loading his creation with glitz and glam plus a big fat destination Johar-isc wedding. Borrowing bits and pieces from ZNMD and Love Aajkal, the story is more like old wine in new bottle, and hence, quite predictable.\n\n\u0095 Cinematography: The breath-taking beauty and serenity of on-screen Manali (in actual Gulmarg) has been captured amazingly. Equally eye-catching looks the vintage and royal Udaipur. Full points to V.Manikandan!\n\n\u0095 Music/ Dance: Barring 'Badtameez Dill' and 'Balam pichkari', which already one of the best this year so far, other creations of Pritam fall flat be it 'Subhanallah' or 'Dilliwali girlfriend'. 'Kabira' carried the hangover of 'Iktara' (WUS). Madhuri's 'Ghaghara' number lacks grace and charm is rather not a fit in storyline. Ranbir's energetic dancing adds more rhythm to Pritam's compositions.\n\n\u0095 Flaws: YJHD does have its share of errs as follows: - Predictable old formula storyline - Low IQ and EQ (emotional quotient)compared to WUS - Unnecessary songs/ dance numbers\n\nIn all, YJHD may not be as suave and heart-warming as AM's first creation; nonetheless, it is definitely a one-time watch. Watch it for Ranbir's charm and cute moments of buddy hood!"

She gets to show her those colors which no body has seen till now. The help coming from other friends towards her to explore her makes me delighted.\n\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: The direction is really good. It comes from a director (Ayan Mukherjee) who has also directed 'wake up sid'. Music: Music is very good. My favorite track is 'Kabira'. Acting: Justified. There are actors who adopt choreography in such a way that it's not easy to imitate. Ranbir in this movie shows why he belongs to that league.\n\nFinal Verdict: Great direction, Great songs, Great star cast thus my vote! Watch it, you will definitely enjoy."

Normally movie do not do justice to the trailers but YJHD was an exception, i was hoping for the movie to loose its track and go in a wrong direction midway but it never did. I was entertained through out the movie, i do agree that the ending was prolonged a bit but i have seen disasters before so i overlooked it and saw this movie 4 Times.\n\nMusic in this movie was just top class and fresh, when the movie opened with a melodious kabira song with all the wedding theme it looked so beautiful to the eyes. I easily felt comfortable with the movie already, i don't really get the hate this movie has received. Ranbeer acts naturally as ever, deepika looks stunning even in a Geeky avatar and the supporting cast Kalki and Aditya does more than justice to their roles and contributes to the film as equally as the main lead. The first half of the movie is excellently paced and Balam Pichkari is my favorite Holi number of all time; so colorfully shot. Ranbeer's character is a very interesting one and he does reflect our youth culture, yes we refuse to follow the same path, do as we are told and born and die in the same place. In some way his character is inspiring, little selfish of course but the guy wants what he wants. He can undeniably lead a movie and does justice to his role, i mean who can pull off an entry like the one he did post Interval in the \"Badtameez Dil\" song. Second half of the movie is lengthy and the pace gets slow which i feel was required, very few movies can make you like the second half and specially make you laugh. So YJHD was a winner in that, i just cant get enough of the movie's cinematography. Its just beautifully shot be it Manali or Udaypur, its good to see India so beautiful.\n\nI may get lot of disagreements or hate but this movie is one of the coolest movies of 2013, I am a big fan of the YJHD's music. Ayan mukherji has done a great job and finally delivering a commercial movie like this after Swades and Wake up sid shows his versatility. Thumbs up to Actors performances, thumbs up to the music and of course the director. Hope to see such pleasant for the eyes and soul movies in future, definitely a must watch and a collectible."

        "review_detailed_main": "MOVIE REVIEW: YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI\n\nRecently,A lot of ROM-COMs and COMING-OF-AGE movies have been released in Bollywood and many of them have been given a HARSH treatment by the public.So,there is immense pressure on the directors and writers because they know that they'll need to come up with something UNIQUE.\n\nAyan Mukerji (Director) seems to have handled the pressure quite well and has indeed created something UNIQUE.Hats off to him for that.After watching Wake Up Sid,one can never expect him to make something like YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI.He not only wrote a WONDERFUL story that contains a STRONG message and bitter REALITIES of life but has also managed to present it in a very GRACEFUL manner by writing the SCREENPLAY himself as well .He surely has GROWN as a director and knows exactly how to speak his heart out in a way that settles well with the audience.When he is calling shots,expect no prolonged MELODRAMA or any uncalled for TWISTS.REMARKABLE work by this 1 film old director. *KUDOS*\n\nYEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a REFRESHING tale that revolves around four friends----Bunny (Ranbir),Naina (Deepika),Avi (Aditya) and Aditi (Kalki).They are having all sorts of fun together on a trek trip until they realize that they're growing older and life has started turning to an unlikeable direction.\n\nRanbir Kapoor plays an IMPETUOUS,FLIRTATIOUS,FUN-LOVING and INTREPID guy,with a STEP-MOM issue,who wants to live his life to the fullest.He dreams of exploring the world and he is quite OBSTINATE concerning that.He is just UNSTOPPABLE throughout the movie.Ayan Mukerji has capitalized Ranbir's abilities very SMARTLY.Firstly,He'll give you a stomach-ache with his WITTINESS,EXASPERATION and STRANGE GESTURES and then he'll make you wanna jump up your seat and DANCE alongside him in a number of up-beat songs.After all of that,he'll show you his CONSIDERATE,INTROSPECTIVE and EMOTIONAL side which will melt your HEARTS.He has done an AMAZING job as usual.Undoubtedly,he is the NEXT BIG THING in Bollywood. KEEP on ROCKING!!! \\o/\n\nDeepika Padukone essays the role of a \"GOOD GIRL\" who has always been the brightest student but hasn't really ENJOYED her life.Then she meets three people who are completely different from her and this changes her life.She is EXTREMELY CUTE in the first half and then shocks with her ULTRA HOT and SENSUOUS look in the second half.After delivering a FANTASTIC performance in COCKTAIL,she has NAILED IT yet again. Way to go GIRL!!!\n\nRANBIR and DEEPIKA share a SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and it is something to watch-out for. Their eyes SPARKLE when they look at each other.It seems as if they forget the world around them when they're together on the DANCE FLOOR.They're indeed IMPRESSIVE in separate frames but together they set the SCREEN ON FIRE...together they're a TREAT TO WATCH...together they're MAGIC.\n\nAditya Roy Kapur's (of Aashiqui 2 fame) role is of a GOOFY guy who is addicted to gambling,fails in almost everything,has no sense of achievement and LOVES his friends.There isn't much for him in the screenplay but whenever he is on the screen,he is DELIGHTFUL.\n\nKalki Koechlin is the new TOMBOY of Bollywood.Her performance is very CONVINCING and ALLURING.She holds her own SIGNIFICANCE even though the film clearly belongs to RANBIR and DEEPIKA.\n\nOnce again,Pritam has produced a CHART-BUSTER ALBUM.This guy is a GENIUS.Almost all the songs are hits and have been choreographed SUPERBLY by Remo D'Souza and Farah Khan.BATAMEEZ DIL,BALAM PICHKARI,DILLIWALI GIRLFRIEND and GHAGRA are there to ROCK UP the place while KABIRA and SUBHAN-ALLAH are the songs with SOOTHING TUNES and TOUCHING LYRICS.\n\nBrilliant work by V. Manikandan (Cinematographer).He has captured EXCELLENCE in each and every frame and has done it keeping in mind the VISION of the director and the TERRIFIC work of the PRODUCTION DESIGNERS (Amrita Mahal Nakai and Rajnish Hedao).\n\nFull marks for Manish Malhotra and Samidha Wangnoo, (Costume Designers).They've added TONS OF GLAMOUR to the movie.The OUTFITS are out of this world,specially,the ones that DEEPIKA PADUKONE dons in the second half.\n\nIn short,YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a movie that can turn a HEART-BROKEN ALCOHOLIC into the LIFE OF THE PARTY.\n\nFor me,being a CINEMA LOVER,missing a movie like this would be a SIN. Watch this and CELEBRATE LOVE and FRIENDSHIP."

In recent years, the track record of Bollywood (Barfi, Dirty Picture, Pan Singh Tomar, etc) makes you think it has evolved beautifully and quite positively. But such movies make you feel hopeless. What the hell is wrong with the producer? He and his films are all about some dream world which does not exist.\n\nKalki and Ranbir are really good actors, but their talent seem to be completely wasted here. Padukone gives bland expressions. And the other guy seems to be a serial drunkard (first Aashiqui and now this one). Forget about carrying any message, this movie even lacked the entertainment quotient. So only one word: AVOID!!!"

Must watch, light hearted movie which you'll enjoy to the fullest with the family & friends. I specially liked the lines of Ranbir like when he meets Deepika after a pond time, he asks her whether she is married, she replays No, Then he asks whether you have kids & she answers, Yes- 6 & he spontaneously says, \"Behuda Aurat\" but in a very comic manner which i liked. There are many such little enjoyable lines throughout the movie. One more thing which I liked is the way Ranbir re-proposed Deepika in the end. The manner he proposed her was not all Filmy but very casual, which was commendable & different."

        "review_title": "Wasn't expecting such routine stuff from the team.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Director Ayan Mukherjee played it safe in his first venture WAKE UP SID with a youthful routine plot wrapped in a glossy package. The film had Ranbir in it to pull that off, along with some good songs and an execution appealing to the young. So, after establishing himself as a director, I was expecting something great and novel in his second venture YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI which unfortunately has been made exactly on the same formula like his first. The film has a big star-cast lead by Ranbir-Deepika along with the current heartthrob Aditya Roy Kapur post his AASHIQUI 2 success story. Plus it also has a big production house and a hit musical score by Pritam to add to its credits. But strangely despite having such great support from both the actors and the producers, Ayan again opts for the same old wine in a new bottle kind of storyline, with nothing fresh in the name of content in his second film. Hence the result remains the same i.e. just average.\n\nBut more importantly, it was really strange to accept it as a Ranbir Kapoor film, as after ROCKSTAR and BARFI, the talented boy was reportedly reading only innovative and fresh scripts for his next films quite intelligently. Now what did he see in the script of YJHD as novel or fresh, remains out of my understanding and the actor must have done it just for the sake of his relations with the director and the production house, as it seems. Because in reality, if anyone else (with not a known name) would have gone to him with such a routine script, hugely dependent upon its youthful gags and sequences only, then he would have rejected it right away, without giving it any second thoughts. So that should say it all as per the plot line of the film is concerned.\n\nYJHD begins on a good note and then offers you nothing in terms of story-progression in its first half. Further, post intermission it continues delivering everything predictable and never comes up with something exceptionally different or unique till the ineffective climax. The at your face promotions of brands like \"Make My Trip\", \"Appy\" and more turn it into a sub-standard product and the additional 'Madhuri's item number' too fails to serve any desired purpose. It slows down repeatedly at many places in the second half and also remains a bit lengthy film for such kind of known plot where the viewer already knows what's going to happen next.\n\nThe technical merits of YJHD include its witty one liners, catchy cinematography and enjoyable soundtrack from Pritam. Though the background score is strictly OK but it's the songs which infuse new energy into the film, every 10-15 minutes as its big saving grace. Particularly the choreography in 'Balam Pitchkari' & 'Badtameez Dil' is hugely enjoyable, featuring some nonsense lyrics too which actually go un-noticed due to the catchy melody.\n\nIn the performance department, as expected, it's a Ranbir Kapoor show all the way. To say the truth, minus Ranbir's honest & visible efforts, the film falls flat since it has neither anything new nor any major unpredictable twists to keep you glued. Putting it more brutally, both WAKE UP SID as well as YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI couldn't have made it to anywhere without Ranbir Kapoor. Deepika looks gorgeous in all her revealing dresses & acts well too, but her badly written role doesn't let her make any huge impact right till the end. For example, after 8 years of college life (studying medicine), the girl must have reached a status (as a doctor), whereas the film makes no mention of it in any scene post intermission. Aditya Roy Kapoor impresses once again even when he doesn't have a full length role here as Ranbir's only friend. Kalki is just the same like in all her previous films and I didn't find any change in her portrayal of the fourth friend. Both Kunal Roy Kapoor & Tanvi Azmi are good but Dolly Ahluwalia remains underutilized in her 2-3 scenes only. Similarly Evelyn Sharma looks sexy & appealing in her small role but Rana Daggubati just comes and goes without making his presence felt.\n\nHowever, apart from everyone else in the film, the scenes I enjoyed the most were the ones between Ranbir Kapoor and Farooq Sheikh who is simply adorable as the loving father of his passionate son, eager to follow his dreams. Particularly their sequence towards the climax is truly moving, redefining the father-son relationship on the screen, in just few minutes.\n\nSumming up, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a perfectly packaged film for the youth, which is purely made to succeed in the first three days of its release and nothing more. Beyond that neither the makers are interested in re-creating any cinematic history, nor has the film got anything substantial to prove itself in the long run. In short, its just another big budget Bollywood film which relies majorly on its Star value, music and marketing gimmicks, more than the content.\n\nSo, if you just want to have a marginally good time in the theater, laughing occasionally and enjoying a few good songs thrown in at regular intervals to keep it going, then probably you may like it as an average entertainer. But in case you are expecting something great, inventive or unique from the actor of ROCKSTAR and BARFI then you are sure going to be disappointed a lot."

The story drags and drags....jokes dry up ....only music and dance keeps u awake and interested !! And the last half hr is a huge disappointment !!\n\nFrankly, its a Deepika's movie....she is brilliant !! Ranbir...sleep walks thru his role. This is not Barfi stuff. Kalki is superb while the bros...Aditya and Kunal are adequate. Farooq Sheikh deserved more screen time....what an actor !! And what the hell was Rana Daggubati doing in this film ??"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hi,\n\nMost romantic Bollywood movies nowadays fail to entertain you because they are so sad, and depressing. Or they have very cheesy jokes. But Ayan Mukherjee has made Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani as one of the best entertainments in Bollywood. Every single song is so beautifully written, with nice dance choreography, and amazing music! The movie keeps you engaged throughout, and has really funny moments.\n\nFor those really picky critics, they may say that the movie is a common script. They'll call the acting very basic, and nothing extraordinary. But I believe that not every movie has to be fully detailed, or needs a very different storyline with extraordinary characters. Sometimes you just want to watch a simple movie that makes you smile, and doesn't make you think really hard about what's going on. And that's exactly what this movie is.\n\nFurthermore, this film gives a good message. I will not spoil it for anyone, so I will not say what happened. But it gives you a good message.\n\nIf you don't want to spend money in the theatres, it's fine. But make sure you watch it in good quality.\n\nIt's a 10/10 for entertainment."

Contrasting characters made the movie very interesting. All the four friends are very different from each other.\n\nThe Jokes and gags in the first half are fantastic and you will definitely laugh out loud.But the second half of the movie dips gradually and the movie is way to long for today's busy audience.\n\nComing to the performances,all of them are outstanding making it a fun watch at the end. Ranbir the ambitious person and at the end a man in love is extraordinary, Deepika from a boring to a fun loving girl is something to watch and till date its her best performance. She adds layers to her character.Kalki is the surprise package, she is above expectation, again a awesome display.Aditya Roy Kapur is cute and adorable, he is effortless.\n\nHats off to the Cinematographer for capturing such outstanding scenes. All the scenes looks beautiful and full credits to Cameramen.\n\nAyan Mukherjee has done reasonably good but not as his first movie.Dialogues are good, narration of the story is somewhat ordinary as the first half is fast and the second half is very slow paced.\n\nOverall it is a nice entertainer. Don't expect much just watch it and you decide ..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Indian cinema is progressing in rapid speed. Gone are the cheesy rom-coms and over the top action movies. Still, it's nice to see an older story in new treatment with some up to date situations and characters. Ayan Mukherjee's Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani may not be as path breaking as his first venture Wake Up Sid, but it still manages to keep the viewer intrigued.\n\nTruth is, if you've had a stressful week and want a full on entertainer that not only enlightens but also educates about life - YJHD is absolutely what you need.\n\nNaina is a nerd who has spent most of her life in books and probably has done nothing exciting in her life. She one day bumps in to Aditi who is a carefree girl about to go on an adventurous trip with friends Bunny and Avi. A boring Naina falls for the spontaneous Bunny but for reasons is not able to tell him, mainly due to the fact that he wants to travel the world and live life at full speed. It's 8 years later and one of the friends is getting married. Back comes Bunny, Naina and feelings...\n\nYJHD has many moments that make you smile or teary-eyed. The moments with Ranbir-Deepika are all classic! The chemistry between the 4 actors is noteworthy.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is the chemistry between the lead pair. Notches above than what they did during their first film together Bachna Ae Haseeno.\n\nDrawbacks? Yes, a few. First off, the Ghagra song featuring the evergreen Madhuri Dixit is not needed and if it was to go in the film, it should have been better placed. Also, Ranbir's relationship with his stepmom should have been better explained.\n\nPritam's music is fantastic. Every song is awesome. Badtameez Dil, Balam Pitchkaari, Ghagra, Dilliwali Girlfriend, Kabira, Subhanallah etc are all chartbuster material.\n\nThe writing is brilliant for the most part.Especially in the first half.\n\nAyan Mukherjee's direction is first rate. This is a bigger film than his last and he's handled such a big task so well. Looking forward to his next.\n\nAditiya Roy Kapoor and Kalki are perfect for their roles. They are just brilliant in every frame. Supporting cast is good too.\n\nAll said and done, it's the lead pair that take this film to a whole 'nother level. It's really what you take back with you. Ranbir Kapoor is charming as ever and of course, he's the best of his generation when it comes to acting. Deepika springs a surprise here and she looks stunning even in specs. This is her best act yet.\n\nOverall, YJHD is an entertainer all the way. Watch it for a smile."

        "review_detailed_main": "If Bombay Talkies went all out paying tribute to 100 years of Indian cinema building extravagant, if not exaggerated, castles of how deeply films have had an impact on the ordinary and extraordinary lives of the Indian people, YJHD does so in a simple,everyday, almost nonchalant way. The movie is about regular people who, like you and me, complicate their lives when it gets too easy and detangle it when it gets too complicated. It does not speak of a love which in an idealistic, tempestuous, all encompassing manner prevails against all odds and enemies like the hero of the Hindi movie, but it speaks of one which is found and realized through a journey of self-discovery where life sometimes comes in the way and sometimes shows you the way. It speaks of success and failure in the same breath just as it speaks of the wild and the calm spirit. It touches base with the very urging topic of the \"Fear of Missing out\" of today's times. It speaks both of letting go and moving on as well as of compromising some dreams for the promise of companionship. And it does all this in a typical Bollywood masala movie, song, drama, friendship, emotion, family fashion.\n\nThe movie packs powerful performances by the supremely talented Ranbir Kapoor who is clearly growing into the star of the decade. Kalki Koechlin as always portrays her part adeptly , not forgetting to mention Kunal Roy Kapoor who even in his small part stood out and shone, albeit from the sidelines. Deepika Padukone looks her gorgeous, beautiful, desirable self delivering a fair acting performance and wonderful and best yet dance performances. Aditya Roy Kapoor does his part fairly well, his dialogue delivery reminding you of a certain Mr. Farhan Akhtar. He might prove to be a decent crowd puller in the form of a female fan following but still needs to improve if he wants to look effortless. Rana Daggubati can hardly be commented upon in his blink and miss cameo but Madhuri Dixit sparkles like a goddess in hers. The surprise at her appearance in such an item number cameo can only be outdone by the bundles of grace that she brings to the \"item\" song and dance routine which in spite of its raw theme was served in a wholesome, refined package. Ranbir manages to match step, performance and presence with Madhuri in Ghagra while outdoing his own dancing skills in Badtamiz Dil. Farooq Sheikh, Tanvi Azmi and Dolly Ahluwalia perform impeccably while Evelyn Sharma is forgettable in her role.\n\nAyan Mukherjee can easily be called the king of coming-of- age Indian cinema in today's times. He takes a mediocre story and screenplay, which is also his own work, and prepares a palatable dish out of it which moves at a comfortable pace. He is supported by a brilliant Manikandan who gives his best work so far weaving magic with his camera work capturing everything from the snow covered terrains of Manali and Kashmir through the aesthetically shot streets of gorgeous cities like Venice and Paris , from the forts and lakes of Udaipur to the gloriously shot sizzling dance numbers. The humour content is healthy and the dialogues are average except for the very well placed one-liners from various talked about movies down the long path of the Indian film industry.\n\nThe music, by Pritam, is youthful, catchy and keeps an eager interest alive for the viewer in the movie and complements the flow well but it fails to qualify for any spots around extra-ordinary or new. Songs like Ilahi and Kabira could possibly be remembered as soulful melodies while Ghagra, Balam Pichkari and Dilli Waali girlfriend might live on as potential dance performance music. Lyrics are strong and fresh in that they aren't predictable, but at the same time, do not lend a hand to the storyline of the movie. A possible exception is Kabira which is YJHD's version of Iktaara denoting similar transformation. Choreography is energetic, fresh and reverberating.\n\nThe movie reminds you of DDLJ at more places than one and seems like a contemporarised version of it where the characters themselves, rather than their families, stand in the way of love and togetherness. It paints nothing very new on the canvas of Indian cinema but is a befitting tribute to Bollywood while staying true to the ways and thinking of the current generation of Bollywood buffs. It picks up where Wake Up Sid leaves off and speaks of settling down where Wake Up Sid speaks of rising up. Most importantly, it serves as a reminder to today's omnipotence and ubiquity chasing youth to stop running and slow down. - \"You cant do everything. There will always be something that you miss. So its better to live the moment and enjoy where you are now.\""

I'm ashamed that such a movie is still applauded by people when there are movies that get half as much recognition and really have talent! I walked out of the cinema during the ending because it was so awkward to watch. Don't get me wrong, I love Ranbir and Deepika as actors but this seemed like they gave it no thought when they decided to act in it and only went in it for the chance to somewhat flirt with one another all in the name of a \"movie\". The only good thing were the songs but after seeing the movie I didn't see their point because they had no story to them either. I usually like the songs better after seeing the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review : The story of 4 friends. Bunny (RK),Aditi (Kalki),Naina (Deepika) and Avi (Aditya). When three of the friends are discovering their life,Naina is just studying,what she is been doing from her school days.Then she meets her classmate Aditi and somehow manage to go on a trip with her friends Bunny , Avi, Aditi.Then various things happen ,they rediscover them selves and can they reach to their destiny? . My view : It is a typical Bollywood Rom-Com flim with a modern day flavour. You should enjoy the movie if you don't really try to think that much about some things like: How Naina suddenly changed where her glasses goes ? Suddenly it seems like their among affairs with each other and after sometimes they are just friends. . But their is some fun,lessons (mostly impossible),thoughts you can get.But you must think there could have been a lot more with this extraordinary plot.\n\nTop of the actors (Among Leads): Deepika Padukone.Though her transformation was illogical but she suits really well in both of her characteristic.\n\nFlop of the actors : Kalki koechlin .She is a great actress.But the dialogue delivery with hindi doesn't suit her.\n\nMy Rating : 7/10 .\n\nFor more reviews stay connected to : fb.me/sinix75"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Doesn't matter how hard you try, there will be something left out\". The movie states this loudly and actually the same can be said for the movie. The movie has one of the finest cast possible with awesome music. But then you have a predictable story-line and a prolonged sangeet sequence. You have Ranbir Kapoor brimming with unstoppable energy sharing the scorching chemistry with gorgeous Deepika. But then the director tries to pack-in too many things in those 2.5 hrs. But in the end, you can safely say you had a great time watching this rom-com because the movie has always its heart at right place. Deepika gives her best again after cocktail. Aditya Roy Kapoor (Ashiqui 2 fame), Kalki and Farooq Sheikh, all give their best shot. Ayaan who gave us Wake Up Sid shows that he is here for long run. Ranbir Kappor showcases his dancing skills with irresistible charisma in songs like \"Badtameez Dil\" and \"Dilli Wali Girlfriend\". All in all, you have 2013's first major blockbuster which entertains and provides food for though in equal measures."

        "review_title": "Ayan Mukherjee's Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani isn't an effort but an attempt at direction, a miserably lazy one that too. Yeh Jawaani Hai Puraani, Bahut Puraani.",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Yeh Jawaani Hai Ghissi Pitti' 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Puraani''Wake Up Sid (Hangover Version)' could easily become alternate titles for 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'\u0085 no, let me change that a bit \u2013 more suitable titles for Ayan Mukherjee's sophomore effort\u0085 no, not really an effort, more an attempt at direction.\n\nHe serves you cold soup this time and that isn't the worst part \u2013 he also serves you the same soup. With a heavy handed treatment; it feels like your college canteen's old lunch lady's made the soup. That's how lazy Ayan Mukherjee is this time - his story is trite, his dialogues are stale, his characters are hackneyed, their situations clich\u00e9d and their resolutions tiresome. This guy seriously needs to grow out of this 'follow your dreams' 'accept change' 'settle down' phase; yes, he got his chance in 'Wake Up Sid' and he fared well, but this is plain directorial lethargy.\n\nDeconstructing Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani's plot shall begin with a clich\u00e9 \u2013 it's about four young friends. Oh, a respite \u2013 two are boys and two are girls so it's not the 'all-guy film' or the 'all-girl film'. This film starts with one of the girls reminiscing her past, as the other is to get married. The girl who's narrating is Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone), and she takes us eight years back into the past, when she was studious, plain-Jane, good-girl Naina. And as all studious good-girls need to be spectacled, she dons one. Still looks hot in it, but since it's Bollywood and spectacles is equal to 'behenji or nerd', our Naina's totally ignored by guys.\n\nShe's in the supermarket with her snobbish mother, shopping in her little skirt/shorts (anyway, she's showing legs, but nobody notices because she's got 'spectacles' on). She hears someone yell near the exit counter; it's Aditi, her former schoolmate. Aditi is mad at a young stout kid who was checking out her legs (according to her). He tells her she's not that hot \u2013 she gets madder. Naina approaches her, they greet, Naina's mother talks about her daughter, Aditi praises Naina for being the 'padhaku' type and then tells about her trip to Manali. The scene ends with Naina being secretly invited by her to the trip.\n\nNext scene at dining table. Naina's mom's insulting Aditi for being the 'bad girl'. Naina throws a tantrum with 'I want a holiday' and then leaves the table. Next we see her checking out Make My Trip Site, probably co-sponsors for this film because they're everywhere! Our brave girl Naina slips out the next day and joins Aditi for the trip but Aditi isn't alone \u2013 she's with Bunny and Avi.\n\nWe're already introduced to these two chaps \u2013 Bunny is the photographer who dreams of travelling around the world (for some reason, Ayan can't think outside the box; Ranbir Kapoor in Wake Up Sid = photographer, Ranbir Kapoor in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani = photographer) while Avi is an alcoholic who loses lots on gambling (no idea how he gets the money). We first find Bunny in a brothel filming with a foreign crew about prostitutes; so there's the usual 'spicy talk' with the prostitute, then a totally purposeless dance number featuring Madhuri Dixit. But we know why it's been added \u2013 it's a Karan Johar production, he was a judge with Dixit on a dancing reality show, he must've thought it appropriate to randomly place her in a dance number that's got NOTHING to do with anything. She looks lovely though, and her dancing is sensuous and expressive but why on earth (or why in a brothel of all places) is it there?\n\nSo Bunny's the photographer who calls his step-mom 'step-mom' (ridiculous and childish \u2013 why not the first name?), Avi is the faltu (useless) alcoholic, Avi is the cool girl and Naina the 'scholar'. All board the train to Manali, their trip being sponsored by MAKE MY TRIP (they could've just had the four break the fourth wall and shout 'I love Make My Trip!). They meet hot chicks, and Bunny has a crush on one of them called Lara, a hot but dumb chick like you see in every other college movie; the girl actually has a background music' played whenever she's on screen and it's so kiddish, your brain feels embarrassed that it has gifted you the power of hearing for these sounds. Okay, so on trip our Naina loosens up (she wears lenses and voila turns into a hot crazy babe in a day), begins enjoying life (she gets drunk. Don't tell her fussy mom though) and falls in love with Bunny, who's commitment- phobic. There's a scene where both Naina and Bunny scream from the edge of a hilltop and you really wish they'd slip and fall to their deaths so the film could surprise us.\n\nThe film never does surprise us. Our hero Bunny leaves for US after the trip, Naina becomes Aditi's best friend, Aditi decides to marry a podgy guy named Taran after Avi doesn't reciprocate the feelings she has for him, while Avi remains a drunkard and is in huge debt. The second half's more embarrassing and most of its set around Aditi's marriage. Random characters come and go and we are meant to chuckle (we don't, not once). There are the 'buddy movie serious scenes' we don't give a rat's a\u2014 about; they're a chockfull of banal moments stuffed with platitudes you'd find on Facebook, written by IQ 100 boys and girls who only think their crappy thoughts are profound.\n\nThis kind of film minting hundred crores at the box office is sheer criminality. Don't encourage Ayan Mukherjee to make more like these! Stop Johar from making money like this!\n\nAnd do reconsider your Make My Trip subscription if you have one \u2013 they'll take you to Kashmir, calling it Manali!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeh Jawani Hai Dewani - Definitely worth a watch, a pleasant experience. The director Ayan Mukerji has done even better job after \"Wake Up Sid\". Though Ranbir(Bunny)-Deepika(Naina) chemistry has done wonders, still I was blown away by Ranbir's wonderful acting yet again as smart, confident, charming, ambitious young star this time. The houseful RDB was a proof that Ranbir will go miles from here, he is the king of the teens and young hearts (and yes, the news is, I still consider myself young!)! It is not only a Rom-Com movie, in few cases it has gone very deep into emotional turmoils which we face sometime between a golden overseas career and relatively simpler but content life with our near and dear ones. People may not like the happy ending and expected decision, but I liked it very much personally as it vibrated my own decisions. The songs by Pritam was very good, specially \"Fakira\" was awesome. I was bowled out by Maduri's item dance, she still looks the same when I was 10 ;-). Kalki did another brilliant job after Shanghai in limited time. Aditya Ray Kapoor and Farooq Sheikh was also good in their roles. Manali where Bunny and Naina met for the first time was picture-perfect, hats-off to the camera crew, I don't remember the names, but it is people like them who make the difference. The story is simple, so no point in telling it here, instead go and enjoy. Overall 7/10 from me."

Not missing out the powerpacked performance of Farooq shaikh who returned to the industry after quite sometime was brilliant.Both of the scenes he was in was actually quite incredible.All the songs in the film are quite wonderful and you want to keep on humming it once you leave the theatre.So its a must watch for youngsters who are bored of the high action packed flicks running adjacent to the film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.I rate it 8 out of 10.\n\nP.s this is not a script where i would rather disclose the script of the film! dor that i would rather want you to yourself watch the film! I just did mention the key fctors for which this film is worth 8 out of 10."

They are most definitely paid!! Second, AVOID this film at all cost. Remember, the ticket might come free or it might someday be aired. But the time spent has a value too!\n\nWhy not to watch? #1. Well, you have seen this brand of movies a million times before in Bollywood. One strong reason. #2. The performances are also lackluster from most stars, except for Kalki. I would mention Ranbir and Dipika. Just a mention. No praises. #3. Direction was not really required. The producer could have cut budget by excluding the Director's fees. Even with just the stars and a cameraman, the film would have been better. #4. Script! This is THE STRONGEST POINT of Why-Not-To-Watch!! The script is tailor-fit (not made) to en cash great locations and all the Bollywood masala of hot girls, dance number, shaadi and the drama that follows. There ARE NO characters in the real sense. You can actually feel the confusion of the script and the lack of work (forget depth) in the end-product. The twisting and tampering of the original script at the discussion sessions and even the reckless insertion of marketable scenes is felt by the audience. I am being considerate while assuming that there WAS indeed an original script. Chances are high that it is a script prepared right on the sets.\n\nSo even if you are of the Jyada-Dimag-Nahi-Daalneka type STILL AVOID ! Your bucks are precious ! Teri-mehnat-ke-paise-hai !\n\nSo why did I give it even 2 points ? Well 1 goes to the cameraman and the other goes to Kalki's performance.\n\nAdd one more to the #HopelessBollywood !!"

        "review_title": "Unmeaningful, overacted and underwritten youth story",
        "review_detailed_main": "Stardom can achieve a lot in India. Apart from convincing masses to buy various products, it can turn dud scripts into blockbusters. Ayan Mukherjee tells us something about the youth, yet again after 'Wake up Sid'. Is he representing the current generation? Is he out to inspire them? Does he have an undying message in the life and travels of Bunny Thapar? Disappointingly, it is none of the above. 'Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' rides on the back of Ranbir Kapoor who at times, appears lost in bland scenes and tries hard in others to put life in them. The anguish can be felt by some of the audience and instantly they can conclude that this melodramatic, cheesy and inebriated representation of a non-existent class of youth is just over-the-top.\n\nThe wafer thin plot revolves around Bunny's (Ranbir Kapoor) aspirations of carefree world travel. Not only does he have to convince his father (Farooq Shaikh) to let him live his dream but he must then tolerate his friends, the loud and indecisive Avi (Aditya Roy Kapoor) who has some occasional funny dialogue and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin), who was frankly better off in Kashyap's realistic films since the fake vibe she carries is terribly unconvincing. Then of course, they take a 'make-my-trekking-trip' to Manali, joined by the studious Naina (spectacled Deepika Padukone) who must awkwardly endure the games, flirting, drinking and street fighting that the others so happily indulge in. Thereafter, Bunny travels abroad for his education and career, without much happening in that phase apart from solitary moments of photography, random hook-ups and pensive introspection. Then suddenly, he gets a video invite to Aditi's wedding in Udaipur where they are all back to flirting, drinking, fighting and a lot more dancing this time.\n\n\"I want to fly, I want to run, I even want to fall but I don't want to stop\"... at the surface, Bunny's philosophy is alluring but without the backing of a script to support it, those lines just fade away into drunken indulgence. On one hand he claims to enjoy his way of life and on the other, being love struck, his conviction melts in a lip-lock scene. His dilemma is his weakness and perhaps the film's major drawback.\n\nThe immaturity and inaneness of several scenes contribute to the incredulity of Mukherjee's script. Now he leads the folks of small towns and villages to believe that city-dwellers are a part of this cool culture where girls call each other 'dudes' and a guy addresses a girl as 'Man'. To add to that, the pahadi folks would feel miserable about their own lives knowing that city people can hike up the snowy peaks while being dressed for a party, drinking along the way, listening to their music on large headphones and then discover German mountaineer parties over the next hill. The other harsh reality that is uncovered by Mukherjee's vision is that as you start traveling around the world, you tend to grow an ugly beard because you don't have to give a damn.\n\nEventually though, Mukherjee gives rise to the much needed maturity in the film when Bunny and Naina struggle to relate to each others' lives and conclude that \"tum galat nahi ho, sirf alag ho\". Only if the conclusion of it all had been along those lines, the film would have been more realistic and meaningful.\n\nRanbir Kapoor rides the film on his shoulders. As versatile a dancer that he is, Ranbir also pulls off comedy, tragedy, indifference and seriousness with equal credibility. With just a handful of memorable dialogues, his potential hasn't been realized by Mukherjee and to make it worse, the supporting cast does not match up to his level. Kalki Koechlin was impressive in Anurag Kashyap's films but she seems quite out of place here. The first half of the movie is overacted with loudness that gets irritating. Aditya Roy Kapoor too tends to be louder than required and is reduced to the most poorly written character in the movie. Farooq Shaikh extended a favor to the director by taking up his role which wasn't worthy of such a fine actor. Deepika Padukone still struggles with the simplest of roles and tries to drive attention to her skimpy clothing rather than expressing various emotions. Her spontaneity may have improved but versatility and credibility of her character are still lacking. The true star of the film however, is Manali and its surrounding snowy scenery. The Himalayas have seldom been depicted in such spectacular fashion and the scene on the mountain top is awe inspiring (only to be spoiled by Ranbir's unnecessary screaming).\n\nThere are too many songs by Pritam in this Deewani Jawani. Balam Pichkari is a catchy holi song while the Madhuri Dixit Via Agra track is forgettable. Kabira is melodious but reminiscent of Iktara. Badtameez Dil is fun to watch with some excellent choreography and upbeat tunes.\n\nAyan Mukherjee's attempt at portraying the lifestyles and challenging relationships of today's youth had some foundation but lost its way in the cheesy, incredulous delivery of the script. Too many fake characters delineate little more than indulgence in alcohol, women and the carefree attitudes. Zoya Akhtar's take on such a subject was far superior (ZNMD) in every aspect with depth in its story, characters and the exemplary direction. 'Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' is just not meaningful enough for the viewer to care about the characters or story. Too much of it was over-the-top from the beginning to recover its credibility. Add to that, the occasional overacting and numerous songs that put brakes on an already struggling story-line. Bunny's character seems determined to live life his own way at times but still seems confused and uncertain about the long run. If that was the point of Mukherjee's film, then it should have been titled 'Wake up Bunny'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (stylized as YJHD) is the routine Bollywood romantic-comedy-drama, with the backdrop of travel. It has all the elements of a typical Bollywood romance that you'd probably expect from Shah Rukh Khan, another Bollywood actor known as the 'King of Romance' in India. There's romance, bromance, bonding, as well as some drama.\n\nHeck, I'd call this a slight rehash of DDLJ (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), one of the most successful Bollywood films worldwide. But DDLJ is almost 20 years ago. This is a modern update on the story, catered for the audiences of today.\n\nIt has a great emotional angle to it, without the melodrama. If you see the film, you'll probably know what I mean. Also, the chemistry between the lead pair Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone is downright FIERY, and Deepika wildly excels in her subtle yet meaningful and deep performance as the introvert Naina.\n\nThe dialogue is hilarious at times, and the movie has it share of well- written scenes, which almost perfectly depict every character's emotions. The music is simply grand.\n\nYJHD isn't all that ambitious, and may seem like a bit of a departure from director Ayan Mukherji's last directorial venture, Wake Up Sid. But for those of you reading this review and are not living in India, you should really start with this film, if you want to check out some of Bollywood.\n\nGreat performances, simple story, fiery song-and-dance sequences, funny lines, and a romantic soul, YJHD is a fine successor to DDLJ, for the youth."

Deepika was even more disappointing. Kalki and Aditya do their part good , way better than other two. i wonder how this film makes this much money? Indians if u want some good quality cinema ignore such movies . it would send a message to the makers that we wont watch bulls**t . Deepika starts remembering what happened 8 years ago and never returns back. guide says the BUTA peak is dangerous to climb yet the first timer Deepika does it easily. guide says no one has ever returned from the peak yet they come down with out any mountaineering equipment."

Bunny and Naina smile at each other. Naina says him a sweet sa goodbye. Bunny's phone rings in a minute and he's off with his backpack. To a new destination while \"Illahi\" song plays in background. Avi got some investors and finally able to save his bar. Naina and Bunny both are happy they chose their life which is free from any boundaries.\""

Ranbir Kapoor is the work of art who figures out how to be not just maddeningly endearing,but loaded with that pizzazz . He entrances you with his look that make his character Bunny so adorable. Post Cocktail, Deepika makes her character unmistakable, mixing sympathy, sexiness with prosper. Aditya is the dim steed who gives a fine proof of his ability .Kalki resembles a tornado of ability that unfurls bit by bit as she stands her ground in spite of the nearness of Ranbir and Deepika. Farooq Shaikh, as Ranbir's dad, is just exceptional. Rana Daggubati shimmers in his cameo.\n\nYEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is adorned with a young score by Pritam like 'Badtameez Dil', 'Balam Pichkari' and 'Ghagra' that are high-on-vitality influences you to have a craving for moving along and have just hit the fame graphs. 'Kabira' overflows a meloncholy song . The movement of 'Badtameez Dil' is super with Ranbir rotating to the tunes with amuse. Madhuri's quality in the 'Ghagra' track includes belief as well. In general, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a fabulous interpretation of sentiment and connections. this one should evoke genuine emotion with not only the young, but rather motion picture watchers of all age-gatherings. Its a motion picture not to be missed ."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first review I am writing for a bollywood movie. I believe this movie deserves one.\n\nAfter reading reviews and keeping an eye on this movie for over a week, I was in two minds whether I should go watch this movie or not. There are so many negative reviews here that just make you think that this movie is going to be terrible and you should not have any good expectations before you go to watch this movie.\n\nIf you are a movie expert and pretty much watch every bollywood movie that comes out than you might not find this movie to be appealing. But if you are somewhat like me who occasionally watches good bollywood movies than I would recommend you go watch this and decide for yourself.\n\nAs other people have said, first half of movie is somewhat fast and is more funny compared to second half. Second half gets more emotional and reflects typical Indian love stories. But that does not mean that second half deserves to get 2/10. I would rate first half 8/10 and second half 7/10.\n\nAll the songs in the movie are really good and most of them relate to the movie very well. Only thing you might find a bit strange is Madhuri's role in the movie and that song at the start.\n\nIf you are a fan of Ranbir/Deepika, this movie is a must for you. Both of them have done a really good job. Many people criticized the acting but I personally don't think there is anything wrong with it. We go to watch a movie to enjoy it not to bite down on every possible little detail and find mistakes and errors. No movie is perfect and to me this is very good.\n\nThere are few things to note if you are going to watch the movie with family/kids. Movie itself is not bad but there are few dirty jokes/talk and some kissing scenes. Other than that there is no rude language.\n\nI watched a bollywood movie in the cinema after a long time and really enjoyed it. I would say if you are not sure about this movie give it a try. Just keep in mind this may not be your favorite but it certainly won't be the worst you've seen."

I agree its a plot that has been used in Bollywood many times, but the way Ayaan Mukurjee executes this is very different from your usual Bollywood films.\n\nThe plot centres a group of friends which includes Aditi (Kalki Koechlin) Avi (Aditya Roy Kapoor) and Kabir Thapar (Bunny) (ranbir Kapoor), who all ready to take a rec around manila. Naina (Deepika Padukone) plays a geeky, quirky middle class Indian girl who's only dream is to live like others, she gets all this when she joins Bunny and his gang on their rec to manila. The plot follows as all usual Hindi films usual do.\n\nRanbir Kapoor after Barfi gives a performance of a lifetime as the carefree Kabir, he plays the role as though he is Kabir himself which is why Ranbir in this moment in time is one of the leading stars of the industry. Deepika also gives a brilliant performance she goes from strength to strength with this role as Naina. Both main actors live the characters as though they are themselves. Aditya and Kalki add a bit of mas ala to the cast. Overall the main cast is very good and hats off to Ayaan and Karan for producing a story that has been told but in a modern style.\n\nOverall a must watch for Ranbir-Deepika fans and overall Hindi movie lovers."

One reason why people will come see this movie is for the cast and colors. From fast beat tunes such as Balam Pichkari and Dilliwali Girlfriend, memorable scenes in Manali and the special appearance by Madhuri Dixit, it deserves a win. The movie takes you on an adventure and its all about traveling with friends and what happens along there journey in life. Yet, the movie lacks with a good story and its basically another version of Dil Chata Hai. There really is no problem in the movie but watch this for Ranbir and Deepika that bring a charming on-screen couple. Ranbir's cute looks and Deepika's beauty is worth a watch! If the cast was different, the movie probably wouldn't do as well because the scenes are made for the cast that's in the movie. It's a light-hearted film that basically tells the story of big name movies such as DDLJ and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in a short modern version but it most relates to Dil Chata Hai. I give this film a 7 out of 10 for its fantastic moments that have lights and colors all over with a touch of a modern and classic movie!"

As there are no good dialogues in the movie, only these dialogues make some fun. 5. Madhuri - Old Madhuri on worst song\n\nand many more..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bollywood romantic drama Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was released in 2013. Directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Karan Johar, the movie stars Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika Padukone, Aditya Roy Kapur, and Kalki Koechlin in lead roles. The film explores themes of friendship, love, ambition, and self-discovery.\n\nThe story revolves around four friends: Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor), Naina (Deepika Padukone), Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin), who meet during a trekking trip in the Himalayas. The movie traces their journey through various stages of life, from their carefree college days to their individual struggles and aspirations as adults. Bunny is an adventurous and ambitious guy who dreams of traveling the world, while Naina is a nerdy and introverted girl who gradually opens up to new experiences. The film explores their complex relationship, their unrequited love, and their paths crossing again after years of separation.\n\nOne of the highlights of \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is its beautiful cinematography, which captures the scenic landscapes of the Himalayas and other locations with great visual appeal. The film's music, composed by Pritam, is also a standout aspect, with several catchy and melodious tracks that became popular upon release.\n\nThe performances in the film are commendable, with Ranbir Kapoor delivering a charismatic portrayal of Bunny. He effortlessly transitions between the carefree and adventurous persona and the more mature and introspective side of his character. Deepika Padukone shines as Naina, effectively portraying her transformation from a shy and reserved girl to a confident and self-assured woman. Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin provide good support with their respective characters, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nThe screenplay strikes a good balance between light-hearted moments, emotional depth, and some thought-provoking dialogues. The film effectively explores the themes of friendship, love, and self-discovery, capturing the dilemmas and choices faced by the characters as they navigate through life.\n\nHowever, one criticism of the film is its runtime, which stretches over three hours. Some viewers might find certain portions to be unnecessarily long, affecting the overall pacing of the narrative.\n\nOverall, \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is an entertaining and visually appealing film that offers a mix of romance, drama, and comedy. It successfully portrays the journey of its characters, their relationships, and their pursuit of dreams. If you enjoy heartfelt romantic dramas with a touch of adventure and self-discovery, this movie is worth watching."

Not.\n\nWe are supposed to consider their boorish behavior applaudable. Not.\n\nRanbir Kapoor who put in a fine show in Rocket Singh - Salesman of the Year seems to have decided that he no longer wants to act when hamming away is adequate. Pity! Deepika Padukone is utterly miscast as a woman with her head in books and unaware of her stunner looks.\n\nAditya Roy Kapoor as the resident lush and Kalki Koechlin as the bindaas gal are good but then the movie is not really about them.\n\nThis is the nth time that Hindi film directors have tried and failed to recapture the Dil Chahhta Hai sort of chemistry between protagonists. I just wish they would stop trying to be cool because they fail miserably."

Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the movie seamlessly blends romance, drama, and humor, offering a captivating narrative.\n\nThe film revolves around Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor), a spirited young man with a passion for travel and exploration, and Naina (Deepika Padukone), a studious medical student seeking to break free from her introverted shell. As their paths cross during a trek, the story unfolds, taking the audience on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.\n\nOne of the film's strengths lies in its well-developed characters, each with their own quirks and dreams. The chemistry between Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone is palpable, adding authenticity to the evolving dynamics of their relationship. The supporting cast, including Aditya Roy Kapur, Kalki Koechlin, and Kunaal Roy Kapur, brings humor and depth to the narrative.\n\nThe cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the picturesque landscapes of Manali and the grandeur of the destination wedding sequences. The film's soundtrack, composed by Pritam, is a mix of soulful melodies and energetic tracks, complementing the narrative and enhancing the overall viewing experience.\n\nWhile \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" excels in portraying the excitement of youth and the complexities of relationships, there are moments where the pacing feels a bit stretched, particularly in the second half.

This work will go down as one of his finest, even though I am sure he will make many more films.\n\nThis role is bread and butter for someone of Ranbir's stature now. He eases into the role, initially playing the fun going flirty young man, then growing into the serious, yet romantic mature man later. This role is not on the same level as Barfi, there is no comparison, however it's these types of roles that will keep Ranbir competing with the likes of SRK for the romantic king award! Deepika has grown massively this year, and this being the third film (Ram Leela is the 4th) she has hit the industry with a bang in 2013. She looks stunning on screen and plays her role perfectly! Kalki, as annoying as her role, again plays it without any blemishes. Her role reminds you of Zindagi Na Milenge Dobara quite a lot! Aditya seems to be alcoholic of 2013 with this and Aashiqui 2 but does full justice to the role regardless!"

The list goes on and on....\n\nThis film can be compared to rat turd. It really stinks!\n\nThe film is about a young teenager Naina (Deepika Paad-ukone Paad=Fart in Hindi or Gujarti for that matter...) leaving home against her parents wishes and going on a camping trip. There here womanhood wakens and she feels sexually drawn to another college-mate she knows called Bunny(The Runt Kapoor).\n\nEight years pass. Naina finishes medical school and works in a clinic. Bunny works as a television cameraman for travel shows and roams the world, as he had planned. They meet again in Udaipur, for Aditi's lavish wedding to Taran (Kunaal Roy Kapur), an awkward but adoring engineer. Naina and Bunny are again strongly attracted to each other. Both resist love \u2013 Bunny because he does not want to give up a dream job he has been offered (as a travel show host), Naina because she fears that Bunny will break her heart again. Will they find a way to be together? Spectacular dance numbers punctuate a roller-coaster romance. Only in the last few minutes of the film does love triumph.\n\nVerdict: you're better off watching the above mentioned movies."

While Naina graduated top of her class and is at the top of her class in medical school, this meeting with the schoolmate left Naina feeling that she's missing something...fun. So, on a lark, she decides to drop everything and head off on an adventure--and she picks the same destination the vacuous schoolmate chose. There, Naina slowly learns to unwind and meets sexy Bunny (he is a man--not some furry--despite the name). They hit it off and seem to be falling in love but one HUGE problem stands in their way--Bunny has vowed never to marry and wants to travel the world and experience EVERYTHING. What's to happen? See the film.\n\nLike the typical Bollywood film, this romance is predictable and there's lots of singing. You can't fault the film for."

The best part is, he never borrows from romantic clich\u00e9s that most love stories depend upon and that, in my opinion, is this film's biggest strength. Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... On the whole, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a revitalizing take on romance and relationships. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age-groups."

A boy and a girl take a life-altering holiday together. She is mousy, studious, bespectacled. She doesn't drink, smoke and has never been kissed. He is a reckless charmer who flirts outrageously. Love blossoms, for her at least, but they must part and then reunite in the foreground of a big fat Indian wedding. Where they enjoy the party."

Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the film beautifully captures the essence of youthful exuberance and the complexities of personal growth.\n\nThe story revolves around Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone), an introverted medical student who embarks on a transformative journey to the Himalayas with her former classmates. The trip rekindles her friendship with the charming and adventurous Kabir \"Bunny\" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor), the carefree Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), and the vibrant Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). As Naina finds herself falling for Bunny, she faces the bittersweet realization that his dreams of wandering the world might never align with her hopes of a settled life.\n\nRanbir Kapoor shines as Bunny, bringing a charismatic energy to the role of a man torn between his wanderlust and newfound love. Deepika Padukone delivers a compelling performance as Naina, transitioning from a shy introvert to a confident woman. The chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika is palpable, adding depth to their evolving relationship.\n\nThe supporting cast, particularly Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin, add vibrant colours to the narrative. Aditya's portrayal of Avi, a fun-loving yet troubled friend, and Kalki's Aditi, who navigates her feelings and eventual maturity, are noteworthy.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its relatable characters and the message that life is about finding a balance between pursuing your dreams and valuing the relationships that shape you. The scenic cinematography, capturing the breathtaking landscapes of Manali and Udaipur, adds a visual treat to the emotional rollercoaster. However, the movie's length (2h 40m) might feel a bit stretched at times, and some scenes could have been crisper. Despite this, \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" remains a heartwarming film that emphasizes the importance of friendships and love while chasing one's dreams.\n\nOverall, \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is a must-watch for its beautiful portrayal of relationships and the timeless lesson that while it's essential to follow your dreams, the journey is more fulfilling when shared with loved ones."

Deepika's acting is not as captivating as that of Ranbir's or Kalki's or Aditya's.\n\n2. Music is great. Very cool and very hummable.\n\n3. Overall its a feel good movie.\n\n4. Direction is good.\n\n5. The places where the movie is shot are all so gorgeous.\n\nI wouldn't compare it to 'Dil Chahta Hai' (DCH) or the likes of DCH. Its just another movie which happens to have friends with issues that you can relate to.\n\nSo my suggestion will be \"Watch it for fun, don't try to make any sense out of it.\" If you do that you will also love it as much :)"

At least cud have saved 30 mins of audience. Power points of movie are Ranbir's acting and good punches in dialogue. Downside is that movie is having nothing new and kinda gets boring by end. I literally saw ppl watching time on when this movie is gonna end in hall. Lol.... Anyways.. Lets hope for a better flick next time... My 2 cents on this?? Don't waste your hard earned money..."

So, this movie has a different place in my mind bcuz of the experience of watching it alone. I will remember this movie for the rest of my life, and watching it just before going to the college has a different place in my memories . However, the story could have been a bit better, but nonetheless it's a total entertainment package , specially the background music at different time intervals gives me goosebumps even after so many years!!!"

I don't know if people understood the purity of the film when it was first released though serious, this is my all time favourite forever will be. I can't find a flaw or waste my time on that because of it being impossible.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is it's grip on audience.

Plus, the dance sequences are super energetic and will make you want to get up and groove along!\n\nThe music in this film is a total hit! From the foot-tapping \"Badtameez Dil\" to the soulful \"Kabira,\" the soundtrack is diverse and memorable. The songs add an extra layer of enjoyment and perfectly capture the different moods and emotions of the story.\n\nKalki Koechlin and Aditya Roy Kapur bring their own charm to the film and add depth to the story.

An hour into the movie and I could not figure out what was different about this one than the so many zillion formulaic movies made before..I could not think of one difference. Also,it's very lengthy,almost 3 hours. It felt like Ayan Mukherjee had to remind people he was still in the industry and he made a meaningless movie to prove this and he had an unlimited budget for this. Yes,the songs are great,the actors are too good and it's shot in very scenic locations,but it is the story or the absence of one that let me down. By the end of it,it felt like 4 great actors were thrown in front of the camera and asked to relive their earlier years. Nonetheless,it has a lot of dreamy content and it does make you feel good because of its good music and an unrealistic happy ending. Watch it if you're a big fan of the romantic genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is a delightful blend of romance, comedy, and life lessons that resonates deeply with anyone who's ever had dreams, fallen in love, or cherished friendships. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the film beautifully captures the essence of youthful exuberance and the complexities of personal growth.\n\nThe story revolves around Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone), an introverted medical student who embarks on a transformative journey to the Himalayas with her former classmates. The trip rekindles her friendship with the charming and adventurous Kabir \"Bunny\" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor), the carefree Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur), and the vibrant Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). As Naina finds herself falling for Bunny, she faces the bittersweet realization that his dreams of wandering the world might never align with her hopes of a settled life.\n\nRanbir Kapoor shines as Bunny, bringing a charismatic energy to the role of a man torn between his wanderlust and newfound love. Deepika Padukone delivers a compelling performance as Naina, transitioning from a shy introvert to a confident woman. The chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika is palpable, adding depth to their evolving relationship.\n\nThe supporting cast, particularly Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki Koechlin, add vibrant colors to the narrative. Aditya's portrayal of Avi, a fun-loving yet troubled friend, and Kalki's Aditi, who navigates her feelings and eventual maturity, are noteworthy.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its relatable characters and the message that life is about finding a balance between pursuing your dreams and valuing the relationships that shape you. The scenic cinematography, capturing the breathtaking landscapes of Manali and Udaipur, adds a visual treat to the emotional rollercoaster.\n\nThe soundtrack, with its memorable tracks like \"Badtameez Dil\" and \"Kabira,\" complements the film's mood perfectly, making it an auditory delight.\n\nHowever, the movie's length (2h 40m) might feel a bit stretched at times, and some scenes could have been crisper. Despite this, \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" remains a heartwarming film that emphasizes the importance of friendships and love while chasing one's dreams.\n\nOverall, \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" is a must-watch for its beautiful portrayal of relationships and the timeless lesson that while it's essential to follow your dreams, the journey is more fulfilling when shared with loved ones."

It is kind of sad mixture of two or three recent hit movies like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Karan Johar should spent more time making movies rather having coffees. Songs are barely OK. Even Kabeera's lyrics let it down, although beautiful music to it. I am banging my head about what Aashqui 2 guy Aditya Roy Kapoor is doing in this movie. Ranbir Kapoor and Kalki Koechlin are way over the top in first half of the movie. It seems the movie desperately cries for experience all along."

The performance of Ranbir is a not-much-not-less kind of performance.It's an appropriate mix of a charmer,a believer,a good dancer and a dream follower.Deepika is so good in her Geek-naina,Independent-Naina and Lover-Naina character.A genuine performance by her.Kalki is so much fun each and every time she appears. The new pjyakkar and sharabi of Bollywood has arrived.He(Aditya Roy Kapoor) should learn how to control his facial expression while delivering his dialogues rather than doing roles of a sharabi.Faarooq Sheikh is awesome in his cameo. But the real hero or rather star of YJHD is Pritam Chakraborty.His compositions are sometimes rocking and sometimes so soulful that stands tall or even compromises for some dull moments in the movie.Hats Off to the Genius.Chart busters such as Badtameez Dil,Ghaghra,Dilliwali Girlfriend and soulful tracks like Shubhanallah,Kabira and Illahi are there.The music is for the classes as well as the masses. The movie suffers too much while giving messages which needed a deft touch.Inspite of some fun moments there really are less no. of high points in the movie.\n\nIt could've been a much better movie if they had done some more work on the script.Watch it for it's Music,Ranbir-Deepika and last but not the least Madhuri's comeback."

And it simply drives us through some magic moments, those moments are though exaggerated as part of dharma movie but we can relate to.\n\nAnd 2nd part of movie, we find ourselves more inverted in Ranbir's character. This movie is such a breeze to watch. Emotionally full of love and feel good moments. And ranbir's scene at the end touched me. It is really feel good movie.\n\nBoth Ranbir and Deepika nailed in the movie. But deepika looks more natural."

Message conveyed is completely out of my moral compass. Humor was just mediocre.All in all this is miles away at best compared with movies in the caliber of \"Veer Zaara\",\"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\".When a movie is intriguing it ends so fast as I am not conscience about time but after 45 minutes of this movie I felt many times stop watching it.Please Mr Ayan Mukherji you have a lot to take from your producer Karan Johar's books."

Directed by Ayan Mukerji, whose last venture was the impressive Wake Up Sid, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani has all the elements required to make a good film. However, Ayan falters way too often, both with the screenplay and direction, which make YJHD just an average film. The story has shades of Dil Chahta Hai, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and 3 Idiots, but it does not charm you like any of those. I thought the screenplay was mediocre.\n\nNevertheless, a decent one time watch. Deepika and Ranbir sizzle up the screen, while the rest of the cast does a good job. On the downside, a shorter film with better screenplay would have been more effective.\n\nActing: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7.5/10 Technical Aspects: 7/10\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nFor a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)"

The best part is, he never borrows from romantic clich\u00e9s that most love stories depend upon and that, in my opinion, is this film's biggest strength. Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... On the whole, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is a revitalizing take on romance and relationships. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age-groups. Watch this celebration of love and get mesmerized!\n\n30 out of 41 found this helpful\n\nPeter_Young17 September 2021 6/10 Enjoyable but pretty much a rehash Ayan Mukerji previously directed Wake Up Sid, his directorial debut, and he did a wonderful job with a film that was both refreshing and very good in and of itself. Just as it often goes with second ventures of promising first-timers, his next film, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, is nowhere as good. I knew nothing about this film when I started watching it except that it was an extraordinary mainstream success. But I was quite interested in watching it. The film is not bad at all, but it just doesn't live up the hype it seeks to generate at its core premise.\n\nThe film follows four youngsters in one of their last trips together before one of them leaves the country. While the film is beautifully shot and is a thoroughly enjoyable watch, it's never more than pleasant, it's never overwhelming, and there's hardly any reminiscence of what the title prepared us for - you'll see none of the youth craze or even youth culture that you would probably immediately associate with this film, and what is lacking at the heart of an otherwise watchable film is the much called-for wild spirit which Mukherjee doesn't manage to capture.\n\nAnd it's not that Mukerji doesn't try. He does. There are some scenes of running through the markets, there are catchy songs and pretty girls, but the script often makes the story not ring true. The only portion where it leaves a mark is in the relationship between the two friends who meet after many years. The romantic tension between the two leads does work to a point, but sometimes it's too polished and fairy tale-like to really be impactful. And the biggest problem, it mostly just feels a rehash of previous films. At points the references to old Dharma (the production company under which the film is produced) films, people, and songs, is really pathetic.\n\nThe film's characters are merely derivative of previous famous characters, and are never given enough depth. Ranbir Kapoor repeats his Wake Up Sid character, and he does it well although it feels he never allows himself to shed all his inhibitions. Aditya Roy Kapur is exceedingly good in some parts and struggles in others, while Kalki is wasted although she is consistently good. The winner of course is Deepika. Again, her character is just a recap of popular characters (Kajol's Anjali in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai; Preity Zinta's Naina in Kal Ho Naa Ho), but she is wonderful, subtly conveying much through her expressive eyes and the tiny, nuanced gestures on her pretty face.\n\nTowards the end, the film grows incresingly fluffy, corny and starry, much to the point of losing the lighthearted nature it sought to define back in the beginning of the show. Heavy music and numerous sentimental scenes are followed by a most shallow moment of realisation on the part of the male protagonist, which is not convincing enough. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is not bad, I have no doubt some would highly enjoy it. Actually I enjoyed it too, I just expected more from this film and was disappointed. Still so, it is watchable and entertaining, with some nice romantic and musical portions.\n\n13 out of 17 found this helpful\n\narupghose16 November 2013 8/10 A film that will make you want to fall in love I'm watching this film well after it was released in the cinemas (in fact after seeing both Besharam and Chennai Express) so I know how the film had performed at the box office, and what most people thought of it so my expectations were high!\n\nYJHD does through the typical roller coaster of a Bollywood romance, but where it differs from those that have failed, is that it has the star power of Ranbir and Deepika at the top of their game, alongside lovely music by Pritam and fantastic direction by Ayan Mukherjee.\n\nAyan is certainly one of the top young directors in the industry, and after Wake Up Sid, shows exactly why he holds his mantle piece. This work will go down as one of his finest, even though I am sure he will make many more films.\n\nThis role is bread and butter for someone of Ranbir's stature now. He eases into the role, initially playing the fun going flirty young man, then growing into the serious, yet romantic mature man later. This role is not on the same level as Barfi, there is no comparison, however it's these types of roles that will keep Ranbir competing with the likes of SRK for the romantic king award! Deepika has grown massively this year, and this being the third film (Ram Leela is the 4th) she has hit the industry with a bang in 2013. She looks stunning on screen and plays her role perfectly! Kalki, as annoying as her role, again plays it without any blemishes. Her role reminds you of Zindagi Na Milenge Dobara quite a lot! Aditya seems to be alcoholic of 2013 with this and Aashiqui 2 but does full justice to the role regardless!\n\nAnother massive plus point to the film Pritam's music. It's soulful throughout and adds a lot to the film. Kabira, Ilahi and Balam Picharki are my favourites.\n\nOverall YJHD is a beautiful film with performances that will be hard to forget. It may not win any awards this year, but it will certainly will be a film I'll remember.\n\n22 out of 33 found this helpful\n\nplanktonrules14 October 2013 7/10 The story of Naina and Bunny has a few clich\u00e9s, but it enjoyable and fun.\n\nI enjoyed watching \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" quite a bit, though I'll admit that the story has a few clich\u00e9s here and there that kept it from being better. Still, given that I was watching it while flying across the Atlantic, it was a nice time-passer and kept my attention.\n\nThe film begins with Naina and her mother meeting up with a rather vacuous old schoolmate of Naina. While Naina graduated top of her class and is at the top of her class in medical school, this meeting with the schoolmate left Naina feeling that she's missing something...fun. So, on a lark, she decides to drop everything and head off on an adventure--and she picks the same destination the vacuous schoolmate chose. There, Naina slowly learns to unwind and meets sexy Bunny (he is a man--not some furry--despite the name). They hit it off and seem to be falling in love but one HUGE problem stands in their way--Bunny has vowed never to marry and wants to travel the world and experience EVERYTHING. What's to happen? See the film.\n\nLike the typical Bollywood film, this romance is predictable and there's lots of singing. You can't fault the film for this--this is THE format that Indian films follow these days and very few deviate from this. My problem with the film, and it's minor, was the silly scene were Naina takes off her glasses and instantly people notice how hot she is! What a clich\u00e9....plus my wife was much like Naina when I met her but is hot with and without her glasses! Still, it's fun and worth seeing.\n\n9 out of 14 found this helpful\n\nnairtejas31 May 2013 5/10 Ayan Mukherji Takes An Already Narrated Story & Adds Nothing To It... 50% Rating: 5/10\n\nHe takes up a ghissa-pita story, much like his debut Wake Up Sid and tries to turn it around. With the cast so heavily gorgeous giving out performances like its their last, revs up the movie-watching experience only for the first half. The second half sucks and drags a lot with cheeky references and illogical sequences. Overall, the route taken to say an old, short, romantic story, is arduous and infested with clich\u00e9s as it dives into deep philosophy...\n\nTraces of Dil Chahta Hai, Rang De Basanti, Kai Po Che & even Aashiqui 2 is explicit, so is the filmmaking which feels like they have been inspired by Zoya Akhtar. Even the screenplay is timid. The story is clich\u00e9d, yes, and to make it worse, the climax actually works against the film although it is justified for a theme like this. Unpredictability is stereotype here but Ayan molds it for his audience as a fun, frothy buddy flick which actually loses pace when theme of Rockstar & Karan Johar led family ties enter the plot.. Juxtaposed with heavy numbers, life elements, relationships, romance & social conflicts, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani only appeals till midway.\n\nRanbir (who the film is almost based upon with the decisions he has to make as a complelling life of a nomad) & Deepike jazz up the screen with no mistake at all; yet Deepika's sudden shift from a pious, studious dame to her usual party- girl avatar is fishy , while Kalki & Aditya pass, with the script not letting them explore their insights. Kunaal is apt for the role while I still cannot construe what Poornima, Dixit & Rana were doing there. Revealing their characters may spoil the watch. Parental conflicts, much like in WUS is prevalent. Supporting cast (Farooq, Tanvi) is terrific. Music is brilliant and the locations add up to the movie-watching experience. At 165 minutes, the play seems to immensely go out of bounds, but the lead pair try hard and dishearteningly fail to keep us hooked. Emotions are played with and usual jealousy element brought up. Get a life, Ay."
