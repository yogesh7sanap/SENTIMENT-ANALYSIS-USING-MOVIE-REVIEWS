        "review_detailed_main": "A pair of Great White sharks attack Sea World in Florida.\n\nJaws 3-D is a mostly weak film but has the redeeming quality of presenting such an outrageous concept you cannot help but watch it unfold. Additionally, it's artistic and technical merits are quite enjoyably flawed.\n\nJaws 2 was an unnecessary yet well made sequel, but having members of Brody family face yet another \"murderer\" shark is a laughably daft concept. Rather disturbingly it continued a trend of movies that demonise sharks. There are numerous other ideas involving the behaviour of sharks/dolphins and reactions of the main characters that are equally as bizarre, but if you can switch the brain off and appreciate their entertainment value you might find it a worthwhile investment of time. It also contains recycled character arcs from the original movie that feel like pale imitations.\n\nTechnically it has problems, particularly when most viewers will not get the chance to see the theatrical release. Most visuals designed for a 3-D experience stand out and do not have the same impact.\n\nThe shark horror sequences have little build up or tension and are quite unconvincing. I do admire the ambition of attempting to create a victim's perspective sequence from the inside of its mouth, but most of the final scenes of painfully slow moving underwater horror, (particularly the moment in the control room) are incredibly ropey.\n\nThat's not to say that the classic original did not (in principle) have the same problems. A mechanical shark looks like nothing else in every Jaws movie. However, Spielberg understood this and wisely kept the shark mostly hidden and focussed on developing great characters and tension.\n\nI feel sorry for the editor of this sequel as it appears they had to cut together footage from both above and below the sea level that make the water's depth and lighting conditions look very inconsistent.\n\nFor some balance I am positive about the performances. Most actors do their best with dodgy material. Louis Gossett Jr, Bess Armstrong, and the coked up Dennis Quaid standout. Lea Thompson has some memorable moments as the \"professional water skier\". It feels the direction was more focussed on making the cast look good in shorts and swimsuits than character portrayals, but they manage to elevate some scenes. Armstrong convinces me as a whale/dolphin wrangler and I think she is the strongest performer.\n\nAs a young child of the 80s I quite enjoyed it on VHS. On a recent rewatch I placed it in the genre: so bad it's good, and sub-genre: never rewatch and spoil that of which you have fond childhood memories."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this one in all its 3D glory in the theater back in 1983, and it really scared the heck out of me. (I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.\n\nThis film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.\n\nThe cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.\n\nThe individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.\n\nThis film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the Jaws franchise you'd think it could amount to a solid sequel. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon, or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent, this film is not.\n\nThere's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different, and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.\n\nThe effects are wretched. In fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.\n\nThe actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive, but again they don't really add anything, and Thompson seems especially vapid here. Luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music, effects, editing and overall storytelling distract from their work."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.\n\nIt's an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to \u00a8Revenge of the creature\u00a8(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to \u00a8Back to the future\u00a8) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, the movie fails mainly due to the 3D effects (sorry for my English, I'm a Spaniard!) 'cause they wanna be more than they're. Sometimes, they look laughable, but the physical effects are awesome (the great great white). I appreciate this movie 'cause this is a movie of my childhood. I saw and recorded it on TV, and I grew with Mike and Kathryn, my right heroes!!!.\n\nNow, I'm conscious about the film's mistakes, but, for a third installment, the result ins't so bad. The plot couldn't innovate the genre, but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes, the scales don't agree, and the \"lake\" looks deeper than it is, for example. The ending, with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...\n\nThe characters are well performed, but I saw this film on the Spanish version, so the \"dubbing actors\" could act better than the original actors. Because of that, I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award \u00bf?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.\n\nThis movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D, the movie was totally fabulous. But, furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it?"

When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.\n\nNot recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless."

The film definitely misses Roy Schneider who was the focal character (apart from the Shark of course.)\n\nIt's definitely better then Jaws The Revenge which is an absolute waste of time. In shark terms this film would be a Basking Shark, it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. It's a film you watch for a bit of fun, it's hard to take this one seriously. 4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is Jaws' second sequel, which I think is the best of the three following the original movie. The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character, Mike and Sean, take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark, which happened to be trapped inside the park, and later perishes. To their surprise, the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother, a huge Great-White shark, is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore, they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.\n\nThe special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies, with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes, you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score, I think, and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.\n\nWhile this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers, even garnering several Razzie Award nominations, I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea, and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park, where thousands of visitors are, and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.\n\nThere are more surprises and thrilling moments, I think, than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room, puncturing the glass, letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.\n\nOverall, Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value, but is what I think the better of the three sequels.\n\nGrade B"

This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt. One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously). I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it. The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there. There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater. This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it."

All in all, a hilarious movie. I wouldn't have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I began watching \"Jaws 3-D\" I had to laugh. According to IMDB and the film itself, it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well, Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.\n\nThe first portion of \"Jaws 3-D\" wasn't that bad. Sure, there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of \"SCTV\" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed, the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and, especially, the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and, it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples, as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea, it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water, it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself, despite nearly a decade between this film and the original \"Jaws\", the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!\n\nOverall, a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing, however, about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, for example, managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely, despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!\n\nIf you didn't know, this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it, as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years, folks STILL remember it and hate it. A terrible film."

To me, the jaw is more scary in this third part then in the first part for example. You can nicely see his body and its just scary to see how big he is. The plot is also very interesting, about a water park that opens his doors for the first time with some nice people working their that gives the movie a lot of fun times to watch. No stupid characters and some moments are really good like when the shark attacks some of the underwater parts of the park or when the dolphins helps the people fight the jaw. Very nice movie."

I could feel the audience slipping away into some mass coma. It was heartbreaking. I remember my friend glancing at me, his eyes lifeless and sad. Special Jaws 3 counselling groups were set up in my local area and I attended regularly.This crime against cinema should be battered and fried. Absolutely disgraceful."

It's mostly just humans... doing stuff. When the shark shows up, you're like \"Wow! There's a shark in this movie?\", since it's basically a Sea World training video featuring Jaws. The ending is pretty random. Okay, so Mike and his girl make it out okay, and what's the first thing on their mind? The dolphins! Are you serious? The dolphins? That's your main concern? How about wondering if your friends are still alive? Before I go, I'd like to say that the scene where the shark comes towards the workers probably looked cool in 3-D, but when you view it on the movie's 2-D home video release, it just looks silly."

There may be lots of floors but it is a good movie so overall I would think that this movie may be stupid but it does not deserve the extremely low rating and low respect to it.

The film used the best technology available to put you right in the movie. Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., and the other actors did a fine job.

The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else. It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. I'm tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot). Don't see this or part 4 because they both suck. Just watch the first two."

Even the second film was better, and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece, it was watchable.\n\nOne major problem with this film is that it's dull, in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.\n\nThe suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.\n\nThe locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.\n\nThe acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.\n\nSo overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The movie spends way too much time showing the lives of the characters, including many unnecessary scenes that shouldn't have been in the film. The attacks are not scary or suspenseful, there is very little gore. The terror is missing in the movie! No one seems to be afraid, instead they have everything under control all the time. The only thing the movie has going for itself is the wonderful cast. Dennis Quaid is amazing as always along with Lea Thompson. Bess Armstong and Simon MacCorkindale were also good choices for their roles. Overall its a movie to laugh at, but you cant help but watch it because it contains the name Jaws on its title."

It had potential, but unfortunately, that potential goes to waste. The script is uninspired and unengaging, populated with poorly developed characters who failed to capture my interest. Although Dennis Quaid's performance was somewhat watchable, even his charisma couldn't salvage the film. The decision to centre a third killer shark movie around the same family felt incredibly lazy, as did many of the story beats.\n\nWhile it might be unfair to critique the 3D elements of the movie since I watched it in 2D, the film heavily relies on gimmicky \"pop out\" effects that are impossible to ignore. While I can't speak for how good or bad they look in 3D, these optical effects are distractingly bad when watching the film in 2D."

Mike's girlfriend is the senior biologist Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong), who also works in the park. He is waiting for his brother Sean Brody (John Putch) that will spend a couple of days with them. Sean meets the skier Kelly Ann Bukowski (Lea Thompson) in a bar and dates her. The park is located in a lagoon connected to the sea through a gate. While the gates are opened with a defect, a great white shark hides inside the lagoon and nobody notes. When the mechanic Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) repairs the gate, he is attacked by the white shark and dies. Finally, the inauguration day comes and the park is crowded with families. But the shark is on the loose in the lagoon.\n\n\"Jaws 3-D\" (1983) is a forgettable movie made to explore the success of the franchise. The story is obviously unoriginal and slightly entertains. The good names of Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr and Lea Thompson in the cast and a few scenes save this film from a total failure. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tubar\u00e3o 3\" (\"Shark 3\")"

The original 3D effects are pretty obvious, except that in the non-3D version, the ones that were filmed as bluescreen shots look absolutely horrible, while the non-bluescreen ones just look silly. In one shot, a chunk of a submersible boat actually disappears before our eyes. I can only assume it didn't look that way in the 3D version, or they never would have left the shot in.\n\nCriticizing the plot seems almost beside the point. I mean, yet another huge killer shark (this makes number 3!) shows up, this time in Florida, where former two-time huge-killer-shark-attack victim Mike Brody just happens to be working at Sea World? Give me a break.\n\nI can't imagine why the Sea World people thought this was a good idea. The movie is atrocious, and makes Sea World look just awful in every possible way. On the other hand, if the movie had been really good, it would have made Sea World look like a terrifying place where visitors can easily become a shark's dinner. The idea behind this truly escapes me.\n\nI have to admit that the cable-TV version I watched was even worse than it had any right to be, since the filmmakers' incompetence was at least tripled by a horrible videotape transfer, appalling sound, and perhaps the worst pan-and-scan I have ever encountered."

You don't get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first movie Jaws (1975) directed by Steven Spielberg is one of the best films he has directed other than the three great Indiana Jones movies, the first movie had good performances, likable characters, and was suspenseful to watch making it a great movie; after the second movie Jaws 2 (1978) not being as good, who knows how the third will go, especially in 3D. The third movie Jaws 3-D (1983) is not a good thriller with average performances, no likable characters to care about, bad 3D effects, and annoying/stupid people I did not care for; the effects and look of the shark works fine for the movie occasionally, but it felt like it was trying too hard to put the 3D gimmick in your face, along with the interesting setting of it being at SeaWorld for some reason.\n\nI did not care that much for the main characters because they were not as likable or funny as the main characters from the first movie; because I do not care about the characters that much, I wanted the shark to attack them, they make dumb choices when it came to saving themselves or anyone else at SeaWorld. For some reason, the characters want to hold the shark in its own room for display without killing it, which leads to things going wrong and the shark finding its way into SeaWorld; I also did not like the dialogue each character had making them sound stupid and have dumb lines that can be unintentionally funny just like the bad 3D effects throughout the movie involving underwater or in some shark attacks.\n\nThe shark is shown quite a bit with it sometimes being an animatronic and the effects are ok, except for the 3D effects; I still like how we will get the point of view of the shark from under and above the water, and the 3D effects are laughable with it trying to look like it is coming close to you. The music for the movie is ok, since it is not done by John Williams who did the first; also, you still have the main Jaws theme that is cool to listen to, along with the movie has a lot of people doing dumb things involving them somehow killing themselves or getting the shark to kill them because of them not listening to any professionals telling them to get out of the water when the shark appears.\n\nJaws 3-D (1983) is worse than the second movie with it having bad dialogue, bad characters, bad effects, and bad 3D; this sequel is not as good as the first, but it is funny to watch because of how bad it is, and the first movie Jaws (1975) was way better in giving a suspenseful shark thriller, so I would recommend watching that than this; if you liked the first film, then you will either dislike or like this, it just depends on if you like shark movies, or if you do not want to watch this because there is no Steven Spielberg directing, then I would just stick with watching and rewatching the first movie."

Despite being years after the original the shark looks worse and to top it off there are some sequences that have been sped up and others that are in slow motion- it looks ridiculous and is an attempt to make up for a lack of quality shots or effects. The crowning (poor) moment is a shark towards the end that moves so slow and so fake towards our \"heroes\" that words fail me, just as all those who worked on this film failed their audience. The script is awful as well by the way, but it barely matters, you won't believe what you are seeing. Atrocious."

        "review_detailed_main": "By this time, it was feeling like 'another day, another Jaws film' but this time, the hook was that the film was in 3D. I think the idea of having a Jaws film in 3D is a stroke of genius \u0096 the idea of having a shark pop out at the cinema audience must've seemed as if it was on par with the discovery of gravity or the founding of new land after a six month boat journey. Alas, since I saw this film in its 2D cousin format; I didn't get the thrill I'm sure I would've got had it been in three dimensions. Given this information, I'll give my opinions based on a 2D viewing as it's only fair.\n\nI think a lot of people have a problem with the film's effects. True, having the bottom of a submarine disappear into the background and then reappear as it turns around is a sure fire way of completely zoning your audience out of the reality of the film but if it had been in 3D, I'm sure it would've created cheers instead of jeers. I've seen a 3D film at an IMAX cinema and I can tell you it's a joy to behold to see things pop out at you. These things supposedly happen in Jaws 3D at well spaced times. The shark charges at you and glass flies at the screen, dolphins do their jumping and water sprays everywhere and as I've mentioned, a one man submarine swims around on a clear blue, water background but when you're viewing them on a television, it just looks like an absolute abomination, graphics wise.\n\nWhat I liked is the way the action is moved away from the beach and the film goes down a new route; moving away from the cop-come-suspicion-come-convincing act in a refreshing way. What Jaws 3D does do differently that I'm sure it wishes it hadn't consists of numerous things. For one, you don't need to be a marine biologist to know that sharks can't swim backwards. They did so in Deep Blue Sea (1999) but we were given reason \u0096 they were genetically altered; but here, the shark just seems to feel like it \u0096 so it does so. Arguably the worst continuity error in a film of all time. Secondly, the film follows the previous Jaws instalments by having the character bicker and argue for a while; in this case the conflict is distinctly put across through the English characters and the Americans as they talk about what they'll do. The English want to kill it and the Americans want to save it; keeping it for their park. A bit of a misrepresentation, if you ask me.\n\nAlthough there are some glaring errors throughout this film: such as the shark swimming backwards and the fact it managed to break through a pane of glass that was obviously too thick since it's pressurised for being underwater. Not to mention the annoying and cheesy way the dolphins attempt to 'save the day', the film remains as an average action adventure piece that doesn't have brain cells but doesn't need them. People mark the film down for its effects but that's premature since they probably saw it on a 2D screen anyway. I thinks it's fitting how one character says to the other when they're discussing the equipment they use at the sea world park: 'You build it and I swim in it.' The same could be said for Spielberg, his original Jaws film success and its predecessors sequels \u0096 you build in it and we'll swim in it."

Yes, fans of B-movies will truly be delighted by this movie. It really is a entertaining campy movie.\n\nStill of course as a movie this is not a very good one. The story is just completely ridiculous and the dialog is laughable at times. The movie its beginning really isn't that bad but as the movie progresses the movie becomes more and more ridicules and unbelievable. Towards the ending the movie even manages to turn into one of those typical '70's s disaster flicks, despite the fact that this movie was released in '83. The shark himself also never looked worse. The silly looking '3-D' effects also don't do much good to the movie. Still none of this takes away the entertainment value of the movie. It's certainly fun to watch and it's obvious at times that the makers and cast also didn't took the movie itself very serious. It even at fist was originally going to be a spoof of the original.\n\nVery bad as a part of the \"Jaws\" franchise, very entertaining as an individual (B)movie.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "JAWS 3-D gets a lot of undeserved hate. The film isn't nearly as bad as most people seem to think it is. It's actually a fun and enjoyable piece of early 80s cinema. The score is great, mixing old themes with all new ones. It really fits the setting well. Most of the characters are likable, interesting, and just plain funny (which adds to the enjoyment of the film) and the story itself makes for a fine old- school monster movie. A lot of the underwater scenes are dark and grainy but that just goes to enhance the atmosphere and make it even more spooky.\n\nAll of the actors play their parts well. Dennis Quaid is great as always. Lea Thomson, Louis Gossett Jr., John Putch, Simon MacCorkindale, and P. H. Moriarty all do a fine job. Bess Armstrong is probably the most annoying of the bunch but over time she's grown on me. I don't find her to be quite so bad anymore. Overall, nobody does a bad job. The first half of the film has the reputation of being boring because there is limited \"shark action,\" but to me this is the best part. This is the period that sets the mood and allows us to get to know all of the characters and builds suspense toward the eventual encounter because we know the shark is trapped in the park. By the time the second half starts and the \"shark action\" really kicks into overdrive, everything has been established, the stakes have been raised, and it just makes it all the more interesting.\n\nA lot of the 3D effects look extremely corny, especially seeing them in 2D, but that just adds to the film's overall charm. Comparing it to today's slick, ultra-glossy, extremely fake looking CGI and I greatly prefer the old cheesy effects. At least they're unique and charming rather than lifeless and completely devoid of any emotion at all (like CGI). But of all the film's complaints, the effects seem to be what gets the most scorn, and I believe that to be the main reason why the film has the reputation it does. Most people can't seem to get past the peculiar effects. The shark itself doesn't look amazing, but I definitely prefer it to the shark from either 2 or 4. But at the end of the day, I guess the bottom line for all the effects is if you're specifically looking to criticize the film for it, you'll definitely have plenty to work with. But if you're able to just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and look past its superficial flaws, you'll have an extremely fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe key is to watch this film on its own and not right after the original or any of the others. Let's face it, the original JAWS is not only the best film in the franchise, it's the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the best films period of all time. Most films aren't going to measure up. The second film isn't terrible but it's definitely a major step down from the first and can be quite boring to get through, especially on repeat viewings. The fourth movie (Revenge) is a notoriously bad facepalm-inducing catastrophe of epic proportions. It literally killed off the franchise and isn't worth talking about beyond that. As a whole though, 1, 2, and 4 seem to be the real trilogy of this franchise (though I personally prefer it as 1, 2, 3). As is though, JAWS 3-D is the outlier in look, feel, and setting, but boy is it better for it. It's far and away better and more interesting than either sequel, by a long shot. It isn't boring and it certainly isn't awful. You just have to see it for what it is.... a fun, cheesy, 80s monster movie with uniquely odd effects. If you give it a chance, it may grow on you."

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Jaws\" came out in 1975, it went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time (until \"Star Wars\" took that honor two years later). Three years after the film's release came \"Jaws 2\" which wasn't as scary and effective as its predecessor. Nevertheless, it made money, and the franchise distributor Universal wanted to make another \"Jaws\" film. Five years after \"Jaws 2\" came \"Jaws 3-D\". This time the filmmakers did something different. They threw in 3-D effects to conjure up scares. Why did they do this? I think it was due to the success of \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" which was released in 3-D a year earlier. That movie made money, and the makers of \"Jaws 3-D\" were hoping to cash in on the 3-D craze that was supposed to be big in 1983. During this particular year, a mess of 3-D movies came out. In addition to \"Jaws 3-D\" there was the sci-fi adventure \"Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone\" which starred Molly Ringwald (before \"Breakfast Club\"); \"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn\", another sci-fi movie featuring Richard Moll (before TV's \"Night Court\") and Kelly Preston (before she became Mrs. John Travolta); the comedy \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" starring Steve Guttenberg (before the \"Police Academy\" and \"Cocoon\" movies); and \"Amityville 3-D\", the third in the series about a haunted house which featured Meg Ryan in one of her early film roles. \"Jaws 3-D\" was the most successful movie of this bunch, but that didn't say much. The 3-D craze didn't go into 1984 like it was predicted. In fact, all these movies got horrible reviews from critics and people stayed away from them. However, I went to see \"Jaws 3-D\" when I was only 12 years old. I really didn't know a whole lot about 3-D at the time. I was told that it was a device in a movie where things come at you. When I was going to see \"Jaws 3-D\" I, along with my mother and a friend were given those special 3-D glasses which you had to wear if you wanted to see the 3-D effects. I put the glasses on, then the movie started. It was one of the most awesome experiences I ever had while seeing a movie on the big screen. I had never seen anything like it. But that was just a one time experience. They don't make movies like this anymore, so I haven't been able to experience a 3-D movie since. \"Jaws 3-D\" is the only movie I ever went to see that was filmed in 3-D. At that time I didn't care if the movie was critically bad and poorly made. I went to see it and had a good time. And on the basis of that one time movie going experience, I give \"Jaws 3-D\" three stars. But (and this is a big but), on home video and on TV the movie is knows simply as \"Jaws III\". The 3-D effects don't come at you on the small screen as they did on the big screen. And that's disappointing. \"Jaws 3-D\" was only memorable for its 3-D effects, but since the effects don't come at you on the small screen, \"Jaws III\" is forgetable. And that's the version you'll be seeing of this movie from here on out. So I can only give \"Jaws III\" two stars.\n\n** (out of four)"

The first half an hour of the film is filled with Friday the 13th-grade teenagers faffing about, and when something finally does start to happen any suspense or terror is ruined by laughable special effects a 50's B-movie director would be ashamed of.

However, I have to admit that I have always enjoyed it ever since watching it for the first time as a child in the 1980s.\n\nThe storyline in \"Jaws 3-D\" is actually good. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of placing a shark in captivity and exhibit it, only to have the shark wreak havoc on the themepark and the visitors. Corny? Perhaps, but it actually provided me with adequate entertainment. I think writers Richard Matheson, Carl Gottlieb and Guerdon Trueblood actually put together quite an enjoyable script and storyline for the movie.\n\nThe acting performances in \"Jaws 3-D\" are good and they have a good cast ensemble, despite the fact that no one from the first two movies are in it. However, the movie does have the likes of Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr. And Lea Thompson on the cast list, so you are in good company.\n\nSure, the special effects in the movie are somewhat dubious. Especially the slow motion scene where the shark is swimming towards the glass window. I mean, that scene is so cringeworthy that you can't help but laugh. It was supposed to be an intense and scary scene, but it comes off as quite the opposite. However, in overall, I have to say that the shark effects in \"Jaw 3-D\" are actually fair enough, and I enjoy them.\n\nPerhaps \"Jaws 3-D\" is a guilty pleasure, but I have always enjoyed it, and I still do.\n\nMy rating of director Joe Alves' 1983 movie \"Jaws 3-D\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

But then, as per the late nineties approximately, we literally received an overflow of inferior and quite often downright retarded killer shark flicks. And now all of a sudden, the aforementioned Jaws sequels actually don't look too terrible anymore. It started in the late 90's with the still traditional but totally inept \"Deep Blue Sea\" and \"Shark Attack\", but then since the new Millennium things really got out of control with murderous sharks popping up in the most illogical of places (like the rivers in Venice, in Tsunami infested areas, swamps, etc\u0085) and \u2013 worse even \u2013 all kinds of ridiculous hybrids and genetically altered species, like dinosaur sharks, octopus-sharks and two-headed sharks. Sigh \u0085 whatever happened to good-old fashioned massively over-sized Great Whites, like in our classic early 80's stinker \"Jaws 3-D\"? Now, please don't misunderstand me, the third installment in the Jaws franchise is still a very lousy film, but at least it's not bad in a frustrating or annoying way. The underdeveloped screenplay, the laughable attempt to bring depth to the main characters, the hilarious 3D effects and all the totally irrelevant padding footage \u0085 It almost feels cheesy and charming in a positive sort of way now. Interesting detail here is that Universal Studios, the mastodon production company behind the Jaws franchise, sued the creators of an obscure Italian imitation for being too reminiscent, but then they were hypocrite enough to steal ideas from the movie they accused of stealing from them! That's Hollywood for you, I guess. The script attempts, poorly I may add, to build a bridge between the previous two movies by depicting the Brody boys (the sons of Roy Scheider) as pivot characters in the grand opening of a brand new Florida Ocean theme park. Mike, the oldest one, works there as the head engineer and his younger brother Sean \u2013 supposedly still suffering from his childhood trauma even though he blindly follows the first cute girl he meets straight in the water for a nightly swimming session \u2013 comes to visit him for the ceremony. Due to malfunctioning underwater fences and unreliable technical staff, the park quickly receives unforeseen visitors in the shape of a great white shark and its offspring. Also in good old Jaws tradition, the park's senior executive initially hopes to exploit the baby shark as a unique special attraction without realizing he puts the lives of hundreds of guests and personnel in danger. When Junior White dies in front of many spectators, mommy goes on a relentless killing and destruction spree. The body count is intolerably low for a shark movie, but that's probably because all the action is concentrated in the last twenty minutes of the film. Throughout more than an hour, we're only exposed to uninteresting relationship issues, dull family conversations and a whole lot of random waterskiing footage. Most of the supportive characters are embarrassing stereotypes (an Australian outback hunter?) and the effects are hysterical even by early 80's standards. Especially the shark's ultimate attack is legendary, as he approaches the underwater control room in slow motion while the people inside just pull stupid faces."

It absolutely blows my mind to fathom that the classic science fiction author Richard Matheson was somehow involved in co-writing this exercise in extreme tedium. The so-called \"story\" is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called \"Sea World\" where Chief Brody's now-grown son Michael works. Rather conveniently, two sharks (mother and child?) manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc.\n\nSounds like it has potential? Forget it. The new shark scenes are sillier than ever, the level of tension and suspense is nil, and the characters are completely uninteresting. The worst served here is actor Lou Gossett Jr., who was so excellent in the previous year's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. What a waste. Dennis Quaid plays Mike without much to do, and while his love interest Bess Armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way, she leaves no impression either. The selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-D effects, and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-D home screen.\n\nA really, really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made. This was followed by JAWS: THE REVENGE in 1987, and as maligned as that next film is by fans and critics, the truth is it turned out a little better than Number Three. * out of ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know how to explain what it is about Jaws 3 that I really, really don't like. The bad special effects, acting, direction, writing, etc. have all been mentioned to death. And yes, it was a really big dumb mistake to go all 3-D gimmicky. That's probably why they picked Joe Alves, the production designer from the first Jaws movie as well as others (Escape From New York, for example, another very grimy-dark and somewhat shoddy looking movie) to direct--the guy was obviously better with everything other than the human portions of the scenery. Or maybe not. The whole movie looks very flat and colorless...lifeless. It's strange.\n\nNo, I think what really kills this movie for me is that seems very...I don't know...UNPLEASANT. There are ways to take even the most misanthropic horror, the silliest and most glaringly fake special effects, and make it compelling, interesting, and somehow cool to watch. It's a very subtle thing which I can't put my finger on. Jaws 3 doesn't come close. As ridiculous as the movie is, it tries to be relentlessly dark, and there are hints of a kind of nastiness or something which doesn't scare me, or even horrify me, but just make me feel very uncomfortable instead, like I need to take a shower afterwards. Perhaps it tries to be too literal when it begs to be stylized. Perhaps it's too dead serious when it's obviously claptrap. There some kind of jarring collision going on, something isn't working right. Basically the thing is the visual equivalent of indigestion.\n\nI will admit that certain things like sound effects work almost too well--the crunching as another vapid Floridian becomes fish food, the muffled underwater groans and shouts. But it's not horrifying in a good, entertaining way, you know? There is one very inventive shot, I also have to admit--the one prick cameraman diver gets eaten, and you watch the poor bastard getting chewed from INSIDE the shark's gullet.\n\nI think I may have an answer. It seems like unlike many horror movies, which simply like to show off gore effects and photogenic ways to kill people, Jaws 3 seems to revel specifically in helpless suffering, prolonging people's pain while they die. Even that poor fish at the beginning doesn't just get eaten...the severed head floats there half-alive for half a minute, uselessly working its mouth, just to drive the point home. It's a distinctly sadistic movie. Perhaps we need to coin a new movie genre for films like this: loathing movies. As such Jaws 3 would probably rank up there with The Passion Of The Christ or something as one of the all-time greats. It's a crappie (pun intended), extremely unpleasant movie to watch overall, but it does achieve its dubious goal unnervingly well. I will give it that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yep, another guilty pleasure movie. This one is sooooo awful it's amazing. Just everything about it is so lame. The effects are terrible - they might have been better in 3D, but on a TV screen the plasticky-ness of it is all too apparent. The acting is well below par for the big names on show here, with some horrible dialogue thrown in just to make things worse.\n\nIn fact, only the basic premise of the movie has any promise - a killer shark attacking an underwater theme/amusement park. But the idea, though good, is drowned (pun intended) by the terrible crapness of the other elements of the film.\n\nThat said, the movie entertained me, but not in any traditional horror sense. Rather I found myself laughing so much at the lame effects, bad dialogue and the terrible liberties taken with physics and shark facts that the movie was a fantastic journey of delightful nonsense. Not so much the Hunting of the Snark, but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.\n\nThere is, in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get, but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course, how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK, but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off, it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.\n\nOf course, the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater, not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible! It won't transmit the shock wave at all! No sir!\n\nIf you fancy a terrifying journey into horror beneath the waves you'd be better off watching The Adventures of Captain Nemo (well, Burgess Meredith as Prof. Cunningham scared me, anyhow). But, if you fancy an awful, awful movie to laugh at with your mates and a crate of beer, this one is top notch stuff."

Little do they know a certain 35 foot great white is tracking down its baby that was recently captured and planned to be used in the referenced exhibit. This movie is directed by Joe Alves (his only directorial project) and stars Dennis Quaid (Innerspace), Bess Armstrong (High Road to China), Louis Gossett Jr. (An Officer and a Gentleman) and John Putch (BachelorMan). The storyline for this, while bad, was actually kind of fun to watch unfold. The water skiing pyramids in this will always be legendary. I really enjoyed watching Quaid and Gossett Jr. In this. The underwater vessel is pretty cool and the infusion of dolphins in the storyline I always liked as a kid. Unfortunately of all the movies in this series this probably has the worst actual shark. The special effects are just awful. This is an absolute must see but just an average addition to the series and genre overall. I'd score it a 4.5/10."

But I must warn you, IF THE QUALITY OF SPECIAL EFFECTS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, you will HATE this film. One of the big things I judge a film on is its showmanship. Jaws 3 would not have failed this. The acting was good, the storyline was good, even the exhibition was good.\n\nWhat absolutely KILLED this film was the special effects. The CG was very unrealistic, and you could clearly tell where it was inserted. The shark... well, I'd imagine that \"Bruce\" (the original shark for \"Jaws\") is turning in his prop room grave, or wherever they decided to put him. The shark they built for this one didn't look much like a shark, and in several scenes, the shark was obviously the puppet. In the first \"Jaws\" film, it was harder to tell.\n\nSorry fan boys and girls. Like I said, the concept of the movie was a good one. The exhibition, however, failed to live up to the \"Jaws\" name."

Carl Gottlieb who wrote the previous Jaws movies came back, to write the screenplay but helped with the writer Richard Matheson. In the making of the movie the filmmakers decided to release the third Jaws in 3D, as there were other horror movies like Friday the 13th Part III which also used the 3D technique. It is a good way to see a movie with a technique, which would make the story immersive to feel being inside of it. After an exhausting work on the production, in 1983 came out Jaws 3-D with Dennis Quaid. The movie's plot: the sons of chief police Martin Brody, Mike and Sean who are grown up now. They work at the theme park SeaWorld, where a great white shark gets trapped inside of it. But then the main characters would realize, the mother of the great white shark is inside of the theme park as well. Jaws 3-D could be an interesting movie as there have been some changes, without using any actors or actresses of the previous Jaws movies. Instead the movie completely failed to surprise the audience and the critics, as it just bored to be a totally uninteresting story. Especially for the use of the cliches in the course of the movie, which can easily distract the audience to not let them focus on the story. The effects of 3D in the movie makes hilarious and annoying as most of the scenes, were focused on the stuffs which would be thrown to the audience's eyes in an inappropriate way. The actors tried to act as good as possible their performances, but it wouldn't change anything to have a second thought about the movie. Jaws 3-D is one of the worst movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone seems to hate this movie, but it's usually just a few things giving off a crappy effect. Example: Dennis Quaid is decent, and for the most part the other actors aren't too horrible, the plot is great (shark in sea world!!), and the set prices are creepy enough.\n\nBut... The 3D is just ridiculously horrid in a few parts. I know some of them really just need the 3D treatment, but a few cuts were just unforgivable.\n\nAnd... 2/3ds of the camera-work look like TV movie/digital camera type Quality, which doesn't look at all as good as the great film quality of one and two. In both versions I've seen everything is blurry for a film in theaters (I've heard that last part is due to universal never releasing a correctly made non-3D version of the film)\n\nSo those two combined really seem to screw up this film a little bit. Too bad, because this fun-but-not-great movie could have been much better. Jaws 3D might just get better rating if it was revised in HD with some of the 3D cuts removed (Or a 3D version- Yes!). Jaws 3D is also quite different in both tone and style from the other films. Both Jaws 1 and 2 seem to focus on being trapped on the open sea, Jaws 3D is more claustrophobic-based. And the style is also very different from 2 and 1, One is very thriller styled, whereas two is more showy. Surprisingly this film is not as showy as Jaws 2. It's style is just strait horror. And Jaws: TR- It's tone and style are pretty much \"Watching jaws 2 while you're high\" In all I thought it was an okay film, but a mixed bag. (By the way I would give this a 6-7 if I could see the true 3D version of the film."

Jaws 3D comes from a time when native 3D was the only option and even though it's not the best Jaws sequel that was ever made, it is one of the best 3D films from its decade.\n\nJaws 3 in 3D ; it's a whole lot fun and makes excellent use of pop-out effects the format has ever seen."

The review scores range, in order, range from 8, 5.8, 3.7, and 3 for J1 to Revenge. If ever there was a proof that sequels are the kiss of death, this franchise is it, and I use the word \"franchise\" loosely. In some ways, Revenge is actually better than 3. At least in Revenge, the shark had the good taste to upchuck Mario Van Peebles for his totally fake sounding Jamaican accent.\n\nFirst, J3 is one large product placement for Sea World. The acting is terrible. Rather than making Mike Brody into likeable quality, Dennis Quaid turns him into an \"anti-character\" that seem to telegraph the message \"I know this movie is a loser; what was I thinking? Oh yeah,...paycheck.\" Lou Gossett has done a better job in far better movies. Lea Thompson's cuteness couldn't save it. The rest are forgettable.\n\nJaws 3 is predictable and boring, and any cinematic qualities are overshadowed by how awful the movie is. The original Jaws movie had the benefit of being the first, but any novelty was wearing thin in the second installment. By 3 and 4, it was old hat. If they would come out with \"Jaws, the Musical,\" it couldn't get much worse."

The new man-made lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the \"Undersea Kingdom\" is shortly to open, but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing; owner Calvin Bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. So on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found, but Kathryn realises that it wasn't their great white which killed the man. It was it's mother who is approximately 35-foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon.\n\nWow, what crap! Yeah it's bad, but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop; at least it's watchable trite. For me this is one big guilty pleasure and it's actually my favourite 'Jaws' sequel\u0085 oh my! I think it was the last one I saw in the series (and Jaws the Revenge being the first\u0085 ugh!) Well, the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke (thankyou \"Jaws The Revenge\"). But I thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. Actually, the concept for the film isn't too bad, but it's just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. Well really, the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb, though it made it even more amusing in it's ineptness. That's because originally the film was released in 3D, but since the images are in 2D is looks quite bad and flat. Who knows the gimmick might have blown me away\u0085 eh, probably not, but I still think that I would get a good laugh out of it. Well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy\u0085 yeah comedy, because there isn't too much in the way of thrills. It was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat, but more so it's plain cringe-worthy and simply implausible.\n\nThe useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board, but I give them points for a change of scenery. The film's setting is perfect and it's a real change of pace. I don't know if you can actually call it Jaws' show, since it basically took every opportunity to promote Florida's Sea World, even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. But it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it, which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. The hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. But I didn't find it too much of a problem.\n\nBut good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly\u0085 horrid! Seeing a shark close up would be petrifying, but here that's not the case because this rubber, robotic clap-trap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. We just see too much of it and I never knew sharks growl. Oh well, if you can't scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. It also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. The time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. But for some people I can see why think its dull and that's because of the lack of horrific terror. The slow-motion sequences were horrifying, though! The music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. The acting seems to be torn to shreds by people, but I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr. and Simon MacCorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters.\n\nAn entertaining B-flick that's not that particularly exciting, but it tried to be different and I still I don't think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. I don't know if it would make the film any better being in 3D, but the novelty of it would have been interesting."

There are so many issues with this one and I want to point out some of the highlights or low-lights depending on how you look at it.\n\n1. Obviously anybody watching this movie is watching it for the shark but, they could have at least attempted to give some attention to the characters and stories. The only time this movie has your interest at all is when the shark is present. It felt like all the actors/actresses were just going through the motions but, you can't blame them when you consider what they're working with.\n\n2. Why was so much of the movie almost pitch black? I realize that it wouldn't be realistic for it to bright underwater, especially at night but, enough light to actually see what is happening would've been nice. There are many scenes where you might as well close your eyes since you can't make anything out. That includes most of the final 10 or 15 minutes and a scene early on that is not even in the water.\n\n3. As I stated earlier, you are watching because of the shark but, you don't really see much of it and it's too dark to actually see it most of the time it is on screen.\n\n4. This is not so much a complaint as an observation. Watch for a special effect shot at the end that is so bad, it's hard to believe it made it into the movie even if it was a 3-D shot. It's the next to last 3-D shot if I remember correctly."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening credits read \"suggested by the novel, Jaws, by Peter Benchley\". Exactly what part of his novel inspired this low rent monster flick?\n\nAnyway, despite being written by the original screenwriters of the first two films, Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, this has nothing to do with Jaws I or II. It is largely a mediocre throwback to 1950s monster movies, even released originally in 3D, which only makes it seem even more like a 1950s B-movie. One gets the feeling, however, that even in cinemas, in 3D, the effects were largely unnoticeable; I forgot that it was originally filmed in 3D, except for when Jaws' jaws come flying at the screen during the climax, and two or three times dolphins are shown jumping out of the water toward the camera, in an incredibly cheesy, 1970s greeting card type of montage.\n\nShark and mommy shark on the loose at Sea World(!) and a cast of soon- to-be-famous people have to do battle with them, blandly and boringly. Lea Thompson is cute in this, her first film role, but apparently the filmmakers didn't think much of her, because after receiving a bad cut on her leg at the climax, her character is never mentioned again. Simon MacCorkindale was clearly unfamiliar with his lines of dialogue, as he obviously stutters and stammers his way through them several times.\n\nThe plot is only mediocre, in a campy, so-bad-it's-good way; the same can be said about the effects. The climax is a low rent rip off of the first film's ending: instead of large yellow barrels, and a canister of compressed air exploding to kill the shark, this time we get tiny yellow grenades to explode and kill the shark, and wake up the dozing audience members.\n\nTruthfully though, this isn't quite as awful as its reputation has it. I probably prefer this film to Jaws II, slightly. It's lame, but at least they didn't just try to copy the first film as closely as possible, like they did with part 2. And again, it is slightly amusing, in a 1950s monster movie/ so-bad-it's good type of way. But unless you're into that sort of thing, you'll quickly be bored to tears."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the second sequel to Jaws, Sea World's new multi-million dollar underwater attraction is terrorized by a 35 foot great white shark, putting both staff and the public in danger. It's up to Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) to uphold the family's legacy as shark fighters and save the day.\n\nI was \"fortunate\" enough to see Jaws 3-D in the theater back when it was originally released in 1983. I didn't care for it back then and, if anything, I found it even worse as I re-watched it last night. There are so many problems I have with the film I really don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the 3D. As best as I can remember, the 3D effects weren't overly impressive back in the day. But watching in 2D, they're even more annoying. The floating arm near the beginning of the film, for example, looks just plain old stupid. The rest of the effects are equally bad. The shark is laughable. The shark from the original Jaws, made years earlier, is so much better.\n\nAs bad as the effects are, the rest of the film is even worse. The film's logic is pretty much non-existent, the characters are pretty much unlikable, and the script is pretty much a dull mess. There's not much here to like. Watching last night, I'm shocked that Sea World actually let the makers of Jaws 3 not only use their facilities for filming, but allowed them to use the Sea World name. Sea World must have believed in the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity. The film makes the staff and ownership of Sea World look like a bunch of bumbling idiots who can't be bothered to give two shakes about customer safety.\n\nSpeaking of \"can't be bothered\", I can't be bothered to go into any more detail on Jaws 3-D. I'll end this by saying that, for me, this is the worst of the Jaws series. I know most people rate Part 4 the worst. While I agree that it's one stinker of a film, at least Part 4 is entertaining. Jaws 3-D is just bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is absolutely nothing that this movie has anything to redeem itself, and that is just really sad. So after we got the first two \"Jaws\" movies, we got to have another one as this franchise keeps milking itself and this time it has gone to a third dimension. Yes, this movie was entirely shot in 3D during the 80s, and I hate to tell you this, I have never saw this movie as it was originally shot. I only saw this in 2D only, and I don't think that Universal Studios wouldn't bother to reissue this movie on Blu Ray with the 3D version. Also, I don't know how good the 3D version is, and I really don't know if it makes the movie a little better. So, what do I know about? So speaking of 3D, the movie is about another great white shark attacking more people, but this time it is attacking at a theme park known as Sea World (I'll admit that I actually like having a shark attacking at Sea World, but that is not saying much). Also, we have Martin Brody's son working at Sea World as he tries to protect the tourist from getting attack by a shark. So, that is what the plot of the third movie is, and I think its really lame. The characters aren't really that interesting, and nothing much to their personalities. However, I do like some of the actors in this movie like Dennis Quad, Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson but their performances don't save the movie. I really don't care much of the rest of the cast, and really don't have much comment of their acting. Heck, really don't care for the music at all. Joe Alves, who was the production designer of the first two \"Jaws\" movies was chosen to direct this movie, and I really don't think he is really that capable on making a good \"Jaws\" movie. Again, about the 3D, I don't know if that version is better than 2D, but I do say that the 3D effects are very cheesy looking. The shark itself looks fine as it was all done practical, but the real life footage is hardly used in this movie because of the use of 3D. Even that one part, where the shark comes to break the glass slowly which I find it laughable. The movie does have some laughable moments like some tourist push a girl to the glass, where there is a dead man outside underwater. Also, the British guy's buddy yelling so loud by how much he has been overreacting. One scene in the movie, where you have two thugs that are trying to steal coral, which I think it should have been cut out because its adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Very pointless, if you think about it. I don't have much comment about the pacing, but it is 99 minutes and really can't comment if this movie bores me or not. So I'll let you be the judge of that on your own views of the movie, but if you enjoy it for its silliness that is fine. To me, there is nothing much to recommend that this movie is so bad its good, so I say that its just bad. \"Jaws 3-D\" is lame and silly, and I personally give it a 2 out of 10."

Needless to say the 3D gimmick back then was even more of a hacky trick than it is today. At least in today's 2D versions, I can't tell where the 3D effects would be, unlike the corny scenes in Jaws 3 that are obviously filmed for 3D effect. I may have liked this film much better if this wasn't the case since it had loads of potential. Dennis Quaid as Michael Brody was tremendous and stood out in the film as a great lead actor. Bess Armstrong was pretty good too, otherwise the remaining supporting cast was bland.\n\nThe plot was fair but the whole branding of SeaWorld kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Considering SeaWorld is a corporation that at the time in the 1980's had a very likely chance of treating animals poorly. Just like in Part 2 with the sailing scenes, there was a lot of fluff scenes that was basically performances by the SeaWorld staff. A lot of the plot premises were too unbelievable and some of the decision making by the characters didn't make a whole lot of sense. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie, not because of the storyline but from the 3D filmmaking and terribly fake looking death scenes. If the film didn't have the 3D effect and let Dennis Quaid guide the movie through I'm sure it would have been as good as Jaws 2."

I haven't seen Jaws 4 yet, but it didn't look to bad. But Jaws 3, ... I'll probably never watch it (willingly) again. The basic problem: too much people, and not enough shark. (however big it was, not the point) Also, the special FX made the original Donkey Kong game look good. If you really want to, then fine, but this is one of a very VERY few movies that I absolutely hate.\n\nBut that's just me..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched this movie last night.\n\nI must say, the first hour of it is somewhat compelling. But the fact of the matter remains, I have been a big fan of sharks since I was about three years old, and what this film does is retain the shark physics very well. Shark behavior, on the other hand, is completely reversed (great whites only tend to go in for \"hit-and-run attacks\") but that's really not the point of this film.\n\nWhat this movie is made for is purely entertainment. While the first Jaws had a tremendous amount of psychological tension, this film provides only death, death, death. More people are killed in this film than any other Jaws film. Not to mention that they made the shark the largest it could possibly be (35 ft). The 35 foot great white is as rare as fist-sized diamonds, but we see one in this film--thank God, though, for the size of the shark does save the film ever so slightly.\n\nThe first hour of the film consists of tension regarding a smaller, ten foot long baby shark that is kept in captivity, being the only great white in such a state. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong provide the leading roles here, and they are both incredibly good actors that have been given an incredibly mundane script. However, as a shark fan, I recommend this film for its scientific accuracy in the first half.\n\nOnce the information is relayed to Louis Gosset Jr.'s character, Calvin, the story begins to turn sour. At first, the shark appears among a group of black-tips and sand tigers (less dangerous and smaller aquarium-type sharks) outside of SeaWorld's more expensive dining area, and it really scares the living hell out of the tourists (imagine a 35-foot black-eyed monster suddenly appearing around sharks no larger than perhaps six feet right in front of you).\n\nFrom there on, the whole movie turns to trash. It's like Godzilla underwater. The shark looks claymated (seriously) and it's vile and malicious. Sharks really aren't that smart. I don't believe any shark would ever smash its way into an undersea control room, but this one does. Also, I recall reading that sharks need to keep moving through the sea to survive (other than the sleeper shark), but this one has no trouble camping out for ten minutes to claim several victims. Also, I realize that this shark needs quite a bit of food to sustain itself (hello, 35 friggin' FEET!!!) but the fact is, it eats a few people, and yet the first of the people it eats in the second half of the film is not even swallowed, even after another victim is (see the film, you will understand what I mean by this).\n\nThe best part of this film is the part in which a diver is trapped inside the mouth of the beast. For about three minutes we watch as this diver is chewed up (and really empathetically feel his tension). The camera angles for this time frame all appear inside the monster's mouth and the whole experience is coupled with a sense of intense claustrophobia that cannot be replicated in any other film.\n\nThis movie was overall a hunk of garbage, but to fans of sharks like myself, a few shots of vodka can make Jaws III very interesting, but further than that, I would call it utter crap."

It has something to do with sharks though what exactly it is about them is never explained. The weak story continues in this fashion.

For some reason they a couple teens show up who are there to steal choral well you pretty much predict what happens to those guys. Nothing happens until the end of movie but the apparent exciting ending isn't that exciting at all. The underwater special effects in this movie were bad and look so dated. Jaws concept can only work the first time around after that it's awful. Good cast but poor acting during the Jaws sequences. Dennis Quid must be trying hard to forget this movie.

The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film, and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.), vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers), and terribly edited action. So, for B-movie fans, I give this a 3 out of 5."

One day, the staff catches a shark and things begin to take a turn for the worse. The boss actually decides to just show this great white to everyone in some kind of pool surrounded with an ankle-high wall. I see nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that the shark still doesn't manage to kill anyone. A problem he suffers from the entire movie actually, you'd think giant sharks can outswim people but apparently not. This shark is pretty goddamn lazy. A bunch of people fall into the water right in front of him, they all make it. Unbelievable.\n\nOkay, I can't really be fair about this movie because I never watched the movie in 3D. But then again, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Of course, seeing parts of sharks flying in your face is amusing but it gets old really fast.

I watch them because they're supposed to be edgy thrillers about anti-social sharks with a taste for pale, thrashing, snacks.\n\nI do have to say that something about this one MIGHT have worked better for another shark film or one about some other undersea psychopathic mammal. As a Jaws flick, though, lets just say this is an excellent example of a film franchise which should have quit while it was ahead. This one just sucks. Although it does get better with beer."

Unfortunately, this completely works against it as the effects are awful.\n\nAnd without decent shark effects, the movie has taken a massive nose-dive already.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the early 1980's. Horror cinema is beginning to see a new light, in particular, the slasher film movement, where iconic franchises such as Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween are being born. According to the documentary Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, every studio, big or small, was pressing their luck on the silver screen when it came to slasher films. They were a huge attraction for young teens who needed a good scare on a Friday night. Consequently, many random slasher films came out (IE: April Fools Day Happy Birthday to Me) and many sequels to other horror films came out.\n\nThis is where Jaws 3 comes in. I only make note about slashers because Jaws 3, in particular, reminds me more of a slasher film than anything else. For one, its pacing is reminiscent of one of the early Friday the 13th films in terms of being very slow (only this time, it doesn't amount to anything remotely frightening), and, to compare it to Friday the 13t: Part 3 - the infamous 3D chapter of the series - it's one gigantic gimmick to showcase its 3D effects. So what happens when you take away that gimmick, like when Jaws 3 was down-converted in the process of its home video release? At the time, VHS and Betamax, the two formats during the film's release, couldn't manage 3D capability, so as a result, the medium that made Jaws 3 different from many horror films was suddenly taken away and what was left was nothing but a bland, interchangeable affair, with poor special effects, little pacing, and the power to be forgotten hours after being viewed.\n\nThe story, for the first time, takes place away from Amity Island and is now at SeaWorld, where underwater tunnels are being constructed for a new exhibit. Employees, including marine biologist Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid), discover that a baby shark has slipped through one of the underwater tunnels and may be responsible for several disappearances in the park. Upon being captured, more still disappear, and it becomes clear the real killer was the mother great white shark and not her offspring. This sends the SeaWorld staff into a panicking frenzy, unsure of what exactly to do about their shark problem.\n\nThe one common criticism I have for all of the Jaws sequels is their slowness in progression. In the first film, the shark didn't appear until roughly the hour mark, giving us time to acquaint ourselves with the staff of the beach, the area of Amity Island, and be smitten with Spielberg's clear direction and Verna Fields' priceless editing. In the sequels, the time between the opening credits and the first time we saw the shark is nothing but bloated filler; the film giving us an illusion that it has characters to care about, places to go, suspense to have us experience, and tension in its scenes. They have nothing. Even when they look like they do, they still flounder under the emptiness of their own screenplays. The times the shark wasn't on screen, I wanted to see one. The times they came on screen, I simply wanted the film to end.\n\nJaws 3's most fascinating feature, however, is not its inclusion of 3D, or its release history. It's that the man credited for the story is a man by the name of \"Guerdon Trueblood.\"\n\nStarring: Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. Directed by: Joe Alves."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: Suffers from horrible 3-D effects, this lame-brained sequel was actually quite amusing.\n\n(This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)\n\nJAWS goes from classic to just plain camp. JAWS 3-D is actually entertaining for more than just its campiness, but that's just generally why its mildly entertaining. Although this dreary series slowly hitting the dump, this one is actually quite a guilty pleasure.\n\nI've heard some pretty bad reviews about this sequel. That's simply too bad, I quite enjoyed this one, depending on how you view it. It has a real twist from the first two. This shark doesn't terrorize Amity like the first two. This one takes place in Sea World (not the one in Florida which we know and love). The shark is bigger than the usual and is wrecking havoc on a grand opening ceremony when her infant, who was captured and kept in the park, died recently. Now throw in some ridiculous scare tactics and it's an amusing film, granted not a great one, but certainly deserves even a little bit of merit.\n\nBy the looks of it, it hardly bears resemblance to its predecessors, except that it features Mike Brody, played by Dennis Quaid. The film co-stars Louis Gossett Jr. giving an over-the-top performance, but as far as I can see he is the only good performer. The special-effects are terrible (not good then, just plain laughable now) but there are some really good moments and the ending with the shark is superb (even if the effects are amateurish even for 80's standards).\n\nNot as bad as they say, if only for its camp value. Watch out for that fake shark crashing through the glass!\n\nRating: ** out of 5."

I have no idea what grabbed me about the film initially. It's a total disaster.\n\nThe filmmakers tried something new with the story, so one star for trying something new. It's just that the execution is laughable. There's no suspense here at all. Every character is uninteresting and badly written. Since it was filmed with 3-D effects in mind the results on DVD look horrible, Mars Needs Women is on par with this one. The film drags incredibly, the story just isn't there, virtually nothing happens for the first 70 minutes or so. Ahh, this movie just completely stinks.\n\nThe other star I give for it's stars. Though this a definite low point for everyone concerned they do their jobs well. Dennis Quaid is always likable and I've always liked Simon MacCorkindale somewhat, got used to seeing him in Falcon Crest, I recall. Or was it Dallas?, hell, I don't know. And finally Louis Gossett Jr. plays his ridiculous role well, only one year after picking up the Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. This would be like Russell Crowe going from A Beautiful Mind to Dude, Where's My Car."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jaws 3 moves away from Amity Island and goes to Sea World where Michael Brody, the son of the now deceased Martin Brody, is now a marine biologist. Sea world has just opened up an underwater walk through so people can view marine life, and the new attraction is a baby Great White Shark. Unfortunately, the shark's mommy comes looking for it and wreaks all kinds of havoc in the process. Now it's up to Michael to stop the shark. With astoundingly bad special effects and acting, Jaws 3 makes the second film look like Ben Hur.\n\nEven what remains of John Williams' score couldn't make this movie the least bit chilling. The makers of this film decided to switch it up from the first one and show the shark any chance they get. Unfortunately, the special effects are so bad in this movie that the shark looks like a cartoon among reality. The tail doesn't even move as it swims through the water. They even make the shark roar like a lion, even though that's impossible. The plot of this movie is too simple. Mommy shark looks for baby shark. Kills people. Michael Brody must stop it. Anything beyond that is useless filler. The second film was understandable because it took place in the same area where it would be more likely to see another shark. Now we're at Sea World where Michael Brody works, and another killer shark shows up! Michael's gotta think there's a curse on him. When he was 12, the first shark swam right by him after killing somebody. When he was 16, he was attacked on a sailboat by another shark. Now he's grown up working at Sea World and another one attacks him! That's a 1 in a billion chance, but whatever.\n\nDennis Quaid plays the role of Michael Brody to the best of his ability at the time, but it's not that good. Louis Gosset Jr. is okay, but he was always kind of a B actor. All of the other actors in this movie aren't worthy of being called actors.\n\nOverall, Jaws 3 completely ruins the impact the first film had, and is a waste of everyone's time.\n\n3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "3D films have something of a dubious reputation for being bereft of creative energy or merit. How long they have had this reputation for, I do not know. If they did not have such a reputation before 1983, they certainly earned it then. After Friday The 13th Part 3, all the 3D film needed was another crapfest to give it a reputation as being a cover for a bad story or script. They got it in the form of Jaws 3-D, which not only ranks as one of the worst films I have seen to date, it also ranks as one of the worst 3D films I can remember. And I include 3D shorts from theme parks in that list.\n\nAs with all films that have 3D photography, the big make-or-break point is the 3D effects. Where Friday The 13th Part 3 did at least a reasonable job with this effect, Jaws 3-D is a spectacular crapfest with its effects, too. Given that both films were shot using the same process, ArriVision 3D, the blame for this lies solely with the director. Underwater shots are hideous in appearance, with enough grain and diminished focus to leave the audience wondering what in the blazes is going on. A lack of detail in dark spots of the picture is often characteristic of films that were shot in the early 1980s and previous, but many of the underwater shots show no effort at all to alleviate this problem. Those who have seen Blade Runner will know this is not impossible. In fact, a few stage lights in the right places could have worked miracles during the underwater/nighttime shots.\n\nThe acting is thoroughly wooden, but I cannot help blaming the director for this, too. Given that the cast includes such B-list dependables as Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., one would at least expect to be able to coax a halfway decent performance out of them. Especially considering that the things they are reacting to existed right on the set with them. Sadly, Quaid looks like he is ready to ask if he is meant to be scared yet, and Gossett Jr. looks like he's ingested too many painkillers. Mind you, these are the best performances that the film has to offer. You will be hard pressed to name two other actors from the film or the characters they portrayed.\n\nTo the film's credit, there are no ridiculous scenes where the shark roars or explodes for no readily apparent reason. While the photography does much to make the equivalent scenes in Jaws 3-D nonsensical, they do make sense if you pay attention. Unfortunately, the ridiculous 3D effects will also leave you chuckling. The moment when the shark explodes, and its teeth come flying at the screen, is a priceless moment of unintentional comedy.\n\nThis is where it all comes crashing down, unfortunately. The original Jaws was made on a very tight budget, and its director realised that he could not rely on effects to carry the day. He therefore decided to focus upon the human element, and filled his cast with the best cheap talent he could get his hands upon. Whether it was his direction or their ability, the performances manage to keep the viewer focused upon something other than the cheapness of the effects. Although you might forget the name of the characters, you won't forget the men who played them in a real hurry. Which is exactly the problem here. As in Alien 3, the characters are unmemorable because they don't have anything remotely approaching a second dimension.\n\nI gave Jaws 3-D a one out of ten. As a serious horror or drama, it sucks dead bunnies through a straw. As a comedy, it works better than the Marx Brothers at times. Jaws: The Revenge was so bad it was incredible. Jaws 3-D was so bad that it is legendary."

If you can get the 3-D version its even better but the plan ol' part 3 will do the trick. if you like sharks this is the movie for you. Jaws 3 delivers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jaws 3 is directed by Joe Alves and features a screenplay written by Carl Gottlieb & Richard Matheson from a story by Guerdon Trueblood. It stars Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch & Leah Thompson. The second sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, this was originally released in the 3D format that had a brief rebirth in the early to mid 1980s. Plot centres around a WaterTheme Park coming under attack from a great white shark.\n\nIt was originally mooted to have been a spoof movie, along the lines of Airplane et al, now that could have worked you feel, what we actually get is an unintentional spoof movie that was made in appallingly bad 3D. Yet the 3D gimmick was enough to get the punters into the cinema and keep those tills kerchinging to the point where Universal Pictures were rather happy. Happy enough to green light another sequel, the god awful Jaws: The Revenge in 1987. As I was one of those punters who shelled out for the 3D Jaws experience back in the day, I feel partly responsible for part 4 assaulting the eyes of everyone who has ever seen it.\n\nWatching it now over 25 years later in 2D, the film is actually worse than I originally remember it being. Of course now in this internet age we can find out about the numerous script tamperings that went on with it, and subsequently look at the non directing career of Alves post this fishy garbage and fully understand why. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how Messrs Quaid, Gossett Jr & Thompson survived to have careers afterwards? But the reality is it's not their fault, Quaid is badly underwritten and a bit too fresh faced to carry the male lead role this early in his career, Gossett Jr actually does OK in the role of SeaWorld park manager Calvin Bouchard, showing the only moments of acting gravitas as he tries to keep things under control. While Thompson is a third arc character called on to look pretty and say a couple of lines whilst trying to keep a straight face.\n\nEven if we shy away from the poor effects work, that were, yes, poor effects even in 1983, Jaws 3 has an amateurishness about it that is laughably bad. The shark sequences look like they were filmed in a bath tub with some kiddies drawing used to scale, while the dialogue, too, seems to have been lifted from a 4 year old's memoirs. Then there is the performances from the likes of Armstrong and MacCorkindale, the former is bland beyond compare, the latter is, if you pardon the pun, wetter than a fish's blanket. There's some decent choreography on show for some water skiing sequences, but even these are countered by the ineffective use of the shark. Don't believe anyone who tells you that this is still fun in a popcorn no brain kind of way, it isn't. It's as bad as its reputation says it is and it's only saving graces are Gossett Jr and that it isn't as bad as part 4. 2/10"

It is so slow that one wonders why and how it is that the characters are eaten. And the scene inside the shark when the diver gets eaten: it's almost so funny that the scene is poorly designed. The acting rings false. And the finale, when the shark comes to smash the window, in 3D, it must not be too great as the desired effect. Same thing for the explosion to kill the shark."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just when you think it was safe for Jaws to not be milked by a greedy studio, we are given Jaws 3-D! Yet another cash grab that is completely devoid of anything that made the original an all time great. The whole movie is just style over substance. The film boast the keywords \"Jaws\" and \"3-D\" to attract viewers rather than depend on its own merit, which it entirely lacks of course.\n\nI will admit they made the right move by picking a new location for the shark. SeaWorld is something entirely different from Amity island. However they don't take advantage of this location at all. There is no build up, suspense or tension in this film. It still feels like a generic monster movie like Jaws 2. It doesn't help that the leads are just wooden blocks. At least the second debacle had Roy Schneider to make it watchable. The leads here are just dry in comparison.\n\nThis films is literal cinematic junk food, while Speilberg's summer blockbuster was a cinematic masterpiece. The effects are so laughable. Especially the scene where the shark breaks through the glass window underwater and everyone screams \"Shaaark\" in slow-motion. The whole sequence is just abysmal.\n\nIt is truly sad what jaws is coming to. It grows cheaper and worse each movie. Still, part 4 makes this movie look like the original Jaws."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 1983, \"Jaws 3\" (aka \"Jaws 3-D\") chronicles events at SeaWorld, Florida, several years after Chief Brody electrocuted the great white shark in 1978's \"Jaws 2.\" The chief's son, Sean (John Putch), visits his brother, Mike (Dennis Quaid), and Mike's marine biologist girlfriend Kay (Bess Armstrong), at SeaWorld and develops a relationship with a park entertainer named Kelly (Lea Thompson). After a small great white is abused at the park the shark's 35-foot mama ain't too happy about it. Louis Gossett Jr. plays the park manager while Simon MacCorkindale plays a publicity-obsessed oceanographer/filmmaker.\n\nI'm glad they changed the location from the fictitious Amity Island (shot on the island of Martha's Vineyard) to an entirely different locale because the whole Amity Island scenario had run its course. SeaWorld in Florida makes for a great location and all-around change. The whole first act is good but the movie starts to falter in the second act and barely makes up for it in the third. Moreover, some of the effects are questionable, not to mention the dubious depiction of a guy inside the shark's mouth. Still, this is a decent sequel in the series with a refreshing cast. It's not nearly as bad as some say.\n\nLea Thompson is young & fetching, even though I was never that enthralled by her, physically speaking, but she has that typical charismatic sparkle in her eyes. Bess Armstrong doesn't do much for me, but she's certainly serviceable and there are a few worthy peripheral cuties.\n\nThe movie runs 99 minutes and was shot at SeaWorld & (the location that is now) Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida.\n\nGRADE: Borderline C+/B- (5.5 out of 10 Stars)"

The acting not so great either. The 3-D effects fall flat. But c'mon- it's harmless rainy afternoon kind of fun.\n\nDennis Quaid is hot in this film. As is John Putch. WOOF! Bess Armstrong is beyond annoying. Then again she always is. This film introduced me to Lea Thompson (one of my favorite actresses ever!!). Loved her ever since and have seen 99% of anything she has been in. \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" is another classic. Damn she was so fragile and beautiful in that film. You just want to protect her character from the crap around her.\n\nJaws 3 has a female ski team, the co-ed ski team- all being attacked by the shark. Though very little chomping takes place. *SIGH* That was disappointing. They should have included a high body count in this one. Including a chomp on Louis Gossett Jr.'s character. Hated him. I love the original movie poster. Which I got from ebay. The covers for the DVD releases of 2 - 4 suck.\n\nEven though the real fun doesn't start until the moment that \"some shark's mutha!!\" starts attacking Sea World \"above and below the surface of the water\"- I will love this film forever!!"

They could have at least drafted a few true SOUTHerners with real SOUTHern accents for those tiny parts. In addition, Louis Gossett Jr. was not a good choice for this movie. I have never seen him in anything where he was a good choice due to his horrible acting skills.\n\nI would also have preferred to leave the 3-D gimmick out of the movie since it only adds to the already low-quality cinematography. It definitely does not add anything worthwhile to the movie and is very cheesy at best.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend watching this movie if you liked Jaws and Jaws 2, to keep up with the Jaws family.

How they can actually call this movie 'Jaws', not 'The Haunted Surfboard', I don't know. Poor, poor, Spielberg.\n\nI didn't believe one bit that there was a shark in the waters, even though I did in Jaws 1 and 2. Firstly, the special effects were so out of date. In the dolphin scene, where they first saw the shark, when you see the Great White for the first time, I found that they just stole the footage from an old National Geographic Documentary.\n\nSecondly, this movie was full of sexual references. For example, Sean Brody says to his older brother Michael Brody, \"I was so close to doing it in the water last night.\" after doing something inappropriate at the beach the previous night. Finally, the amount of shark facts they got wrong was just tremendous. I completely lost count.\n\nOverall, if you want to watch all of the 'Jaws' movies, I advise you skip this to 'Jaws: The Revenge' for nothing important happens in this movie. So, under no circumstances (except for a good laugh) watch this movie EVER. Or else you'll find yourself being sick."

At this writing, it ranks number 49, but is probably worst than that. Believe me, even the 3D effects such as they were didn't help this turkey and it's amazing that the career of any of the actors involved survived it. Well, some of their careers didn't, as Bess Armstrong and Simon MacCorkindale went on to do bad television series and/or miniseries.\n\nThough you may never have a chance to experience the film in 3D take my word for it when I tell you that you didn't miss anything. The 3D effects were minimal, for example, in most scenes the shark was too big for the 3d effect to work, and other than some splashing water, and one floating fish head, there wasn't any sense in even bothering with filming it in 3D. On top of this, never has the audio in a film been as bad as this one. There are times when you have to strain to hear any of the dialogue. Then again, you probably wouldn't want to hear it so you're better off.\n\nI suppose I could talk about the acting, but there isn't any. The worst offender here is Louis Gossett Jr. who should have known better. He spends most of the film shouting mumbled dialogue which is totally unintelligible, as if he were in a hurry to get his part over with so he could leave the studio lot as quickly as possible without being seen. He must have had some foresight into the big stinkeroo this legendary dead fish tale would become.\n\nThe film must have made some money though. That's why we were next subjected to Jaws IV, which goes onto prove that Carp is Carp, no matter what number you put behind it.\n\nAs for any excitement and suspense, my advice is for you to open a can of Star Kist. That would be more thrilling than this mess, and take up a whole lot less of your time. Or better yet, just watch a Charlie Tuna commercial if you want to be entertained. Till Next time\n\nNext Class Please"

The tradition remains in this third installment, but something is terribly wrong here! Universal had a bad pre-Y2K glitch when they released HALLOWEEN 3 with different elements not pertaining to the original series. Later, the new JAWS movie was put out only to convince folks that it wasn't the same thing again. The result probably was beyond disappointment.\n\nHere's what I believe happened to JAWS 3. Alan Landsburg Productions actually created a killer shark movie not relating to the JAWS theme. Universal had a past history of suing film studios in releasing rip-offs similar to their patented work. Letting the giant movie studio release ALP's production was obviously the safest bet in avoiding a lawsuit. A few people may have remembered a poverty row studio called Film Ventures International, who released a movie in '82 called GREAT WHITE for about a single weekend, only to have banned future showings as a result of a court order involving plagiarism.\n\nMy advice to movie buffs is to remain committed to the original JAWS film released in 1975. The sequels bare no resemblance to Steven Spielberg's art of moviemaking."

One of the film's greatest factors is that the characterization scenes aren't all that aggravating to sit through. The bar scenes and the few scenes with the couples on the job are decently done, giving off a nice sense that a normal couple could be involved in these types of affairs without being forced into them. The action does come along at the end in all the right installments, featuring a lot of big action set-pieces that come off really well at first with the brief first attacks as well as the great encounter in the lagoon when they first encounter with the smaller shark. The discovery of the mother starts the film in earnest as the sight of the shark appearing in front of a panicked crowd of tourists and crashes into their structure has delightful possibilities, and they are somewhat played nicely here. The race to fix the stranded visitors is a nice suspense-builder, coming off in a very elegant manner and allowing for some really nail-biting scenes following the shark attacking the complex itself providing some nice action. The chase through the underwater ship is pretty nicely done and comes off with a great air of urgency about it. The shark in here also looks the closest to a real shark, giving off a realistic shape that is really close to a great white rather than a demonic face with a shark's body. It also displays a realistic touch by moving its upper lip to attack, something that none of the other sharks did. This wasn't all that terrible as there actually isn't that much to really dislike in this one. Most of what's wrong with the film is that the effects are pretty abysmal in general. The 3D effect isn't employed beyond poking objects into the camera for no reason, while the green-screen photography present also doesn't help matters, often times making them look worse. There's no believability at all in hardly anything in the film, especially the young, lifeless shark and this really hurts the film. It's nearly impossible to have any fear or tension in a film where the main threat isn't imposing, and it's on display nearly every time there's a shark on-screen here. The stupidity inherent in so many situations is a major crime, especially the shark's capture and display to the public being quite obvious and wouldn't play out in real life. The measure of taking out the creature also applies, as it really defies logic and in a scene full of nonsensical things, it's hard to pick one thing about the ending that really works. The shark itself deserves mention, as the body count in here is really unacceptable. For a giant shark to cause as much damage and mischief as it does, to be around as many thrashing bodies in the water as it always manages to be around, and the fact that it sneaks up on the victims isn't going to be left out. There should've been more kills in here, and with so many missed opportunities, it's a real shame. These are the main things involved with this that really bring it down.\n\nRated PG: Graphic Violence and Language."

        "review_detailed_main": "Numbers don't lie folks..people do. This movie was a financial success, yet is was yanked by Universal after 4 weeks. It still finished 15th for the year of 1983. To put it in perspective the number 14 movie Scarface also was released threw Universal was allowed to run for 3 months, despite and X rating and only made slightly more money, and was a PR nightmare for the Studio. Why is this?\n\nFirst of all the producers of Jaws and Jaws 2 refused to get involved because they wanted this sequel to be a Comedy. Secondly Joe Alves the second unit director of 1 and 2 (the guy that does all the non dramatic hard work like stunts and sharks) was given this project as a debut. Most directors don't get a big budget debut, so this must have really ruffled the feathers of Alve's former bosses. So we know the rest, it was released, made a bunch of money, and to mend fences with the original Jaws hot Shots Universal yanked it. After all they just wanted the money.\n\nAnd it's really a shame because a lot of hard work went into this movie. I categorically dismiss the criticism about the special effects of anybody who didn't see this movie in 3D the way it was meant to be seen. The arguments that the brody boy's leap frog from kids in Jaws 2 (released in 78) to where they are in this movie (Released in 83) is equally idiotic. Nowhere is it stated or even implied that this movie actually takes place in the year it was released.\n\nThe cast is Great with the exception of Quaid, who lacks chemistry with Bess armstrong who really nailed her role, so he should have been replaced. Alan Parkers re-scoring is great, and who can complain about getting to see a young Leah Thompson in a bikini.\n\nIt's a shame politics get in the way of artistic expression, the critics are always there, but supply drives demand, a movie can't be successful if it get's yanked. Just ask Andrew Dice Clay"

This movie actually got me interested in diving and living that quite free travelling lifestyle hinted at here\n\nIf you remove the bad sfx and accept that it was made for 3-d, also some of the sillier moments like the shark smashing through the glass.. the underlying story is not actually bad, a great white getting into a lagoon marine park.. could make for a very high quality movie actually, (the first hour or so of this one are pretty good), and this surely inspired movies like deep blue sea\n\ncertainly better than sharks falling out of the sky and other such nonsense that has been around more recently\n\nthe smug guy and sidekick (P. H. Moriarty from The Long Good Friday) with bad 'Australian' accent are a bit annoying though\n\nwatch the 4th one at your peril, since the core story for that is utterly ridiculous, but I won't say that about this one.

What he doesn't know is that a great white shark has invaded the lagoon and everything in it suddenly becomes its next meal. In the meantime \"Mike Brody\" (Dennis Quaid) has migrated from Amity Island (where his father was the chief of police) and is now an assistant manager who has his hands full working for Calvin Bouchard. Needless to say, he becomes quite unsettled when his girlfriend \"Dr. Kathryn Morgan\" (Bess Armstrong) suggests capturing the great white for viewing purposes. Calvin approves of the idea but what he doesn't know is that its mother has also followed it into the lagoon--and she is much bigger. Now, as far as this particular \"Jaws\" sequel is concerned I have to say that it doesn't compare favorably to either of its two predecessors for the simple reasons that it was dull, predictable and lacked the necessary suspense. Additionally, this movie tried to capitalize on its 3D effect but unfortunately it doesn't translate to video or television. In short, unless a person really loves shark movies I would stay away from this particular one. Accordingly, I rate it as below average."

        "review_detailed_main": "3D is now commonplace in cinema but now these days, movies are not made specifically for 3D. But, in the 1980s that was the case. There were several films throughout the 80s and 90s released specifically in 3D like Friday the 13th Part III, Amityville 3-D, and Freddy's Dead. In 1983, another 3D film was made and it was Jaws 3-D. Jaws 3-D had a troubled production with studio interference and what not. The film would be directed by Joe Alves and this would be his only directing credit. The film stars Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. The film was a decent financial success but failed critically. So much so that the film was nominated for five Razzies.\n\nYears after the events of Jaws 2, Michael Brody works at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. While working there, his brother, Sean, comes to visit. It just so happens when everyone is there, a shark manages to get inside the theme park and starts to wreak havoc.\n\nWhere do I even begin? Well, I should note that I have a regular DVD version of this film (more specifically a three movie set that has Jaws 2, 3, and 4). So I cannot see this film in it's original 3D. So by itself, it looks like garbage but not in an obnoxious in your face manner like in Friday the 13th Part III. In fact the intentional 3D effects that are supposed to be of the in your face variety are somewhat subtle. The other effects are very flat and get worse and worse as the film moves on. Now, there is a BluRay version of this film that has the 3D version and from what I have been told, it actually makes the film mildly better. So, if you are mildly curious I suppose checking it out would not be a bad idea. Now the quality of the footage all around does not look good on the standard DVD and perhaps it is because the film had different cameras for 3D. Again, maybe the BluRay release fixes this. Now moving on to the whole story here. Jaws 2 was basically a rehash of the original film. This film is still about a shark attacking but the film does get creative with it's location, a theme park. More specifically SeaWorld. But even then, this ends up being a blatant advertisement for SeaWorld. So, they should have just had it set at some generic theme park. Sure, it shows off their budget, but I hate seeing blatant advertisements. At least it is not as bad as the product placement in The Wizard. Now the story revolves around sharks getting into SeaWorld. Now, this wouldn't have happened if there was not a gate that separates the park and the ocean. Now, I am just a simple amateur film critic so maybe there is a reason why a simple gate separates the park from the ocean. I have no clue but I am gonna call it a flaw in the design. The acting here is not very good at all. No big shock there. The characters are not even that good either. Honestly, the Brody brothers are boring and dull. To be honest, it feels like it was all shoehorned in. It is entirely irrelevant that they are the Brody brothers. But, apparently this is Universal's fault because they forced screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to put them in there. Another character that should be mentioned is the park owner Calvin Bouchard. This guy is basically the mayor character from the first two films in a sense. I mean this guy clearly has no clue how to run a theme park like SeaWorld. For me, this film is almost too lighthearted almost because the shark is hardly present most of the time. This makes for a boring film especially when you have dull and boring characters. There is very little suspense in key scenes but that is not to say there is not any. There are maybe a total of two or three scenes that have some sort of suspense. Which says a lot considering that the original Jaws relied on the John Williams score to help build suspense and this film barely has it. I honestly think that it was used once and that was during the intro. The kills are pretty basic and the one thing that I can confidently say about this film in regards with doing something better than a sequel is that this film has more gore than Jaws 2. Now with all this movies nearly overwhelming faults, this film's original script was supposedly fairly decent and probably would have been better received than Jaws 2. If you ever find the film's original script, give it a read through and see how it compares.\n\nJaws 3-D is another Jaws sequel that decreases in quality. Poor special effects, poor acting and poor characters really drag this sequel that had potential as seen in it's original script."

You should get paid to watch their advertisement.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me in the least to find out this film is indeed backed heavily and financially by Seaworld itself."

        "review_detailed_main": "The brilliance of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film \"Jaws\" was that it took the premise for what was essentially a B-grade monster movie and pumped it up with so much thrills and so much escapist joy (and added some very interesting characters) that it excelled to a first-class work of art. \"Jaws 2\" was a production whose rushed schedule showed clearly in every frame, but at least it made a noble effort to be good and still capture not only the same thrills, but the same charm as the original. So it wasn't dismal when it failed. However, with the revival of the wildly over-hyped and unnecessary 3D format of movies came the third installment, \"Jaws III\" also known as \"Jaws: 3D.\" A little time has passed since the second movie. Martin Brody's (Roy Scheider from the first two movies) sons have grown up and one of them (a young Dennis Quaid) is a maintenance manager at Sea World. During his brother's (John Putch) visit, a great white shark busts through the underwater gates and begins to snack on people who venture into the park's waters. Eventually, the shark is captured, which leads to a jaw-dropping discovery: the shark is a baby. So ignoring the fact that in reality sharks do *not* care for their offspring, the cardboard cut-out characters declare that its 35-foot-long mother must also be on the loose on opening day, of all times.\n\nGone are the thrills and gone are the great characters. Looking back on the original \"Jaws\" and having the chance to see it in a theater for the first time (and meeting its screenwriter, the knowledgeable Carl Gottlieb) I am only further reminded of how strongly that movie succeeded because of three sharply-written, characteristic-packed characters who we believe in as human beings. They were essentially cutouts (a police chief, a mad hunter, a biologist) expanded into personalities we could relate to, people we liked, so that we rooted for the humans and condemned the sharks. Well, the characters here are more cutouts, but they remain so. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong do what they can, but they have nothing to expand their characters upon. Their motives and scenarios are flat, their passion nonexistent. The same applies for the supporting cast, with nobody standing out.\n\nFor the record, I have only seen the two-dimensional format of this picture. Reportedly the movie is no longer available for 3D viewing because it was so cheaply done and looking at the film, I can see why. Because even if the optical hocus pocus were handled well, it would not excuse the incredibly cheap visual effects. Oftentimes when the shark attacks, it uses the same gimmick. First of all, the tracking point-of-view shot which was so terrifying in the original movie and so redundant in the sequels. The camera zooms in on the victim, in a close-up so extreme that we can hardly see anything, the screen goes red, and then out of plume of over-lit blood we see a digital image meant to be a severed head or leg float toward the screen. If it jumped out at you, it would only increase the stultifying reality of how fake it is. Sometimes the movie even throws in cheap gimmicks for a 3D shot for no reason at all, such as a ludicrous shot where the camera zooms in upon a masthead-like sculpture protruding over the entrance to an exhibit. Does the object have any plot relevance or does it even look particularly good? No. So why include this track-in shot? So the filmmakers could make a thing stand out for no particular reason.\n\nThere are a great many horrid effects shots in the movie. Bad underwater sculpture and set design, including a submersible that was all too obviously a toy tricked into the shot. Effects like this had been done better twenty years before. As for the shark, the filmmakers make the dumb decision of using live shark footage for most of the scenes. As with the second movie, we see a lot of the shark this time around and by showing so much live shark footage and so few animatronics (which aren't too good this time around) the comparison is only more jarring. Sometimes the shark is also a digital effect, including an infamous shot where it rams through an aquarium glass, also not-so-convincing. And then there is a cheap rubber model used for the baby shark, which looks like something taken out of a TV movie.\n\nActually, the whole movie seems like something taken out of a TV movie. It was directed by Joe Alves, the production designer for the previous two movies and unfortunately his directing talents are far below his ability to create models, animatronics, and sets. With many logical errors (such as a shark out-swimming a motorboat), lackluster character development, horrid special effects, and a distinct lack of joy, \"Jaws III\" results in being a very forgettable production. I guess that's the best I can say about it. That although it bored me as I watched it, I found no difficulty in forgetting the experience the following morning."

An angry great white shark breaks in to the lagoon to search for its killed baby, however it rages up attacking tourists and disrupting the parks opening day.\n\nThe film had a great set to work from and a great story but there's no chemistry with bad actors and lame special effects. Compared to the second film its a huge step up, I don't know whether anyone expected another story set ashore in Amity village, its nice to see the writers thought up some fresh ideas.\n\nThe underwater sequences at the start and towards the end where the sharks swimming through the gate into the lagoon, i was pretty freaked out despite the fact it looked freakishly fake. I can understand it might have been a huge it in the 80's, especially because it was in 3-D, but today its definitely lost its appeal..\n\nhowever I recommend this to every Jaws fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "I give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it \"real,\" and one point for the filmmakers' truly laudable 'Efforts.'\n\nFour generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.\n\nHowever, like most badly executed thrillers with substandard \"eye-candy,\" J3 has a worthy message for all of us: Try to bottle Nature in an attractive Theme Park package, and nature will get back at you in a deadly, often gruesome way.\n\nMost interesting here are the two-dimensional, stock characters. They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...\n\nWhat we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, \"Calvin\"), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater. Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.' He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!\n\nThe heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.\n\nMy favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out. Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.\n\nBrief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.\n\nJ4 stinks and sinks! Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans. These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands, sitting quietly counting their box-office money.\n\nSee Jaws 3. If anything, it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show, where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience."

The plot? Shark kills somebody in a bedlam of blood and gore, shark kills someone else, then someone else, ad nauseum.\n\nI really can't figure out what went wrong here. The director and writers were part of the original Jaws, so it would seem they are capable of creating something of value. What happened? Let's take a closer look: It seems that this is the only film Joe Alves has EVER directed! Well, thank goodness he won't be releasing anymore of this toxic sludge upon the world of film. Writer Peter Benchley, writer of the original Jaws, was a writer on this film as well. A closer look at his writing history reveals him as a writer on: Jaws, The Deep, Cruel Jaws, The Beast, Creature (White Shark)... Hmmm, I detect a theme here. Peter Benchley is the Mario Puzo of shark movies. Another writer on this film was Carl Gottlieb. It seems like 1983 was a bad year for Mr. Gottlieb, because the same year this sludge was written, he also wrote the bomb known as \"Dr. Detroit\". This director of \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" seems to actually have a better career as an actor than a director, appearing in such films as \"Johnny Dangerously\" and \"Clueless\". Aside from the Jaws films he only wrote on 4 movies.\n\nThis overwhelming evidence seems to prove only one thing. Stephen Spielberg was the only production talent on Jaws, and without him and the high-caliber actors of the original film, hacks like Peter Benchley and his band of cronies will never create another watchable film again."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jaws 3\" is not an awful movie as so many snobbish would-be critics contend. For an awful movie try something like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" or \"Howling 2\". Certainly, it isn't a great film like the original \"Jaws\", but it is what I consider a decent sequel and an enjoyable movie that works and that is much better than much of what passes for \"good\" movies, presently.\n\nAlthough the basic premise of a \"monster\" eating people is extremely old, I think the plot formed around this idea is rather clever and intriguing - a great white breaking into Sea World.\n\nMany of the film's critics bash the film for the unrealistic scenario of having a mother Great White follow its baby and seek revenge for the baby's death, and by criticizing it thus, they are showing their own stupidity.If such critics actually spent some time paying attention to the film instead of trying to feel superior, they would realize that the mother shark breaks into Sea World and gives birth there. Also, the mother completely ignores the baby (realistically). It isn't the baby's capture and death that sets the mother off - it's the decision to shut off the water pumps that provide it with its oxygen supply in the place where it was lurking that causes it to finally start exploring the park.\n\nAlso, the special effects are damn good for an 80's flick and are much better than lame CGI in modern films. Sure, CGI has the capability of being realistic, but that capability hasn't been reached yet.\n\nThis is a fine film that deserves more credit than it is given. I only hope that its poor reputation doesn't prevent Universal from giving it a good DVD release."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having only seen this in 2D my review must refrain from assuming that I've been privileged to witness the \"full fish\". However I think that my sense of smell, whilst not on a par with a sharks, is acute enough to smell poop in the water many miles off. This floater just can't swim for its life.\n\nThe Jaws franchise degenerated so quickly, and obviously, a part of the problem is that a great white shark is not a versatile antagonists.....but a bigger problem, and reason for the stagnant water that is the wider Jaws franchise, is the Brody family: they aren't strong swimmers either. They are a doggy paddle trying to compete with an oversized dogfish in adrift racing.\n\nThe third film, in whatever dimension you watch, tries to dissolve some of this jetsam in purified water by relocating the setting and refocusing on a next generation: the Brody brother spawn.\n\nIt doesn't achieve much because these boys are no more interestingly written than the park...they are just as wet. The girlfriends are equally waterlogged.\n\nThe storyline is dredged from the abyssal and the characters are defleshed rather than fleshed out. Like a divers leg bitten by a shark. Metaphorically.\n\nThe visual special effects have a bit more gusto given to them by the cast and crew than in Jaws 2 but unfortunately, in 2D at least, they are much worse here in Jaws 3.\n\nI rate 3/10 because there are a couple of delicious gross out moments which prevent this from being meritless and the production designers and practical effects/props teams certainly earner their crust with these. Everyone else involved was filter feeding. I can't really recommend this film any further than that."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one seriously bad film, but on reflection maybe it gave author Michael Crichton some ideas for his novel Jurassic Park, which later became the Stephen Spielberg movie of the same name. Spielberg of course directed the original classic Jaws film, of which this is the second sequel. A great white shark causes chaos in a marine theme park as against the cloned dinosaurs escaping and causing chaos at a pre-historic theme park. Unfortunately the production standards of this film aren't even a pale imitation of the original, 3D effects notwithstanding. For the record, I didn't see this in 3D.\n\nPutting aside the campy performances, cheesy special effects, unconvincing acting and downright awful dialogue, Jaws 3D just has a ridiculous storyline. It just defies belief that a supposedly 35 foot ( it never looks anywhere near that big in the film) white shark could enter an artificial enclosed marine park lake ... and then hide out! But that's what we're expected to swallow, hook, line and ... you know the rest. And then the management decisions to deal with the issue are of course predictably inept.\n\nHard to believe too that Louis Cameron Gossett Jr. went from his Oscar winning turn in An Officer and a Gentleman to this, where he was nominated very appropriately I think, for a Razzie award. We do get to see a young Dennis Quaid in just about his first inauspicious lead role, before he hit the big time proper in his next film The Right Stuff.\n\nI may be harsh not looking at the film in 3D, but the special effects look terribly fake, even taking into account, it was released in 1983. The suspense/action quota is laughable. Because the film was given an American PG 13 rating, you don't ever really see anyone getting eaten. You just see clouds of red in the water, close-ups of a mouthful of teeth and some hilarious chomping sounds. Stuff like this gives credence to the stories of Jaws 3 originally being envisaged as a spoof.\n\nI'm amazed this film was a commercial success giving rise to another equally vacuous sequel. People must have loved putting on those funny glasses."

Whereas the first two films were set in a New England sea resort and focused on the struggle of an everyman police chief against a force of nature, this entry gives us an amusement park, a dolphin trainer, and her dolphins.\n\nThe change is most apparent when one listens to the soundtrack. Whereas John Williams's soundtrack was full of menace, the Jaws 3-D soundtrack is full of celebratory cues meant to show off Sea World. (Indeed, at times the film comes across as an advertisement for Sea World.) Even the shark cues come across as adventurous rather than suspenseful. Although it's a good score, it doesn't really fit a horror movie.\n\nThe horror is further diminished by the lack of characters to care about. The performances are too broad to care about any of the main characters, particularly Louis Gossett Jr. doing Murray Hamilton-lite as the owner of Sea World. Moreover, most of the shark attack victims are depicted as unlikeable, eliminating any real sense of empathy.\n\nThe only reason I gave this film four rather than three stars is that I loved it as a child. It's mainly good for nostalgia or showing younger children to introduce them to the Jaws series."

Well, in simple terms it could be used as an extreme torture device, DVD quality making the pain even worse. I won't say anything about the plot (even though there is not one) but I will say something about the dazzling, state-of-the-art special effects, the only thing that salvages the movie. Basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine. Unbelievable! You wouldn't think for one minute that they were using a miniature centre made from yogurt pots, or a diving machine so super-imposed one side of it totally disappears in one scene! Nah, great SFX. They could even be compared to the might of the Doctor Who films made in the sixties, with flying saucers on strings etc. Oh sorry, I forgot - they weren't actually made from yogurt pots.\n\nYou can probably figure out that I dislike this movie a lot, and you'd be right. But please, take note from this review - when Carl Gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought we'd have on OK movie. It turns out that looking at a dog turd for 90 minutes would give you more adrenaline rushes than this total tosh."

        "review_detailed_main": "Seeing Jaws 3-D makes me wonder if I was too harsh on Jaws 2. I recently reviewed Jaws 2 and criticized its sloppy and poor storytelling and pacing, but nonetheless thought it had moments of good film-making, especially in its action set-pieces - so you had a decent, albeit not exceptional movie. Well, the third Jaws movie makes Jaws 2 look like Jaws. Jaws 3-D is a movie that, to my astonishment, makes me feel nothing. Well almost nothing. The only emotion that stirred inside me during its entire one hour and forty minutes... was embarrassment for this \"amateur hour.\"\n\nI was mildly interested in seeing the movie because it seemed to be the last Jaws movie with the crew of the previous movies working on it. Longtime Spielberg production designer Joe Alves directed, as he was a second unit director on the previous movies and played a part in getting them to look good. Jaws 3-D was also the last Jaws screenplay penned by Carl Gottlieb. Gottlieb, who contributed to the screenplay of Jaws and largely wrote Jaws 2, had shown some competency in staging suspenseful scenes and allowing moments for characters to breathe and develop. I am not sure if they were under strain from studio executives, but it is clear watching Jaws 3-D why Alves never directed again, and why Gottlieb's writing career more or less fizzled out after this movie.\n\nCharacters, such as the two Brody sons, have little character and less to do. There's no meaningful exchanges between the brothers or other Sea World workers, or the park owner (an enjoyably slimy performance by Lou Gosset), or the Australian... hunter? photographer? Even Jaws 2 managed to have moments where people acted (even if that was rare). Here everyone goes through the motions. Dennis Quaid gets his paycheck. Sean Brody, played indistinctly by John Putch, has a... uh, character arc where he's afraid of the water, but gets over it because a hot chick offers to bang him by the beach. I guess that's character development. But he leaves the movie two-thirds of the way through, severing one more connection with the series' cast and history that we have grown attached to. Now, I am always for movies, especially genre/franchise flicks bucking convention and cleverly moving past their forebears, but without good writing or characters, all those efforts are worthless. Jaws 2 didn't have a particularly strong script, so it leaned on the setting of Amity Island, and some familiar faces to make up the deficit. Jaws 3-D thought it could lean on the setting of Sea World and the presence of other sea creatures like dolphins, orca, and the like. The outcome is a total dud, and cynical misjudge of what will keep the audience engaged.\n\nThe setting is totally wasted - see Deep Blue Sea to see a film that at least tries to take advantage of its location in an underwater observatory. Making an amusement park the site of widespread bloodshed and chaos has immediate potential (see: Jurassic Park), but Universal did not seem to want to spend the money fleshing the premise out, so what is left is a real cheap production: extending from the sets all the way to the marquis attraction - the shark itself.\n\nThe shark has never looked so bad. Jaws 2 showed off a shark that was in some ways superior to the original, and the resultant construction allowed for some inventive and fun action scenes from the director and crew. In Jaws 3-D the shark was stiff, mostly motionless, and seemed to have consisted of a single model that was capable of opening its mouth and wiggling a little bit. The action scenes were mundane and executed in a dull manner and lacked the dynamic camera movements and smart cuts of the previous movie. Instead, we have \"fin chases something in the water\" scenes, mixed with some laughable \"shark-torpedo\" moments where the shark slowly inches towards something to attack. The film's other effects are likewise poor. The optical shots and overlays were so so shoddy that you wonder how anyone signed off on them, other than slimy producers looking for a quick buck. They say that while making Jaws Spielberg called the SFX crew the \"special defects department.\" He had no clue how good he had it.\n\nHere's a rule for creature movies. If you can't show the monster all the time, at least have a good writing/actors. If you can't have good writing/characters, than at least keep the thing short and moving so my time isn't wasted. Jaws 3-D wastes your time and feels longer than its 1hr40min length because it lacks a good monster, good performances or writing, and has a terminally slow pace riddled with filler. Jaws 2 had me pining for more shark scenes. When compared to Jaws 3-D, Jaws 2 feels like non-stop shark tail slapping you in your groin. The movie tries to pull of some cheap jump-scares and gross-outs, but the make-up and special effects are c-movie grade and incredibly silly. Worse still, they are spread out so far and few that they are less like exclamation points than they are a dull rapping on the TV screen to make sure you are still awake.\n\nIs there anything positive about Jaws 3-D? Surprisingly, yes! The music, composed by Alan Parker is fun, adventurous, and well-suited to the action. While leaning on the score of John Williams, it nonetheless manages to achieve its own sound and feels fresh and enjoyable. Mr. Parker deserves a commendation for doing the best he could with a bad source. It's a shame he seemed to retreat largely into made-for-TV movies after this, never getting a huge Hollywood movie to sink his teeth into again.\n\nIn summation: this movie definitely feels like the death-knell for this \"franchise.\" There wasn't even enough happening to offer a \"so bad it's good\" experience! Despite having a few of the original hands working on it, the movie demonstrated that they lacked the skill, the time, or the artistic freedom to bring about something worthwhile. I'll give it to the crew of Jaws 2: they tried to make a good movie, they just didn't really succeed. The makers of Jaws 3-D didn't even try!"

Somehow another shark manages to be a family curse to the Brody's and goes after Michael where lots of people get eaten including his first black victim.\n\nJaws 3 also stars Louis Gossett Jr. and Lea Thompson."

However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.\n\nDan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.\n\nFortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm. Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails."

This third instalment in the \"Jaws\" family is entertaining, if somewhat tripe in its handling of the subject matter. Despite being an absurd looking shark imitation, the sight of the great dorsal fin breaking water beside oblivious skiers, together with the signature pulsating rhythm of the theme music, still manages to send shivers down the spine.\n\nThe young Brody kids (Dennis Quaid and John Putch) from the first two episodes have returned, now adults enjoying some catch-up at the recently revamped Sea World Resort, where the older brother (Quaid) works alongside his love interest (Armstrong). However their merry reunion is short-lived when a young Great White shark is discovered in the waterpark's lagoon. After an attempt to catch and conserve the shark in captivity fails, they soon discover that mother is also in the park, and not at all pleased at the exploitation of junior.\n\nDespite some amateurish-looking performances in the minor roles, and the occasional inane dialogue, this remains a mostly suspenseful and exciting third entry in the quartet, still capable of invoking a primal fear of the water. And in case you were wondering, there's a particularly graphic attack scene and aftermath (check out the inventive make-up effects employed) that should impress."

        "review_detailed_main": "Roger Ebert wasn't known for his political views, but he did have thoughts on the film industry. I guess you could consider views on the actual movie industry to be political ones. They include stuff about censorship, special effects, etc. I will always remember at how he was against 3-D. He kept making article after article about how he was tired of it. 1983 saw a resurfacing of 3D that came from the 1950's. There were many third installments in series that were 3D and this is one of the worst. It's pretty easy to see that this was just a cheap gimmick and you can comprehend how it died off in this decade.\n\nBut I'm digressing. This is the third \"Jaws\" movie and it's fascinating for me to watch these films in chronological order if only because of how massively they declined with each installment. At first, I thought this didn't have any connections to the previous films, but I was wrong. The main characters are the Brody brothers, the sons of the main lead from the other films. It's still a loose connection. I literally fell asleep watching this movie as it was so boring. Okay, that was probably only because I stayed up for New Year's Eve and got little sleep, but still it was boring. Even for a 98 minute film, it seemed too long. Everything was padded.\n\nThe worst thing was of course how bad the special effects were. I mean, I even tried to use some old 3-D glasses I had around and they didn't work. Everything is horribly stilted here. I have never seen any film that has images that so blatantly try to just stick out to the audience. The coloring effects are terrible. I can blatantly see an error with the submarine as part of it visibly vanishes through a bad special effect. The shark models look terrible too. It is literally the worst use of 3-D I have ever seen in any film. I couldn't find Ebert's review of it, but it might have had a profound effect on him. Skip this. *1/2"

        "review_detailed_main": "Into the glut of the early 1980's 3-D revival craze swam...Jaws 3. I had the misfortune of actually seeing this one in the theater when it was theatrically released, one of the first flicks I saw at the then-new multiplex cinema - with 15 different theaters - that had opened in my town.\n\nI had previously seen both Jaws and Jaws 2 and enjoyed them both, Jaws 2 being a solid-enough (if not spectacular as the original) sequel. Jaws 3 and Jaws 4 are both crummy movies; arguing which one is worse than the other being an exercise in futility.\n\nA lot of plot holes. The Brody brothers in 1975 were roughly 4 and 8 years old. Three years later in Jaws 2, they were roughly 12 and 17 years old. In Jaws 3 - eight years after the first Jaws - they are in their early and late 20's. In Jaws 3, the entire movie supposedly takes place in Sea World, Orlando. Despite Orlando being in the center of the state of Florida, in the Jaws 3 universe Sea World is located directly adjacent to what appears to be the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnyway, in Jaws 3, the Sea World water park is centered around a large lagoon. However, is it even remotely plausible that even the largest lagoon could manage to mask the presence of not one but two Great White sharks for several days? One assumes these sharks (the bigger of the two being 35 feet in length) would be feeding on the Sea World aquatic life from the get-go, and even in a large lagoon a 35-foot Great White would be spotted fairly quickly.\n\nSeeing as the plot itself is utterly ridiculous, one is basically left with the 3-D and the kills. Well, if you're watching Jaws 3 at home, you're not watching it in the original 3-D format. What you are watching is a film that has washed-out colors (the result of transferring the 3-D format to a non-3-D format) and a grainy visual feel. As for the kills, well, there is one that results in the victim being swallowed whole by the shark and provides a neat POV from inside the shark's mouth. The other kills are fairly boring. And even the number of shark scenes and kills themselves is outweighed by the amount of screen time devoted to the main characters galivanting around the park and talking. Dialogue is fine when you have a memorable screenplay with memorable characters speaking memorable lines. Jaws 3 has none of these things.\n\nI will say some of the 3-D stuff WAS effective when I saw it in the theater. Again, you don't get any of that when seeing it at home. What you get is a slow, ponderous, pointless sequel in a franchise that would have been better off ending with the 2nd movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jaws 3-D\" (1983), it appears that the film makers haven't learned their lesson yet. Just when you thought these movies couldn't get any worse, they vomit this waste of cinema in our faces! Wow, as if two mediocre films weren't enough. I'm still asking myself: \"why did I waste my life watching this \"movie\"? This \"film\" is so bad, that it's an embarrassment. \"Jaws 3-D\" has a redundant and cliched story, the acting is all over the place, most of the special effects are abysmal, and the soundtrack is a joke! The plot is, a great white shark accidentally gets itself trapped in a SeaWorld theme park, and it's up to Brody's children to save everyone. I will give the story some credit (SOME!) They were on the right track by placing the shark in a singular location setting, rather than somewhere out in the ocean. Since the shark is stuck in a small area, that has the potential to create tension for the situation. Why? Because the victims are trapped as well with nowhere to go. Unfortunately, poor script writing and execution prevented any good from happening on the screen. Don't even get me started on the abysmal 3D elements! They add nothing to the story and just make it even more embarrassing than it already is. If that's even possible! I'll go into more details with the 3D effects later. Another thing is how stupid all of the characters are. All of them make the situation more difficult than it has to be. They are all scrambling, thinking about how they're going to get rid of the shark. Here's the thing, the shark is in one area, unable to escape. Just call animal control, or shoot the stupid shark! The fact that the characters can't comprehend such an obvious answer to this problem is mind-blowing to me, for all the wrong reasons. I understand that characters in horror/thriller films are supposed to be dumb, but this is ridiculous. It makes you question the intelligence of the writers themselves, because they're most likely that stupid in real-life! But, the bottom line is, that it's the exact same premise as the first two movies, it just takes place in a different location. That is the epitome of lazy writing! All of the acting is average to just plain horrible. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Dennis Quaid and Lea Thompson. But, that doesn't mean their performances are perfect. It just means that they're the best of the worst. All of the characters are dumb and unlikeable. So, when the shark finally meets it's eventual comeuppance, it's nowhere near as satisfying as it should be. As for the rest of the performances from the cast, they do terribly! Bad writing will almost always equal bad performances. As for the special effects, the majority of them are garbage, especially the 3D elements, which are shown throughout the majority of this \"film\"! From the opening credits alone, you know exactly what kind of \"movie\" you're in for before it even starts. I'm not a fan of 3D elements in films or shows, and this \"movie\" just laments that fact. These are some of the worst, if not the absolute worst 3D effects I've seen in any movie. Even the shark itself looks more fake than the props used in the first two films. You'd think that the props would look better and more realistic over time, but, they just get worse and worse! The soundtrack, composed by Alan Parker, is an insult to the great John Williams. Saying that this film score pales in comparison to the first two movies is an understatement. John Williams is my all-time favorite film score composer, and Alan Parker was supposed to be the ideal replacement? What's the matter with these film makers? I don't blame John Williams for turning this \"movie\" down, it might have ruined his career! The only good element in this \"film\" are the sets/locations. They do create a somewhat decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in SeaWorld, or anywhere else Florida! But, at the same time, putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad idea. Why is that? Because, if children watch this \"movie\" and they love going to SeaWorld, seeing the shark there will most likely scare them away. Putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad way to promote the park! They might as well say on the SeaWorld website: \"come visit SeaWorld today, and get eaten by great white sharks!\" See what I mean? What were the writers thinking? \"Jaws 3-D\" is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It's unnecessary and I feel no tension or drama while watching it. I just think to myself: \"is it over yet?!\" I'm giving this \"film\" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from \"Jaws 3-D\", you'll just be wasting your life while watching it. The reality is, as this franchise continues to limp forward with these pointless sequels for some reason, they just get worse and worse. Also, for some reason, we still have one more film left in this series to tare apart. Apparently, the great white sharks haven't learned their lesson either!"

Well almost 30 plus years later I recently saw it on Bluray in 3D, on a 60 inch TV.\n\nI enjoyed the movie, its a typical 80's cheesy movie. If the movie had been edited a little tighter it would actually be a good film. The reason the film is in my memory is because the directors sister used to be a secretary for my father, and from memory the director was on the run at the time for legal reasons. Anyway back to the movie, it does drag in places. However watching the in your face 3D is enjoyable and brings back childhood memories of just how great the 80's really were I need Doc Browns Time machine to just spend a few weeks there, and to get an opportunity to have the big hair and shoulder pads. Its basically Jurassic Park in the water, a theme park that goes wrong and people die, pretty simple really. Watch it and enjoy it for what it is good old plain cheesy fun. I also realized that Dennis Quaid who is in the movie could have made a good Han Solo."

        "review_detailed_main": "The second sequel to Spielberg's 1975 horror/suspense masterpiece JAWS, JAWS 3 shifts the mayhem away from Amity Island to the Sea World resort in Florida. But in the tradition of a lot of Hollywood sequels, this third big fish entry is even more ludicrous than the second, and of course nowhere near as believably frightening as the first.\n\nDennis Quaid stars as Mike Brody, who is now employed at Florida's Undersea Kingdom. His younger brother Sean (John Putch) has the same problems with hydrophobia that their father once had, a fear that is amply justified when he goes to visit Quaid in Florida, and a shark enters the park's submarine tubes, killing three employees before being anaesthetized by Quaid and the park's chief itchycologist (Bess Armstrong). What neither they nor the park's manager (Louis Gossett Jr.) know is that its mother is coming for its young one. The result is the expected panic and a shark destruction scene that tops the one in JAWS 2 by leaps and bounds for its sheer ludicrousness.\n\nEven though it was originally shown in 3-D, JAWS 3 still isn't very good. Sure, it has Quaid, Armstrong, Gossett, and even an early appearance by Lea Thompson. But all of that goes for naught because of the stiff direction of Joe Alves (the production designer on the first two films, and associate producer on JAWS 2) and the unusually lame script by Richard Matheson (of DUEL and \"Twilight Zone\" fame) and Carl Gottlieb (who co-wrote the first two movies). Many of the effects are pretty good, and the acting is fair. Otherwise, however, JAWS 3 is a watchable film and nothing more than that."

But because it's not in 3-D they just come across as gimmicky and annoying. And there's a lot of scenes like that. Most of the movie is just bad 3-D. These flaws are enough to distract you from other, more conventional flaws. For one thing, the story is bland, and I mean bland. Jaws gets trapped in Sea World in Orlando, Florida. And before I go any further I just have to dwell on how dumb that marketing trick was. Is that really the coverage you want? On top of that, the characters are all stock. Almost none of them have any personality at all. There's no reason to care about any of these people. The bottom line is that Jaws 3-D is just a mix of awful special effects with a really lazy, uninteresting script thrown in as filler. Any resemblance of tension or suspense that was seen I the first movie is gone. Instead, it's just a hallowed out shell."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here is where the Jaws franchise takes a downward plunge. The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando, and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong, a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered, it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up, I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up, and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.\n\nThe rest of the movie follows Quaid, Armstrong, and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr., and Lea Thompson, as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak.\n\nThis movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983, and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind), but many are just window dressing (the submersibles), or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on, but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)\n\nJust forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine.\n\nI just have one question, to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!), the title logo of \"JAWS III\" was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style, and they \"chomped\" at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!!\n\nViewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's, the swooshing sound is there, the CHOMP sound effect is there, but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of \"Jaws III\".\n\nThat opening gripped me when I was a kid... where did it go?"

A better movie probably could have been made utilizing the basic premise, but these filmmakers aren't up to that challenge. The dialogue and the characters are just not that interesting, and the movie doesn't start to cook until past the hour mark. It may be unique for this franchise in its attempt to cash in on the resurgence in 3-D cinema during this time, but the effects are pretty damn laughable most of the time. Debuting first unit director Joe Alves, the production designer and second unit director on the first two movies, proves to be out of his depth here, and thereafter returned to what he did best.\n\nPolice Chief Brody's eldest son Mike, now played by Dennis Quaid, is currently working at Florida's Sea World where he's romancing head biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong). As he is visited by his baby brother Sean (John Putch), an enormous shark slips inside the park gates, nibbling on an occasional victim before eventually making her presence known to the public.\n\nCo-written by Carl Gottlieb, who also co-wrote the first two movies, and none other than Richard Matheson (based on a story idea by Guerdon Trueblood), although Matheson would later charge that script doctors ruined his original premise. The actors are all reasonably likable, with a lovely and adorable Lea Thompson making her feature film debut and Louis Gossett Jr. offering a very amusing take on the \"entrepreneur\" character Calvin Bouchard. Simon MacCorkindale is likewise a hoot as the somewhat smarmy documentarian. John Williams's iconic score is appropriately utilized once again, with new compositions courtesy of Alan Parker.\n\nIf there is one nice touch here, it's the added threat of Sea World customers trapped in underwater tunnels that have been weakened by the sharks' rampages.\n\nThis kills time agreeably enough, if the viewer isn't too demanding.\n\nFive out of 10."

As the crowds flock to experience the miracles of a sub-aquatic world, a 35-foot Great White shark explores the lagoon looking for her offspring (and something to eat).\n\nWith the early '80s witnessing a brief revival of the 3D gimmick, it must have seemed like the obvious choice for producers to add an extra dimension to a third Jaws movie, great whites looming out of the screen presumably even scarier than standard 2D sharks. Jaws 3D proves that this isn't actually the case, with tension and scares in short supply thanks to the cheesiness and predictability of the script, and ham-fisted direction from Joe Alves (whose directorial career started and ended with this film).\n\nOn the flip side, it is this very cheese factor that ensures a fun time for fans of schlock horror, with countless objects (including torn and mangled body parts) thrust into the audience's lap at every opportunity, truly laughable special effects, and some terrible performances (Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarty as British shark trappers are hilariously bad\u2014even more lifeless than the shark).\n\n4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for having the lovely Lea Thompson in a bikini. Great Scott!"

It really angered me to see the treatment of the baby shark when it was captured. (Yes, of course I know this is just a film, and the shark was a prop.) The only reason I say that is because the film seemed to not incorporate much scientific fact, if any at all into the Sharks biology and instincts.\n\nAll in all, it is probably my least favorite of all of the Jaws films.

The awful look of this film is of course due to it being a 3-d movie and because of this watching it without the glasses causes lots of ugly cinematography and awkward long shots that they didn't edit for the 2D release. I sadly watched the 2D version and from what I've heard the 3D aspect of this movie is actually its best part. That being said even with the 3D side of things aside, this movie is still awful. The premise is actually kinda interesting that being a jaws shark has sneaked into a sea world park however, they don't do much of anything creative with the premise and the story is pretty non existent. Every single character in this movie is completely uninteresting which is a pretty big problem when half nearly half the runtime is focused on them. Outside of a singular scene the film never felt tense and every single shark kill was cheesy and really badly shot. The way the film ends is also completely out of nowhere and feels incredibly cheap and out of nowhere. Overall while the premise is interesting and the 3D side of things may be good (with glasses) the cgi and awkwardness in 2D is awful and everything about the plot and horror is pathetic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jaws 3, the second sequel to a movie that didn't even need one. In theatres it was presented in glorious 3-D, but not for home video, nor is it shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, which sort of takes the fun out of this movie. But it still has its assets. Besides having a big cast, I can easily say that the mechanical shark in this installment is the best yet! First off, I liked how the eyes of this shark realistically rolled back white whenever it attacked its prey, just as real sharks' do. A very nice touch.\n\nI also noticed that the shark in this movie had a lot more attention paid to the working mechanics of its jaws. For instance, when a shark opens its mouth, its gums lower to the point that they look like they're going to fall right out of its mouth. You'd think something so noticeable would've been incorperated into the design of the mechanical shark in the the first Jaws movie. But it wasn't until Jaws 3 when that effect finally came into play. It was the first and only mechanical shark in the series that did that. It was also the only shark in the series that never stuck its head out of the water for more than a couple of seconds, which was more realistic than having a shark throw itself onto a boat, and stay there until someone slides into its mouth.\n\nLastly, the shark's skin seems to have been perfected. It wasn't rubbery like the sharks in the first and second movie, and wasn't as rough as sandpaper like the one in the fourth Jaws. Its skin actually looked fleshy! Apart from the shark's super-slow speed, and the several instinces where we were obviously meant to see it in 3-D, this shark looked more real than all the other sharks in the series put together! The one thing that I couldn't get past with the shark in this movie was its size. Though it's true that all the sharks in the Jaws series were guilty of being overly large, 35 feet is ridiculous! And what better way to see this big female shark demonstrate her freakish size than by scooping a full grown man completely into her mouth, where he's repeatedly squeezed between her massive tongue and the roof of her mouth until he explodes! Though it was interesting to watch, and maybe even a little funny, it was clearly impossible.\n\nAll in all, this movie just served to be campy fun, and will appeal to you if you enjoy movies like: Anaconda, Lake Placid, Piranha, and Deep Blue Sea. However, if you're hoping for a movie that recaptures the fear of the original Jaws, than don't look any further than Jaws 2.........."

I had a hard time believing and feeling like this was a part of the Jaws series. Since the release of \"Jaws 4\" it is more apparent that Jaws 3-D fits the collection like a square peg in a round hole. This is not to say that the movie itself was bad - I did like the story line - there was just nothing to really tie it to the series (no Martin or Ellen Brody, no Amity etc). May have done better as just another shark movie rather than the third installment in the series. I'm not too big a fan of the \"3-D\" effects either (maybe they were better in the theater). As far as Peter Benchley's \"Jaws\", this one is a good argument for mercy killings at birth."

At best, you're reacting to the occasional, \"Ooh got you!\" jump-out-and-scare stuff. I'll be glad to stop by your house and jump out at you with a knife and a mask: you'll be just as impressed. This is the kind of movie friends of actors Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., and Lea Thompson probably show at parties to mercilessly tease them. Bess Armstrong (High Road to China) and Simon McCorkindale (Manimal - 'nuff said?) probably consider Jaws 3-D a high point in their careers, though."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Jaws 3-D. Before we get into it, here are my ratings:\n\nStory - 1.25 Direction - 0.75 Pace - 0.50 Acting - 1.25 Enjoyment - 1.00\n\nTOTAL - 4.75\n\nWhat happens when you take the shark out of Amityville? The big fish flounders.\n\nThough, in all fairness, I cannot put the fault at the writers' feet. Both Gotlieb and Matheson, the legend, have solid writing backgrounds. Gotlieb even wrote for the original and better Jaws and Jaws 2. The story is not the worst I've seen, and it expands on the original films. I liked the concept of moving away from Amityville Island, though a couple of the principal characters come from the island. Six degrees of separation and all that.\n\nSo, where does the blame belong? The director, the special effects, and the person who decided to make it a 3-D movie. Joe Alves does his best to embrace the 3-D but falls woefully short. So not only do we get severed fish heads spinning towards us, but we have, fallen reeds and jumping frogs. As for the special effects, to say this shark was awful would be an understatement. The animatronics are nowhere on par with the original great white. The only parts that move, and badly, are its jaws, the skin around the mouth, and the slow left and right swish of its tail fin. And, the captured baby shark is physically manhandled to create his movement. That said, there is one gruesome and notable effect - the dead workman. He is one nasty looking corpse. Even this bright flash in the dark and the talented cast cannot save the film.\n\nThanks to the shoddy special effects, the film's flow takes on a lethargic pace that damages the movie beyond hope of complete enjoyment. The injury gets worse when you factor in the 2-D 3-D shots. The old 80s 3-D process looks flat and unreal when converted into 2-D.\n\nThe only reason I would recommend this flick would be if you are looking to watch the entire series. Though, I'd suggest missing Jaws 3-D, unless you have nothing better to watch, or do.\n\nFeel free to check out my Absolute Horror and Monstrous lists to see where I have ranked Jaws 3-D.\n\nTake Care & Stay Well."

The Producers somehow managed to drag Dennis Quaid and Luis Gosset, Jr into nightmare, and while they are always good, they can save this movie from itself. What Jaws taught the film industry was that suspense and a solid script could sell a horror film in the way Hitchcock did, without dopey special effects.

They take place in open water and the shark destroys some boats. This one is in a whole different environment... Sea World. People are saying this plot is ridiculous except it's really not because having a live great white shark in captivity is every aquarium's dream. Sure the shark bashes through steel mechanized gates but is that really such a far leap from pulling apart an entire pier or pulling down those yellow barrels like the shark did in the first movie? Unfortunately everything positive I could say about this movie stops there.\n\nWhile the look of the mechanical shark improves with each sequel this one did a terrible job at showing it properly. Also there's a scene where the baby great white is attacking a sunken ship to try getting to some people but it's clearly a guy ramming a toy shark into a miniature ship prop. The baby also hardly ever moves its tail for some reason so it looks like its just drifting in the water. The effects have their moments but they're mostly cheesy and laughable.\n\nThe acting is uninspired and none of the characters are really memorable. There were times where I was like \"oh yeah... THAT guy exists...\"\n\nEvery time I saw the shark fin rise to the surface and heard that iconic music playing it felt like the director was just saying \"Oh! I get to make a JAWS movie! That means we need lots of these shots!\" There was no tension to those shots like there was in JAWS and even a little in JAWS 2.\n\nIt's bad but I've seen worse. The only reason I gave it a 4/10 instead of a 2/10 is because I didn't take the film very seriously so I got some good laughs out of it."

It is one thing to have a shark attack in the open water, but not at an underwater park. A shark can be easily contained in a park like that. This is one of Dennis Quaid's early movies and probably one he doesn't put on his resume. He tries hard, but the movie is stale and dull in its first half. It does liven up in the second half when the shark attacks the underwater park. What these scenes lack in logic at least they work to some degree. I have not seen the movie in its original 3-D but I doubt it would improve the movie much. I think Jaws the Revenge is slightly better than this movie, which should tell you something. 5/10"

Whilst the acting was so so, the suspense was incredible and nearly rivalled other popular 80's sci fi movies such as ALIENS, that I rank as the best suspense that I have ever witnessed on film.\n\nI thought It was a huge jump ahead from the second movie and although the first is a classic.. If I am honest with myself, I think I enjoyed this more than the first one. Though incomparable and very different style.

Once in a while they have a big hit. More times than either of these, the sequels will fare well, or good enough at the box office, even though they may be far inferior films. And sometimes, a sequel will be terrible and still do well with audiences. That's okay with the movers and shakers in tinsel town because making money is mostly what making movies is all about.\n\n\"Jaws 3-D\" is in that category of quite bad sequels that nevertheless did quite well at the box office. It may not be too surprising, considering the subject matter and the enduring aura from the original film, just eight years earlier. And, to some extent, considering some intrigue and enjoyment from \"Jaws 2\" in 1978. Maybe the 3-D angle was the biggest push for making a second sequel. But this film fails in all aspects except a couple of scenes with the shark.\n\nIf that were the only reason for watching this film, and the rest of the script could be trashed, it might score a 5. But the acting by everyone in this cast is horrible. It ranges from the melodramatic to the infantile to the forced and amateurish. The script is terrible. The idea for the plot is okay, but the screenplay just doesn't build an aura of suspense and worry about where the beast will strike or appear.\n\nEnough said. This is a very forgettable film. As bad as this one is for intrigue, characters and acting, Hollywood yet did one more - looking at the box office from this one. But \"Jaws 4\" in 1987 did not recover its budget in the U.S. and just earned a little worldwide. That probably put an end to the efforts to try to capitalize on a singular fantastic fright movie from 1973. Many of us who enjoyed the original scary thriller are happy that Hollywood finally has had its fill of great white sharks. How about a giant octopus movie? It's been a few decades since the sci-fi folks at Hollywood made one of those.\n\nHere's the only humorous line in the movie. Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) says to Dr. Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong), \"All right. I'll have my beeper beep your beeper.\""

Jaws 2 was a fun if slightly misguided sequel, that at least gave the people what they wanted: more of the same. Come Jaws 3 and 4, there is nothing left of that classic original. Both are among the worst sequels ever made.\n\nWhile The Revenge is a mostly joyless and incompetently made trash heap, Jaws 3D is a more interesting and bizarre beast. It is one of the worst blockbusters ever produced, but that isn't due to laziness or lack of interest. It's because they tried really hard to make something great and failed so spectacularly!\n\nThe stories are true. The effects are some of the worst ever made for a studio film. The camera is horribly blurred. There are shots that last just long enough to make it awkward. All of this brought on by the insistence of 3D. Topping that, the acting is average at best and the plot is creative but so out of touch with the rest of the series.\n\nIt is a terrible, terrible film. Why 9 out of 10 then? Because Jaws 3 is funnier than most comedies I have ever seen. It is a huge guilty pleasure. Whenever someone asks me what bad films I love, this along with Dungeons and Dragons, and Sleepwalkers are the ones I go to.\n\nIt is laugh a minute and I find such joy whenever watch it. This is helped by the film having some good music (no John Williams but hey) and Richard Mathesons script (which he understandably disowned) working as a blockbuster story that supplies some fun set pieces. Also, if you can actually see this in 3D, I recommend doing so. It's some good optical effects, that just don't work in 2D.\n\nI showed this film to my wife, who can't stand creature features, and she found it to be enjoyable. It isn't a film I recommend unless you enjoy the so bad it's good part of cinema. Personally, it is my favourite of the Jaws sequels. That may not be for its quality, but I had fun regardless."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sequels that slavishly try to recreate the original are often well reviewed but, to my mind, less daring. Enter Jaws 3D. After the darker tone of Jaws 2 which often felt like a TV movie remake of the original, the third Jaws film feels like a fun - sometimes thrilling - blast of Hollywood fun. Cinephiles holding it up to the standard of Spielberg's film are missing the point: this is a popcorn munching thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Perhaps best of all, it genuinely builds a head of dramatic momentum - climaxing in an outrageously fun death scene for Jaws. It's big. It's silly. You can invest in it or laugh along, depending on your mood. And one more thing: the score by Alan Parker is exceptional!"

Jaws 3 had some nice actors, but that's where it ends. Jaws attacking Sea World is a cute Idea but it wasn't executed too well. I have to admit though, that I love to watch all four of the Jaws movies. Some one please explain to me why the newer the Jaws movie the worse the shark looked. The shark in Jaws 3 looked liked it was carved out of oak, it didn't move much it just rammed things. However the part where the shark chases Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong on the dolphins was priceless."

I don't know exactly what year it was filmed but the costuming and the atmosphere is 100% accurate since I am a child of the 80s. I don't understand why these reviews have to be so long. I'm kind of running out of things to say. Wonder if there's going to be a jaws for 2024 and beyond there really should be they should have one every five years at last yay I reached the minimum."

        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up watching all the Jaws films from young & i like the whole franchise of course the first film is the best & the all time classic of the lot but each is good fun in their own way & i like the whole franchise but 1 & 2 are obviously the best.\n\nThis is easy going colourful summertime fun with cheesy bits but all in true 80's fashion so yes this movie has alot of charm & mainly it's very entertaining!!!\n\nLead star Dennis Quaid is a real 80's actor who i saw in Enemy Mine & Innerspace on video growing up & he's decent here as Cheif Brody's now grown-up son Michael.\n\nAnother good 80's actor Louis Gossett Jr (he also starred with Dennis Quaid again in the Awesome sci-fi thriller Enemy Mine) & posh British actor Simon MacCorkindale as professional shark hunter Philip Fitzroyce, a character i actually liked best in this ensemble cast. Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) is another 80's actor that stars & Bess Armstrong who gives the films best performance as Kathryn, Michael's girlfriend that is also a dolphin trainer & marine biologist. Yes, Kathryn Morgan is the strongest character in the movie with her smarts (knowledge) & weariness of how serious the situation is. The weakest actor is John Putch as younger brother Sean Brody, he's pretty corny. I really liked Fitzroyce's right-hand man Jack Tate played by P. H Moriarty, another British fellow & good character. You get the feeling there's a lot of interesting adventurous history with those two missionaries.\n\nI love lots of films that seem to be hated by everyone so that doesn't bother me as in life you like what you like so who cares? & i reCally like the adventure Thriller Jaws 3 & another bonus is we wouldn't have deep blue sea (1999) without Jaws 3 as there's so many similar bits & shots it's like Deep Blue Sea is a distant cousin sequel or exists in the same universe their both too similar.\n\nJaws 3 is just so much fun well it's the most B-movie of the franchise but the most fun of the franchise & full of summertime adventure with the best music of the franchise & a real sense of wonder & adventure plus it also boasts the most sinister & most terrifying kill from the massive shark in the whole franchise yes that's right the disturbing death of the British Shark hunter when he's in it's massive jaws & he's still alive but the shark just keeps him there crushing him but not chewing him it's as if this shark is pure evil & is torturing this guy & the camera view from inside it's jaws & seeing the light outside it's mouth & he's reaching out to it is truly terrifying so yeah there's alot to like in Jaws 3 & it's probably my fave after the classic original.\n\nThe under water cinematography is stunning in Jaws 3.\n\nAlso Jaws 3 fits in nicely with the slasher boom of that time as Jaws 3 often looks & feels like a teen slasher as the big evil shark is stalking it's victims within the Sea World amusement park & picking them off one by one is brutal ways it's got that slasher formula in a way & it works perfectly.\n\nI've always loved Jaws 3 & just like I've always loved Halloween 3:season of the witch (1982) another cult classic sequel in another famous franchise & it was hated on for years but finally it's been seen as a great stand alone film & maybe Jaws 3 will receive that fan base one day? Anyway i love it.\n\nI love the sea life centre adventure park setting & the characters are all good especially a young Dennis Quaid & the always cool Louis Gossett Jr so the cast is nice & the movie has a real exciting sense of fun & Horror with some memorable classic moments such as the shark attacking the under water dome attraction with everyone running & screaming it's real B-movie Horror fun.\n\nI know it's not as good & well made as Jaws 2 but there's a charm to Jaws 3 that i genuinely enjoy & like i said the Amusement park setting is great & the music score is Fantastic again & the silly fake ropey \"3D\" fx just add to the pure 80's fun of it & it only adds to it's dated charm!!!!\n\nJaws 3 to me is the most fun of the franchise it's not the best made or best acted but the most fun & like i said a nice new setting is appreciated.\n\nI don't understand all the hate for this movie? Of course it's not Spielberg again but it's a fun follow up in the series & i have fond memories of watching this & always will love it & yes that's probably my Nostalgia talking but hey all these films was apart of my childhood growing up as we all know Jaws was a phenomenon & an iconic bit of pop culture so these movies was always around on t.v & in video stores so yeah i love the whole franchise but Spielbergs 1975 original is the masterpiece but the others are all great sequels & 3 is most fun.\n\nA pure fun Summer monster movie & one that's ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable & a colourful exciting summertime romp.\n\nMy personal favourite after the classic original & i know it's not as well made as even Jaws 2 but part 3 like I've said is so much fun & a perfect summertime movie.\n\nJaws 3 is a Nostalgia filled pure 80's fun fest."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite what a lot of reviewers have said over the years, JAWS 3 is really not that bad.\n\nIs it as good as JAWS? Not a chance. Better then JAWS 2? No way. Is it as ridiculous as JAWS: THE REVENGE? Nope. Not at all\n\nThe premise for the film is pretty solid and interesting. Two sharks enter Sea World without anyone knowing. And of course, bloodshed ensues.\n\nThis movie is famously known for being the most violent out of the four JAWS movies. And it is. The acting is not as good as in the previous two films. It wasn't the worst acting I have seen in a movie. it was decent. And believable. I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jnr and Lea Thompson did a great job. The rest were fairly decent.\n\nThis movie came out at a time when 3D was all the rage and it shows. I grew up with this movie on VHS and never got the chance to see it in 3D until it came out on Blu-Ray. Even then, the 3D effects were not that good. Thats really the only issue I had with the movie. The special effects were not that great. It was great to see the mechanical shark when you actually saw it, though most of it was seen in pretty dark water. And it was mostly its head.\n\nOther then the dodgy effects, this movie is not half bad. Its an entertaining movie when you are having a JAWS marathon. It is not as bad as JAWS: THE REVENGE, despite what some people say. It is a decent enough of a movie to sit back and chill with your family or mates and kill some time for 90 or so minutes. This movie is still better then a lot of the shark movies made now days on the cheap. If you like the previous two JAWS movies, then you should really watch this one. It does go for something different and takes you away from Amity Island and the beaches"

He arrives his younger brother Sean Brody, but again sharks terrorize the giant park and cause many casualties. Will Mike succeed in stopping the malignant shark ??? Jaws 3D sequel is pretty good but not as good as two of its predecessor films are Jaws (1975) and Jaws 2 (1978).

Had the movie Jaws 3 NOT been tied to Jaws ... say they named the movie \"Seaworld Supershark\" ... then the high expectations wouldn't have been there and the movie may have been better remembered and reviewed.\n\nAs you watch Jaws 3 try to watch it as JUST a movie ... not as a sequel but as its own unique film and you may have a higher opinion of it!"

Mike works for Seaworld and has a girlfriend that works there too, Dr. Kathryn 'Kay' Morgan. There is a great white shark that Kay gets the idea to capture to show off, help the park make some money from the shark attraction. But what they don't know is Jaws is close by and will wreak havoc in the park... it's up to Kay and Mike to stop her.\n\nThe big problem I found with the story was Sean was sorta there and then written out of it suddenly. I think there should have been more focus on the two brothers all these years later fighting another mammoth-sized great white shark instead of Sean being \"kick out\" of the film and left with Kay and Mike to fight her.\n\nStill worth a looksy if you want some mindless but fun entertainment.\n\n5.5/10"

Lets just get this straight, no sequel was ever going to beat Jaws, especially without Spielberg. Jaws 3 doesnt come close at all but it is certainly better than most people say it is. Its kind of a guilty pleasure.\n\nThe story is trying something new. Its moved away from Amity Island and put the shark in Sea World. Yes, it does sound a little bit dumb but its also kind of campish fun. Atleast, it didnt keep taking place on Amity Island.\n\nThe acting is pretty much sub par. Dennis Quaid is the only one to do a passable job. Louis Gossett Jr. is adequate but the rest of the people are flat. The acting is not a strength but this film isnt about acting.\n\nJaws 3 is enjoyable. It lacks the suspense and tension of the first film and even the second one. But this is campy fun. However, the complaint I have is the ending. The scene with the shark coming towards the glass. With today's modern technology that might not be a bad scene. Yet its completely laughable. Even in 3-D it would have been excellent. Its a joke here. This film might not be great but it certainly is better than most say."

This is obviously a progression too far for some, who obviously wanted to see another chief Brody movie, set on a beach and arguing with a mayor about whether there is a shark or not. What is interesting is that the newly released Meg seems to borrow heavily from Jaws 3D and the Meg was a remarkable success... What this movie adds to the first are better effects in 3D, a more complex story line, more action and arguably bigger stars, while still using some of the same elements which made the first movies so popular. There are other Jaws movies apart from the first two, don't let other people put you off a decent film because they dont like progress...."
