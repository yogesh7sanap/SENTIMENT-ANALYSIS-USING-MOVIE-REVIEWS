        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up watching the 80's version of the chipmunks, so when I first saw the trailer to this predictable but cute live-action update, I was somewhat happy. Although I knew that the humor would be targeted at a crowd under 10 years old, I still wanted to see it, especially since the 1980's animated film THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is still one of my all-time favorite animated films.\n\nTHE PROS: Well I went and saw it, and my expectations were met. It was more for younger kids, but it was throughly enjoyable. It was good to hear the Chipmunks sing their classic Christmas song, there were plenty of funny (but not hilarious) moments, and the Chipmunks themselves were well-animated and undeniably adorable (particularly Theodore).\n\nTHE CONS: The story is predictable (although typical for most kid's films nowadays). Jason Lee is badly miscast as the Chipmunks' long-suffering songwriter and adopted father, David Seville. Also the \"romance\" between Dave and his neighbor is too clich\u00e9d. We don't need some sort of love story in every single film in my opinion.\n\nOverall, there is nothing brilliant about this film, but it's still fun. It ought to please young children and their parents.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It's no Citizen Kane, but it's more fun than a Hula Hoop."

Right before their 50th birthday they make another appearance, this time on the cinema screen in a film that just like Garfield (2004) combines live actors and computer graphics. The story of the film is no new one: a guy becomes the more or less unwilling host to the chipmunks as their tree is demolished and together they roll from one adventure into the other.\n\nFor the rest there is not much to tell about this film. It is worked out well enough and most kids will enjoy it. I know the one I watched it with did. It isn't half bad for the adults either. Graphics have been done well enough and the actors work with it well enough to make a nicely working film. Storyline is rather straightforward and very predictable, but not really to the point of being irritating.\n\nAll in all, typical children's film that works out well enough for the younger audience and that doesn't put the parents to sleep right from the start 6 out of 10 chipmunks singing"

Also, once again a movie with a loser \"dad\" character and some very bad children (okay, they are chipmunks but behave just as children as they are kids) like Daddy Day Camp and others? Actually, the chipmunks make all the difference and save the movie. What does not work with Garfield (warm Hollywood-emotions and the animal as a fast rock star-type) works perfectly with the chipmunks. Also their animation is never off-setting as it quite often was with Garfield. And even after almost 50 years, it still makes you smile to hear them singing. When you watch the trailer you can see that poo-eating part which I see is in the movie just to bring in that type of audience - I think it is a bad idea as it makes others think twice before buying ticket for this movie which has only one fart joke and this poo joke of this type of \"humour\". Otherwise it is watchable and the animated characters are even lovable (Jason Lee is not so great in this). It was a fun travel back in the time when I watched them as a child. Not a big movie, also there are problems with the pacing but it's much better than expected."

And this is one of those instances where cartoon is better as cartoon in 30 minute segments rather than a 90 minute CGI. Just like with the movie Garfield, the movie doesn't do anybody justice.\n\nI guess the creators thought it would be cute for the Chipmunks to sing lots of popular music numbers created within the last 10 years. But I found nothing amusing with the destruction of songs I knew. Nor did I really feel there was any character development between Dave and his love interest. And where were the Chipettes?\n\nThe plot was corny and unbelievable. Somehow for the Chipmunks to attain such success rather quickly is just Hollywood interpreting life in an highly unrealistic way. Not only that, but it felt too superficial and boring. I wish kids would watch something else than this waste of time. \"F\""

But once there I was not bored and there seemed to be a crowd that apparently was expecting a treat of some kind as several appeared to be veterans of earlier showings who had then gone out and grabbed their posse to watch it again (only with them this time).\n\nNice way to spend a Saturday with the kids and grab a laugh or three. Anyway, I'll give it a thumbs up!"

Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film. If you feel you must see this film, rent it, at the most. It is NOT worth eight bucks to see it in theaters, unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting."

Now, having seen the film more than once, sometimes unwillingly I must admit, I would say that it is an okay movie for kids, but that is it, nothing more.\n\nIt follows the lovable story of Alvin, Theodore, and Simon, which has been around for quite a while, it is just less lovable as a big screen motion picture. When I started watching this movie, I immediately assumed it was going to be really good, because I do have to admit I kind of loved the old cartoons, what I saw of them at least, and was expecting that love to contribute to my viewing of the movie. I was actually sort of disappointed with what kind of film it turned out to be. Yes, of course kids would love this film and maybe some adults would like it, because it was a cute film, but, I would say it is definitely and never should be called great for the plain and simple fact that they tried way too hard at times with crappy jokes and humorless antics that the chipmunks I knew and loved from the TV series were a bit annoying.\n\nThere were a few laughs, well, chuckles really, and I certainly was intrigued by the story plot, but overall I think there were a lot of things that could be changed, like how at the start of the film no one seems to notice the chipmunks running across the building floor and hopping into the muffin basket. I mean, they are small but not that small, and plenty of other things I could tell as well, such as the humorless antics I mentioned earlier, in example, toilet humor, which is sad that that seems to be a big gimmick in children films today, but I would rather not have to make this a spoiler comment by continuing to express my likes and dislikes of the film in full detail to the point where everyone is drooling a little; I'm sure by this point you have either agreed or disagreed with everything I have said.\n\nWell, show this to your kids because they will laugh their butts off, but as for adults and teenagers I would say to expect the unexpected which could be anywhere from you liking this movie as the kiddie film it is, to thinking it was just okay and being mildly entertained, maybe even disappointed if you are a really big fan of the old cartoon series."

Alvin and the chipmunks are supposed to be funny and cute, and someone needs to let this film in on that little secret. The acting was bad from lead Jason Lee, I feel like he didn't even try, which I can kinda understand, based on the material he was given to work with. If you wanna sit down with your young children to watch this, then they might enjoy it, young meaning like the 2-5 range, but anyone older is probably gonna be bored or annoyed. The chipmunks singing wasn't even that fun or entertaining either, once again, it was uninteresting and just downright bland. Sorry, but unfortunately the filmmakers behind Alvin and the chipmunks wasted the potential of what could've been an amusing film, instead they went for dumb and annoying and bland. Yep that basically sums it up for Alvin and the chipmunks, and dear god I haven't even seen the many sequels. Do we really need soo many chipmunk movies?? Do we? How about we give sequels to movies that actually deserve them. 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "When the box office figures for the US came in this weekend I was absolutely horrified! Sure I expected I Am Legend to do well, but the amount that Alvin and the Chipmunks got ($40+ million!) seemed absurd. Added to that the fact that it had earned more than Golden Compass did in its opening weekend just seemed ludicrous. The trailers I had seen seemed very mediocre and I wasn't looking forward to seeing it that much. So what a surprise, and a delightful one, to say how much I really enjoyed the movie. Sure its a kids movie through and through, and if you're not into talking animals then you will come out of this movie and criticise its plot, script and usual more adult things that critics criticise about. But if you go in willing to sit back and enjoy the movie you will realise there is a lot to enjoy. The three leads themselves, Alvin, Simon and Theodore if you've never seen the Chipmunks before, are all very likable and have some hilarious moments. The movie features consistent humour that ranges from fart jokes for kids, to some really subtle references, most notably one to Die Hard where for one moment I thought Alvin was going to complete his Yipee Kiyay moment and make the parents gasp in horror, he doesn't so don't get too excited. The script itself is pretty decent, there are the obligatory clunky sentimental bits, but generally the movie is consistent and full of laughs. It does outstay its welcome admittedly and feels that little bit too long, but these are mere quibbles as this is a movie that is bound to entertain many kids and adults alike, and the fact this did better than Golden Compass no longer frustrates me, as this is admittedly a much better movie than Golden Compass.\n\nThe three leads of the movies are CGI creations, they are also surprisingly voice by Justin Long (Alvin), Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon) and Jesse McCartney (Theodore), though you'd never know as obviously their voices have been morphed so they sound much more like the Chimpunks. Anyway their voices sound perfect, Theodore's being the most distinct and will make many audiences world wide sit their and go awww. Alvin is a great lead and has some brilliant moments. Simon is the most dull of the three but has some pretty funny moments as well. But its when the three start singing the movie just comes to life, the Chimpunks Christmas song definitely gave the older members of the audience to relish in, and their rendition of Funky Town is by far the highlight of the movie. The actual adult cast themselves are pretty decent. Jason Lee, from My Name is Earl, is a decent enough lead and at least does better than the adult actors in Garfield who seem almost asleep. When the sentimental stuff kicks in admittedly he does stumble a little bit, but generally Lee is on top form and definitely isn't always overshadowed by the chipmunks. David Cross does the traditional villain role pretty well, although he does start to irritate after a while and when he goes into pure evil mode later on in the film he just seems a bit silly. But by far the worst character in the movie has to be Claire, played by Cameron Richardson, she is out of place in this movie and the romance thing never plays off at all.\n\nWhere Alvin and the Chimpmunks succeeds where movies such as Garfield and Scooby Doo have failed is the fact it succeeds in the comedy department. Sure the movie has its nostalgia factor, but if it wasn't funny then the movie would be a disaster. Thankfully this is a very funny movie. The fart jokes are obviously aimed at kids, but thankfully there aren't that many of them, in fact when you compare this to something like Garfield you realise how well the scriptwriters have done keeping this to a minimum. Slapstick is obviously a big part but done very well and there are many set pieces that will please audiences. The songs as I have said are definitely the highlights and as I've said before the Funky Town rendition is just pitch perfect. There are many one liners to be found as well amongst amongst some of the clunkers that appear later on. The sentimental scenes also are not as horrific as some more recent family movies have been. In fact some of the scenes generally do warm your heart.\n\nOverall Alvin and the Chimpunks is a surprisingly good movie that is definitely something parents should take their kids to see this Christmas. While maybe not as good as Enchanted this is definitely better than Golden Compass, and kids will lap this up. So the obligatory sequel that will arrive seems perhaps a more joyful event then it seemed before I saw this movie. In fact a sequel now seems quite a decent idea."

Suddenly their happy little house is cut down and put up in a work office building as a Christmas tree. There the threesome stumble across a music composer named Dave Seville (Jason Lee) who is forever struggling to impress his boss \u0096 Ian Hawkes (David Cross) who is a monster lurking beneath the surface \u0096 and achieve success.\n\nWhen Dave hears the chipmunks' marvellous singing abilities he agrees to let them live with him in his house. This action immediately sets off a chain of outrageously funny events as the mischievous trio turn Dave's life upside down.\n\nThis charming hour and a half of nicely-done entertainment will be highly enjoyed by young and old. However, for those intending to buy the DVD it may have lost its sparkle the second time round."

But after thinking about it, the chipmunks have been around since the 50's, my generation's chipmunks were a new introduction to us as well as this movie is to the kids of 2007. So my boyfriend and I checked out Alvin and the Chipmunks tonite just to see what it was about and you know what? I think it was cute for what it was. There are flaws here and there about the film, but it was meant for the kids, you have to admit. But the voices and characters are cute and the story works. It's a new story to the chipmunk's tale and adventures.\n\nAlvin, Simon, and Theodore, three singing, talking, and dancing chipmunks have just got their home(a tree, naturally) torn down and they are taken into the city. They jump into a basket being carried by Dave, a failing song writer, and they go home with him. He first shoves them off, but after hearing their singing, he comes up with the idea to write songs for them and see where it goes. They are a success and everything seems to be going very well for them. But until the music business takes advantage of them and tears their family apart, they realize that Dave is really who they need.\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks of course is not the movie of the year, but for a kid's movie, it was very cute. Judging from my generation of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, yeah, it was strange seeing them through what this generation considers cute and fun was a bit silly to me. I wished that they would've focused more on the building of the relationship between Dave and the boys, but I guess that might leave room for a sequel. Now, if you're looking for Citizen Kane, don't see this movie, if you're just looking for innocent fun and a cute family flick, I think you might enjoy Alvin and the Chipmunks.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A big surprise of this film is that it does nearly everything just right. Good story (just what is needed and nothing more), great casting, and a wealth of fun, catchy chipmunk tunes. \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" engages adult audiences as well as the kids who just can't get enough of those squeaky voices.\n\nThe film separates itself from other kid movies through its 'intangibles'...simple things from the choice of Dave's home (with the clever address of '1958', the year which started it all) to the facetious opening scene with the three chipmunks \"angering a tree\" after they \"had a bad day\".\n\nJason Lee is an outstanding casting choice for Dave Seville, the original Chipmunks guardian/songwriter (and stage-persona of Ross Bagdasarian himself). As Dave, Lee keeps a plausible rapport with the chipmunks, reminiscent of Joel's rapport with the machine creatures of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", only with the added ability to warm to the chipmunks' charm as a reluctant father might.\n\n\"Chipmunks\" sticks to the ageless themes of the importance of heeding one's parents and of doing what's wise rather than just what feels good at the time. Dave and his Music Producer Ian Hawke (David Cross) both battle for the chipmunks' attention as symbols of good and bad, respectively.\n\nAnother big plus for the film are the chipmunks themselves. Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are given greater character distinction and development in this film than in any other Chipmunks production. The CGI art was balanced enough to convey their moods & expressions but without pervading too much of the rest of the real-world movie.\n\nThe only disappointments were the inevitable ABC (Annoying, Base, Clich\u00e9) kid-movie shticks (e.g., rear end/wedgie references, gas moments, etc.), of which the film has a few early infractions but nothing quite able to dispel the chipmunks' puerile charms or to send adults walking out with rolling eyes.\n\nOutweighing this are the fun, pathos, and music of a classic trio reborn. All in all, young and old alike will all come out wanting talking chipmunk friends of their own."

Also, how much can we really expect when it is a story about 3 singing chipmunks? The delight of the film and what people (my family anyway) want to see is the chipmunks get down and boogie. This movie in my mind accomplished everything and more that it might have set out to accomplish. It is extremely funny at times and also has a few heart felt moments. The overall story was very good. There are some morals taught here and you don't always see that with these types of movies. If you are in for some slapstick chipmunk boogie and rock and roll then check this out. I can almost guarantee you that any kid under 12 will love it and it is still enjoyable for adults."

        "review_detailed_main": "After a month of purposely deciding NOT to watch this movie, I finally decided to humor my friend and see this update on Ross Bagdasarian, Snr.'s, creations from fifty years ago. There were pretty funny scenes when they surprised Dave in the beginning and a hilarious one when their manager, Ian (David Cross), gave each of them a caffeinated iced drink to give them energy. Other than that, this was a mostly by-the-numbers story of the pressures of success and the toll it takes on your health. In fact, the climatic scene when the rodent music group is revealed to be lip-syncing to their own vocals (because of their now-hoarse voices) seems aimed at those who go for such acts like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson instead of real musicians who play genuine music (though I don't consider what David Seville-Jason Lee-had auditioned initially for Ian authentic either). It's obvious that Lee (\"My Name Is Earl\") and Cross (\"Arrested Development\") took these roles for a large paycheck though Lee, at least, grows on you after a while. The music performances of the Chipmunks themselves are variable depending on whether you like any of the songs they sing here or the way their voices completely dominate though I admit liking their performance of \"Only You\", \"Funkytown\", and, of course, \"The Chipmunk Song\", and even the updated version of \"Witch Doctor\" (though I prefer the original recordings). Not bad for a reboot though for my money, I think I'd love to see the original version for television from the '50s, \"The Alvin Show\". P.S. What a treat to see the original album covers of The Chipmunks over the years during the end credits."

He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.\n\nI didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit. If it weren't basically the only family film I could take my son to around Christmas, my wife and I wouldn't have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker I thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.\n\nI'm not kidding. It's putrid. Only David Cross's terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.\n\nThe story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent \"Curious George\" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to \"update\" the Chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. It does not work.\n\nThe chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. These chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.\n\nEither as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. The final straw? My son couldn't wait to leave. Spend your money renting Curious George instead."

Kids would probably like the cuteness of them and even end up buying stuff animals of them. Not surprising.\n\nThe story is simple, it does remind me of the Garfield movies' plot. I then remember that the director did direct Garfield 2. I have to admit that the chipmunks are cute and that may draw kids/children to watch it. I do like some of their songs but hearing them sing got me a bit of headache. I am surprised that the cute singing of the chipmunks could match it. The director did a good job for that. Chipmunks are going to become real celebrities as children will buy the cute stuff toys and the soundtrack of the movie.\n\nOverall: It is a movie that kids/children and adults can enjoy. Depending on your taste of the chipmunks. The story may be simple but kids will like the appeal of the chipmunks. It does have some funny scenes, cute chipmunks and songs. That will probably be the appeal of this movie. Your choice. If you like cute animals talking in their squeaky voice, you will like this one. If you can't stand their squeaky voice, this will probably not be an interest to you."

Given that the Chipmunks were not only talking Chipmunks, any parent of small children could appreciate Dave's trouble with them.\n\nThe use of popular music was wise and my 8 year old was excited to know the songs. We actually have bought the sound track for long car rides.\n\nI did loose interest about 3/4 of the way through and was hoping the story would wrap up.

I wasn't wowed over by Alvin and the Chipmunks, but it was a cute and harmless film. Same goes for its recent sequel.\n\nStarting with the pros of Alvin and the Chipmunks, the production values are great. The photography and editing are decent enough, the locations are striking and the animation on the chipmunks is very good. The chipmunks themselves are adorable, especially Theodore, not only by their appearances which epitomises cuteness but also their voices which are not too irritating. The soundtrack is quite catchy as well, the film bounces along quite nicely, Hill's direction is satisfactory and there are a number of funny and cute moments even if these moments are never more than hilarious.\n\nHowever, it does have its shortcomings. The story is rather predictable, as it can be with these animated/live action adaptations, and there are some clich\u00e9d subplots and characters such as David's romance with his neighbour. Some of the script is weak with some of the jokes falling flat, and I do agree Jason Lee is miscast as David looking rather ill at ease.\n\nAll in all, cute and harmless entertainment but it is also unexceptional in the story especially. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too. She's 4 - she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. Perhaps it took on too serious a tone - the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death. Something happened, anyway, and it wasn't for the better.\n\nOf course, the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) began. Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and got their start. The movie is updated to the present time, although their real origin is noted by Dave's street address of 1958, which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job as Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be blunt, and I couldn't figure out the point of the character of Claire, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can watch with the kids - it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids, in fact. It gets a 4/10 from me."

They must find a new home and they end up at Dave's house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave's house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.\n\n(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of \"Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!\" and Alvin would say \"OooooK!!!\" Those two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I know your child will, because it is a fun movie.

Yes, the plot is tacky and predictable and David Cross overacted his \"evil\" role, but the overall experience left us smiling once the credits started to roll.\n\nSo... why did we like this? The answer is the result of several factors, the most important one being nostalgia. If you were a child in the 1980's, there was no way you could miss out on Alvin and the Chipmunks, the hit animated series. The real-life version succeeds in being very similar - both in substance and in style - to the nostalgic show. Furthermore, another major point that contributed to this film's success (in my opinion) are the Chipmunks themselves (Alvin, Simon and Theodor) that are cuter and more adorable than ever in their CGI versions. Kudos to the animation department on that one.\n\nAll in all, there are better and more successful family films out there, and Alvin and the Chipmunks is certainly far from being a deep and meaningful film that you'll want to cherish throughout the years. However, the good thing about it is - it never intended to become a classic. Instead, it sticks at what its good at being - harmful, entertaining fluff for kids and for adults who've watched the show.\n\nI gave it 7 out of 10."

Of course he hasn't a clue what to write for the next track but three irritating chipmunks named Theodore(the cute fat one voiced by singer Jesse McCarthey),Simon(the geeky one with the glasses voiced by Micheal Gray)and finally the leader Alvin(voiced by Justin Long who mind you was great at the fast forward voice over for Alvin). All three of them help Dave with his songs and the manager for some record company wants to have the chipmunks for himself so that they will earn a living.\n\nThe whole film was so stupid and annoying yet some parts were funny. The three annoying chipmunks almost gave me a migraine as I wanted to turn off the TV but I said to myself right I am going to give it a chance.\n\nFor the film im giving it a 2 and for everything else 1/10.\n\nThis is strictly for kids who like cute talking animals."

        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up with the cute cartoon of 'Alvin and the Chipmunks', and I was pleasantly surprised to see a live-action version of this movie come out in 2008. Dave was far more mild-mannered in the 80s cartoon series from memory, but Jason Lee's hoarse but amicable version of Dave suited this movie. He held his own against the CGI chipmunks, and of course, who doesn't love Theodore? The live action version of this movie is like the cartoon- cute! It beats the embarrassingly bad Garfield movie, where Breckin Meyer just didn't hold his own to a CGI Garfield. I think 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is on par with the 'Scooby Doo' movies, although Lee doesn't quite pull Lillard's great impression of Shaggy. However, Jason Lee is great as Dave, and he does the father figure thing so well, so I warmed up to his interactions with Alvin, Simon and Theodore.\n\nI had no idea who did the voice-work, because of obvious altercations, but Justin Long as Alvin is commendable. Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney had Simon and Theodore's voices nailed respectively. David Cross also adds to this movie as scrupulous agent, Ian Hawke, who uses the chipmunks tirelessly for his own personal gain. Not quite a memorable villain, but he does well as the slimy producer guy, and has some funny lines.\n\nThe best thing about 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is that it doesn't overdo the singing, and that works for me. It's a cute kid's film that will appeal to people who remember the show, but will also appeal to a younger generation.\n\n***\u00bd out of *****!"

The movie itself is pretty funny, I thought it would be a tacky movie aimed at the 5-10 year old age bracket, but after seeing it myself, I would place it in the any age bracket. As you can see these most common misconceptions that I share with most of you (Most probably) were proved wrong. If you have a bit of spare time, I suggest encourage you to go along and see it. I enjoyed it, and I would definitely watch it again. Full credit to Tim Hill for directing such a good movie, Two thumbs from me."

I don't think that any other kids movie really compare to this one. It was pretty entertaining. It was pretty cute, and enjoyable. The acting played by Jason Lee who took care of the chipmunks was pretty good. It is not very easy to play a part where you have to talk to chipmunks. So I think that you have to give him credit for the most part. This movie didn't have any bad language or anything bad for children. It's the perfect family kids movie to see. The story was a little bit plain and boring. I thought the direction was very good. Some of the message were stating that you should do anything for family. When I left the theatres I said to myself I will rent that and see it more. Overall rent this movie and give it a chance it was pretty good. Their were very many scenes to laugh at. Have fun and enjoy this family movie."

I am glad to say this is not one of those.\n\nOne thing I notice myself doing a lot is laughing. There's a lot of giggle moments and a few laugh out loud moments especially involving Theodore. Alvin plays just the same as I remember from my kid-dom days as being a furry version of Dennis the Menace. Simon however seems more like a semi smarter but not smart chipmunk how I remember him being more of a rodent Einstein. Perhaps thats just my own mis-perception. Which brings to mind Dave. I think he is not only the worst portrayed but also worst actor chosen for the role. This isn't Jason Lees fault as much the casting director, for he struggles to play the role, but is just totally wrong for it.\n\nThe movie does emphasize one major fact and thats how Hollywood pretty much destroys everything for a quick buck, which is kinda ironic considering the movie is a remake of an old franchise which personally would have been happy being left in the past for old time nostalgia.\n\nOverall the movie is a good adaptation of an old classic franchise which personally I loved watching and unexpectedly swooned at the beginning of the movie when they sing their Christmas Special original (for those of us who remember.) I especially recommend this for parents wishing to share their past with a modern present which will be enjoyed by the modern era of children.\n\nIm glad to see my expectations were far bested, by a job well done, despite its what seems like fatal flaws, down shadowed by excellent acting by all involved.

Growing up on these movies as a kid, I tried my best to go in with an open mind, which proved to be surprisingly easy considering I remembered next to nothing about what was going on in this film- and after seeing it, I still don't quite understand what went on. The film is needless to say about talking CGI chipmunks for who whatever reason can talk and sing and begin a music career in the most generic rock biopic sort of fashion. It has its charming moments before all this occurs, but most of that lands in the so bad and campy its fun sort of feel, and nothing about this movie seems to screamed they really tried. The acting in this film is just atrocious at times, and i'm not surprised every single actor who appeared in this film had their careers flushed down the toilet afterwards. I hate to say it, but some of the songs do prove to be catchy, especially \"How We Roll\" and the film is pretty entertaining, even if it's painful to watch at times. In the end, Alvin and the Chipmunks is nothing i'd ever watch again, but I liked it better than I expected to. Its cheesy, formulaic, and mind-numbing but it does manage to have some charm to it from time to time. It won't be anything memorable or mind blowing, but it is a film about talking chipmunks so I guess what do you expect?\n\nMy Rating: 4.7/10."

This movie tells of how Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney) came to meet Dave (Jason Lee), turn his life upside down, then subsequently change his life for the better.\n\nWhen the three chipmunks were taken in by Dave everything they did turned into a disaster, and that's what irked me. They destroyed his house, got him fired, and ruined a potential romantic reunification all within days of moving in with Dave. I was openly saying that I probably would've euthanised all of them. This same extreme scenario in a cartoon doesn't cause the same amount of grief for the viewer. In a cartoon the outlandish and the ludicrous are expected, so you roll with it. In one scene a place can look like a nuclear holocaust occurred and in the next scene everything can be right back in order with no problem. If the same thing happens in a live action movie it triggers a different response.\n\nThe saving grace of this film is how quickly Alvin, Simon, and Theodore end up being a lifeline for Dave who was a struggling songwriter. After first humiliating Dave by not performing upon request, they went on to resuscitate Dave's career. When the chipmunks performed his songs for music exec Ian (David Cross) all was right with the world. But when Ian wanted to milk the chipmunks for all they had with endless performances and commercials, Dave had to come to the rescue."

These are no ordinary little animated characters however \u0096 they sing and they talk. So our intrepid musician writes their songs and gives them shelter. The Chipmunks are a huge hit \u0096 America loves them. But can Dave protect them from being exploited by ruthless, greedy men?

He was just so hopelessly dull and one dimensional that after about 15 minutes, the cute factor of the chipmunks could no longer satiate my want of solid acting. However, you're hearing this from a 17 year old who went (on free will, I'll admit) to see it with a 9 year, who when I asked what she thought of the movie, said it was 'great!'. I went, just like the rest of moviegoers, due to a brilliant marketing campaign, that was greatly helped by the cuteness, and familiarity of 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' for the older audiences (maybe even the parents, who remember the cartoon version). Come on, who wouldn't want to see a parody of 'Bad Day', the most annoyingly over played song of last year? So I'm confounded as to what to rate this movie. Put simply, kids will love it, the parents might want to fall asleep, and call it day (they will however have to put on a smile when it finishes). I was sitting at the far right of the movie theatre, and thought to myself on several occasions how nice it was that I had a wall to rest my head on, so that I could go to sleep. Anyone's attention span that might get bored of chipmunks, I forewarn you, the acting will NOT be something to lean on; you will have to find the chipmunks amusing, sorry."

        "review_detailed_main": "6 April 2008. Alvin in the contemporary age, taking two of the original Alvin songs and seamlessly incorporating them into the update. This new adapted version from the television original maintains the faithfulness of the key elements of the Chimpmunks over time. Unfortunately the rather predictable, though decent plot, also fused the Chimpmunk characters, Alvin, Theodore, and Simon whose characters weren't quite as richly distinctive as they could have been. This animated movie was nicely accomplished with it technical effects and avoided all of the cheesy moments and instead actually promoted a more compelling humorous animated action. It had a good message and handled its subject matter with care and sensitivity. Seven out of Ten Stars."

It is aimed at youngsters and those grownups who are amused by singing chipmunks. The film tries to be heartwarming but would have benefited from more laughs. The story is predictable and plays like a TV movie. Lee is likable if bland as the guy who adopts the furry creatures. The CGI-generated chipmunks are pretty good, although it's sometimes a little hard to understand what they are saying. Cross is a goofy villain. A similar theme is utilized in another recent film, \"Ratatouille,\" which is much better than this lame comedy."

Jason Lee does a decent job as Dave and the actor's who did the voices for Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, were pretty good.\n\nThe CGI Animation was also good. I also liked how they had some of the song's because I was a fan of the Chipmunks when I was little.\n\nBad: Everything else was boring. Even though I had a few chuckles here and there, I was bored. Also, why have David Cross as the bad guy? Why?\n\nThis film is strictly for kids and not for any fan of, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\"."

And when it started singing, would you not be a little concerned? The nice thing to do would be steal their talent for money, THEY ARE CHIPMONKS!

        "review_title": "Low expectations + better than expected story = decent flick",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hybrid live-action + computer animated flicks have a quite spotty box office record. Tim Hill, the director of 2006's \"Garfield: Tale of Two Kitties\", knows this very well. That movie tanked domestically, just like the first \"Garfield\" did. The main culprit, of course, isn't the realistic looking blending of computer created characters in a live action world. It's downfall was a tepid, one-dimensional storyline pandering to only the pre-K audience.\n\nHopefully, Hill has learned his lesson going forth from \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\". What we have here is definitely no savior of the retro-saturated market of anthropomorphized rodentia movies (\"Ratatouille\" takes the gold for the most creative, fresh and cute rodent flick), but it's better than much of its competition.\n\nThe trio of symphonic singing chipmunks, having been displaced from their natural home in a tree in a far-away forest, find themselves in the big city, having been transported in their downed tree to the lobby of a megalomaniacal music company. Seems their home is now a fresh Christmas tree. Knowing their new digs aren't friendly to little forest creatures a fraction the size of the next largest life form, they find refuge in the muffin basket of one Dave Seville, having been rebuked by his friend-turned-multimillionaire music exec, Ian. The pairing of these octave-gifted munks with this lonely, bumbling musician provides the backbone of the movie's plot.\n\nIt's a relief to have been able to laugh along with the rest of the patronage, comprised mostly of pre-teens to freshly post-teens. Granted, I wasn't rolling in the aisles with them, a sign that I must be more critical (and yes, older) than they are. The innocent, brain-resting humor was impeded by a couple factors. Exactly how many potty & poop jokes do we need in a movie these days? By all accounts, we've been shown enough potty pranks to last us well beyond the current Writers Strike (and maybe until the 3d animation folks give the render farms a rest).\n\nThe cast of actors seems a bit wooden, too. True, it's hard to be especially convincing when they are putting on a show in front of a bunch of void space, but I couldn't help but wonder during the first 10 minutes if a giant pin-up of Jason Lee would have been more dimensional than Jason Lee himself. Due credit goes to him though, for putting in a decent performance this side of Jon (Vacant) Arbuckle. David Cross stole the show, though, for his delightfully weaselly turn as the music exec seeing too many $'s in the Chipmunks.\n\nOverall, I'm surprised by how pleased I was when the end credits rolled. If Hollywood has taught me anything with this genre of movies, it's best to go in with very low expectations and be surprised by the lack of suckage put before me.\n\n\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" gets 6 of 10 stars."

This well directed thriller should of been more successful in box office. Another thing that surprises me is that the film didn't win Best Picture in fact the film didn't even go nominated. The films screenplay and dialogue is also amazing it should of won an Oscar for the screenplay. I still can't get over the fact of how great this movie is. Alvin and the Chipmunks is incredibly well constructed and directed and all around a great nay PERFECT film that is most definitely Oscar worthy and even better than The Shawshank Redemption.

Playing slimy record exec Ian, he seduces the Chipmunks into a fancy, happy-go-lucky lifestyle that caters to their every whim. Stick-in-the-mud Dave proferred upon the 'Munks a more conservative, put your money in the bank for a rainy day kind of anti-M.C. Hammer money management philosophy. The 'Munks will have none of it and instead go out a barn burning world tour courtesy of said slimy record exec looking to milk the Chipmunks for all their merchandising worth.\n\nLee appears nearly robotic in his scenes and reluctantly echoes David Sevelles of yore--\"Allllllvvvin!\" For a guy who used to be on the cutting edge of indie comedies, it feels like an awkward casting fit, but perhaps this is what his handlers in Scientology want.\n\nAll this said, the Chipmunks themselves deliver on some pretty good comedic moments. My kids loved them and even us adults got a few amiable yucks out of what is otherwise a bland family movie. I will give the filmmakers' credit for not making them too cutesy, but rather sufficiently anthropomorphic so that we can enjoy them without gagging on the gee aren't they cute chipmunks factor.\n\nThough Dave has a pretty love interest, they keep the family-un-fair double entendres and innuendos down to a bare minimum. You won't need to explain much to your children if they ask.\n\nWorth the investment to go a movie theatre? Probably not unless you get a good matin\u00e9e special where they have popcorn and a coke for $5. Otherwise, the kids can enjoy it on DVD in maybe 3 months."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alvin and the Chipmunks is a VERY famous cartoon musical trio. They were created decades before I was born, but I was 21 when this movie featuring the trio was released, and had been familiar with the anthropomorphic chipmunk characters for most of my life, having seen them in animated cartoons as a kid. The 2004 film adaptation of \"Garfield\" brought the hand drawn character to the CGI format and in a live action world, and this \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" film does just that with these characters. I haven't seen the \"Garfield\" movie in several years, but can still remember its mediocrity, which means I wouldn't want to watch it again. After that, I was not desperate to see this later live action/CGI crossover when it first came out, and after finally seeing it over three years later, it's not too surprising to me how lacklustre it is.\n\nAlvin, Simon, and Theodore are three talking, singing chipmunks who live in a pine tree in a forest, but their lives change when this tree is cut down and taken to Los Angeles with them still in it! Dave Seville is a struggling songwriter in L.A. who is trying to get a song of his published. He presents his latest piece to Ian Hawke, Dave's former college roommate who is now a JETT Records executive, but sadly, he rejects the song. In the building where this happens, the Chipmunks' tree is put up and used as a Christmas tree. As Dave leaves, the Chipmunks jump into a basket he is carrying and are taken back to his house without him even knowing they're with him! When the struggling songwriter discovers them in his house, it isn't long before he puts them outside and refuses to let them back in. However, he is then surprised to hear the three of them sing, so he makes a deal with them. If they sing the songs he writes, he will provide them food and shelter. With the Chipmunks' talent, it looks like they could be the key to Dave's success, but they end up causing more trouble for him!\n\nWhat is probably this film's biggest problem is not a surprising one at all, and that problem is that the darn thing simply isn't very funny. I didn't watch the entire flick with a straight face, and there were very seldom times when I laughed just a little, such as Ian's reaction to Dave's new song near the beginning, but the vast majority of the gags failed to amuse me at all. The Chipmunks cause a lot of trouble for Dave, which is supposed to be good for laughs, but it isn't. There's one part showing Alvin putting what Dave thinks is a piece of chipmunk feces in his mouth to convince Dave that it's actually a raisin, and then spits it out when Dave is not looking! This is even worse than the chipmunk defecation scene in \"Enchanted\" (a film which came out around the same time as this \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" adaptation and seems to be much more popular, but I honestly don't get what's so great about it), and it's making me queasy to talk about it! In addition to the major lack of funniness, the three main characters sing some familiar hit tunes, and generally cheesy ones if you ask me. Alvin and the Chipmunks certainly don't make these songs sound any better!\n\nEven though I didn't see this \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" live action/CGI adaptation until over three years after I last watched the \"Garfield\" one, I can still compare them, and while both of them are bland, I would say that this one is slightly worse than the other. Both films are supposed to be comedies and severely lack laughs, but at least the \"Garfield\" movie doesn't have anything like the chipmunk excrement gag here! Well, I'm sure many would say these two movies are strictly for kids, and both of them were made years after my childhood ended, so maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I guess both films could have far more appeal to kids than adults, though 2007's \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" may have more adult fans than 2004's \"Garfield\", so many could disagree with my opinion on it. Still, I most certainly don't suggest people watch this movie expecting it to be great entertainment for the whole family, nor should viewers expect it to be 100% clean. It spawned a sequel called \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\" in 2009, and you can be sure I intend to avoid that follow-up, just like I've continuously avoided \"Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties\"."

I am now an 18 year old Man who is very interested in movies, so when Alvin and the chipmunks came in the theaters i was about 10 years old. And for me and my brother it was an adventure to see that movie. People often forget that there are movies who only exist to entertain kids and not the critical eyes of film interested man who only likes good films for example bird man and so on. This is a movie for kids which is very entertaining and also brings back the wonderful feeling of Christmas in that time. It also learns much about money and friends. I can say that the message of this movie is to stay on the ground and with your family and that you should not go there where the money is. After that movie i became a big fan of the chipmunks. I was surprised that it was that good, my brother and i also always listened to the songs of them. And thats what it about in this movie, its not interesting mystical or something, it is a wonderful entertaining film for kids and the film also contains some good messages.\n\n(Sorry for my bad English, i am Austrian)"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Los Angeles, Advertising executive and struggling songwriter David \"Dave\" Seville (Jason Lee) has once again had his songs rejected by Chief executive of Jett Records, Ian Hawke (David Cross), who claims his songs are awful and no one will sing them. Meanwhile chipmunk brothers Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) end up in Los Angeles after their tree is chopped down and brought to Jett Records' lobby as a Christmas decoration. As Dave leaves Jett dejected, the chipmunks stowaway and end up in Dave's home. When Dave discovers the Chipmunks who reveal they can talk he initially wants nothing to do with them, but changes his mind when the chipmunks reveal they can sing. After initial hurdles in selling the concept to Hawke, the Chipmunks become overnight successes with their hit single \"Christmas Don't Be Late\" as the pop star lifestyle begins to wear them down with the Hawke all too eager to wring all he can from the Chipmunks.\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks is the third incarnation of the franchise that began in 1958 created by Ross Bagdasarian. The series was a massive success in the 1960s before going into hibernation in the 70s due to Bagdassarian's death from a heart attack, and got a resurgence in popularity thanks to Ross Bagdasarian Jr. Reviving the franchise with A Chipmunk Christmas which in turn lead to the NBC Saturday Morning Sitcom that lasted for about 10 years. During the 90s when the NBC series ended, Universal attempted to revive the brand with a VHS release of The Chipmunk Adventure, as well as production of direct-to-video films Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein and Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman in the hopes of tapping into the exploding children's home video market of the time that gave life to many direct-to-video Disney films and Universal's own Land Before Time series. Along with this plan was a live-action adaptation of Alvin and the Chipmunks that would've been directed by none other than Robert Zemeckis after he'd finished with Contact. No information on this incarnation of the project has ever been disclosed, and Zemeckis apparently lost interest in the project and opted instead to film Cast Away and What Lies Beneath instead. Once Zemeckis lost interest so too did Universal and the brand languished under Universal's stewardship with Bagdasarian Jr. Even initially a lawsuit against the company for neglecting the brand and sinking a property that had yielded $4 million annually to a low of about $70,000 (ouch). Eventually Fox acquired the rights to The Chipmunks and made the film with Simpsons writer Jon Vitti and director Tim Hill, and despite a teaser trailer that prominently featured a scene where Alvin eats...\"something\", leading many to assume the film would be awful and bomb. Despite negative buzz, the film managed to score a strong #2 opening in Christmas 2007 and managed to gross $200 million in the United States alone and outgrossing larger budgeted films such as Enchanted, Golden Compass, and Fred Claus. Alvin and the Chipmunks didn't make the best impression with its teaser, but while I don't think the movie is good it's at least not awful.\n\nTo start off on a positive note, the effects used to bring the Chipmunks to life created by now defunct visual effects house Rhythm and Hues Studios are well done. While the Chipmunks don't look perfect, they do look much better than the models used in films like Bill Murray's Garfield movies, Scooby-Doo from those movies, or the model work in Cats & Dogs. While the Chipmunks don't translate seamlessly to live-action with the movie bending over itself pretty clumsily in trying to justify certain elements like why the chipmunks wear their signature outfits, why Simon wears glasses, or why they live with Dave, it does have some genuinely solid work integrating the CG elements with the live-action elements. The Chipmunks personalities are kept mostly intact, especially Theodore whose good natured simplistic innocence is well conveyed in both the model work as well as Jesse McCartney's delivery (who apparently is a fan of the franchise and watched the 80s series for reference). Simon while still identified as the \"smart one\" doesn't feel like he captures the same anchoring/voice of reason role he played in the show or previous films and he feels like he's a little too willing to go along with Alvin's shenanigans in this movie. Alvin I really wasn't a fan of in this movie, while Alvin was a trouble making schemer in the previous incarnations, he was also a caring character who was able to show he really cared about his brothers, Dave, or even random people such as A Chipmunk Christmas were he gives his prized harmonic to a sick child as a Christmas gift. Alvin in the 2007 film feels like he's written to be a chaos engine who's lacking in self awareness and I'm not a fan of these types of characters because it has the consequence of divorcing character from them. Jason Lee is hit and miss as Dave, on the one hand he occasionally has some solid work as a down to earth counterpoint to the Chipmunks, but on the other hand he's not all that adept in the more over the top scenes of slapstick or Dave's trademark \"Alvin!!!\" yell. David Cross on the other hand is really good as antagonist Ian Hawke who sells the sleazy record producer character very well and his delivery on certain lines alone makes them funny. There's also the added question of why we needed \"name\" actors to play the Chipmunks if they're just going to speed up their voices and render them unrecognizable.\n\nIn terms of plot, the movie feels like it's a very middle of the road sitcom. It has sitcom stakes, sitcom dilemmas, a sitcom plot, and while the original Chipmunks TV shows were more or less sitcoms (especially the 80s cartoon) when you put something into film format you're expected to up your game a little in scale and scope (such as The Simpsons movie). The 80s Chipmunk movie The Chipmunk Adventure may have been a very silly jewel smuggling plot, but it was also animated by ex-Disney staff and featured a globetrotting adventure with unique and memorable locales and characters, granted not always for the best (looking at you out of place parody of 1921's The Sheik) but still had clear ambition and effort even if it didn't strictly speaking work. I will say however that Jon Vitti does take this very standard rags to riches/price of fame plot and puts it to good use showing the behind the scenes misery of stardom and the exhaustive indifference of the music industry and there are some scenes that are sweet and kind of funny such as Dave getting Simon some glasses for his poor vision or Theodore sleeping in Dave's bed after he has a nightmare, but those moments are balanced out with some moments that land with a thud or exist solely for creating visual noise. As for the songs it'll be a case of either you like them or you don't, some of the renditions of Chipmunked songs sound perfectly fine, while others are more middling, though admittedly that may just speak to my general dislike of mid 2000s musical trends and how they're incorporated.\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks was the best possible version of this franchise we were going to get given its time of release. The movie isn't great, but it's nowhere near as bad as we thought it was going to be from that awful teaser trailer. It's a movie that plays strictly to young children, whether it does so successfully is a matter of opinion but when you have movies more notorious attempts at children's entertainment I maintain you can do worse."

And I don't mean a good way, the kind where I sit through watching like, what am I even watching. The story is painfully predictable. The humor is mostly unpleasant. The characters get annoying. The editing makes the movie over the top hip. And the big problem I can find is this film serves no purpose. I get that, it's an origin of the chipmunks considering it's based on the cartoon series from the 80s, but there are better ways to make it work by telling a good story rather than being modern and trendy throughout. I know there's late 2000s kids that grew up with this and consider their childhood, so I guess I won't stop them. But even with that and for music fans such as myself, I can't really recommend this much. It's not really worth your time. If you want to watch music movies, there's quite plenty such as Almost Famous and School of Rock. I'll admit it's not the worst live action movie based on a cartoon, but this film is just uncomfortable."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie, it was very funny, had a great story and had everybody's favorite sons, Alvin, Simon and Theodore. I remember watching the Chipmunk cartoon when I was a kid, and loved it, it was great, had lot's of laughs, my favorite was Alvin.\n\nI always compared me and my sisters to the Chipmunks because we used to always have a lot of fun and we used to pretend we were in a band and were famous. Well, I never had a father like David Seville, but I always wanted one, and yes my father did yell at me just like Dave does with Alvin.\n\nI thought Jason Lee was perfect as David Seville, a lot of people didn't think he did an okay job, but I loved him. I liked the reference to My Name is Earl, I thought it was very funny.\n\nI always wondered how Dave hooked up with three chipmunks, and now I know. I thought it was great how the 4 hooked up, and I do remember watching the episode when Uncle Ian showed up, and I wasn't really a fan of him. It got worse when my parents had a boy and named him Ian, and he was always a trouble-maker, still is, lol.\n\nIt was a great movie, wasn't the best, but it was still a good movie to watch. My five yr. old nephew loves the chipmunks and he thought it was very funny, a lot of kids will like this one, but I think pretty much it's a movie the whole family can enjoy. I gave this movie 7 out of ten, because the CG chipmunks were really cute and enjoyable to watch and....well....like they say in their theme song, \"Were the Chipmunks, Alvin, Simon, Theodore...do, do, do, do, do do. Great movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Or at least that's how the theme song of the cartoon series sounded like, dug out from my subconscious. For those, like me, who have grown up in the 80s watching television cartoons like Mask, Transformers, He-Man, there are those which are less action based, such as Peanuts, and of course, Alvin and the Chipmunks, featuring the trio of Alvin, the de-facto ringleader, Simon the smart one (hence the clich\u00e9 glasses) and the greedy Theodore.\n\nWith cartoons from the past being remade into feature length movies, such as Scooby Doo and Garfield, yielding mixed box office results, what about these 3? To begin with, this is not quite like the cartoon series, in that the chipmunks are sized correctly, as with the other adaptations (no more handgun transforming to 50 foot robot), and curiously enough, they didn't need their body length clothes to hide their modesty, just a top coloured in the right way will do. And for Alvin, all is forgiven when the filmmakers finally remembered he sported a cap. Having effects wizardry helped to in bringing to life the trio of chipmunks, down to the last furry detail such as their hairdo.\n\nThose of us who have grown up with the series, will find multiple shades of story lines adapted from the cartoons all meshed into one here. It's a reworked origin story of sorts, so as to bring in a new legion of followers who haven't seen the series on television. Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr almost 50 years ago, to have the characters translate to the big screen, bode well for its longevity, at least from the reaction I got from the kids, they are in love with the singing trio with all the clapping and the dancing along the aisle (yes!) each time they perform in their high pitched voices. I too was tempted to applaud, but that would be too geeky-like for those moments I became a kid again.\n\nJason Lee stars as Dave Seville, the \"father\" of our singing sensation, who finds it a little difficult in trying to warm up to the notion of being family with animals. Having started off the wrong foot, it provided ample opportunity for that iconic scream \"Aaaalviiiiinnnnnnn!!!\", as he finds himself out of a career and with 3 extra mouths to feed. But as rehashed scenes and storyline goes, the Chipmunks soon prove to be taking the USA by storm with their brand of oh-so-cute voices and slick dance moves, that they become superstars in their own right.\n\nYou'll know the drill from here, as dodgy music label producer Ian (David Cross) tries to undermine Dave to pry the cash-cows (heh) from the latter using despicable tactics, giving rise to being the sole adversary with the evil corporation type who's out to exploit and milk the chipmunks for what they're worth. Being a family friendly film, the theme of belonging and err, blood running thicker than water and profits, ring through, though I thought to toddlers, that might not actually matter, but to the parents bringing them to the theatre, then it's a reminder that children do appreciate being loved and having that pat on the back.\n\nJustin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney provided the voices for our lovable chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore respectively, though that didn't really matter in the final end product given that their voices had to be sped up to achieve that chipmunk effect. In fact, you and I could also be reading the lines, and applying the same technique to become chipmunks ourselves. And amongst the three, I dare say Theodore will win new fans in the very manja way it got portrayed. A key scene from the trailer had been reworked, so don't be surprised if you see that deviation - though for once, I thought the trailer version was better and closer to character.\n\nLike the movie says, \"they're talking chipmunks!\" so I feel that given the holiday season, and the tie-in with the movie to the season of good tidings, it may actually bode well for the film. There may be nothing truly new in the antics of the chipmunks, but they will probably still charm your socks off. So before you roll your eyes at yet another talking-animal film, give this one a chance, and I'm quite certain you'll be tapping your feet at the right moments too!\n\nSo hit it again, Alvin, Simon, Theodore! And watch those plush merchandise fly off the shelves in time for X'mas! Stay tuned during the end credit roll which showcased some of the album art from their musical albums of the past."

Together, they set out fame as singers, hoping to make a positive impact in their lives. However, the unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke (David Cross), wants to exploit the Chipmunks, directly breaking up the family in the process.\n\nThe movie does pick up the pace at first when the chipmunks first appear on screen and runs into Seville, ending up being his house mates. The chipmunks' singing were pretty fun to listen to; however, the story's pace looses steam somewhere in the middle, where the chipmunks lose their spunk and let the fame get the best of them. The story basically dragged on from there.\n\nThe voice actors who played the chipmunks did a fine job, but Jason Lee wasn't very good as Seville and clearly wasn't right for the role. I would have liked to see him show more emotion and surprised expressions when he first spots three singing chipmunks (it's not everyday you see three, tiny singing critters). Unfortunately, he showed a disinterest in the role and lacked substance overall.\n\nThis movie has its fun moments, mostly in the beginning, but not a terribly great movie overall. I'll watch this once, and then find something else to spend other Saturday nights with.\n\nGrade C-"

The acting is for children as well, so is it a Grammy Award Winner, NO, but, still a fun and loving story! My son is 4.5yrs old and he absolutely loved it!! He was laughing, and jumping around, and totally thrilled about the movie! It doesn't have to have superheros, and violence to be a good enjoyable film for kids to be interested in! The chipmunks are fun, mischievous, and teach Dave a lesson he will not soon forget! :) Watch it with your kids and ENJOY!!! :) My son can't get enough! lol!"

After that this site has asked me to elaborate on my feeling's fine (it's my first post here so rookie mistake) I believe that the exclusion of that particular album was a attack country music in general. And at this point they want ten line's of text fine. It is only a movie about chipmunks with Jason Lee, who happen's to be a way better actor then what ever he was asked to do in this sub par for his standard movie. At this point it's pointless for me to ramble on about it . I tried for ten line's I think I have it ."

Ian played David Cross is a little over the top but this was acceptable to the adults and made it very easy for the youngest kids to understand. The animation of the Chipmunks was great, OK they did not look like real chipmunks but they did not look cartoonish like in Roger Rabbit. The story was reasonable and provided lots of laughs throughout which many 'A' grade comedies fail to do. In conclusion a 'B' grade family move which succeeds 100%'"

This is more a cartoon then the motion capture films of Robert Zemeckis. I mean that as a slap to Zemeckis who's animated creations (Beowulf, Polar Express) have less life than the all CGI Alvin and his brothers. Whats worse is this film with no pretensions and simply a desire to make one laugh is ten time the fun of most of the \"next big thing in movies\". Can you sense I liked this film? Can you sense that maybe, just maybe we have a mindless winner here? Aimed at kids the humor doesn't talk down to them. Oh sure the humor is childish and low brow but I laughed more times than I did at several recent \"good\" comedies (see Superbad). The music is quite good and the characters are appealing. I like how they play with the things we know about the characters for example how Dave writes the Christmas song we all know love and get sick of every year. There is a reason the film has been near the top of the box office since it opened, its funny, and not just for kids since lets face it there are only so many times Mom and Dad will drag the kids to see a bad movie repeatedly."

The parents who bring the kids will find little to no laughs. Did I laugh at the poop joke? Yes. I don't think I was paying attention to the movie. It was more of a shock than funny but I still laughed. One can make fun of Jason Lee doing it for the paycheck but who doesn't. It's not like he's winning an Oscar any time soon. The chipmunks are mostly harmless fun. The music is good initially especially as a Christmas song. Once it goes hip-hop, it gets annoying."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Alvin and the Chipmunks,\" directed by Tim Hill, is a live-action/CGI hybrid film that brings the beloved animated chipmunks into the modern era. Released in 2007, the movie follows the mischievous trio-Alvin, Simon, and Theodore-who find themselves living with struggling songwriter Dave Seville, played by Jason Lee.\n\nThe film's charm lies in its blend of slapstick humor and catchy musical numbers, which pay homage to the original cartoon series while introducing the chipmunks to a new generation. The CGI characters are well-animated, capturing the distinct personalities of each chipmunk, with Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney providing lively voice performances.\n\nWhile the storyline is predictable and caters primarily to a younger audience, it offers enough nostalgic appeal and lighthearted fun to entertain families. Jason Lee delivers a solid performance as the exasperated yet caring Dave, balancing the chaotic antics of the chipmunks.\n\nOverall, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" is a fun, albeit formulaic, family movie. It may not break new ground, but it successfully combines humor and heart, making it an enjoyable watch for fans old and new."

The songs brought back fond memories from when the chipmunks first were introduced to the world. This movie made them seem alive and just as mischievous as in all their past records. It is great to have characters that can be shared across generations. It was good to relax and watch a movie with no sex and violence and especially no vulgar language.

        "review_detailed_main": "Alvin and the Chipmunks is another of those CGI/live-action family films based on a cartoon. This film did look cute and appealing, but beyond that, it had little to offer for me.\n\nThe overall premise is about three singing chipmunks named Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) who lose their tree home and are sent to Los Angeles, California. The three come upon a struggling songwriter named Dave (Jason Lee) who decides to hire them to sing his songs for him. It's cute at first but later becomes troublesome.\n\nSadly, I couldn't really stick my teeth into this kids flick. It was dull and too predictable mainly because of its dry humor. The gags primarily consist handfuls of toilet jokes and destructive mayhem. It isn't such a bad thing for a children's film, but these gags are clich\u00e9d and recycled from other family movies that have already overused these techniques (i.e. farting, making a mess, breaking stuff, getting somebody fired from work). These predictable jokes were used a lot by Alvin and co which bored me and made me find the trio very annoying and unlikeable.\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks is not a disaster, but it's forgettable for grownups alike. I was 16 when I first watched this on TV so maybe I was a bit too old for this stuff. I wouldn't recommend this as your sort of movie if you're over the age of 11, but it's strictly aimed for kids so they will surely enjoy it more. If you have some, give this a rental to keep them busy. \"C-\""

I mean, they look SO real, that, I couldn't even tell if they were CGI!! Same thing with the flawlessly PERFECT Spider-Man franchise!! (Third time's a charm for Spidey.) But, anyway, the acting by whoever played David Seville, (the chipmunks adoptive human father) is great as well. The music is awesome in the movie! The soundtrack brings back childhood memories.

I don't think people appreciate this classic enough, it was part of my childhood and is different from any movie I've ever seen.\n\nThe second movie is at the same level and has an even worse rating. The third and fourth movies are worse but still good in entertaining, I guess not enough people of my generation rated this movie for it to have even close to the rating it deserves."

They messes always and it's fun to look on them. Dave as they live with is always angry and screaming Alvin when Alvin, Theodor and Simon have messed the house and I think it's funny. Now, it has also been a Alvin and the Chipmunks 2.There are good songs in both films but better songs in Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 I think. They are famous all over the world because they are good singers. They have smurf voice and that's right fun. The song I most remember from the first film, Bad Day.The film is for all ages, it's a family film. But I think there are more girls who are watching this movie. But the film is well more a child movie. But I think we older people make jokes in the movie better than what they do younger. It is fun to watch if you have the way several times. For when we make jokes better."

However, unlike the cartoon, these are not ethomophic but are actually real squirrels, obviously they are much smaller than their animated counterpart. So this film was also hated by many people but for me it didn't I find it not bad at all I quite appreciated it because they are quite funny with squirrels Davis' character was done well an excellent Villain is Ian Hawke who wants to use the squirrels to become famous and then the CGI Sometimes it is done well and badly at the same time momentabout the squirrels and then you dub the squirrels or the one that looked like I lifted it blown out of wood from my mouth which was obviously very well done I always defend films based on cartoons however too many people really hated this guy I tell you that I recommend this filmsee it if you are a fan of Alvin Superstar, trust me, but to conclude I rate it 8-"

I am also a big fan of Uncle Ian, one of the mot underrated characters not just in this movie, but in the entire franchise. He is very much the biggest side character, even though I consider him a main character. Simon, on the other hand, deserves to get deomoted to being a side character. My suggestion is to swap Uncle Ian and Simon. But overall a phenominal film, I have seen some bad reviews on this movie, and I cannot stand the blashphemy against Alvin and his shenanigans."

Really, taking cartoons and turning them into real characters? How could that work? Well to say the least, they pulled it off. This movie was cute, entertaining, and funny. While it may have strayed a little from the originals, it still had that chipmunk flair that we know best. I am seventeen, and this movie was awesome. It had everyone in the theater, children, teenagers, and adults alike laughing the whole time. And when the credits rolled, there was applause, something I haven't heard at a movie theater in a long time. Even if you aren't a chipmunk fan, any kid will love it, and you probably will too. For me, this is definitely a 10 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this movie expecting to see something close to GARFIELD (which was a terrible film), but ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS is actually really good! I know. It sounds crazy. Especially coming from a 30 year old. I think Jason Lee is the weakest part of the film. He is funny in some scenes but lame in others. But David Cross is good in every scene he's in. And the movie as a whole is great. It's very funny. And surprisingly emotional. This one is going to go up there with recent comedies with great characters. The story is the perfect one for the remake of the 80s TV show I liked as a kid. It's the origin story about how this guy, David Seville (struggling songwriter, disorganized guy) came to adopt 3 singing chipmunks. David Cross is the music executive who keeps shooting Dave (and his crappy songs) down. Dave has just gotten out of a relationship with a cute girl (don't remember her name, but this plot was totally unnecessary -- the movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to jam in a romance between Dave and this girl, when the real romance of the movie is between Dave and the chipmunks). Dave realizes these talking chipmunks can sing, and that launches the career of the strangest music act ever seen to man. But I'll say it again, the movie is very, very funny. I recommend it to families and even to single people like me who enjoy comedies."

Everything in this movie is just perfect, the animation of the chipmunks, the acting, the story, the joy, and most of all; the way some lines makes you LOL. OK, so far, the total gross of this movie is more than $ 250,000,000 only US and UK which means contradiction, 5.7 and making $ 250,000,000. Just can't get it. Jason Lee was very funny, I'm trying to think of some other actor who would have done better than him... I couldn't find any; he was the only actor for this character. David Cross was the only bad choice; I wish John Travolta had that role."

        "review_detailed_main": "Took my munchkin to see Alvin & The Chipmunks today. Though Jason Lee is boring and David Cross is way over the top, the Chipmunks themselves are awesome. Alvin, voiced by Justin Long AKA the \"Mac\" guy is great! He wasn't as recognizable as Simon, voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler AKA Dr. Spencer Reed from Criminal Minds, who has most of the best lines in the movie. Rounding out the cast is teen popster Jesse McCartney as an adorable Theodore. For those who watched the cartoons as kids, this movie is great nostalgia and definitely how you would have imagined the Chipmunks come to life. The music is pretty cheese, but I still would recommend the movie for anyone who has young kids. The first two shows we attempted to go to sold out while we were in line, so we waited two hours just to see the movie, and weren't disappointed. I wouldn't say this is a must see in the theater, but I would definitely catch it again when it comes out on DVD. The movie attempted an underlying theme of the dangers of fame and it's effect on children, which I thought was interesting given all the child star dramas being played out in the media today. I think they meant it to be a subliminal gift wrapped warning for children to not try to grow up so fast and to listen to their parents because they know what's best for them. I don't know if any of that message will really sink in, but at least the kids will be entertained."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello There AATC Fans!!! 50 years ago when Mr. Ross Bagdasarian Sr. created three little chipmunks, he created a phenomenon. I was born in 1981, so I remember them back 20 years ago. He has done a remarkable and fantastic job in creating these little guys. Jason Lee's portrayal as Dave Seville was just outstanding!!! I've read a lot of comments about the crude jokes and the somewhat sad moments when Dave thought about giving up. Alvin, Simon and Theodore aren't all about crude humor, they're all about recreating a tone that was first heard of in 1958 and again in 1980. in 2007, they were introduced as icons and showed the world that after 50 to 20 years of being exiled, they are back, and better than ever. Parents, PLEASE TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO SEE THIS WONDERFUL FAMILY FILM!!!! I've heard people say, they don't look the same, well I've got news for those people, in 1985, I was a little kid, always looked little even at 8 years old, now I'm 26, I don't look 8, but I still get people not believing me when I tell them I'm that old. The same goes for Alvin, Simon and Theodore, yes, they didn't look boyish, they looked like real chipmunks, but it's still them. Another complaint, is the Chipettes. They were not in this movie, and people were flipping out saying, \"Where's the Chipette's\"!!!! Well, just like I said about the Chipmunks, the Chipettes are still in a vault somewhere, somewhere in exile. But if us moviegoers can spend our money and see the Alvin and the Chipmunks movie over and over and buy it on DVD, then a sequel will be in the works and the Chipettes will return along with Alvin and the Chipmunks. Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and Janice Karman have done a brilliant job in bringing back those little guys. Mr. Bagdasarian Sr. would be proud of his son and would be thrilled to see all of us marvel at his 50 year creation. It's a must-see and must-have. It's a Christmas treat for all who enjoy laughter and entertainment. Enjoy The Movie and Enjoy The Holidays!!! THANK U!!!!"

Based on the 80's cartoon, the story's about three chipmunk brothers who went to live to a music composer with no luck, their lives will change drastically after they start living together. It has some moments that are very funny, some other aren't. The animation is good, not the greatest but good. The music is really good, they used some 80's classics that will make you remember. The cast is decent, Jason Lee in the role of David Seville was OK although it could be better, it was a performance lack of humor, a rare thing on him cause I think he is a great comedian. Cameron Richardson, The Female interest of Dave in the movie, what can I say, she is very beautiful but she doesn't show me that much of an acting. The best one of all the cast was David Cross in the role of Ian, a greedy music manager, was really hilarious. This is an enjoyable movie for the family."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dave (Jason Lee) is an advertising man who secretly longs to be a hit songwriter. He lives in a nice house nested in a beautiful little enclave near LA, with a pretty neighbor named Claire (Cameron Richardson). They once dated but Claire broke it off, feeling Dave was too immature. Meanwhile, three chipmunks have their arboreal abode cut down, with them in it, and shipped to a major recording studio as its Christmas tree. On the day the Dave comes to pitch his songs to the executive of Jett records, Ian (David Cross) and fails to win any approval, Dave picks up a muffin basket and heads home. Guess who is in that little basket? Yes, its Alvin, Simon and Theodore. Soon after, Dave is startled to find three little critters eating his cheese puffs and Lucky Charms. He throws them out in the rain. But, they cheerfully start singing at his window and Dave realizes that they may be the very singing group he needs to promote his songs! Sitting down at the piano, Dave plunks out a new Christmas tune, The Chipmunk Song, and soon Dave and the three darling animals are on their way to success. However, Dave makes the threesome go to bed early and do chores. When this gets annoying, A, S, and Th decide to move in with Ian, who has promised them \"no rules\". But, will the Chipmunks benefit from Ian's guidance? Not likely! Alvin and the Chipmunks is a darling new addition to the holiday movie repertoire. First, the cast is nice, with Jason Lee giving an adorable performance as the harried Dave Seville, and Cross doing a great job, also, as the misguided studio boss. Richardson has a smallish role, which is too bad, for she is lovely and sweet. It would have been nice if the director had put a more obvious romantic encounter (a few kisses?) between Dave and Claire into the picture. Oh, well. As for the chipmunks, they are a computer-generated joy, being very funny, very appealing and very clever. Kids will fall hard for this trio, in my opinion, and want another film somewhere in the future. Then, too, the look of the movie is wonderful, from the nice costumes to the lovely California setting (Dave's house and neighborhood are beautiful) to the art direction. The script, while not totally original, has plenty of fun and frolic. Of course, after the initial Christmas song, the chipmunks get more heavily into \"hip-hop\" style with a syncopated new version of the \"witch doctor\" song, among other tunes. But, that is a minor element in the overall plot development. Mostly, let us all thank the studios for this film with a big \"chip, chip hooray!\" It is a very enjoyable flick that will plaster big grins on the faces of most everyone in the viewing audience."

It was born out of my utterly pure and totally nonbelligerent desire to point out the fact that you don't have to be in your prime state of development in life to enjoy a movie such as this. Oscar material? Would never even consider it. Excellent? Not even close. Has more dents and scratches then a car freshly plucked out of a demolition derby? Not quite. Do you have to be a raving Alvin and the chipmunks fanatic, who has seen every single episode, can't have any more collectibles with them unless you create them yourself, would marry any one of them if given the chance, in order to enjoy the movie? Not by a long shot... I can't really find word to describe the movie from the myriad of terms that come to mind, save one... good. I suppose that breaks things down easily enough for everybody to understand. And by everybody I mean the entire range of haters, lovers neutrals, people who lost the last shred of their tiny little soul while still in their mother's womb, others who are just jealous that other people have fun when watching this movie, and a great number of other categories as well. I, for one, believe that the only thing that can stop anyone from enjoying this movie in the least measure is their own way of thinking. If you've outgrown the childhood that may or may not have been influenced by such phenomenons as cartoons, you'll probably find this movie stupid, silly or simply outrageous. But... and this is a big BUT ladies and gentlemen, if you still hold that little spark in your soul that switches off an annoying part of your brain that makes you analyze things, then you will most likely kick back, enjoy the movie and savor your popcorn, fizzy drink and/or the laughter of the 5 year old sitting next to you. And as you look at that little boy or girl's face flushed from all that laughter, you might actually find it somewhere in your more or less frozen soul to laugh yourself once every now and then. If your versatility in the domain of cinema is virtually limitless and unmatched, and you have nothing against a silly, heart-warming comedy now and then, check out Alvin and the chipmunks. You'll like it. If you fall into any other of the categories mentioned above, or simply prefer a brain-twisting, heart-wrenching movie, over other kinds of stuff Hollywood throws at your fragile little brain/retinas, then don't waste your money. Use it to end hunger in Africa... it's more productive that way."

With the boys still inside, the tree is shipped off to the lobby of the prestigious Jett Records, helmed by a slick and conniving record executive named Ian Hawk (David Cross), in downtown Los Angeles. Ian is a former college roommate of Dave Seville (Jason Lee), a down-on-his-luck musician and songwriter who has never given up hope for making a successful career out of his quirky musical sensibilities.\n\nWhen Dave goes to Jett Records to pitch Ian a new song, he is rudely booted out of the offices. Taking a basket of muffins as consolation, he wanders past the Christmas tree being installed in the lobby. The Chipmunks, smelling the tasty muffins, jump in the basket unbeknownst to Dave, who unwittingly carts them back to his apartment where the Chipmunks secretly install themselves quite comfortably.\n\nBefore you can say, \"Alvinnnnn!!!\" the 'Munks run amuck, turning their new digs into a disaster area. The boys' home-wrecking antics include storing toaster waffles under the carpet (put aside for the winter, the 'Munks explain), and leaving some mysterious dark, round objects strewn about (Simon insists they're...raisins). Shocked at what the boys have done to his apartment, Dave is even more astounded when he discovers that not only can these rodents talk, they can sing.\n\nDespite his misgivings about his new tenants, Dave seizes the opportunity to put together his songwriting skills with the 'Munks unique talents.

        "review_detailed_main": "When their tree is cut down and taken to the lobby of a record company, three singing chipmunks, Alvin, Theodore and Simon, meet and team up with Dave, a likable down-on-his-luck song writer, to become a world-wide pop phenomenon. But with a manipulative record exec out to exploit the furry trio for every dollar he can make, will fame and fortune prove to be rodents undoing?\n\nI liked 'Alvin And The Chipmunks. On the surface, it's a feel-good family film with a well-meaning hero, cute CGI characters, and a boo-hiss baddie, but it's also a savage indictment of the world of pop music that takes some vicious swipes at the industry's exploitation of minors. Kids will love the silly antics of the cuddly rodent trio; adults should enjoy the lambasting of a business in which image and money are all that matters.\n\nJason Lee (from TV's My Name is Earl) is terrific as Dave, and does a convincing job interacting with his (non-existent) CGI counterparts, whilst stand-up comedian David Cross makes a great impression as slimy executive Ian Hawke. The talented rodents themselves are voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney (although their voices are unrecognisable, having been altered drastically to sound like the famous fur-balls).\n\nThe humour varies from the most basic (fart jokes and slapstick) to the less obvious and more intelligent (one of the chipmunks inhales helium from a balloon, resulting in an extremely deep voice; Hawke gives the exhausted pop-stars the chipmunk equivalent of a line of coke: a cup of coffee topped with cream).\n\nAlvin And The Chipmunks is fine family fun from start to finish, which grown-ups should find themselves enjoying as much as their kids. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

Jason Lee is wonderful in the role of Dave, because he is filled with charisma, humor and a textured facial expression, with age the position of the hero becomes more recognizable.\n\nIt's amazing how Ross Baghdasaryan managed to create a franchise about chipmunks, Karl, as much as 64 years ago, so I hope his characters are loved to this day."

And the ending could have been a little bit better/had more closure. It was a decent ending- don't get me wrong. But I think it could have done better...I know I was left thinking \"uh..is there more?\"\n\nOverall, great film, highly recommend for taking kids or kids at heart to see it."

After spending $50.00 on tickets and refreshments and two hours I can't get back, the kids asked if we could pick up the DVD on the way home. I could have saved $30.00 and could have done something that I wanted to do while they watched it on DVD. My kids have the DVD now and watch it all the time. Good for the kids, barely tolerable for the parent. I give it an eight as an average. The kids give it a 10, of course, and I give it a 2. The two is for the chipmunks. They are very cute. I find that the more annoying a show is, the more the kids like it. It's what happens as I get older."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed by James Plath, Managing Editor of DVDTOWN.COM and Contributor to HollywoodinHiDef.com\n\nSynopsis\n\nOne name says it all, but who knew of Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. back in 1958, when \"The Chipmunk Song\" sold 4.5 million records in just seven weeks? Bagdasarian was better known as David Seville, and a high-tech tape recorder allowed him to do the voices for all three chipmunks as well as his own, and the musician's son revived the pop-novelty phenomenon in the Eighties, when it spawned an animated TV show. Now, this live-action and CGI film brings \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" to a third generation. Forget what you've heard from cranky critics.\n\nThis is a great family film, entertaining for the youngsters and fun for parents, and not just because it's an \"origin\" story that incorporates snippets of the old familiar songs. Sure, it's a giggle to see how Alvin, Theodore, and Simon end up bagged in a Christmas tree that's erected in the lobby of Jett Records--where Seville just happens to have been tossed out by his old college roommate and Jett honcho, Ian (David Cross). But it's also a hoot seeing Jason Lee duplicate the wide-eyed enthusiasm from his TV character on \"My Name is Earl,\" only with chipmunks to interact with instead of a slow-on-the-uptake brother.\n\nThe plot is pretty standard. The chipmunks (voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler) strike a deal with Dave to sing his songs in exchange for room and board, but then go with \"Uncle\" Ian after they're convinced Dave doesn't want the little troublemakers in his life anymore, only to have Ian turn into a regular Stromboli, working them until they're ragged (and until Dave can come to the rescue). Dave apparently has problems committing to a family, and so a side plot involves his ex- (Cameron Richardson). Though the Chipmunks go from Chip 'n' Dale clueless to hip-hop savvy faster that Alvin can get into trouble, how much logic do you want from a film that has talking and singing rodents? The CGI animation is excellent, the furballs are fun to watch, and there's only one poop joke and one fart gag, which is tame by today's standards. Kids will love it for the mischief, the singing, and the humor. And ultimately, the message (family first) is a good one.\n\nVideo Quality\n\nThink primary colors, and lots of them, along with strong black levels that provide a nice 3-dimensionality, and not just for the CGI chipmunks. \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" was transferred to a 25-gig disc using the AVC/MPEG-4 codec and presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and it looks great in 1080p High Definition. The picture has a nice polished plasticine look to it, with strong edge detail.\n\nAudio Quality\n\nI'm a PCM fan, and so to my ears, while this DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio does a fine job of delivering a clear soundtrack with a nice balance and spread across the front speakers, it doesn't seem to have that extra \"pop\" that PCM often delivers. The rear speakers get involved during the Chipmunks' shenanigans and music, and particularly with the hip-hop numbers they really come to life. You lose a little fullness with the Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1, but both are still very serviceable soundtracks.\n\nSubtitles are in English (CC), Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean.\n\nBonus Features\n\nFor a box-office hit, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" comes with only TWO features, not counting a handful of other trailers. That's not even one per \"munk.\" One of them gives us the history of David Seville and the Chipmunks, narrated by Bagdasarian, Jr.. It covers all the bases, and while it falls short of being what fans have come to think of as a full-blown documentary, with multiple talking heads, copious clips, and behind-the-scenes footage, it's still a nice feature. There are vintage stills, artwork from advertising and promotions, and a nice overall history. A second short feature on the music explains how Ali Dee and Co. didn't just want to make music for helium-voiced chipmunks; they wanted to make cool hip-hop and R&B tracks that would be worthy of a Top-10 song. It's interesting, but I would have liked to have had another feature on the CGI animation or a commentary track with Lee and the director. Why not?\n\nTru-Blu?\n\nIf you have a Blu-ray player and you have children, you already know that good HD titles for the whole family are tough to come by. Though there have been plenty of failures when it comes to live-action/CGI versions of a beloved cartoon classic, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" really does a nice job of appealing to nostalgic fans of the old music and cartoons, while also jazzing it up for a whole new crowd of admirers."
