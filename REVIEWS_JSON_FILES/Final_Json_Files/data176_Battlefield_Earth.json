        "review_detailed_main": "My spouse and I went to see this on opening night. We were expecting to see an extremely bad and costly film, and we were not really disappointed. It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.\n\nAs they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry \"can't get a break\" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.\n\nIn fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking \"Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?\" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.\n\nIf you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here, but not much else. Some day when you need a good laugh, rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector."

My personal guess: no, and if they were, I'd rather not know about what.\n\nNone of the reviews have done BE justice. Having heard what a start to finish mess this was, my brother and I decided to watch it, just for fun. It was horrible beyond all our expectations - and not in a fun way. And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude.\n\nI've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:\n\n* Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.\n\n* Special effects, film, sets, costumes, makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.\n\n* all other salaries: $4,999,888.\n\n* script: $112 and change.\n\nThough that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made, or released, for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this, why should anyone care? Ah, well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.\n\nI never thought I'd give anything a 1, but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen. So, * is my vote, and I'd rate it lower if it were possible. Just... incredible. Watch and learn."

If you want to teach someone about plot holes, pop Battlefield Earth into your DVD player. If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie, so copies of it are rare.\n\nThis movie is painful to watch. It hurts my eyes because everything is so tinted, it hurts my neck because everything is so angled, and it hurts my ears because the acting is so bad. Oh, and trying to figure out why someone thought this would make a good movie gave me a headache. All that being said, I cannot hate this film like some other movies, and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it, it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And, I have to admit, it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.\n\nAnd it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget, so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made. It's painful to watch, it makes no sense, and watching John Travolta, Barry Pepper, and Forest Whitaker act in this movie was like watching Goofy. Actually, I think I'd like to see a version where Goofy plays Terl.\n\n0/10"

But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell."

Every time I watch it I find more and more hilarious plot inconsistencies, and the slanted camera angles and dialogue never cease to amuse. I guess since this film is somewhat affiliated with Hubbards hokey religion, there is no cursing to be found in the movie. Instead we get to hear how many ways you can use the word \"crap.\" In several situations Travolta refers to specific unpleasants events as being \"crap-lousy.\" It's hilarious and has to be seen to be appreciated. In conclusion, if you fancy yourself a MST3K type critic, you will surely enjoy this crap-lousy movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "...not because Travolta is in dreds, not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages, but because it is one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nI do not use that term lightly. I consider myself a lover of bad movies, movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success. \"Battlefield Earth\" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.\n\nI saw this movie because I expected it to be bad, and even I was shocked at how bad it was. Just plain bad. In nearly every respect.\n\nI suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic. And they were loud. So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed. Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.\n\nDirector Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen. Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), \"Battlefield Earth\" is already being compared to \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\" In my book, it's a fair comparison.\n\nTake the direction. Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything. The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.\n\nThe effects, well \"Plan 9\" had pie tins in strings. \"Battlefield Earth\" has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment. Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.\n\nGaping continuity? Well, \"Plan 9\" had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars. In \"Battlefield Earth\", the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future. Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week. How did they learn you ask? Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course, somehow still working on electricity 1,000 years in the future. More? The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle. How do they still work? They found fresh batteries? Next Duracels I see, they better say \"Best if used before 3005.\"\n\nIs \"Battlefield Earth\" worse than \"Plan 9\"? I'd have to say yes. \"Plan 9\" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh. Just fun to watch. After about an hour of \"Earth\" I wanted to hurt someone. After two hours and it was still going, I wanted to hurt myself. Avoid, even for lovers of dumb movies."

That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake.\n\nI don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.\n\nI would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.\n\n'In preparing a judgment of worth,\n\nI proclaim this lame movie to be worst'\n\nDon't forget that 'I told ya'\n\nto blame John Travolta\n\nand L. Ron for Battlefield Earth.\n\nOh, if it were only a musical. 2/10.\n\nClark Richards"

If you go to the Smithsonian, you'll find the curators go to extreme measures to protect documents that are only 200 years old.\n\n-- Are we really supposed to believe that stone-age barbarians can learn to fly fighter jets in just one week? It takes professional pilots years of training.\n\n-- Jet fuel does not remain stable for a thousand years. Most of the plastic components in the jest would have become brittle. The battery packs in the jets would have become unusable.

The rest of the movie is the standard very bad, short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all.

But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces.

Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think \" Rat brains \" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the \" man animals \" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term \" Man animals \" irritating ? Surely it should be \" Manimals \" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ?

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, this movie sucked. It sucked on levels that I was not even sure that a film could legitimately suck on. In response to comments that I have seen from others, Battlefield Earth is NOT too deep, did my undergraduate in Philosophy, I know Ancient Greek and Latin and study Plato... no third rate sci-fi writer from the 20th century is going to get over on me. Battlefield Earth is NOT too bleak... I like bleak post-apocalypse films, the darker the better. Battlefield Earth is simply too stupid.\n\nThis film failed as a thriller/drama, because the characters were so wooden and unbelievable that I really did not care one little bit about anything that they did or what happened to them. And the acting and dialogue were so horrendous that I felt like I was watching a highschool play.\n\nIt failed as sci-fi because it did not tell us anything about ourselves or the human condition, and the science was a bit too fictional.\n\nIt failed as an action film, because the action scenes were done poorly. Slo-mo, tilted cameras and echo-chambers do NOT heighten drama on their own, they must be used in conjunction with something else.\n\nIt failed as a promotion of Scientology, because the only lesson that I got from it was that if you are mad at one member of a race of people then it is apparently ok to commit genocide on them as a whole. I saw no evidence in the film that the human characters were justified in blowing up the whole psychlo planet, beyond the fact that a more reasonable solution would have been too complex for Hubbard or the cast and crew of the film to understand.\n\nAnd the fact that when the psychlo planet blows up I felt not one iota of excitement or joy, or even anger, just sort of an extension of the emptiness that I felt through most of the film. This is not some liberal whining about the evils of imperialism or anything, if the plot had demonstrated to me that the planet should be blown up and the psychlos wiped out I would have cheered and yelped like an idiot, but I simply don't remember that part of the plot. All I saw was that Terl was a jerk so the psychlos must die, if that is the lesson that Scientology wants to teach, then I think we should be a bit concerned.\n\nThis film was so remarkably bad that I began laughing about 10 minutes into it and stopped soon after. After sitting in the theater for what felt like days, I looked at watch to see that only an hour had passed. I communicated this fact to my friends who responded in horror. We stayed to the end, but it was not worthwhile.\n\nThis film has replaced Popeye the Movie as the worst film I have ever seen, because it had a huge budget, relatively talented cast and crew and still was not particularly more interesting than watching a blank screen for 2 hours. Big budget films continue to get lamer and lamer while American tastes and standards continue to decline.\n\nThe 'tributes' to older sci-films (or just rip-offs) sucked, I was unimpressed by the little Blade Runner montage at the beginning (as that whole scene just sucked), as I was by what appeared to be a remake of the infamous riot scenes in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (is that the right one? the second to last film anyway), which was itself based on the Watts riots. There were other examples, but those were the two lamest.\n\nI won't even get into the inconsistencies and improbabilities of the plot, because they have been well-documented elsewhere, and besides, they are not the reason that this film was so bad. The 1000 year old fighter planes, the man-animals flying harriers, the flight simulators at Ft. Bragg (which I am assured are not there) all would have been fine in a film that was not created by the mentally impared. This film was so bad, and so lame, and so terrible that it will be the yardstick against which all bad sci-fi will be measured in the future.\n\nComparing this film to Ed Wood's work would be an insult, as Wood at least appeared to love film. This movie is almost toxic in its disrespect for both its medium and its audience."

I do have to say the Hollywood does produce some god awful flicks, but none so highly publicised or with such big names starring in them.\n\nSo avoid this like the plague, don't give distributors any excuse to produce anymore copies of this rubbish and don't waste another second of your life actually watching it.\n\nI give it -10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is truly a horrid movie. But (maybe..) worth watching once because it's an instant, modern camp classic.\n\nNow, if you notice, I only submit bad reviews to this site, but that's because bad movies are a hobby of sorts for me. I'm one who thinks you can learn more about film from bad movies than good ones, and if there is any thuth to that, every film student's thesis should be written about Battlefield Earth.\n\nYou don't just wonder what they were thinking. You're amazed that so many people had to be so incompetent for this movie to get released. It defies comprehension. They had the budget, some (well, ok.. ) 'capable' (servicable might be a better term) actors.. so how could any outfit fail so miseraby?\n\nIt's an amazing film in all the ways that it sucks. It combines all the elements of a horrid film - employs characters which don't develop in any way, that you don't care about (or even root against), who act in very irrational or excessively stupid ways for the purpose of lengthening the film or serving the plot. The very worst part of all (and how you can do this I've no idea) is that the movie is boring and abrasive at the same time. It's like repeatedly being stabbed while still being in that place between sleep and awake where you don't really care about anything.\n\nThe crawl at the beginning, as well as the constant screen wipes, are a complete rip-off of Star Wars. I hesitate to even mention that film in this review. Worse yet, the script spends about a third of the film playing out things that you already know from the crawl! That aliens or whatever took over earth and killed most of the humans, the ones who still live are living in mostly tribal cultures. But, you're still subjected to quite a lot of them 'discovering' what is going on... which you were told before the movie even started. Why waste my time like that?\n\nImmediately, the cheese in this movie starts to get thick. You get the Hero (tm) riding a white horse, his love interest, the crotchety old tribal elder, the Hero knowing the truth though no one believes him... blah blah blah.\n\nSoon you start to notice that the screenplay is completely offensive to watch. In an effort to be 'cutting-eduge', a lot of the film is short from these tilted camera angles, what you would see if you tilted your head 45 degrees to one side. When it's not giving you a neck cramp from the camera angles, ripping off Star Wars with screen wipes, ripping off John Woo (poorly) with rapidly changing camera angles during combat scenes, you are treated (ahem) to gratutious use of slow-motion. Yes, there is more slow-motion here than in a whole season's worth of Monday Night Football. It's all part of a directorial scheme that really seems very patronizing to the viewer.\n\nDetails in virtually ever scene evoke that \"yeah, right\" reflex from the viewer. Such as, in the shopping mall where the glass is still relatively clean (after 1,000 years), characters using 20th century phrases such as \"the grass is greener on the other side\" or \"piece of cake\", which have apparently survived 1,000 years worth of dialect evolution and humanity's near extinction. Or, when Ker doesn't notice the \"hidden\" camera (obviously in view of anyone with half a brain, and on top of that, it makes loud noises when it zooms!). But, good thing Travolta just-so-happens to have placed these cameras in the city sewers (we all know how much excitement there is down there), or he never would have seen our hero escaping. Other intelligence-insulting garbage occurs, such as when the cave-people learn to pilot fighter jets in a week, nuclear warheads are found in still-working order 1,000 years in the future,\n\nThe alien costumes are pretty retarded, but I can't really complain because that fits the aliens, who have to be the stupidest race ever to conquer a planet and enslave a race. For example, the aliens are very intersted in gold, but didn't seem to locate Fort Knox. Or worse yet, when the enslaved humans are sent to mine gold (which, in this movie, is found in big chunks in the ground), and they come back with gold bars, the aliens think nothing of it. huh? The slang the Psychlos use is puzzling too. They call humans \"man-animals\", but just call dogs \"dogs\". They refer to air as \"breath-gas\", and the hidden cameras not as cameras, but \"picto-cameras\". Oooh! How high tech that sounds!\n\nYou get the idea. Picture a movie that tried to be Star Wars. Now, subtract any sort of compelling storyline, any well-done action scenes at all, any characters that you care about their survival. Make the hero(s) stupid and the villians even more stupid. And still, the whole comes out to be less than the sum of its parts.\n\nRun - don't walk - away from this piece of crap. And if you like bad movies - don't bother. You can't laugh at this. It's just unwatchable. To borrow a phrase, this smacks of the Yiddish theatre in space.\n\nTo be accurate with my overall rating, I might have to use negative scientific notation. But, I'll just leave it at 0/10. I could actually feel myself becoming stupider with each passing minute."

On a side note our hero is the same actor that plays the sniper in Saving Private Ryan. John Travolta plays a decent villain. Maybe its just me but I thought Battlefield Earth was pretty decent. I am actually disappointed they did not make a sequel of the movie. My recommendation is to keep expectations low this way when you see the movie you won't be disappointed."

With classic quotes from John Travolta such as the constant use of the word \"man animals\", and (in reference to the gold) \"You smelted it into bar form\". Then there is the high quality acting from the \"man-animals\", the grunting and monkey like movements make for some quality comedic acting. The setting only helps the comedy, I laugh whenever I remind myself that the year is 3000 and yet our weapons from 1000 years earlier are in tact and ready to use. Then not only are our out dated weapons ready to use but they can apparently do now what they failed to do 1000 years earlier which is destroy the alien planet. What a great idea; in my opinion this passes \"There's Something about Mary\" as the funniest movie sequence of all time. On one last note, the hardest laughs came from the costumes...poor John Travolta, they spent all that money on making him tall and creating a back lot environment but they couldn't find a way to hide his fat gut?"

And man are they done badly in this stinker. In fact, they don't get anything right.\n\nJohn Travolta and Forest Whitaker have three Oscar nominations and one win between them, which is enough to discount the value of the Oscars altogether. Whitaker probably comes off the better of the two. He may be costumed to look like Oprah Winfrey from her fat years, but he gets far fewer lines, and therefore opportunities to embarrass himself. Travolta, on the other hand, assumes a dandified, English aristocratic accent for some reason, and delivers one howler after another. It's unclear to me whether or not he realizes how bad this movie is and is hamming it up on purpose for lack of anything better to do or thinks he's really contributing to something of value.\n\nYikes -- you see something like \"Battlefield Earth\" and realize you might need to recalibrate your bad movie meter.

It is turned into a movie produced by a man who is one of the leaders of an infamous cult founded by the man who wrote the book in question. Aweful dialogue, NO characterization, cliches EVERYWHERE. I read on a few sites that Scientologists bought multiple copies of the book to fraudulently put Elron (sic) Hubbard on the Best Sellers List. The same method was used to try to boost ticket sales of this dreadful film (apparently with the movie only making 20 million, either they didn't repeatedly go see the film as ordered, or there aren't as many scientologists around the world as claimed.

In BE the few surviving humans have regressed into a primitive society with no technology or education and the film spends some time with them, seeing how they live and see life. Fascinating\n\nI tend to dislike sci-fi films carried by special effects only and thankfully BE doesn't fall into this category. What makes it different is that instead of having an intracate plot embelished with strange future technology it basically revolves around the physcology of being imprisoned and enslaved which is unusual\n\nA lot of time is spent dealing with the humans responses to technology and advanced concepts, while we also see the aliens are not just 'evil' stereotypes - they just think the humans are animals and treat them as such\n\nThere are also no massive battle scenes, and for a sci-fi film a lot of hand to hand combat. All this made me even more impressed and like most good films, the hero's really have to fight hard to win and they do in BE too, there is a sense of satisfaction when they start learning to outsmart their captors\n\nI liked the sound track which was atmospheric and there seemed to be a lot of repetitive music played quietly in the background throughout most of the film - this is actually quite unnerving and I enjoyed this unusual effect\n\nThe only points of criticism I have are the concept of the aliens being after gold, the sillyness of flying 1000 year old Harrier jets, and the computerised 'education' scene where the hero ends up explaining geometry and physics to his cavemen brethren!\n\nThe gold didn't bother me THAT much, after all its a resource of the earth and it's very believable aliens would invade our planet for its rich resources As for one or two 'silly' scenes well, they only last a few minutes its not a big deal\n\nSo I don't understand the critical attacks to BE. I can only assume people don't like Travolta for some reason (ok, he's an easy target with the scientology), or were expecting lots of effects and action This is not Starship troopers (which bored me senseless)!\n\nUltimately I think the film was marketed wrong, it should have been an underground film aimed at the alternative sci-fi market. Its just not a mainstream film\n\nI think there a quiet a few people out there who would also be pleasently suprised like me!"

I guess the movie cost around 73 Million . Lets do the math. Hollywood spent 73 mill, I spent 50 cents. I suffer from a dreaded disease . I LOVE bad movies. Heavens Gate , Water World you name it , I love it . Wing Commander ? ate it up . Science Fiction is my all time Movie Jones. A bad Sci Fi is better than any other type so called good flick. I had followed the production of this movie on several movie sites and when the bad reviews came out the way they did I knew BFE would be a treat. Travolta hitting all the talk shows pumping up this 'EPIC '. Comparisons to Star Wars ? Let me get out my fifty cents . People this was made just for me . Bad acting ? No problem. Camera angles ? No problem . Plot ? no plot ? Who cares. These movies do not come every day . Do I want to sit with the rest of the planet and watch all the thumbs up crap ? Why ? I had to listen to everyone trash Starship Troopers the same way .Its not every day you get to see brain sucking spiders. Sit back,turn off your brain and relax . Giant aliens with air tubes hanging out of their noses , and ape people flying fighter jets ? COOL STUFF . This movie went perfect with my Raisenettes and buttered Popcorn . I will be saving up my next 50 cents for the sequel or sequels . Look for me , I will be the guy with the big smile in the front row . Rock on people."

It's just a propaganda film of immense proportions, with bad acting, awful costumes (AWFUL!), horrible direction, neck-damaging camera angles, a story line that an eight-year-old could improve upon. I took the sage advice of others that had seen it, and denied the funds to the Church of $cientology, buying a ticket instead to Gladiator. Theaters at the time in LA were populated by numbers of Co$ members, gasping and clapping like programmed drones.\n\nNow THAT was creepier than anything in this steaming bit of business.\n\nDon't even rent this. See 'Manos, the Hands of Fate' if you want to have a good time seeing a bad film. 'Manos' is mind-bendingly bad, but in a hilarious way that can actually teach you about the mistakes you shouldn't make when directing a picture. 'Battlefield Earth', alas, doesn't even have that."

I agree that this is the campiest movie ever made, including Plan 9 and all the other ones that come to mind. It totally missed its mark on every point. You really have to see Travolta's acting in this movie to believe it. My favorite line of his: \"When you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer GALAXIES!!!\" See, the reason this is favorite movie is because it doesn't stop entertaining for ten seconds. Right from the beginning, something cheezy is happening that makes you feel embarrassed for everyone involved in this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT!! I know it is hard to believe that the makers of this movie thought it would be good, but it's true! I read one of those promo magazines that came out right when the movie was released, and these people thought it would be a blockbuster! WTF???? Did the producers get to see this movie before it was put out?? Anyways, this is one of the few movies I'd give a 10/10 for because it is so humorous even though that's not what it was meant to be at all. A must see. One other thing: all you people that were upset at how bad this movie is, where is your sense of humor?? Are you the same people that like Ace Ventura or something? Does something have to be in the form of a one-liner joke for you to laugh at it or what??? Get a clue!!!"

I liked the aesthetic, and the old school special effects. I actually found John Travolta's performance to be surprisingly refreshing, after putting aside my initial criticism of these sky Demons having American accents.

Very rarely do screen adaptions match the appeal of the book, but Battlefield Earth's concoction of idiotic characters, plot holes, bad acting, and lapses in logic came from ineptness and not from any demands of the film medium.\n\nWith this one film director Roger Christian has shot to the top of my \"Really Bad Directors List\", easily replacing the likes of Michael Bay and Simon West. Christian's reliances on wipes and tilted camera angles doesn't cover up the fact that he has no clue how to frame a scene or how to get his cinematographer to use more than a 40-watt lightbulb to light the picture.\n\nCritics long feared that this movie would have been a Scientology propoganda flick due to the author of the book. From what little I know about Scientology I can't find any of it in this picture and I think that's a shame. Such a picture would be far more interesting than this waste of time."

        "review_title": "I watched it in its entirety so you don't have to",
        "review_detailed_main": "I originally wrote a review about this movie after only seeing parts of it. Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely, I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First, a summary of my old first review:\n\nBattlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting, but after zapping regularly between the two, it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie, it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same, the action scenes were bad, the dialogue was horrible, and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever, where everything repeats endlessly. So, eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.\n\nNow, after having seen it in its entirety, I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score, but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness: it gets a solid one.\n\nThe whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight: the story on itself is preposterous \u2014 I'll come back to this later on. Yet, even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie, but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful: it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slow-motion shots, but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that close-ups and slow-motion would be used to focus on the action, but not here: the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action, they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off: scenes just drag along, and are then followed by a pile-up of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table, but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue, which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad sci-fi TV show from around 1990, stretched to almost two hours.\n\nFunny enough, I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really, what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then, but it's just ridiculous if *every* shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa, so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camera-work that is awful: there is an overuse of close-ups, and often half of an actor's face is cut off (partially due to the tilting). Sometimes we also get close-ups of random objects as if they are of great significance, but they aren't.\n\nThe acting is bad, not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.\n\nThe special effects probably looked OK back in 2000, except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now, it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie, but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.\n\nNow, by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes, even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG-13 but ironically enough, the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous, and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However, the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the \"nuking the fridge\" scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1, meaning \"never ever watch this\", I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl, but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously, it could be worth it.\n\nThe only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score, but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins, the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.\n\nOverall, Battlefield Earth is a complete failure, and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it seems to me that everybody involved in making of this movie experimented with their careers. If I was the one financing it I wouldn't be sitting here writing sarcastic comments, I'd be after some heads. Roger Christian's especially and that of the screenwriter and possibly Travolta's.\n\nSurely there have been other films that bombed colossally while being terribly expensive, but I haven't seen any that seemed to have been made to fail on purpose. Until this one.\n\nLet's start with the obvious. Direction. Directing was so poor and intrusive even the most unaware of the viewers must have noticed it and realized for the first time in their lives how the watching experience can be influenced by bad directorial choices. One single choice stands out like turd in a punchbowl - tilting the camera in every single shot. Every single shot you watch with nauseating feeling desperately wishing that the camera straightens up. But it never happens. And there was never any artistic justification for it. Okay, we see the future world through skewed eyes because the future world is screwed - point taken - now can we watch the bloody movie? No.\n\nI did endure watching it though, on a TV station that mercifully airs commercials every 15 minutes, so I could take breaks from time to time. I was able to realize that not only the picture has been massacred but the story as well.\n\nI was hoping it wouldn't be due to the following: Hubbard, author of the story, was founder of Scientology / Travolta is one of his zealous followers / this movie is Travolta's passion child / Travolta took a key role in production as well. One would assume Travolta would honor his master enough to make this faithful to the book. Well, he didn't. And it's a pity because I found the book to be spectacular (I was in high-school, but nevertheless). It may not be original but it is quite an inspirational saga of liberation of Human race and Earth from Psychlos, a corrupt occupational forces from outer space. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't rate Scientology one bit (I think it's a daft pastime for rich and famous) and I don't rate Hubbard as a person (frankly, he's an idiot). And I also didn't give a hoot about allegorical messages of this sci-fi while I was reading it, nor did it prompt me to turn to Scientology. But, for all its flaws, \"Battlefield Earth\" is still something that might have put the whole \"Star Wars\" n-logy to shame. Had they done it right.\n\nOf course, the movie is a fast medium, one must cut a lot from book to make it work on screen. But Travolta's vanity is also to blame for this movie's undoing. I guess if he was any younger he would be taking the role of Jonnie. Because the book IS about Jonnie, the hero (although opening parts of the book are written from the chief villain's perspective). It is about his journey from slave to master and mankind's journey to rediscover what they have lost. The decision to put Travolta's villain in the spotlight and casting the hero aside was instrumental in killing the spirit of the original story. Not to mention they totally omitted second part after Humans' victory over the Psychlos.\n\nEven if the director was not a complete dope, this still would be far from satisfactory."

Everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they've ever done. This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive, Two of a Kind and Swordfish, which are comparative masterpieces.\n\nThe cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful. The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky, take for example:\n\nChirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.\n\nThe acting, considering the fairly accomplished people involved is laughably hammy. Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.\n\nFilled with plot holes, poor special effects, bad acting, worse writing, no direction and a soundtrack that would annoy deaf people, this 'film' has less artistic merit than a theoretical snuff movie written by Joe Eszterhas, directed by Uwe Boll and staring Brendan Fraser. Truly and utterly abhorrent."

I can't see any reason why 50% of voters would rate this film below \"Monster a-Go Go\" and \"Santa with Muscles\", other than pure, unabashed bigotry.\n\nI am not a Scientologist, but no doubt someone will accuse me of being one anyway, the same way a bigot might accuse anyone in favor of gay rights of being a homosexual.\n\nI compare this movie to the recent remake of War of the Worlds which took a lot of criticism just because Tom Cruise is a Scientologist. If L. Ron Hubbard had written 'War of the Worlds' I suppose it would be rated a \"1\" by half of the voters too, most of whom would simply jump on the bandwagon.\n\nOn special effects alone, I give this movie a 5. Overall, I give it a 6.5. This is without a doubt, the most underrated movie I have ever seen on IMDb."

The Plot? This is written by the Hack writer, Hubbard, who started Scientology to make money. The scenes jump from place to place, huge plot holes, very bad science and bad photography. The villains are directly from Scientology, called Psychlo's, that have been implanted by \"catrists\" psychiatrists anyone, who Hubbard hated with a vengeance, and also whom the CO$ hate. I have read reviews from $cientologists here, each fullsome in their praise of this movie, but they are following Church of $cientology policy and lying. This is a bad movie, and should be taken out the back and put down. I also see it as the downfall in Travolta's career, as how can he claim $20million for a movie, when this turkey has not even made $20million."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched Battlefield Earth today. Um\u0085 yay? If you don't already know, Battlefield Earth is considered the worst movie of all time. When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking, \"Oh boy, this is going to be hilarious.\" Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering, \"What's so bad about it?\" I'm wondering, \"Where do I even start?\" How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically, a race of aliens called the \"Psychlos\" take over Earth following a nine minute battle (yes, nine minutes). A thousand years later, the last remaining humans become hunter-gatherers. But, the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl, played by John Travolta, is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet, decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me, or is that really stupid? Plus, there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example: A group of tribal men, who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie, get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later, there going all \"Star Wars\" fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly, how were they able to master it in one day? There's more, but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements, it would become really, really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is, according to dictionary.com, \"a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on him/her and his/her attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe.\" Not only is that A, fake, but it's also B, stupid, and C, a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear, there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad, which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one, not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious, annoying, stupid, douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid, he's the smartest alien ever, and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie, I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a sci-fi movie, you think of CGI. Yes, Battlefield Earth has it, but it sucks. I've seen B-movies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake, the lasers are copy-paste with a ripple effect when it hits, the explosions lack impact, the scenery is bland, and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear, there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! I-it just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue, that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall, this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie, it's the soundtrack, which is somewhat decent (I use that term loosely). This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a B-Movie, it would have been decent because of its humor (yes, the movie is pretty unintentionally funny). As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers, which it is, it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap."

The dialog is dumb, the effects are pretty bad (by and large), the plot is about what you'd expect, and the entire thing is roughly the equivalent of smearing dog feces onto film and putting it through a projector.\n\nPeople often neglect to mention costumes in a movie, and not being a costume person I suppose I do the same, normally. But the costumes in this case deserve special attention. Were they bad? Let's put it this way: To call them worse than wearing a gown made from frozen puke would be demeaning to frozen puke. You know those shoes that the Spice Girls wore about 10 years ago with really tall soles? That's what John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker wore the entire movie. Plus they have things that look like boogers hanging from their nose the entire time, and hair that Medusa herself wouldn't be caught dead in. And so on. Look at the pictures and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAnd if you think that it's inappropriate to include the word \"boogers\" in a serious movie review, you obviously don't realize how bad of a movie we're talking about."

Turning that screenplay into one of the most derivative, idiotic movies of the decade just retires the side in the bottom of the ninth. Hit the showers losers, it's time to load up the short bus and head back to Clearwater. Is everyone in the cast a saintliest or did Travolta resort to blackmail and bribery to get a cast for this third rate copy of any science fiction movie made in the eighties? Of course, if they were actually meaning to make something so preposterous that it's laughable, I owe someone an apology. Don't go to it. Don't rent it.

        "review_detailed_main": "I actually went to see this crappy movie when it came out, and never before have I felt so completely cheated out of time in my life. I knew going in that movie was based on the series by L. Ron Hubbard, liar, con, fraud, bigamist, tax cheat, cult leader, etc, etc, yet I was still willing to suspend my prejudice in the hopes that his fictional writing might somehow be translated successfully from the trailing threads of his fabricated life.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI managed to squirm in my seat as I sat through this miserable excuse for a movie only to be granted a brief respite to use the restroom. It was at that point that I'd considered leaving the theater, perhaps even demanding a refund. Still, there was a niggling sliver of doubt that perhaps I just wasn't giving the movie enough of a chance, that maybe it would get better near the end. So upon flushing the toilet, I'd returned to my seat with fresh eyes, and proceeded to writhe even worse that I had before, despite having just used restroom. Needless to say, the movie and I should have switch places halfway through the showing. It should have been consigned to being flushed down the toilet while I made shadow puppets in the projector beam for the audience's amusement.\n\nHonestly, I think I would have been more entertaining, and a hell of a lot less insulting to their intelligence. At the very least, they could have given me their pocket change for charity, or perhaps even pity for having suffered through the movie, and it would have been a better use of their money. Only they were in the same predicament I was in - we were all out the cost of several 40 oz. bottles of malt liquor and a swift kick to the genitals, both of which would have been preferable to this scam that we'd fallen victim to (Hubbard's soggy ashes must be gargling in laughing amid the scum of the sea floor).\n\nAs far as the movie itself goes, the plot was so thin and full of holes that you could have flown a 1000 year old jet through them. The acting was so pathetic and lacking in effort that it was painful to endure, and the dialog? A cruel joke. The special effects, props and costumes all seem cobbled together with bubblegum and bailing wire and should have been piled into a steaming heap, doused with gasoline and burned along with the script and the master reels until nothing remains but ashes.\n\nGiven the option to see this horrid movie, do yourself a favor, and do something else with your time instead. Even if it's spent looking at a blank wall for and hour and a half contemplating its hues, shades and textures, considering the alternative, it's time well spent."

Revolta wasn't even slightly funny. His Terl was annoying, stupid, irritating and a complete hack.

The human vs. Psychlo scenes are more like Weird Al's parody of Rambo in UHF!\n\nBarry Pepper (as if returning as Jackson from SPR), has a huge amount of energy as Johnny the hero, but somehow he wasn't as likeable as Travolta's Terl. \"Listen up, Rat-Brain!\" I liked this movie because of the humor and the absurdity of the Psychlos."

No, in this, it's the Psychlo(a name that sets the bar so low for creativity, that it's impressive that the rest of this manages to limbo under it), essentially people in black armor with dreadlocks(well, a few of them are made ugly, as well... one looks like Pearl from Blade 1) with inconsistent(why do shots cause debris to be blown away, when men are just stunned?), awkward-looking guns that fire laser blasts worse-looking than those of the original(not special edition) 1977 Star Wars. One of the humans, Jonnie, is captured and wastes no time trying to escape constantly, in spite of every. Single. Attempt. Failing(pathetically, even, and usually for the same reason... and yet he eventually, unbelievably, becomes a forward-thinking flippin' genius). And somehow, Terl(Travolta, who chews so much scenery that you can barely believe that there's any left for Whitaker to chow down on... unfortunately, there is, and we are thus denied a single acting performance in this that is not awful), the security chief(whose scheming to get out of that job and out into the galaxy, conquering, where he feels he belongs, is one of the closest things we get to anything interesting... sadly it takes up fairly little of screen time), not only doesn't think anything of it, he *teaches him stuff that could extremely obviously be turned against him*(I know that they supposedly think little of us, but there's gotta be a limit to that notion). It's like the two species are having a contest of who can be stupider. The quality of being dumb, when seen in a mainstream movie(not something indie) tends to be played for laughs, or used to evoke sympathy. Here, it's straight, obnoxious and intolerable throughout. We're supposed to care about these guys(whose ignorance extends to not realizing statues and mannequins *weren't humans or gods*). And fear these... hammy Jamaicans(seriously, a bunch of the time, they laugh maniacally, even at each other). We do neither. The sets are bland, grimy and boring. Dialog is horrible. I'd say roughly a third of the shots... think about that for a second... are Dutch, meaning, the camera tilted to the side. Not only does it lose its effect within the opening minutes of this(!), it gets to be genuinely disorienting, to where it'll look like someone is walking on the wall, or facing an odd direction, etc. The horrid nature of the FX is beyond abysmal. And this has very little to do with Scientology... I don't care about L. Ron Hubbard or the religion, this is and would be pure crap regardless of that. There is mild language and disturbing content in this. The RiffTrax for this is hilarious and helps immensely in dulling the pain that this induces, and rewatching this with that, as I did, can help a lot to restore a chunk of the faith in humanity that you may have lost in your initial viewing. I recommend this to those who refuse to listen to the warnings of those of us who are unlucky enough to have watched this tripe. 1/10"

But whether or not you're Christian, Muslim or Hindu, you know that one religion is more dangerous than any other: Scientology. Because no other religion in the history of mankind has spawned a movie as abysmally awful as the majestic super-turkey Battlefield Earth.\n\nThe plot, if there was one, concerns a group of very ugly and expendable people locked up somewhere 1000 years after an alien race called 'Psychlos' (which is a combination of 'psychos' and the 'L' in L. Ron Hubbard) has destroyed civilization as we know it (kind of like Janet Jackson at the Superbowl). Also, the aliens are people with contact lenses, big heads and dreadlocks. Um... Yeah. That about sums it up. There's also a \"hero\", played (?) by Barry Pepper, an ugly old priest-something to whom the sixties weren't too good, and a dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend who has nothing to do but mope.\n\nJohn Travolta camps around with awful lines, laughing like an idiot, possibly in a state of suppressed panic as he slowly starts to realize that he's possibly not doing his pal L. Ron Hubbard a favor by starring in this film. The technical and factual flaws are too many to list and so obvious it's like the makers were joking. If that is the case, hardy f-ing har, big laughs! The goofs range from minor nuisances like the fact that Travolta's character speaks English when he's supposedly speaking Psychlon, to miles-wide plot holes like how the Harriers can still run after 1000 years, or how unprotected books are still intact.\n\nSo, the cringe-worthy performances and holes you could put Peter Harryson's butt through aside, can Battlefield Earth at least count as \"silly fun\"? Why, of course not! Every skewed shot, every mindless scene of this movie seems intent on making the viewing experience as unpleasant for the viewer as possible. If they're not out of focus, the shots are likely to be ruined by one-colour filters, but what can you really expect when the director is doped up all throughout shooting? Barry Pepper is so bad as the supposed \"hero\" the makers could just as well have slapped a Cheney mask on a traffic light and called it acting. The only reason I even remember the name of his non-character is because it is so offensively stupid (how lame is 'Johnny Goodboy', seriously?!)\n\nI recommend the PC game of the similar name. The movie, on the other hand, you should avoid like a rabid Doberman with AIDS. That is all.(r#24)"

There are several questions about the film, such as why was Fort Knox not looted, If you listen carefully the film answers the question, as \"greener\" and friends walk in to the vault, Carl makes a comment about the Psychlos satellite not being able to see through the lead walls of this \"cave\",so as far as the film is concerned the Psychlos did not loot fort Knox because they did not know to look there for gold. The Psychlos are not stupid at all, keep in mind that much of this film is allegorical, i.e. the psychlos= corporate America, the resistance= Socialists/ Proletariat for example. That is the best thing about the particular film, a viewer can analyse it indefinitely, why? because the director and the actors were familiar with L. Ron Hubbard, Imagine what The Lord of the Rings would have been if New Line had found only people oblivious to Tolkien. A film by people who care about message is better than one which does not. If people do not like this film, it is unfortunate, but the masses would rather not think about films"

The acting is truly horrible (Travolta in particular is embarrassingly bad here), the story riddled with holes, the dialogue truly laughable.

You can thank Travolta et al for that.\n\nHubbard did not write a story in which Harriers and their fuel remained intact and usable after a thousand years nor did he have humans who could learn to fly them in a day or two. All that lasted of human creation were some of the stone, concrete and steel structures and some other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers.\n\nI can't even see this being watched for the humor value. The aliens were not written to look like this, the story only loosely follows that of the novel and Hubbard would probably hook Travolta's privates to an e-meter for his butchering of the tale.\n\nI have no real love for L. Ron Hubbard - he's obviously a smart guy if he can create a \"religion\" that makes the kind of money Scientology does but I do consider \"Battlefield\" one of my favorite books.*\n\nFor Science Fiction, you won't find any improbabilities in the book, unlike the movie (Well maybe one, with relationship to the alien's telescopic technology) and he goes to great, yet still entertaining depths to involve topics as far-reaching as interstellar finance and diplomacy and he covers all the bases when it comes to holes in the story.\n\nThere is no way the book could be capsulized into a movie, even at 180 minutes, so Travolta was foolish for even trying. A mini-series perhaps but that's been tried a couple of times with \"Dune\" and we all know how that went. Do NOT see this movie. If you see it, don't blame the book for what you see. Incidentally, I do not recommend any of Hubbard's books other than this one.\n\n*As a matter of fact, you don't even have to leave this web site to see the results of his charisma and Scientology. Sort the many comments about this movie by \"Loved It\". If you take out those who are obviously being sarcastic and allow for another 10% of the comments being people who are trying to be sarcastic in their promotion of the film but are simply too stupid to make it obvious, you still have an inordinate number of people who claim to genuinely like the movie. Statistically speaking, the cross section of stupidity in the general public doesn't allow for an explanation of all the positive posts, so what are we left with?\n\nPosts by Tom Cruise and his John Travolta and their fellow adherents.\n\nPeople that think L. Ron Hubbard's emeter, while relieving them of their money, will also get rid of those nasty \"body thetans\" that Scientology expose. (Ancient aliens who attach their spirits to you and who can only be removed by the magical transformation of your money to Scientology. There are apparently tenets of Scientology that call for the visiting of web sites where movie reviews are easily posted and singing the praises of anything to do with Elron. Of course these are just my first amendment rights speaking, IMDb doesn't need the cadre of Scientology Attorneys descending on them and I'm sure that by now they would like to reiterate the views expressed in this post do not reflect the views of anybody with money that the aforementioned attorneys can get their \"fins\" on."

And a majority of the good sci-fi films came from the golden days, which some may seem cheezey now with their low budget effects against the new CGI we see now in films, but their story still sticks out with an amusing plot. Battlefield Earth's Story sticks out, like a snapped bone coming out of your flesh.\n\nI won't give you spoilers about the movie because it really wouldn't do anything, all that there is in this film is talking, and VERY little action scenes and visually effects, which are delivered weakly. I also wont give you the plot because there really is no plot.\n\nThis is a film that will bore you so much you would want to attempt suicide.\n\nHow can Hollywood make crappy movies these days?"

The windows are just a way of wasting time, but thats OK the whole movie is a waste of time. Wheres the freaking story line!!!!!??????? oh thats right there is none.

Maybe that's why Battlefield Earth is so enjoyable to me. It's so ambitious and pretentious that it inevitably brings a smile to my face.\n\nEither that, or I'm just a sucker for bad movies."

Of course almost everyone who has ever watched a film will be aware of this, since it has become universally known as a bad movie. As such it can be used for educational purposes; to show people how NOT to make a film.\n\nAnyway, I will not go into too much detail as there are enough reviews here highlighting just how terrible this film is and the many plot holes.

What was this even about like DA fudge here are reasons why this movie sucks and there's no spoilers nope no spoilers anyway don't even watch it.\n\nFive reasons why battlefield earth sucks 1. The characters : the characters are terrible really bad they are unfunny and I believe they are mental like why the heck are these people but john travolta character was the worst character of all time Yes his character was terrible and unfunny. 2. Villain : do you call this guy aka terl a villain really he just acts like a clown he isn't even trying we can't take him seriously to be our villain at least kylo ren try ed and did better. 3. Design : just forgettable really stupid. 4. Story and plot : wait I don't need to talk about the story and plot why? Well guess what there is no story after all. 5. Acting : horrendous they act like clowns they are not even trying and john travolta my man he is ignoring his roles and he is pretty bad in this movie he just sucks.\n\nTake my word guys don't even watch this crap it is known like one of the worst movies of all time and they are so damn right."

I won't give away the plot -- there's not much to give away.\n\nSadly, there are a couple of good actors, but they seem to have been caught up in the Scientology aspects of the film rather than making a good movie or even one that makes the slightest amount of sense.

Trying to make primitive men look like fast learners in a flight simulator is laughable, especially since the equipment they're using is almost 1000 years old.\n\nIgnore harsh criticisms of the film. The costumes, special FX, some acting, etc aren't really that bad. The problem with the film is its poor execution and improbable story. It really irritates me when I read people saying \"this has no plot\". There IS a plot, but it just doesn't work. I've seen worse, but what makes this such a razzie-winning film is Travolta's heavy promotion of a movie that will make him the laughing stock of Hollywood until the next big star comes along and is made to look asinine."

        "review_title": "Unbelievably bad -- but who is really to blame?",
        "review_detailed_main": "I agree completely that this is one of the worst films imaginable: both with the over 20,000 people who rated it so low, numerically; and with the bulk of the verbal reviews that try to warn others away from it.\n\nHowever, I do not think that the lead or supporting actors are to blame. I suspect the formerly Oscar-winning director should also take less blame than the public assigns to him, for this filmic atrocity.\n\nEven though I only bought a (used) DVD of this film so I could study a number of films on IMDb's \"Bottom 100\" list, to see what I could learn from films that tens of thousands of people hate ... I still want my two hours back. Stunningly, unbelievably, \"mouth hanging open in shock\" bad! This is the sort of film that you have to watch two really good films immediately afterwards, to counter the emotional assault. And it still leaves a bad taste in your mind, after that.\n\nThe sheer beginning-to-end consistency of the film lets many of those who have taken the blame in other reviews -- actors, director, etc. -- off of the hook, in my opinion. Here's what I mean: take 100 people off of the street, totally at random. One at a time, give them some lines of bad dialogue to read, out loud. Tape the results, and study how each of those persons delivers those bad lines. What are the odds that all 100 random people would give the exact same STYLE of line reading? Same speed of delivery; same tone; same, same, same, every time. What are the odds they'd all sound stupid, in the exact same way? The odds are probably better that you'll win the Lottery (without buying any tickets) and get hit by part of a visiting comet, in the same day. The fact that all the actors in this thing look and sound like perfect clones of one another is beyond highly suspicious, in my opinion. It tells me to look elsewhere, to assign due blame properly.\n\nTake that thought experiment a step farther. Take a quality actor like Forest Whitaker, and recalculate the odds. Here's a person whose past body of work clearly shows that they are more than capable of a wealth of fine, subtly nuanced, always entertaining, sometimes simply wonderful performances. A person who gave decades to study and practice, so that you completely buy into the illusion that this actor is who he or she is pretending to be, within the context of a given story. Or Barry Pepper \u0096 \"Saving Private Ryan\" alone, in my mind, shows that he can act very well; and hold a viewer's attention; and make that viewer care about the character that he's portraying.\n\nWhat are the realistic odds that several trained actors with excellent prior credits, would all act in the EXACT same way? Specifically, that they would all look and sound like a parody of a mentally challenged person who was told to make fun of really, really bad actors. No way! It's beyond any statistical probability. It's simply not possible.\n\nSomeone with a lot of power -- more power than any director, I'd suspect -- had to be treating this group of actors like mere puppets: telling them what to do; when to do it; and exactly how to do it. A classic case of micro-management, followed by blaming the victims -- who always knew better, but were not allowed to disobey their orders.\n\nThis person or persons had to be pulling everyone's strings, from just outside of the camera's field of view. I say that because I've been on over fifty sets, as an Extra -- the ideal \"fly on the wall\" situation, for seeing what REALLY happens on movie sets. What I saw, in a lot more cases than the bulk of the public would ever think was possible or likely, was the director or producer simply over-ruling an actor's acting decisions. In too many cases, quite rudely telling them \"No, no; that's wrong: do it this way\" and then demonstrating. I'm talking big stars here, as well as highly respected character actors. It happens.\n\nHaving seen directors do that, as if it were their sole prerogative, I have to wonder how much influence the financiers had, here? If a person coughs up several million dollars, out of their own pocket, they are going to want creative control. And they'll get it. It's a given; or the film won't get made. I think that's the real problem at work here.\n\nIn summary: I think this film is an incredibly rare example of \"studio interference\" -- without a studio really being involved. I'm sorry the actors, directors and others took the blame for the final product. I'm sure they expected a lot more creative freedom than they got. I hope their careers will recover. In the end, I'm marginally glad that I studied this bad film \u0085 if only to have a clear warning of unusual dangers related to the creative funding of films no one is in any hurry to make. However, that doesn't mean you should ever watch this film. Do yourself a favor: run away!"

The truly inconceivable stupidity of the Psychlos (how could they possibly conquer so many other civilizations when they repeatedly demonstrate utter idiocy). And Barry Pepper's \"fight for freedom\" speech (I half-expected Mel Gibson to make a cameo appearance as William Wallace, knock Pepper to the ground, and serve him lawsuit papers for plagiarism).\n\nI have to stop. This is just too much. Please see it for yourself, and discover the magic of a truly awful, deplorable movie."

Bad films are released every week, but this one sinks beneath ordinary badness to become a genuine so-bad-it's-good movie.\n\nBarry Pepper gets to make lots a big, faux-'Braveheart' speeches as Johnny, a cave-dweller who leads his people in a fight against the voracious aliens who have taken over Earth. He is aided in his fight by the aliens themselves, who helpfully teach Johnny their language and all the basics of science, leave him in an abandoned library so he can be inspired by the Declaration of Independence, and send him off unmonitored so he can take his people to a huge cache of US weapons left in a bunker, still working after 1000 years of neglect.\n\n(By the way, it appears these weapons were never used...no wonder the aliens only needed 9 minutes to conquer the planet.)\n\nJohn Travolta, who labored long and hard to bring this story to the screen (it's based on a book by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard), seems to be having a great time as Terl, the alien chief of security. (Forrest Whittaker, playing his sidekick, looks like he can't believe he's in this thing.) But the truly big laughs come from Pepper, who actually seems to be taking this seriously. And the swelling, \"stirring\" music. And the stunning plot holes. And the stupidity of the aliens. And the schockingly lame action sequences by director Roger Christian. And the laughably fake matte paintings meant to evoke post-invastion Denver and Washington. Mark my words: 15 years from now, this movie will be a staple to midnight showings, complete with people coming dressed as Terl and shouting things at the screen. It's such a fascinating guilty pleasure that, God help me, I'm giving it 6 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "L. Ron Hubbard's 1950's-style science fiction promo for Scientology has been made into an equally bad film. The plot is antiquated and harkens back to the late 40's when Hubbard, shipped out of the Navy after a dismal service record, joined the action sci-fi genre pioneered by Doc Smith, Van Vogt and others, to create mega-hero stories about men who did everything right while they battled transparently awful villains. In his book Hubbard pitted the remains of humankind, led by an arch-hero modeled after the old space opera heroes of the 40's and 50's who can do no wrong and who always wins, against the evil Psychlos, so named because, as Hubbard states at the end of the book, they were basically a good people until someone invented psychology which taught them that they were animals and thereby divested them of any spiritual or ethical basis to their society. Whereupon they spread through the galaxy, destroying populations and raping worlds. Hubbard in his paranoia always felt that the major impediment to society accepting Scientology, which is essentially a form of psychoanalysis whose invention he spearheaded, was the active antagonism of organized psychology and psychiatry, both of which were out to get him and to stop Scientology because \"they knew it really worked.\" Each of Hubbard's childishly-written scifi epics since the 50's has implicitly battled against Psychology, hence the name \"Psychlos\". Look no further for the support of Scientologists for the film or for Travolta's compulsive and self-destructive desire to see the movie made at any cost - it was imperative that society \"wake up\" to the menace of psychology and to their reality that Scientology provided the only truly workable psychoanalysis in existence, and that it should be embraced by everyone as Scientologists attempt to \"clear the Planet.\"\n\nBut Hubbard was such a poor (yet prolific) writer that it is only the massive financial power of organized Scientology, which charges a small fortune for its \"religious\" services (i.e. psychoanalysis renamed \"pastoral counseling\"), that has moved along his books to best-seller status. That, and clever advance sales and coordinated drop shipping of titles to make that one-week punch on the NY Times bestseller list. But that's not enough to rescue a scifi movie that is patently awful and may well spell the end of Travolta's ever being taken seriously again by Hollywood or by anyone seriously interested in the cinema industry."

It is however true that there are major flaws with the film: The cinematography is distracting and made it hard at times to even figure out what was going on in the picture. The filming crew took some risks that in this case didn't work at all or might have given that they were done minimally. The slanted angle shots, slow motion sequences, choice of dominant coloring, and other cinematographic oddities became tired after about 30 minutes into the movie. - 2/10\n\nThe script was an attempt to cram a novel into a movie. It was lacking and at times confusing, referencing things that only a person who had read the book would understand. Repeting words and phrases was a little annoying. However, it was a consistent style that helped to develop the characters. - 4/10\n\nThe acting was acceptable, given the script. The only main annoyance is that the accents were inconsistent. Travolta and all other supporting actors did a fine job. They were believable and into their characters. - 7/10\n\nThe music was right on. The composer was over the top, but the composer was writing a score for a movie where the cinematography was over the top. So, I do not think that the composer should be faulted for writing the most appropriate score for the movie he was assigned to. - 10/10\n\nThe story was compelling, but left more to be desired. Perhaps this was because it was a movie based on a book and the book would explain more. - 8/10\n\nInconsistencies, impossible situations, and continuity error was all over the place. - 1/10"

But all is not lost, the movie does have a lasting impact by way of a life-lesson about the importance of Leverage. A running joke of this caliber is a thing to be cherished; rarely is humor at the expense of so many people and so much money.\n\nViewed through the eyes of heavy intoxication, this movie is so bad it's almost worth seeing once, but only with others.

It's clich\u00e9, over the top, unrealistic and the human hero is a self-insertion of L. Ron's on belief that he was the greatest man to have ever lived. And that's not true by a long shot, since I'm here.\n\nSo anyway, the idea is that in the year 3000 CE humans are dominated by a malicious race known as \"Psychlos\" (L. Ron instilled a fear of Psychiartrists into Scientologists, or \"Psyches\" as he called them, claiming they were behind the concentration camps in Nazi Germany) and humanity has turned into a bunch of pack animals that eat rocks and rats. The Psychlos are using people to hunt for gold (again, one of L. Ron's batshit crazy beliefs) and misuse them and treat them like animals.\n\nThat's about as far as I got. I watched about 45 minutes of this crap and couldn't finish it. What has is bad has already been said and is deserving of the critique.\n\nBut take a moment to think about this. L. Ron wrote this...thing...and was meant to have written the 'holy' texts of the Church of Cashmaking, er, Scientology. If people are taking this as fact, then there is something wrong with them. As I said. I did my research. People believe this is going to be a real future event. Pathetic."

Just to state, I am not a Scientology fan, or follower, and I have not been brain washed from any of Hubbard's writings. I am simply a Science Fiction fan, and have long awaited this film's release since reading Battlefield Earth some 10 - 15 years ago. Having said that this film falls miles below the depth and intrigue offered by the novel. Of course they would have needed to make at minimum a 4 or 6 hour movie, or movies in order to capture the essence of the novel, but it would have been worth while to do so. There is so much glorification of characters in the movie that the characters with the exception of Travolta as Terl are mere shadows of what Hubbard intended. I have read other posts here that state Travolta's race is depicted as cruel, and horrific, and that they thought this was Travolta's doing as his own input into the film, but he certainly hit the nail on the head with this one, as the Psychlo race is suppose to be cruel as well as highly intelligent. The film skims over important points such as the mathematics that the Psychlos build their entire empire on which just happens to be the most powerful in the entire universe. Terl's bumbling idiocy is apparent through his the film, as well in the novel, which explains his being outcast to such a desolate planet as Earth.\n\nThe entire relationship between Terl and Jonnie is omitted, as well as the struggles of Jonnie as he deals with the realization that he has become the leader of the remaining humans on Earth. In addition the entire last third to quarter of the novel is left out of the movie. The charter depicted in the movie is nothing like that of the one written in the novel. This is unfortunate as you really learn to care for Jonnie in the novel and you don't get that same feeling from the movie. All in all I give this movie a 5 out of 10, perhaps a little higher than it deserves, but if you have read the book first you fill in the spaces as you go, and you tend to omit the crap inserted by the film makers to beef up the visual effects."

Ron Hubbard's impressive science fiction novel \"Battlefield Earth\" comes to the big screen-and it's one of the ugliest, most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. Let's not beat around the bush here, \"Battlefield Earth,\" everything you have heard about this movie's badness is true. Actually, I debated whether to even write this review since so many critics have rightfully bashed the movie already. However, the duty of a film critic is to pan the bad and praise the good movies. I am hardly going to betray my roots for a piece of trash like \"Battlefield Earth.\"\n\nThe \"screenplay\" by Corey Mandell is unorganized and riddled with problems. The special effects convey some of the most phony, cheesy, and superficial computer animation ever seen on screen. Even big stars John Travolta and Forest Whitaker become lost in the material. They contribute the worst performances of their lives. To save time, name any aspect of \"Battlefield Earth\" and it's probably terrible.\n\nProduced by Jonathan D. Krane, Elie Samaha, and John Travolta, and on a budget of over 70 million, \"Battlefield Earth\" was not a cheep mistake. Hollywood needs to be more careful with its precious money. Movies are not a medium in which angry filmmakers can heap garbage at America. This film bombed at the box office and will haunt the producers to their graves. Thank God America spit at this despicable mess of a motion picture.\n\nThe most shocking thing about this movie is the massive talent involved. John Travolta is a multiple Academy Award nominated actor. The Cannes Film Festival rewarded Forest Whitaker the best actor award a few years ago. Berry Pepper starred in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award winning WWII epic \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The director is two-time Academy Award-winner Roger Christian. Designer Patrick Tatopoulos helped on such blockbusters as \"Independence Day\" and \"Stuart Little.\" Speaking of \"Independence Day,\" the Best Visual Effects Academy Award winner from that film, Joe Wiskocil, also worked on \"Battlefield Earth.\" Some of Hollywood's biggest producers, including Travolta himself, gambled big bucks on this project. With so much talent involved and so much going for it, how in the world could this movie be this bad?\n\nAll of those award winning film contributors now have a whole crap load of contradictory awards to add to their shelves. \"Battlefield Earth\" won big at the Razzie Awards-winning the worst picture of the year, worst actor of the year (Travolta), worst director of the year, worst on screen couple of the year (John Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him), worst screenplay, worst supporting actor (Pepper and Whitaker), and worst supporting actress (Kelly Preston). This alone should raise a flag for anyone who still wants to see \"Battlefield Earth.\"\n\nThere is no sense in explaining the movie's plot or listing the countless flaws in the production. It would take too long, waste too much space, and you would not care anyway. However, if I can still convince just one person not to waste their life away on this film-just one person-then I have done my job."

I stared at my TV in total disbelief at the complete stupidity of this! Maybe it was meant to be a farce? Not since Zardoz have I sat there and wondered, \"WTF am I watching???\" At least Zardoz had Sean Connery!\n\nSo it's way way in the future - like a thousand years. Human civilization was conquered by aliens long ago, called \"Psychlos\", who have big heads with dreadlocks and wear platform Frankenstein boots! Yes, I said dreadlocks! - I suddenly feel a bad reggae song coming on -\n\nWhat's left of humanity lives pretty much as slaves to the aliens and have been reduced to the level of cave people. They even grunt like apes when they fight. Seriously! It's laughable to watch. But, when they are not grunting, they actually speak very good English.\n\nSo one human (Pepper) is randomly selected to learn alien technology so he can perform some secret work for the big boss dread-locked alien, played by a rather comical Travolta. Pepper decides instead to use this new found wisdom to rally the humans and . . . \"Stand up! Stand up! Stand up for their rights!\" (Sorry, couldn't help it) Long story short, in 7 days (seriously, SEVEN days) Pepper and a handful of humans learn how to fly harrier jets that have been sitting for 1000 years and are perfectly clean and shiny with absolutely no rust - not to mention the fuel that has managed to stand the test of time! Which is an incredible feat because the gas in my snowblower won't last until the next winter!\n\nThe special effects are sub par for the generation, the costumes are just ridiculous! The dread-locked aliens bear a striking resemblance to Klingons from Star Trek the Next Generation and the humans all appear to have long hair mullets but are clean shaving. They are very clean cave men!\n\nI'll give it a star because I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of it all. And if you need to laugh at something stupid, this is your movie!

At the time I had no interest, John Travolta was the guy from Face/Off, Broken Arrow, and Pulp Fiction. Seeing him in a sci-fi action title didn't interest me in the least. So fast forward 15 years later and I catch this gem on DVD at a garage sale for $0.15 and I have to buy it. Why? Mostly because buying it second hand this way ensures none of my money goes to Scientology, but mainly because I was dared once before to watch this movie a few years ago and couldn't find a legit copy anywhere. So now I figured I would take that $5 challenge to sit through the whole movie start to end without interruption. Needless to say I lost $5.15 that day. This film is abysmal and is the reason why there needs to be a 0 rating on IMDb. There is not a single redeeming feature to the entire production: the credits are crap, the music is terrible, the acting is bad, the dialogue is forced and uninteresting, the special effects are not that special (this movie came out 7 years AFTER Jurassic Park and the effects in that are 1000 times better), the costumes are just ridiculous Mad Max rip offs, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. Avoid this film unless it is for ironic reasons or to torture someone. Even then be forewarned there is a strong possibility you will fall asleep while watching it (as I did)."

Yes, the plot is alarmingly full of holes. Yes the art direction was an amalgamation of STARTREK-STARWARS-EVERY OTHER SCIFI MOVIE. But i liked it. I know I should have my head examined. Something about the bad plot, hammy acting, and downright hilarious dialog(Crap-lousy! priceless) just rubbed that cheesy-movie bone right. This is glorious 21st-century-film Camp at its best. This IS right in line with Roadhouse as best unintentional comedy. This DVD goes right next to RH on the \"yeah-i-liked-that-movie-SO_WHAT!\" category.\n\nalso, this movie would have never seen the light of day, If that Hack writer-turned-\"Religious\" icon :L.Ron Hubbard was not the author."

        "review_detailed_main": "Guess I'm odd man out on this one. I always liked it for what it is. Reading the majority of reviews leads me to believe people find this film quite implausible and cheesy. You better believe it is! That's actually one of the things I enjoyed about the film. There's no mental/emotional heavy lifting here. That's OK sometimes.\n\nI have a hard time believing the movie was made to be taken that seriously in the first place. LOL ... If that's what you're expecting, then yeah ... you'll be disappointed. There's plenty of glaring plot holes, and other inconsistencies. They're very, very easy to see, but my personal take on it is that It's just for fun. It's practically a farce. The actors do a wonderful job hamming this thing up (it's completely over the top) and mostly, it makes me laugh. I think they did a great job in this context.\n\nI give extra props to Whitaker and Travolta here. They play their parts (greedy, self-serving, arrogant aliens) to the hilt here. Pepper sticks to his role in earnest. That's mostly what makes this work for me.\n\nAgain, I don't know if the filmmakers intended to make the next \"Star Wars\" or sci-fi blockbuster here. Seems to be what the public was expecting. If that's the case, they might very well have been disappointed. I didn't approach this film with those expectations, which may be why I accept it for what it is: a pulp science fiction film that doesn't ground itself in \"reality\" any more than is necessary to advance the plot! It also has a certain unique cinematic (almost comicbook-like) styling to the film that I actually liked.\n\nWant to say also, (after reading some of the other reviews) I don't know anything about Scientology or Hubbard. This had zero influence on my viewing the film. I did not perceive that the movie has any religious bent or major social/moral message to it. There's \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" - that's about it. Certainly nothing overly profound or complicated.\n\nIf being completely implausible is reason alone to dislike a sci-fi film, than I should like very few of them. Sure, if you're willing to sit through an intelligent sci-fi film like \"Interstellar\" you might feel smarter for it, but I'm not afraid to admit I thought it was ... well, (gulp) kinda boring and depressing. I think I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth again. Rat Brain!"

The scene about humans liking rats as their favorite food stands out. It is especially enjoyable after hearing Scientologists brag about how aware and cosmic conscious they are. This movie makes about as much sense as Dianetics. There are so many inconsistencies it boggles the mind. Believe it or not, Travolta still talked about making a sequel even the week after the movie had bombed more ways than thought possible. If you love bad movies, DO NOT MISS IT! Otherwise, avoid this one like the plague. One good thing that this movie has caused is the downgrading of that imbecile John Travolta as a screen idol."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand why most people hated this movie. The only thing I can come up with is to blame the marketing folks who put together the trailers, which made the movie out to be serious science fiction. It isn't. It's a comedy. Only a small handfull of serious movie fans would not be majorly disappointed over having been duped. I consider myself to be a serious movie fan and I love Battlefield Earth. The performances by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were so funny I could hardly stop laughing and the comic book camera angles completely blew me away. Yes, the story is silly but that just makes the movie even sillier...perfect for a comedy, and just what I would have hoped for. Actually, I feel sorry for people who are so critical they can't enjoy themselves. I watch around 70 movies every single month....movies being my only passion....and I enjoy better than 95% of everything I watch. Obviously, I do quite a bit of research before I select a film and I also have a few simple tricks to keep my level of disappointment to a minimum. One is really simple. I've noticed I like almost everything Roger Ebert likes so I can easily add his thumbsup picks to my list. If Roger pans something, I look a little deeper to see if any viewers liked the movie and why they liked it. Yep, Roger sometimes has a bad day and ends up panning a movie that is actually quite good. Reading movie reviews from average viewers helps alot, also. Battlefield Earth is a good example. If you scan the reviews, you'll notice a few people who loved the movie and alot of people who hated it. Try to figure out why those few people loved it, what they saw that others may have missed, and you might discover a true gem. For the record, I also liked Heavens Gate, Water World, and Billy Murray's Razors Edge.....all of which were heavily panned. Bottom line.....if you're looking for a seriously \"fun\" movie in a comic book format with John Travolta doing his funniest stuff ever, try Battlefield Earth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Picture this. There is this caveman, ok? Raised a hunter-gatherer in a pagan world. OK? No problem. He's in a Harrier Jump Jet. Ok? He has just crashed the plane into a huge dome at an astounding speed on purpose. He's not hurt at all. Ok? He sees crates of fuel and explosives, lying for absolutely no reason on top of this dome, right next to him. Ok? He takes out a bazooka which he luckily remembered to bring, and blows the fuel, explosives, the dome and himself to smithereens. Ok? So, what is this, one of those silly Zuckerman movies like 'The Naked Gun', where the surreal is the order of the day? Nope. Is it a comedy at all? Nope. It's the latest sci-fi thriller from John Travolta and pals, BATTLEFIELD EARTH.\n\nNow, maybe the situation of a caveman flying an airplane into a dome and blowing it all up with weirdly placed props is explained. Ok, so it's a little farfetched, but it's all explained in a way so that it's believable, right?\n\nLet me answer that in the manner of a Psychlo: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! In man-animal-language, that means 'No way. This movie is so downright stupid and boring that it defies belief'. The last half hour or so is fun because it's just so insanely stupid and intelligence-insulting, but everything before that is a boring waste of time. It's not even bad in a fun way, it's bad in a 'I will rip your arm off and beat you to death with the bloody end'-way.\n\nAnyway, the lowdown is this: The year is 3000, and mankind, we are told, is an endangered species. It turns out Earth was invaded by Psychlos (Klingons without the charm) about 1000 years ago and wiped the entire planet clear of humans. Almost. Because Psychlos are vulnerable to radiation (it makes their breathing gas explode - yes of course it does), the humans live in radioactive areas where the Psychlos can't get them.\n\nWe join our hero, Jonnie, as he learns his father was taken by the gods. Oh la la. He gets all stroppy and instantly starts leaking Hero Juice all over his torn caveman clothes. \"We must fight or we will never be free! Boo! Boo!\" He yells and everyone ignores him. But off he goes, into the unknown. In the unknown there is a huge golf ball for absolutely no reason. If you've seen it, you'd have noticed.\n\nAlso in the unknown are other humans, who buddy up with Jonnie. Then, all of a sudden, the shadow of a Psychlo turns up and starts shooting green balls of light after them. Sometimes the gun says 'BANG', other times it says 'ZAP' and other times still it says nothing at all. The sound effects guy was really concentrating on that one.\n\nAnyway, Jonnie and his new buddies are captured by the Psychlos, and we are introduced to John Travolta Psychlo and Forrest Whittaker Psychlo. They both look, and are, stupid. Jonnie shoots a few Psychlos and is not punished for it, and then he has a pointless fight with someone in a cage. All the while, the Psychlos are acting incredibly pointlessly and stupidly, and they get a disproportionate amount of screen time. This goes on for about 45 minutes where nothing - and I mean NOTHING - happens. Not a jot. Zip. Just a lot of talking, yelling (for the humans) and laughing insanely (for the Psychlos).\n\nI must mention the Psychlo sense of humour, since it is all over this endless 45 minutes. The joke is always the same: one Psychlo says: \"Oh no, WE will not kill you.\" The other Psychlo says \"Oh thank Hubbard for that! I thought my days were numbered\" (the actual dialogue from the film was, believe it or not, much worse than this example.) \"No\", says the first Psychlo, \"WE will not kill you. But *I* will kill you!\". Second Psychlo looks stunned with surprise and gets shot. First Psychlo: \"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\" And that's it. The joke is always reading the sentence to the letter and then finding a little loophole to exploit. The other Psychlo is always fooled by this, even though he has heard this kind of joke at least a million times before and has used the jokes himself a million times. This sort of joke is endlessly referred to as being 'leverage'. If you get bored (and you will) then count the number of times the word 'leverage' is uttered.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the movie, someone seems to have remembered that a movie needs a plot of some sort. Ok, so we're told that the Psychlos are mining the Earth for gold. Since they have incredible technology like intergalatic teleportation and the like, they of course have an advanced spectroscopy machine to locate the gold ore via satellite. Oh, wait, no they don't. They just happen to find a gold mine in a radioactive mountain. OK, we know that Psychlos are allergic to radiation, so they of course just deploy some robotic miner. No, hang on, they don't have robotic miners. So they want to use the man-animals to mine the gold for them. So, they pick Jonnie, because he's the hero, and teach him everything about the psychlo language and how to mine, so he can teach the others. While they are at it, they also teach him everything he needs to know about Psychlo security codes and procedures, because that's really relevant. They also teach him how to read human language somehow, and he is taken to a library where he is allowed to read as much as he wants about anything he feels like. We notice that the Psychlos are very good at keeping their slaves ignorant so they don't start a rebellion or anything. Oh yeah and he is taught to fly a Psychlo plane as well.\n\nThey are dumped by the radioactive gold mine and told to get going. To keep an eye on them he has a drone fly by the mine once every 24 hours or so. The Psychlo DO in fact have little miniature cameras with a huge range, but they seem to forget that and opt for the inefficient drone option instead. This gives Jonnie the change to forget about mining and just fly to FORT KNOX to get the gold! Yes, Fort Knox! The most enforced place on the planet, impossible to penetrate. Unless you're cavemen of course, in which case the outer door is just a piece of sheet metal you can knock over, and the door to the vault is left wide open. When the Psychlos go back for the gold, they don't wonder for one minute how the humans got the 'mined' gold smelted into bar form without any sort of equipment.\n\nThe Fort Knox part leads into the stupid and fun part of the movie. I won't tell too much to spoil it for you, but the caveman in a harrier jump jet scene kinda sums it up. Oh, and look out for the effect of one atomic bomb on the Psychlo home planet.\n\nIn short, I wouldn't call this a bad film. I would call this an absolutely, mindwrenchingly terrible film. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! (Psychlo Humour again)"

No. Battlefield Earth actually a pretty interesting premise, namely an alien species has taken over the earth as asset into their inter-galactic corporation. Humans on earth have somehow been sent back to the tribal ages and are seen as any other animal on earth by the aliens. Cheer for the tribals as they try to revolt.\n\nTravolta tries his best as security officer responsible for safeguarding the corporation's interests on earth, but it's a hard role to play convincingly.\n\nThe movie is mostly let down by tribal human actors. Both their screenwriting as their acting is subpar. Their entire dialogue during the movie is cliche upon cliche.\n\nBut for me, the premise of the movie is what kept me interested. What if we encountered a superior alien species? Would we be treated like and evolve into tribal man-animals?\n\n7/10 If you like Harry Potter, give this movie a try!"

I would like to add to the dude up there that said the Psychlos and Ciatrists were a pot shot at Psychiatry, if you would've actually read the book or listened to the movie you would have found that the other race was NOT the ciatrists but the Chinklos and did it also ever occur to you that perhaps the origination for the name Psychlos came from the word Psycho?? Looks to me as if you were just grasping at straws to relate the religion to the movie (a relation that is NOT there).

So long as movies like this make it to theater no one can ever say to me, \"Burning movies is bad,\" this kind of film makes me wish Hollywood was not in business.\n\nNow on to the main event. What was good? Um\u0085 did you read above? Or see my rating? NOTHING IS GOOD. There are moments when I wonder if a movie worse then this is possible\u0085 (Yes I have seen plan nine from outer space and let me tell you, that's got nothing on this.)\n\nWhat was bad? Well let me count the ways. 1) bad acting, horrible acting, stone flat acting that makes you want to cry, sad and pathetic acting worse (That's right worse) then you see in daytime television or made for TV movies. 2) BAD ACTION, possibly the only thing one might have expected out of this film was a little action, some killing, possibly a few explosions. While there are explosions and futuristic guns, this is not a cool sci-fi flick. Think horrible camera work, no sense of timing, and no sense at all, watching grass grow gives one a better sense of satisfaction then watching an action scene from this HORRIBLE MOVIE. 3) You know what, I am done there, if I put one more word down about how bad it is I will go nuts, simple don't see it, ever, it's not worth it."

The makings are there for a good old fashioned Space Opera & the plot holes could have been fixed or minimized. I have always said that most movies are designed to separate a twelve year old lad from his allowance & this movie, even with it's flawed script, could do that. I have no knowledge of Scientology nor do I wish to have any (that goes for most other religions as well) but it does seem to me that the spectre of Scientology looms over the movie. There seems to be an enmity towards the film that is unjustly transferred from the controversy surrounding the religion. Even with better execution the movie would have had to get past this controversy thing. It is almost impossible to do a remote postmortem on the production. I do think the finger can be reasonably pointed at the top executives & perhaps narrowed down to poor counsel to them or excessive interference by them. Many good stories & books have been lost in translation to the movie medium by the same management problems. I actually found the film to be watchable enough but then I was raised on cheap 50s monster movies. There are monumental plot holes in many of them too so I guess I have a bigger tolerance than a younger & more sophisticated audience. I for one feel sorry that Travolta lost so much money on the project. One last curious fact. Don't I remember the remote control explosive collar thing being used by real world crooks a few years back? I guess that proves that life imitates art."

Based on a work by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, this movie focuses on the ultraviolent alien species Psychlos that enslave and study the last living humans in the 31st Century. The humans rebel and join forces to destroy these damn dirty aliens once and for all. As a person who's not quite into science fiction movies, I found out early on why this movie is often considered the worst. The laughable Psychlo designs look like troll dolls covered in moss with dirty mops on their heads. Despite being the leader of the superior conquering alien race, Terl (John Travolta) has no idea how to communicate with the humans or what food they eat. The humans also have inconsistent tendencies, the shopping mall mannequin worshippers that give away their weapons to villains, but yet know to use a nuclear bomb to take out the Psychlos' planet. Seriously, you'd think Terl and his gang would have wiped out the human race on Earth with the use of radioactive fusion, rather than the other way around. So, with that said, Battlefield Earth is one miracle of a sci-fi flop. With the horrendous art direction, baffling idiotic inconsistencies and complete stupidity in the writing and characters, this movie is one giant intergalactic dog that has to be seen to be believed.

Half of it's enjoyment is in fact how cheesey it is. But the enjoyment is still there. The rest of the enjoyment is from Travolta's over done preformance. Whether he went into it with some intent to be somewhat mocking or if it just comes out that way, it's still amusing none the less.\n\nIt's no masterpiece but it's better then a one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, folks, I recommend this movie wholeheartedly! Why? Well, it seems to me that a lot of effort and money have gone into making this movie, even down to the filming of a \"making of\" documentary, leading you to believe that nobody actually realized how bad this film was until it actually bombed. The thing is, the movies' flaws are so blatantly obvious that you can't help wondering why nobody actually spotted them during production - perhaps people were too afraid to mention anything to the all-powerful John Travolta (it reminds me of a Disney epic that was supposed to be set in a mountain top castle in Norfolk, until one of the English production crew gingerly pointed out to the Disney executives that Norfolk is as flat as a pancake.) There are just so many holes in the storyline that the \"Goofs\" section just does not do the film justice, and key elements of the story are just so hairy as to be laughable. The baddies look like Klingons in high heels, and have the mentality of the Ferengi and intellect of a Walnut. To make matters worse, Travolta plays his role like some ridiculously camp fop - if this were a Jane Austin story you could understand it, but this is supposed to be the year 3000. How a race of aliens who were hyper-sensitive to radioactivity could conquer the world is as baffling as how they could occupy it for 1000 years and still not know what its inhabitants eat. Even more amazing is that this whole conquest thing is about gold - it seems that the aliens just wanted to rob us blind. You'd have thought that an advanced civilisation like theirs in possession of teleportation equipment would have figured out a way of teleporting the gold out from under us without all this conquest business... This film covers the first half of Hubbard's book - the second half was to be made into a sequel, but poor reviews saw an end to that idea. Shame - As I understand it, the sequel would have been even more preposterous than the first with intergalactic bankers seeking to \"repossess\" Earth in lieu of Psychlo debts... You just have to see this movie, even if only to laugh at how seriously it takes itself..."

The action is way too confusing at times with no idea of where or what is actually taking place (probably purposely, thinking that the general public likes big explosions and no plot...and if you do, this is your movie!). It's basically Independence Day with worse acting, a futuristic set, and a really bad pseudo-plot. The acting was not good...especially John Travolta! The editing and effects were absolutely stolen from the Star Wars films...complete with sweeping cuts from center to edge of screen.\n\nHardcore sci-fi fans might like it...but I would not recommend it to anyone else. I gave it 1 of 10, just because there was no zero. It is not the worst film I have seen (see: Christmas Evil), but you'd expect a lot more in the decisions of a so-called star.\n\nMr. Travolta...you are actually a good actor, but you've made maybe three good movies in your lifetime...think before you take your next role.

It had loose plotlines, symbols which the director forgets to make important, and worst of all, it was the most unrealistic scifi movie I have ever seen. Needless to say, it was a 120 minute countdown until the final curtain was finally drawn.\n\nThe symbols shown throughout the movie are bizarre, and they don't really ever show up again. I won't go through them to spoil the actual story, but if you see something early in the movie that you may think is important to the plot, don't worry, it won't be. You can usually completely forget the scene you just saw, because it doesn't really have any bearing on the rest of the movie.\n\nOn the level of pure scifi, it was an even worse movie. One of the great ideas behind Star Trek is the believability of the technology. Even if we cannot build a transporter or a teleporting pad, we the audience have an idea of how they work. This is one of the great strengths of star trek, it's accessibility. Battlefield Earth throws out many fancy gadgets, but tells you nothing about them, or it shows many other items which have been lying around for about 1000 years, and they still have power. The logistics of the movie are very poor to say the least. 1000 years is a long time for equipment to sit, some cars can't sit a week without running, or else they will die.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a good time, go else where, if you're looking for action, go elsewhere, and if you're looking for integrity and acting, you'll really want to avoid this one.\n\n(ps. count the number of times the word \"leverage is used, or the number of times the main character is choked.......goodness guys, c'mon, be kinda original...)"

I don\u00b4t know what was worse, the idiodic plot, the bowel wrenching acting or the dialog from hell. Sorry Mr. Travolta these types of movies makes me, a former fan, really think twice before seeing your next one."

Not only did he further enhance his reputation as a big fat pile of crap who'll star in anything that keeps his plane in the air, but he also managed to ruin the burgeoning career of Barry Pepper who'd shown genuine promise in Saving Private Ryan.\n\nI suppose one could lay the blame at the doors of the ridiculous 'Church' of Scientology who no doubt had a hand in convincing Travolta that the infantile scribblings of its founder would make a good movie, but I don't know. Anyone who genuinely believes that starring in uber-garbage like Be Cool or Look Who's Talking Too is a step in the right direction must surely shoulder most of the blame.\n\nFilth."

This SF-Film has the biggest Plot holes since the late 1950s, the acting is bad and the story, which would give room for a good movie (or at least an acceptable)is just blown into pieces. And regarding the plot holes: I am not only talking about scientific plot holes. There are sequences and ideas in this film which make the fairy tales which my mom stopped to tell me at the age of 3 look like history-factbooks.

One of the most infuriating things about this movie is the complete lack of any creativity in order to explain the obvious inconsistencies and conflicts of logic in the plot and story, like using 1000 year old weapons and airplanes!; either the creators of this film think that anyone who would watch this movie are completely retarded (which may be true, and that includes me!), or the people who made this movie are freaking delusional- both are obviously true! The only thing that pleased me about this movie is knowing that Travolta fronted most of the finances for this movie in hopes that it would make something in return and spread the word of Scientology, only to have it completely destroy his flailing career and show how out of touch these isolated actors can become."

Suffice it to say that repeated viewings (thanks, HBO) will convince you that whoever wrote the screenplay adaptation had to either be brain-damaged beyond belief or seriously wanted to sabotage Travolta's career. Not that he needed any help here; Travolta redefines scenery-chewing, making Snidely Whiplash look as subtle as DeNiro in comparison. It's a performance you'd expect to see from your high-school drama department on a bad night.\n\nEven the technical aspects of the film were badly handled. Why were all of the scenes shot through blue filters? Did the director decide he really likes tilting his head, or perhaps have a permanent neck cramp? Why do humans sound like apes after 1000 years in the wild, when humans live in tribal communities all over the world without screeching at each other like Cheetah warning Tarzan? I won't even bother with the most commented stupidities this film has to offer.\n\nAn interesting fact: women rate this film higher than men. If you look at the IMDB vote statistics, the only two demographic groups to rate this film above a 3 are women between 18-29 and women between 30-44. I find that absolutely incredible, especially considering the window-dressing attitude that the film takes with females, both human and Psychlo. In fact, I can only remember two female characters that had any lines at all, and one of those is a cameo by Travolta's real-life wife, Kelly Preston, in a role with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nWatch it for its unintended humor -- especially the Psychlo boots; good Lord, who designed those, Andy Warhol's ghost?"

I'm not one to stop a movie halfway through so I figured we should at least let this dredge finish.

First, Travolta, giving the worse performance he has ever given. He wasn't even like a real villain. He was more like a caricature of a villain. His incessant \"evil laughter\" became laughable itself halfway through the movie. I half expected him to start stroking his mustache while tying a girl to a railroad track while we patiently awaited the arrival of the lone ranger. If Travolta is lucky, he'll be getting a call from Tarrantino offering to jump start his career again.\n\nSecond, Barry Pepper, who was enjoyable in Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile seemed like he was trying to imitate Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in Braveheart. His speeches, meant to sound inspiring were annoying and made me want even more to turn the movie off even more.\n\nThird, the screenplay seemed like it was written by a three year old. It was so predictable I knew what the next person was going to say half the time.\n\nThere are so many more reasons i could give you not to see this movie, but I'm sure between my review and the reviews of others on this list a good half of them will be mentioned.

Reportedly the film was taken back and re edited after it's disastrous theatrical run in the hopes of improving it, that's why it was delayed on route to video, DVD and cable. One Internet critic swears that the re edit was in fact worse than the original theatrical cut. Either way though, Battlefield Earth cannot be salvaged. This film truly is one of the biggest fiascos to come down from the high mountain of Hollywood in this or any other century. I won't go into the many plot and logic problems, as they have been covered in great detail already. I will say that the film fails (at least for me anyway) due to the fact that nothing, and I mean nothing memorable, ever appears on the screen. Nothing sticks in your mind, it's like watching a blank tape or scrambled TV image. Nothing is there. Continuity is bad too. It seems that in some instances the director went straight to \"C\" while ignoring \"A\" and \"B\" all together. It's also hard to accept the Psychlos (or whatever they are called) for they are without doubt one of the goofiest looking alien races ever created, a cross between the Klingons, the Predators and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein, with none of the originality. You laugh at these so called villains, with their clod hopper boots (that several of the actors have difficulty moving around in) and over size cod peices. I doubt that humour was the intent, but a good laugh is what you get at the bad guys' exspense. The various human characters aren't much better. You can't get drawn in when the bad guys are silly and the human heroes do not elicit sympathy. I wish I had a dollar for everytime that Travolta yelled out \"rat brain,\" though.\n\nThankfully the misguided talk of a sequel has dried up, but the fall out of this megaton turkey will linger for years to come. So beware America!"

Does Forest Whitaker know that he looks like a reject from a Wizard of Oz revival???\n\nAs I'm sure everybody who reads this already knows, John Travolta is Terl. 1000 years before, the evil alien race of Psychlos have taken over the entire Earth (in 9 minutes no less), and those who survived now live either in scattered outposts, or are enslaved by the Psychlos. In comes Johnny \"Goodboy\" Tyler to save the day.\n\nThe premise itself is cool enough, and having never read the novel, I can only assume (hope?) that it's better than this space-wreck of a movie. So full of implausibilies, Battlefield Earth is more of a comedy than a straight-faced sci-fi film. 1000 year-old planes that still fly? Heck, their paint even shines. Books left in the open air that are still readable and not falling apart? Come on.\n\nThe film does serve the purpose of being a party game. Count the number of times the word \"Man-animal\" is used! How many times do the Psychlos refer to the \"home office\"? How long can Travolta go without cackling?\n\nTravolta seems to think that the world is clamoring for a Battlefield Earth 2. He may be right. Until the sequel comes out, I can't imagine another film in the meantime can be such a joke. We may be clamoring, Mr. Travolta, but not for the reasons you think.\n\nMy grade: F"

As per all Hollywood movies you just need to get your head around the unbelievable events that make the story work, usually things like people being in the right places at the right times and 1 in a billion coincidences etc that always seem to take place on the silver screen, in this movies case the adult primitive humans all seem to have a learning curve equal to Einstein to the power of 10. Lets face it, this movie is not reality but very very few action/sci-fi movies are if any. If you take into account that every single one of Steven Segals pathetic, predictable, nothing new, movies in this database rates higher than Battlefield Earth you must surely agree that this movie has been very unfairly rated."

        "review_detailed_main": "Battlefield Earth is still a fun slice of old school sci-fi fun, it is very silly at times & very stupid at times but it's nearly always entertaining or atleast to me. Yeah some of it is dumb, some of it silly but it's entertaining & old school fun.\n\nI've honestly seen way, way worse films that were Mega Budget \"Blockbusters\" such as 65, The Predator, all of \"Bayformers\" films, all of the Fast & Furious films, all of the Ocean Eleven films, some Marvel films (including Deadpool) & some DC films (including Shazam) all of the Tom Cult Cruise mission impossible films, Battleship, Terminator Genisys, Terminator Salvation, Godzilla, Godzilla king of all monsters, Pacific Rim 1&2, Oblivion, War of the Worlds, Minority Report, Army of the Dead, MIB 4, Wanted, Babylon A. D, Ghostbusters: Afterlife & many more totally crap films, Battlefield Earth is better than all of those in my opinion. But as we know Battlefield Earth still has many, many big problems & huge plot holes & stuff that just doesn't make sense.....but if you don't think too hard about it then the film is mindless sci-fi action fun. There is parts of it that are great, such as the \"Planet of the Apes\" style beginning scenes which in like best. I like the old abandoned mall scenes & the scenery of destroyed cities & the parts where Barry Pepper is just wondering around the beautifully created ruined scenery.\n\nWe all know how hated on this movie is & most of it is justified but i still find lots of bits to enjoy in this big silly but fun sci-fi flick. A bigger budget B-movie really with alot crammed into it.\n\nTravolta is ridiculous as the main evil alien & does look silly as all the Aliens do but it's got that very '90s sci-fi adventure feel to it so i dig it like Independence day, Stargate & Waterworld, or something along those lines.\n\nI'm a big Barry Pepper fan & i think he was easily the best in the movie as the courageous but still, dumb at times caveman tribe hero & he lifts it more as he's genuinely a great serious actor & still puts in a solid performance. Also Barry Pepper is one of the most underrated actors ever.\n\nThe special fx look fantastic so no complaints there at all!!! Battlefield Earth does have a nice relaxing late-night movie vibe to it that i really liked. Some films are just better being viewed late at night & Battlefield Earth is one of them. Many nights I've put on this film & just chilled out watching it. I like the colours, blue & green, that give the film a glowing comic book look & i really do enjoy the quiet peacefulness of all the beginning scenes right up til the old derelict shopping mall attack. I loved the filming of the mall hunt scene, with the big dreaded alien zapping everything & seen in small glimpses. Those moments made the big dumb alien creatures \"Psychlos\" seem threatening & Barry Pepper gets to run around & smash through a few plates of glass in Blade Runner style. See there's some good stuff in Battlefield Earth, just a shame there's also as much nonsense too. But i enjoy the chunks of fun 90's sci-fi action that they did get right & just not take it all seriously, it's fun.\n\nThe music is also great throughout the film & i liked the colour scheme of the movie & one scene i genuinely loved was the big empty abandoned mall sequence, it's a great scene full of action & fun.\n\nSome chunks of this film are ridiculous but other parts are great fun with a very pulpy trashy apocalyptic look & feel to it all so yeah there's good stuff in this adventure flick.\n\nI don't ever follow the critics & i usually like alot of films they hate so that doesn't bother me at all!!!\n\nI enjoy Battlefield Earth have watched it lots of times & i like the camera angles & the stunning cinematography too.\n\nA fun sci-fi adventure but nothing special & yes there's lots that really don't make sense but it's an easy late night watch."

This film is horrible, literally the worst film I have ever seen. I worked at a movie theater and so I watched it for free and I still walked out. The canted camera angles and cheap looking production make it hard on the eyes. The acting especially by Travolta is ludicrious, you have expect him to gnaw on the set he's so over the top. So little thought went into making this film. The best example is that the aliens are supposed to be eight feet tall so the best that they came up with was to have the actors wear three foot platform shoes. So all the alines lumber about looking ready to topple over at any moment. Their can only be one reason that this movie got release and is receiving positive reviews on this site and that's Scientology, which is fine, but it is what it is. Don't let anyone fool you, this movie is much worse than you can possibly imagine."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's something very strange about the bad movie that is Battlefield Earth. I saw it months ago and thought it was the silliest thing I'd seen in years: wildly overacted, completely implausible, and possessing an absolutely brainless plot.\n\nThe movie isn't bad because it was made by a lethargic director. Rather, Battlefield Earth's awfulness is the product of the bizarre and feverish direction of Roger Christian. Yes, Christian directed this movie as a man possessed: ending each scene with a rather tired-looking middle-wipe fadeout, shooting the dynamic duo of Terl n'Ker at a neck bending 15 degree angle, and coming in for a lot of disgusting closeups with the disgusting \"Psychlos\".\n\nThe plot adds both badness and hilarity to this movie. Terl is, without a doubt, the most mentally-challenged supervillain in cinematic history. Many others have been awed by the 1000 year old Harriers, their caveman pilots, and the magical simulator these top guns nee cavemen use to master their new steeds. Additionally, there is Terl's bizarre insistence on teaching the rat-brains nuclear physics, without any need to do so. Certain words are repeated feverishly and quite meaninglessly: \"leverage\", \"man-animals\", \"rat-brains\", \"the home office.\" Meanwhile Travolta laughs hysterically and uncontrollably at jokes that a lowbrow 9 year old would shrug at, Whitaker growls like a second rate Klingon, and Barry Pepper does his best to act uber-heroic. It's a mess worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nAll of this is both bad and somehow quite funny. I have read musings by Christian that he and the crew wanted to get the sequel out even after Battlefield Earth tanked so badly. If he manages to pull this off, I might even show up to laugh myself silly - again. Nor would I really mind seeing it again for laughs.\n\nOne idea he might consider is buffing up his feeble storyline by merging it with that of another movie - kind of a Hardy Boys meets Nancy Drew type arrangement. Here are some plot ideas for Roger:\n\n-Here on Battlefield Earth: In the year 3000, a drag race between two man-animals in ancient cars results in the destruction of the local Psychlo diner. The evil Terl forces the two young rat-brains to work together to rebuild the establishment - and gives them both a crash course on nuclear fission. Can they overcome their class differences and rivalry over pouty heroine Leelee Sobieski in order to take back the planet?\n\n-Terl, Interrupted: In the late 60's, Terl is committed to a mental institution. Can his budding friendship with sociopathic woman-animal Angelina Jolie help him overcome his pathological need for \"leverage\" and poor sense of humor?\n\n-American Psychlo: In the late 80's, Terl finds work at a cutthroat Wall Street brokerage, where he becomes an accomplished serial killer who enjoys shooting the limbs off of cows and \"leverage\" buyouts."

Unfortunately, the book is over 1000 pages long and the last 900 pages are crammed randomly into the last 5 minutes of the movie.\n\nThe first 45 minutes or so seems to be a very close rendition of the opening of the novel. It sets up the situation quite well. It seems that the original idea was to make this into a mini-series on TV depicting the entire saga. It also seems that once the backers realized what they had, they pulled the plug on funding and the rest was completed as best as they could manage on what was left of the budget.\n\nSurprisingly enough, John Travolta plays Terl pretty much as he is described in the novel, but only for the first half of the movie. Who knows what he was playing later on, but it wasn't Terl. Terl didn't talk to people in the novel, he talked at them.\n\nMaking Battlefield Earth into a two-hour movie was roughly the same as it would be cutting up the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy into just two hours. The result was a mess. In the book, the time-line is stretched over a period of three or four years with every action meticulously described. In the movie, I think it lasted about a week and ignored the bulk of the action.\n\nThis movie isn't even good enough to be bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot has been written on this film, both before and after its release. Whoever said there was no such thing as bad publicity obviously hasn't heard of this. Prior to it's release, there was controversy over both its Scientology background, with fears being raised as to possible subliminal messages, and from the producers, talking of a film that would top Star Wars. Neither George Lucas nor concerned parents need have lost any sleep.\n\nAfter bombing on its release, amidst the sound of critical panning, Battlefield Earth still remains at the front of people's minds, but for the very wrong reasons. Having watched this film properly for the first time a few days ago, I can finally see what the fuss was all about.\n\nQuite simply, this is a textbook example of how not to make a film, a perfect showcase of everything that is wrong with big budget Hollywood. This movie fails on a quite astonishing amount of levels, making you wonder how anyone involved could sit back and say 'Yep, that's the one.' At least you could argue that small budget movies have an excuse for being rubbish, as they can't hire top name actors or production crew. It's incredible to think a post-Pulp Fiction Travolta or Forest Whitaker actually came within a million miles of this (well, apart from the whole Scientology thing.) So, where to begin? Well for a start, the script is simply wretched. The acting is similarly bad, although you have to wonder if any actor could turn in a decent performance reading those lines. Then there is the question of the directing and editing, the latter being quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Continuity was all over the place; for example on one scene Barry Pepper falls over (incidentally, he spends the entire moving doing that, running away or grimacing) near some steel pipes, yet lands in a patch of open ground. Or he runs into a forest, yet a few seconds later he appears to be in a quarry. That's before we even get to the pointless slow motion, the way lightning changes in between scenes, or the weird camera angles. Storyline, believability or scientific credibility you say? Well, here are but a few errors in the film; fires burn when there is no oxygen, guns destroy scenery yet only stun people, the alien baddies switch between English and alien language randomly, cities seem to have been abandoned for a decade, let alone a millennia, in one scene it's snowing yet the next it's the middle of summer, and so on. Perhaps the way the cavemen speak perfect English, yet can't understand what a square or a half is.\n\nThe aliens aren't any more impressive mind you. Called the Psychlos (clever huh? Never would've guessed they were the baddies) and absolutely definitely not bearing any resemblance to a certain Star Trek race, they are so stupid you wonder how they can walk and talk at the same time, let alone conquer the galaxy. Apparently stripping the galaxy bare of gold, they somehow conspire to miss Fort Knox. They think men are savages, yet live in the remains of cities and even visit a library. They really should've watched some old James Bond films as well, as they could've learned a few things about hiding your plans from your adversary.\n\nNow you might think this is a pretty damning list, but I haven't even got to the best bits. The caveman flying the harriers at the end will surely go down in movie folklore, facing stiff competition from the cow shooting scene, or the 'falling through 4 plates of glass' part. It goes beyond being one of those films that is so bad it's good, and transcends to a whole new plain of great-badness. Even the special effects range from average to rubbish, with the dome breaking at the end reminiscent of an early Playstation game. Good points? Well there were a few nice scenery shots. For the above reasons, and more I simply don't have the space to go into, I recommend everybody see this film, especially those who want to get involved in the film industry. It's a perfect example of what not to do.\n\nIncidentally, this film doesn't play properly on my DVD player. Perhaps its trying to tell me something?"

During the first Apeplanet-half of the film I did start to question my ability to absorb a cinematastic experience of this magnitude, and I had to take several breaks as I searched the IMDB for advice on how to stand the pain. But with a few of the more humorous comments in mind I ventured on into the second half. To my great surprise and pleasure, Battlefield Earth now evolved form its dull apeplanet remake form - over a MadMax/Army of Darkness inspired 'well-fight-them-with-science' where all of the human-animals suddenly develop an evolved way of thinking, plotting and gesturing - all in a matter of days - very fascinating. The last part of this - dare I say - Epic, is nothing short of an ID4 clone, and I can seriously recommend that you force yourself to see this part through - its very rewarding.\n\nConclusion: Yes its bad!! - one of the worst actually... No the plot is no better than your average 50's scifi film. Yes John Travolta deserves his hard earned raspberry award for worst actor.\n\nBut all in all this is a must for your next bad taste movie night!"

The script seemed to be written by the Wesayso corporation--\"Why were the Harriers functional after 1,000 years? Because we say so!\" \"Why were the humans able to suddenly learn to read and operate heavy machinery? Because we say so!\" Travolta's performance was more dull, flat, and lifeless than I've seen in a long time and inspired more mirth than menace. Throughout the movie, I kept turning to my friend and asking, \"Is this the part where Charlton Heston goes to talk to Yul Brinner/Anne Baxter/Yvonne DeCarlo/God\" (CHOOSE ONE), but I'll admit \"The Ten Commandments\", a howler in its own right, was aeons better than this mess."

I read Battlefield Earth when it came out. I felt that Travolta and crew were wise to break the book into two parts and cut the story at the correct point.\n\nThe book itself runs as the movie does. Lots of action, the movie is basically one long action sequence. The movie presents Hubbard's satircal humor well and if you have not read B'Earth (as most of those commenting here) and are into fiiillmmm (as it seems most commenting here are) then you will be too busy trying to figure out \"why the film angle?\" or looking for \"subliminals\" that some idiot claimed were in the movie.

The plot and acting are proposterous. Travolta looks like a complete and utter joke in his lame costume. Also, cliches run abound and everything seems to get sewn up in the last 10 minutes. If you want to laugh at really really awful movie, then rent battlefield earth. This movie should be called Battlefield crap. It is a waste of time and money on the producers part. Just think those millions of dollars wasted on this so called \"movie\" could have gone to a foreign country to save some starving children. Instead the money was wasted on bad direction, bad acting, bad costumes, bad special effects and an overall bad movie. ENJOY!!!"

Let me stress that I'm still talking about the BOOK at this point. It just so happens that Battlefield Earth, the movie, is playing on our university movie channel this month, so I figured since I didn't have to pay for it, I would watch it.\n\nAND it was the WORST adaptation of a book I've ever seen. From the first scene to the last battle, it was a confusing and pointless mess. The best elements of the book were left out. All of the triumphs of the humans over the Psychlos portrayed in the book fell flat in the movie. I could write about the specifics for hours and still not be able to convey just how awful this movie was. The sad part is that the movie could reflect badly on the book, which hopefully will not be the case.\n\nIf you see this movie and hate it, please read the book immediately to see how good the movie could have been.

Oh yes, John Travolta! He plays a mad greedy alien in such a ham way that it makes an Austin Power's movie look like a Royal Shakespeare Company production. His line delivery is so weird, and if it wasn't for the poor makeup and costume he's been given you would be drawn to conclude it was evidence of substance abuse. Travolta's antics unfortunately seem to have infected the rest of the cast who act in a manner that would have been rejected if given by the puppets from Sesame Street. If it isn't Forest Whitaker laughing for no apparent reason all the time, it's Barry Pepper trying to make up for his lack of dialogue through a series of grimaces. It's usually at this point that a reviewer will say, 'ah yes but...' and offer up either the story, action or effects as solace. Sadly none of these are executed any better, and in some respect much less so. The plot (and I assume the book makes more sense, please) has such big plot holes in it you could drive a Death Star through them. For example, the aliens take over earth and set about plundering it, a thousand years later they have still to notice a large building called 'Fort Knox' which is full of gold. And when I hero's want to fight back they - amazingly - come across a squadron of flyable Harrier jump jets. That they learn to fly in simulators in a few days. Moronic isn't the word. Many Sci-Fi film's are endearing enough that you can allow them some artistic license, no film is ever going to get as much as Battlefield Earth needs, ever. So in summary:- bad acting of a diabolical script of ridiculous story presented in a banal way with negligible style."

However, this has all been said in detail by other users. I will just say this. Do not watch this movie. In fact, encourage others not to watch this movie as well. Believe me, you will be doing yourself a favor.\n\nWill this become a cult classic as someone else suggested? Well, I've noticed a pattern associated with the so-called \"cult classic\".

I was expecting there to be something monumentally wrong with this movie from all the flack it has got, but what I saw when my dvd arrived(I had missed it in the cinema)was that this was a pretty decent sci-fi film with some action elements, and that may be the problem. That it is mainly aimed at people who liked Independence Day ID4 which was mostly an action, emotional(aww she died boo hoo) affair using Sci-Fi as a tool for the disaster. But what we have here in Battlefield Earth is an entirely different cookie, this is pretty much all sci-fi, not completely ground-breaking sci-fi but it's not bad sci-fi. It had some more unusual colours and angles which you wouldn't normally use but don't you get sick of the same old stuff? And the center crossfades for every change of scene may seem strange but they certainly give the movie a definite distinctive mark. pretty much all the characters involved were good, although I didn't really feel I got to know the other human characters in the film really, so any deaths that happened didn't mean a whole lot, as I said it's a pretty much whole sci-fi affair \"All except fantasy, there is none of that\". It didn't stick close enough to the book for me,(so far as I've heard the audio book) it mixes and changes scenes around adds and changes characters but it still stands on it's own even if not a totally accurate translation of the book. The plot is pretty well set out and apart from some minor twisting of rules of physics is quite solid, the characters are not 100% real but they are distinctive, I've seen too many films where characters can get easily confused in your mind. The soundtrack was addequate, the special effects in the day light looked strange and not very realistic but still very cool :)\n\nOverall it's really not that bad and I'd say that it is quite long but I don't think it's drawn out, Strangely I felt it was rushing through everything but taking a long time doing it(if you can work that out).\n\nI don't think it deserves half of the flack that it's been given, I think possibly that you have been influenced by the relationship of the movie with scientology via it's writer L Ron Hubbard, which is a shame.\n\nI suggest you see the movie for yourself rather than let other peoples opinions decide for you. 6/10"

It's difficult to imagine someone voting up this offal without an ulterior motive.\n\nWhere does one begin? The director has a very small bag of tricks, all of which appear to have been stolen from other directors' much larger bags. Someone really ought to explain to this man that tilting the camera can be effective OCCASIONALLY. Or that the use of split-screen wipes can be an interesting scene transition OCCASIONALLY.\n\nJohn Travolta can now rest assured that his performance in \"Urban Cowboy\" is no longer the most embarrassing of his career. The plot holes are far too numerous and large to list. This screenplay makes \"Independence Day\" look like \"Chinatown\". I'm sure Travolta wanted to make the name L. Ron Hubbard more prominent to the American public. Hopefully, he did just that, and the Pope of Scientology will henceforth be justifiably recognized as the greatest sci-fi hack who ever lived."

I'd just watched an interview with John Travolta on TV and he said it's a great movie (well, he would, wouldn't he?).\n\nFive minutes into the movie, I was looking at my watch to see how much longer I'd have to stick it out. The whole thing is loud and senseless, and I just can't figure what on earth on director was trying to do keeping the camera angel tilted at 30 degrees through most of the movie. It works on some shots, but on the whole it's the most irritating thing in movie history when overused for no apparent reason. The less said about the script writer the better, and the acting borders on the ludicrous, and the story line... well, maybe that's down to the original novel, but how can anyone take cavemen flying fighter jets in aerial combat seriously? And the movie expects us to take it seriously.\n\nAs soon as the movie was over, I walked into another movie theatre to watch Titan A.E. to renew my sense of faith in the genre.\n\nGive me Ed Wood's sci-fi films any day. They were bad, but they had a genuine honest feel about them. The same can't be said for Battlefield Earth."

The acting f.ex. is c**p, but with dialog like this thats no surprise.

This reminded me of a bad episode of one of those Star Trek spin off series(although I'm not sure which). There are elements of this movie that were to be liked.--I sincerly belive that this is going to be one of those movies that will develope a strong cult following in years to come(kind-of-like DUNE did).If this movie accomplished anything it remeinded me of the original 1968 Planet of the Apes-for both various and obvious reasons. I give generously give it 2 stars out of 5- and only becase that last 15 mins of this film has some bad-ass special effects and stunts(thats worth the second star-if it wasn't for that I'd just give it 1 star)"

So let's go over some of the obvious points:\n\nCharacter Identification: The hero had the approximate personality of a brick wall, or Lawrence Welk--i.e. none. The characters all practically define the term \"one-dimensional.\" Quite frankly, they all could have died, and I could have cared less. And if they died in some unusual and twisted manner, which unfortunately they didn't, I would have laughed because I was that apathetic about them.\n\nPlot: It's your basic rebellion story served up again. Neglecting the gaping holes other users have mentioned, it still is nothing new or significant.\n\nDialogue and Acting: Dreadful. Given that the character concepts were so cheap, the actors didn't have much to work with, but they still managed to fall short of the mark set for them. Travolta particularly annoyed the hell out of me with his \"evil\" portrayal.\n\nTo the people who liked this movie, all I can say is, \"silly man-animals.\""

Anything I've ever posted before and critized as being bad can't even compare to how awful this was.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the acting that was bad.\n\nThe special affects were cheap looking, the makeup and wardrobes was bad too, but you know, what really caught me was that there was no catchy score that helped move this movie along (a bull dozer couldn't move it).\n\nIt's just that bad of a movie.

From the plot to the script to the direction and to the acting. Let's leave the plot, script and directing as what it is, total junk. The thing I don't get with the acting is John Travolta trying to make a B movie? It sure seems like it. But at the budget they are making it for and his dedication in making this film, I assume he wouldn't think he is making a campy movie.\n\nAnyway, probably will be appearing in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 pretty soon, except it is not campy enough, the thing instead looks too amateurish."

I used to work in a cinema and was forced to watch \"Mac and Me\" in a auditorium full of rampant children, and if I had to make the choice between watching that or Battlefield Earth, well Mac it is, violent ankle nibblers n` all."

Personally it's a cult favorite of mine, 1 because Travolta is at his arrogant best, Forrest is a riot, and the dialog of aliens trying to understand these \"Humans\" is hilarious and engaging. I've always failed to see any rationality in the other 95% of reviews, for even people whom I know who think it only mediocre , well, just think it's mediocre.\n\nMost rational people have very little trouble thinking of 10 big budget blockbusters they consider worse...lol I usually have more fun watching folks making fools of themselves about this movie than any other movie ever made where hilarious irrational hatred of a film is concerned. I give it a 10...(Really on a true review scale I give it a 6.5, but it gets a 10 vote for the pure joy I've had watching mob morons trip over themselves to bash it with 1s and 0s while stating how terrible a Kirk Cameron movie is and gives it a 4..LMAO From the irrational hate to the hypocritical mob mentality it's a cultural phenomenon. As good as the book?? No, but what is really, A decent sci-fi flick? Yeah it really is."

Enter Johnnie, played by Barry Pepper, who seemingly rallies his primitive man into a well-oiled fighting machine. In one weeks time they learn to use Harrier Jets, Missiles, Guns and more, and are met with resistance from the Psychlos and their guns which look like they were made from PVC pipes and U bends for sinks.

The actors couldn't walk in them in a realistic enough way. The acting way overdone, exaggerated, cartoonish. Almost every line in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes. I can't imagine what they thought they were trying to accomplish. I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a church of scientology propaganda film and that the bad guys were supposed to represent psychologists and psychiatrists.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Battlefield Earth\" makes so many missteps I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the best way would be to examine the film in the broadest of terms. Despite a potentially interesting story, the whole enterprise is plagued by clumsy scripting and poor direction. The plot holes grow bigger and bigger as the story proceeds, and what little credibility it had to begin with is extinguished by the unfortunate third act. I have not read the original novel, so I cannot compare, but it's safe to say that it couldn't have been much worse than Roger Christian's ill-fated adaptation. The idea of humanity fighting a centuries-old alien occupation certainly has dramatic potential, but little of it is realized. It plays like a bad \"Star Trek\" episode, especially since the alien race--the Psychlos--look suspiciously like Klingons.\n\nThe film is poorly directed and edited. Christian uses a variety of techniques in an attempt to command our attention, but he doesn't seem to know how to put them to proper use; he just throws them at us in a fit of desperation. The camera is almost always tilted; rarely is there a level shot to be found. The overuse of screen-wipes is unnecessary and annoying. Just about every image is shot through blue and green filters. He generates little excitement or tension, confusing rapid, borderline-incoherent editing with action. According to some reports, even he wasn't too pleased with the results, although he tried to put a good face on it.\n\nJohn Travolta is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself, although delivering an over-the-top performance doesn't necessarily equal good acting. He doesn't really come off as menacing, just loud and brash. Barry Pepper is solid as the hero; it's a minor miracle he comes across as well as he does, but why did he sign up for this turkey in the first place? The same could be said about Forest Whitaker as Travolta's second-in-command. He manages to make it through intact, but I don't think he will put this thing on his resume anytime in the near future. I think bad movies like this explain why some actors are self-conscious about seeing themselves onscreen.\n\nIt's a bit sad though; Travolta had wanted to make this film ever since reading the novel upon its first publication twenty years ago. At long last, he had a chance to proceed with the project--only to meet in glorious failure. He actively defends the results, saying that in twenty years it will be a cult film like \"Blade Runner.\" Putting aside the inappropriate comparison, this sounds like the voice of a man in denial. That's not the end of it though; he wants to make a sequel, based upon the remainder of the book (the film only covers the first half). Might as well bring it on and get it over with; to be honest I'm curious to see if it could actually be worse. Finally, I'd like to hear more about what went on behind the scenes. Such an account would probably be more worthwhile than the film itself.\n\n* (out of ****)\n\nReleased by Warner Bros."

It worked in Star Wars because they were further apart and so established something. Battle field Earth just chopped and changed without doing very much.\n\nMaybe I missed out on something not seeing it on the big screen (but it didn't last long enough for me to see it).\n\nNo I hear on the grape vine that there is plan to make a sequel....Please if the parties responisble read this....Please..Please ...Please...Don't bother."

I am no Scientology advocate, but the book was just another of L. Ron Hubbard's novels. That's it. Travolta made this movie as a homage to his mentor, not to promote his religion.\n\nAnd of course the movie is rife with plot holes. Unfortunately, the story is too deep and complex to make a 3 hour movie complete, let alone a 90 minute one. The universe in the book in far more expansive, and Johnny's plan of taking back the planet is far more in depth. The difference between books being made into film, and original screenplays, is that the screenplay is written with such time limitations in mind. Every book that has been made into film has had plot holes and missing elements.\n\nAll of that said, the only truly bad part of Battlefield Earth is the cinematography, but really only one aspect of such. Too often the camera seemed tilted for no other reason than to depict a chaotic scene, and this just did not come across well.\n\nThe acting was done very well, the sets and special effects were for the most part done well. The costumes were not perfect, but I am sure it is not easy to make a 6 foot man appear to be an 8 foot alien.\n\nI understand there are going to be some people that truly don't like this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin with, Battlefield Earth is not the worst film ever made. Tim Burton consistently makes worse films than this. But it remains a pretty sorry excuse for two hours and almost $80 million bucks. Even my parents, huge John Travolta fans, said that Travolta should have been slapped for making this film. That alone should tell you something about this film's lack of quality.\n\nThe funny thing is, the premise of the film is actually not that bad. Earth is conquered by aliens, and the human slaves rise up in a revolt. Sounds like a worthy base concept for a film, but the details of the movie ruin it. Like naming your alien invaders \"Psychlos\" from the planet \"Psychlo,\" for instance. Or naming your hero \"Johnny Goodboy Tyler.\" Or making your alien invaders such nitwits that they actually take rebellious humans and pump their brains full of knowledge to make them smarter. Or having Harrier jets working perfectly fine after 1000 years and having cavemen easily pilot them after a few days on a simulator when experienced pilots can't even do it after years of training. Or having one nuke take out an entire planet because its atmosphere can't handle any kind of radiation (are we to believe that Psychlo has no ozone layer?). Or any of the other many, many flaws, inconsistencies, plot holes, logical lapses, and idiocies that pass for the movie's story. Seriously, just what were writers Corey Mandell and JD Shapiro (working from the L. Ron Hubbard novel) thinking, if they were thinking at all? From start to finish, the script is so ridiculous and whacked-out that there's no way you can buy into it. And when the cavemen start chanting \"Piece of cake! Piece of cake! Ugh ugh ugh ugh!\", the only response you can have is to laugh yourself silly.\n\nMaking matters worse is Roger Christian's inept direction, which includes an addiction to tilted camera angles. Granted, angled shots can work when used properly (The Bride of Frankenstein and Batman, for example), but 90% of this film is canted for no reason (and at least half of it is done in slo-mo). Our first glimpse of Johnny Goodboy Tyler is when we see him striding down the plains on horseback like the Lone Ranger\u0085and the camera tilts from one side to the other every time the shot changes, and it looks so ridiculous that you just start laughing. And the slo-mo shots of the cavemen being hosed down by the aliens look like bloated Super Soaker ads\u0085and again, you have to laugh. Oh, and let's not forget the scene where they rip off The Matrix's lobby shootout, another laugh riot. And what's more, they don't even use sound FX in some of the shots, which makes it even nuttier. For someone who apprenticed under George Lucas, Christian didn't learn anything about making a good movie. And then there's the problem of the visuals. Why do the Psychlo ships look like flying shoeboxes? Why do the Psychlos all have George Clinton hairdos with Village People Leather Guy outfits, Joel Schumacher codpieces, and rubber werewolf hands? And why do the FX look so cheap (when Travolta's arm is blown off, it looks like exploding styrofoam)? Visually, this movie is so pathetic that again, it only induces laughter (and the less said about Kelly Preston's The Mask-style uber-tongue, the better). As for Elia Cmiral's score\u0085argh. A tinny, high school-sounding orchestra mixed with synth-rock does not a good blend make.\n\nThen there's the acting. I really liked Barry Pepper and Kim Coates a lot. Pepper's an intense actor in the Ron Eldard mold, and Coates has an amiable goofiness about him. Both men deserve better than this. But Travolta, otherwise a stellar actor, was just plain awful. He overdid the hamminess, his faux-British accent was annoying, and his flowy hand gestures made him look like a bad gay stereotype\u0085which had me laughing again. (While we're on the subject, what was with his Snidely Whiplash laugh?) And Forrest Whitaker's Fat Albert voice as Travolta's dippy sidekick was howl-inducing. In fact, all of the Psychlos and the other cavemen were ridiculous. They were either laughable or just plain stupid. With no story, no characters to care about, and no decent visuals to hook us, what are we supposed to latch onto?\n\nI can't help but laugh when I hear people say that this movie's too deep, too intelligent, too moral, and too truly sci-fi for the unwashed masses to appreciate it, hence its failure. Just who are they kidding? Battlefield Earth is little more than MST3K fodder at best, a screamingly funny piece of ineptitude. And if Travolta is serious about pushing ahead with the planned sequels\u0085please, don't. Once was bad enough."

If you force me to say something nice, I'll admit that the gore was non-existent, despite numerous limbs being blown off - most of the shootings take place off camera and the aliens apparently don't bleed. There was no sex to speak of except for a little, ok a lot, of tongue being shown - so it's a fine family film if anyone can manage to stay awake. Even so, if I could have rated this less than \"1\" I would have. Blech."

This is understandable, as it is hard to compile a complex book of 400 to 1000 pages into a movie length that modern audiences will sit through and theaters will show. However, Battlefield Earth has reached a new low.\n\nThe first time I saw this movie, in the theater in 2000, I fell asleep about 30-45 minutes into it and didn't wake up until the credits. What I saw of the movie was bad, but I felt that it might pick up.\n\nI was sooooooo wrong.\n\nWhen I (finally) rented it on DVD, I was appalled. The only thing this movie and the book had in common were the names of some of the main characters and the title. Everything else had been (badly) adapted for the screen. Half of the greatness of the book was exploring not just the conflict on Earth, but of the politics that a newly freed Earth is subjected to. That aspect is completely missing from the film.\n\nThis was maybe the most wasted 2 hours I have ever experienced."

The acting in this film is at best bland but is often much worse, John Travolta take the prize for worst acting with his Psychlo Terl. This character is probably the dumbest villain in history, complete with an annoying maniacal laugh and frequent use of the word leverage.\n\nThe only reason to see this film is to see how bad you can make a film despite a big budget and competent cast and crew, and I would advise to see this movie with a few friends and lots of drinks."

A brief summary of some of my favorite movies.\n\nI admit when I saw this movie on opening day I thought some of the elements in the films story were a little ridiculous. The flight simulator, the fact that the humans were a little slow on what the function of things really were, but the idea of taking back the planet wasn't so terrible and neither was the carrying out of that idea.\n\nThe acting was fine. The SFX and the Art direction are not as bad as some say, with sixty million dollars how could anything look cheap. I read a criticism on the dialogue, what do we know about how aliens talk anyway? Aliens have personalities and attitudes and they have to put them to use, they're in a business to make money and rule the universe, treachery is a way of life.\n\nI recently started reading the book and it cleared up a few things in the film, it's disappointing that the producers wanted a 2hr action-SiFi movie instead of what L. Ron Hubbard wrote in his book, but it doesn't take away too much of the story and is still worth your time.\n\nFor the bored at heart and those who thought is was stupid, go back to watching made for TV movies that the have brains, acting, directing and the same moral point and cliched story line(at least THIS was original), with a box of tissues. For those who aren't so quick to insult a group of well established film makers who made what they KNOW to be a good movie(or else they wouldn't have wasted they're time making it, do you think John Travolta needs another twenty million dollars to waste a year of his life to make a crappy movie?) see it. It doesn't play so well on the small screen but it's still not a waste of your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Battlefield Earth\" (2000), if there ever was a disease reincarnated as a \"movie\", then this is a perfect example of one. To be honest, I have never seen this \"film\" before in my life, but I have heard things about it, and have never had the desire to check it out. It just happened to be on TV last night, so I decided to watch it. I thought: \"you know what, I like science fiction/action movies. I'm going to give this a watch, how bad can it possibly be?\" Well, it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought. No, it was a million times worse! What in the world did I just watch?! The story, or lack thereof, is nothing short of a joke. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, the special effects are horrible, the sets/locations are abysmal, and the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Believe it or not, this \"movie\" is based off a novel by author L. Ron Hubbard. I have never read the novel, but I'm sure that it's probably much more entertaining than this pile of filth of a \"film\"! Originally, \"Battlefield Earth\" was to be a part 1 of a 2 part movie series. The original book it's based off of is 1,050 pages in length, and this \"film\" only covers the first 436 pages of the story. Can't imagine how bad the sequel would have been if it was ever produced! But thankfully, it was cancelled. This \"movie\" should have never been made to begin with! There is barely any story, it's basically like the diarrhea stain known as \"Diner\" (1982), nothing but subplots that go absolutely nowhere and don't add up! It's a crying shame, because the story concept seems interesting and has a lot of potential. But it was just executed so terribly, so terrible that it should be illegal! The acting is also a total disgrace, from all of the actors subjected to being in this \"movie\"! I have never seen acting so over the top, yet so cringeworthy and yet so boring in my life. I was surprised to see an actor like John Travolta in this \"film\". When I saw him on the poster, I thought: \"I like John Travolta as an actor. Maybe he can make this movie worth watching?\" But no, he actually plays one of the aliens, known as Psychlos. No really, they are actually called Psychlos. Come on, a preschooler could have come up with a more intimidating name than that! We'll get to talking more about those aliens in a second. The special effects are nothing short of horrible, I've seen better effects on old video games! Even the sound effects are cheap and generic. Like an old cheesy arcade game! Also, the makeup for the aliens in this \"movie\" is some of the worst I have ever seen. They just look like humans with Jamaican wigs and nose piercings. They must be inspired by the villain Screwface from \"Marked For Death\" (1990)! Honestly, I've seen children's Halloween costumes that look more realistic! Some human beings actually look more like aliens than the so-called \"aliens\" in this \"movie\". Let that sink in for a moment! The sets/locations look like they were edited together by a first year student in film school. Also, the cinematography is some of the worst I have ever seen. If you look at any scene from this \"movie\", you'll notice that most of the shots are at an angle. What? Was KidBehindACamera the cinematographer? Yes, I know that they were trying to shoot this \"film\" to look like a comic book. But it just makes it look like the camera operators were drunk! Seriously, over 90% of the shots are slanted. It looks like the \"movie\" is sinking! Although, to be honest it was sinking before it was ever made. If you have the courage to watch it, be prepared for a sore neck! Also, the soundtrack is awful, but I suppose that this diarrhea dump of a \"movie\" would be incomplete without a terrible soundtrack. This \"movie\" should have never been made, it's a crime to film making. I've seen many movies in my life, and this one is the worst \"movie\" I have ever seen, so far. I rate this \"movie\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 IMDB stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. For all you're worth, stay away from this sorry excuse of film making. To all actors and film makers sadly involved with this \"movie\", all I have to say is, I'm sorry. We can all be thankful that this \"film\" didn't ruin your careers!"

These include, but are not limited to, \"An entirely new style of science fiction film-making\", \"Good scene transitions\", and (my personal favorite), action that will leave you \"exhausted\". Sadly, the box said nothing about inane dialogue, ineffably awful acting, and a plot that has so many holes in it, it could be used to strain spaghetti. In my opinion, before watching this movie, you must check the logic centre of your brain at the door, lest it shut down permanently from the strain of trying to make sense of the fact that a highly technologically advanced alien species was still unable to discover Fort Knox.\n\nIf you want a fun drinking game (and I firmly believe that generous quantities of alcohol can only improve the viewing experience) take a drink/shot every time a Psychlon says the phrase \"Man-Animals\", and every time you catch a glimpse of John Travolta's and Forrest Whitakker's grotesquely over-sized...uh...packages.\n\nSpeaking of Forrest Whitakker, the man is an Oscar winner. Did he not know what he was getting himself into? Why did he stay once he realized what was going on around him. Some of his dialogue seems like a cry for help. It's unfortunate that his career had to suffer through this movie, although maybe it's just as well that he got it out of the way early. Unlike John Travolta.\n\nImprobably, Travolta is worse in Battlefield Earth than he was in Broken Arrow. The man puts in the performance of a lifetime, an awful performance in what he must have known was an awful movie.\n\nI have run out of words. If you really must watch this movie, watch it with a group of people with whom you can mercilessly tear it to shreds. At least you'll get some enjoyment out of it that way. I still have not mentioned the forgettable score, bad editing, and terrible cinematography which seems to live in mortal fear of any shots that occur at a completely vertical angle. Now I have.

My theory is that they put a chip in his brain and forced him to function for them, that's the only way... OK, first it's just terrible. They had this slow motion scene that seemed to go on for ages, then the only character that was nearly likable was killed in a nuclear explosion to save some annoying guy's butt. The \"aliens\" are incredibly dorky and unbelievably unbelievable. Oh. Flashback. *shiver* Why? Why would anyone want to bring such a terrible thing into this world?! Sick minds..."

Oh, give us a break! The action scenes are just so-so, but everything else about this cheap imitation for a movie is just laughably bad - and that's the only charm in it - it is so bad it is laughable.\n\nThe primary source of amusement is the (supposed) \"dialog\" - I especially like the aliens hissing at each other, it's so, well... meaningless.\n\nThe explosions are cool. The prison scenes are stolen from every prison movie of the 1930s. whatever good is to be found here could be found - better - in the old Star Trek TV show. And John Travolta - ! ha ha ha ha ha!

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen plenty of bad films in my time, but I usually understand the reasons behind their being made. For example, \"Saturday Night Live\" rip-offs with actors like Rob Schnider, Adam Sandler, Norm MacDonald, etc. are cheaply produced and do not face much difficulty making back their cost at the box office. The countless plot-free action movies that pop-up every summer manage to pull in cash thanks to their good-looking actors and stylish visual effects. But \"Battlefield Earth\" baffles me. This is not simply a movie that fails in the acting and writing departments. It is also a failure technically, showing a total lack of skill in everyone involved.\n\nFor those of you who decided not to sit through L. Ron Hubbard's 1,000+ page novel, the \"plot\" (heh) involves Johnnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a young human who single-handedly rises up against a race of aliens that have dominated Earth for a thousand years and have almost entirely erased mankind in hopes of mining for gold. He is captured, learns of the true nature of the aliens' plans from their leader Terl (John Travolta), organizes a revolt, and so on. It's a good thing that the writers gave our hero the name \"Goodboy,\" because it's about as far as they seemed willing to go with character depth.\n\nThe acting ranges from laughable to downright pathetic. Whenever something bad happens to Johnnie, Pepper is given the chance to look into the camera and shout \"NOOOOO!\" to express the emotional damage inflicted on his character. Distinguished actors such as Forest Whitaker and Michael Byrne are sadistically embarrassed in supporting roles. And John Travolta... sheesh. It looks like he didn't even bother to read over the script. He says his lines as if he were Snidely Whiplash with laryngitis, and can't even get the mandatory evil laugh (\"HOO HOO HOO HA HA HA!\") right.\n\nAs I said earlier, technical problems also abound. About twelve-too-many slow-motion shots are used during the fight/chase scenes, and they are handled with such clumsiness that it looks as if someone were using stop-motion movement instead. Most of the visual effects look like something you would see on a cheap cable TV series. The lighting in the underground scenes is so dark that I had a hard time figuring out whose face I was looking at. Even the camera angles are bad- every scene has tilted shots that appear to have been filmed by the cameraman from the old \"Batman\" TV show. Director Roger Christian should have stuck to designing sets for a living (yes, he won an Oscar for his work on the original \"Star Wars\"), because he can't even set up a shot properly.\n\n\"Battlefield Earth\" looks and feels like one of those direct-to-video sci-fi movies that show on HBO at 3:00 in the morning, yet the budget was big enough to feed a small country. A critical and commercial bomb, this movie deserved every ounce of bad press it got and will be stuck somewhere between \"Glen or Glenda?\" and \"Inchon\" on the list of the worst movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing that disturbed me about press reviews of this film is that - bearing in mind all religions are essentially large cults - everyone seemed to use it as a brickbat to beat Scientology over the head with. I mean, some of the makers of Batman and Robin were Christians, but I don't remember anyone denouncing Jesus for that.\n\nWhat's more, Scientology isn't even mentioned once during the film. Unless I'm mistaken, and the movement details seven-foot alien conquerors with dreadlocks. Source novel author L.Ron Hubbard was also the founder of the Church of Scientology. In fact, rather than being crammed full of religious recruitment, the movie's major problem is that it has nothing to say, being little or no more than a generic \"mankind enslaved by aliens\" picture.\n\nSo, the film itself. Obviously flawed, quite dirgelike, yet also nowhere near as bad as its reputation. I guess people just love a good bandwagon. Psychlos is probably the dumbest name for an alien race ever, and there's much riffing on familiar SF territory. Maybe this was all new when the novel was written in 1982, but for a 21st century motion picture it's like watching inferior carbon copies of your favourite genres movies rolled into one. The setting is a decimated future Earth full of dubious comic setpieces, melodrama and naive speech making. You half expect Kevin Costner to walk on at any moment.\n\nDirection is adequate, but a little too gimmicky, while acting is pretty wooden all round. Only one to really break out of this rut (though not in a good way) is John Travolta, who plays John Travolta in alien make-up. His slightly smug, over the top portrayal does begin to tire quickly, while with their Rocket Man boots and noseclips, the Psychlos also look ridiculous. As it is, you're never convinced this is a real alien race, and you never care about any of the faceless humans either.\n\nThe dialogue is also quite corny, with the odd \"puny humans\"-style ramblings, and the film is curiously po-faced and without real charm or involvement. Combine this with a distinct lack of narrative tension and you've got a movie that fails to really engage on any level. The climax sees a vaguely gung-ho rendition of human military technology vs. alien weaponry. The CGI used looks like it'll date very, very quickly and the whole thing is oddly soulless. And, if you pay close attention, there's also a signposted sequel opportunity.\n\nYet despite the huge number of weaknesses I've mentioned, this is far from being the worst film ever made, probably not even John Travolta's worst film. Yes, I've seen much, much better, but I've also seen a Hell of a lot worse. 4/10."

When contrasted to those type of films - it does seem like a science-fiction comedy and does not look as bad as the critics say. I think most critics are reading to seriously into this movie and failing it.\n\nThe whole movie was like a farce. Each enemy group (alien vs. human) is playing each other out. The way the aliens were defeated is hilarious. The plots of greed from the alien race is also funny. It made them look more human than alien - rather than some cold calculating alien concept like Darth Vadar that has no lower motivations. This movie is funny - it is a comedy, that is why people are missing the boat - they are viewing it like a serious film like Star Wars or Star Trek, Aliens, Prediator, Total Recall, Terminator, Bladerunner etc..., and of course, it fails when compared to serious sci-fi films. People here did that to the movie the 'Village', because they thought it would be a thriller suspense - when it was more of a romantic movie and should have been evaluated differently.\n\nI recommend this movie if you are into science-fiction comedy - if you liked 'Spaceballs', 'Evolution' or 'Ghostbusters', watch this film too, it is good as a comedy. The whole film is a big joke.\n\nOn a more serious analysis of the movie reveals the following themes: The invasion of the Europeans, of the Native-Americas since 1492 is what this movie is reminiscent of and seems to portray artistically. The civilisations that once dominated America were destroyed as European settlers mined for gold and made the Natives slaves. The film sort of portrays this to alien vs. man in a science-fiction format. However, real-life does not show a subjugated people gaining victory in such a flukey simplistic way as the movie portrays. The movie would be more convincing, if the aliens fought among themselves, and relised the 'man animals' were in many ways like them and started movements to incorporate them into their society and take away the slave status. Then it would be a pure political satire. Anyway, just my thoughts...."

I have read it counting the time i am now reading, at least 15 times. To make a awful movie like this one is a disgrace to the million's of fans and to the Late L.Ron. The man who wrote this screen play should never be allowed to pen another work in Hollywood again. There are plenty of film makers in other countries who don't care about quality of what's in the can. The special effects were sub par, the acting was terrible, All in all it was a terrible waste of 80 million dollars. What needs to happen is that someone who loves the book must come forward to write an actual screen play. and a competent director must be found who will take this movie to heart and do it justice. I would say the director in mind is Peter Jackson. I know he would do it right."

I can't help but feel pity for the poor ignorant fools who actually seemed to think they had a good movie on their hands. I have a hard time believing John Travolta will be able to regain a reputation after starring in a movie in which the logic behind characters' actions is even less balanced than the camera which is at a tilt on every shot. Mr. Travolta's character plans to find out what humans like to eat best by starving them to a point of desperation and seeing what they eat. Simply presenting this logic as something that anyone, especially someone who proves himself clever throughout the rest of the movie, would use is completely ridiculous. In their plan to save the world, the humans plan to collapse a dome made with glass and metal beams that covers the city, thereby letting in gas that is poisonous only to the Psychlos. What doesn't seem to pose any problems is the fact that huge steal beams will falls from the sky. But hey, it's the future. Steal beams fall only on bad guys and bad guys always belt out an evil cackle"

There is no discernible reason for the (over)use of color filters, except perhaps to distract from John Travolta's complete lack of talent. Possibly the worst offence (from a technical standpoint, that is) has to be the Dutch Angle -- normally used sparingly to \"throw off\" the viewer's perspective to create feelings of unease and/or discomfort, but in Battlefield Earth is literally the only shot used. This film is the cinematic equivalent to having your genitals mangled by rabid weasels with dull teeth while laying in a Taco Bell dumpster in July. I highly recommend it."

It was merely long and overproduced, so it seems practically everyone got a chance to read it, which is why it is one of the few science fiction novels held in \"high regard\" by the masses. Considering its very doubtful that the author actually even wrote the bloody thing, we don't even know who to really blame, other than Mr. Hubbard's wonderful little cult. He still seems to be putting out more and more books decades after his death. Believe me, the ideas in Battlefield Earth are almost plausible when compared with the \"concepts\" of Scientology...and the movie probably cost only a little more than the average person is supposed to pay to the cult. Might as well be a Mormon for those prices.\n\nThere are \"good\" bad movies and \"bad\" movies. Ed Wood, Phil Tucker and Ray Dennis Steckler made \"good\" bad movies...one's that are fun to watch and you can laugh at but still see the work that went into them as some form of art. This movie was just plain bad. The story is bad and the acting is atrocious. Travolta and Pepper constantly sound like they are reading from cue cards or doing a cold walk-through. There are so many plot points that are just plain dumb that it makes your head hurt to contemplate them...savages learning how to pilot Harrier jets overnight and US Military technology being fully functional after a thousand years to name two of the biggies.\n\nEven the special effects were pretty lame...in fact, they were basically stoic and standard. In a major science fiction blockbuster, you expect something new or innovative. Even Lost in Space made good use of that popular spinning effect (the process name eludes me at the moment), which was just becoming big at the time. But there's nothing to grab your attention in this movie.\n\nLuckily, I think this movie did so poorly at the box office that we don't have to worry about a sequel. Hopefully the Scientologists will find some other less intrusive way to plead their dead leader's case next time...I wonder if they tried door-to-door leaflets?"

And that was something to be told about.\n\nI don't really know what the director's been thinking, but they really made up a really really bad shape(performance) of both the Psychlos and the Human(animal),couldn't they make it better that all of the Psychlos look almost the same even the outfit and so are the human,that sometimes you get confused all over who is really who. The Psychlos really look like a bunch of fools that couldn't even walk in a proper way and seems to be too slow just to get themselves move along, and they also surely too easy to be defeated in a fightback, for an Alien of which almost wipe out the entire human race in about 9 minutes and enslaved human race from many centuries ago. Take that into account.\n\nAfter all,despites of all the lacking in the movie,we(or I) should give a credit,the only credit to the 'moral teaching' of this movie, which is to never give ourselves up on any hard circumstances and about how to encouraged ourselves to avoid the destruction, the struggle of human race against the Psychlos surely means something, it shows the superiority of human if just we put some efforts on it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Forget Plan 9 From Outer Space. THIS takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. I can't believe I even paid any money for it! I actually thought that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone says, and it did have a really cool trailer. Instead it ended up being worse than I expected. It carries the basic elements of a good movie (action, romance, etc.) and under uses them. Okay, so those elements don't always make a good movie. But they could have been excellent sub-plots in this film, as they appeared to be at first. I can't even believe this is called a \"movie\". It's more like a bunch of big actors overplaying their parts and spewing unflattering and stupid dialogue during a bunch of dumb scenes. Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, and of course, John Travolta all shame themselves in this mess. They are very good actors and I respect a lot of the choices they have made throughout their careers. But their performances in this smell worse than rabbit feces. There is a plot to speak of that's easy to describe, but it's so dumb I don't really want to put any effort into deciphering it. Oh well, here it goes.\n\nIt is the year 3000, and man is now an endangered species. They are scattered in groups all over, hiding from the Psychlos, an alien species that has ruled earth for the last 1000 years. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) sets out to find a beast that was described in a cave tale and is captured by the Psychlos. He then encourages all of the other captured humans to revolt against the Psychlos. The plot gets dumber and more complex, mainly because it lost my attention after about an hour and thirty minutes. What's to say? Well, actually there's a lot to say. First off, you'll know the film is going to be bad as soon as it starts with incredibly sucky scene transitions, and it continues for the rest of the film. First Tyler learns about his parents' deaths, which cuts to a second long shot of him at their graves, and is instantly followed by the cave scene. The connection between these (and just about all of the other) scenes was really choppy, and the \"opening doors\" effect just didn't cut it. To add to the ridiculously giant plot holes, only about seven of the characters are properly introduced. Sheesh! I hope that whoever edited this never works in the movie industry again. Oh, and did I mention that John Travolta sounds more like a kid in a candy store than a villain? I would also have to agree with just about everyone else on the statement that he looks like a moron. Now jump to when Jonnie is captured by the Psychlos, which is followed by scene after scene after scene of him running away, and each one ends with him getting shot by guns that look like Nerf pistols. And the guns don't even kill him! Wouldn't the Psychlos consider using a more lethal weapon after the first two or three chases? Guess not. The rest of the scenes mainly just show Terl and Ker having discussions with either each other or some guy who has a neck bigger than earth itself and Barry Pepper and his nameless friends \"easily\" finding out how to save earth. Gee, if I were a Psychlo, I think I would believe it would make perfectly good sense to not let my enemies have access to potentially vital information, even with the biggest guarantee that there would be \"nothing that could help them\". There's also the incredibly lame Psychlo language session, the freaky chick with the huge head and long tongue, and the cavemen instantly learning how to fly fighter jets. Sure they've had to hide in caves for hundreds of years, but to have them marvel at being able to pronounce \"warning\" is just plain dumb. And how many times did they say \"piece of cake\"? I wonder if it outnumbers the number of scenes showing Jonnie getting captured and worthlessly beating up somebody. As much as I love action and big battles, the jet fight wasn't really thrilling, nor was the gun duel. They were just plain bad, but the fact that the movie has most likely bored you to tears by then isn't much of a benefit itself.\n\nAnother bad thing in this film is that there are parts that will remind you of better movies. Pepper's hair and the guy who looks like Aragorn are likely to make you think about Lord Of The Rings, the detonator removal scene is reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me, and the Fort Knox scenes will trigger thoughts of Goldfinger. All three are movies I should have been watching instead of this. But to ease the suffering, my sister and I did spend about 60 minutes making fun of it, and I recommend that you come up with your own plan to pass the time if you plan on watching it as well. The only positive factor I can arouse when referring to this movie is that it would make a fantastic episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But since that was canceled before this was made, there are no existing aspects of the film that are half enjoyable.\n\nBy now you should get the picture. This film sucks big time. It's so bad that when I got up to get some orange juice in the kitchen, I could feel my brain rotting. It also fueled a nostalgia for Plan 9. Really, it did! Roger Christian ought to be ashamed of himself for making this. Amazing how a guy who worked on something like The Phantom Menace could be responsible for something this bad. So in short, cavemen can fly jets, Psychlos look like the Coneheads, learning a new language can be done by zapping it into your eyes, and Pepper has hairstyles that make him look like a girl. Whoop-dee-doodle-do.\n\n0 out of *****"

Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets.

Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods \u2013 a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.\n\nThe film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not 'the worst film of all time\u0099'.

It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms \u2013 something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.\n\nThe film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn't that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd \u2013 like a Klingon but with more bits! It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fist-ed that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it \u2013 a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.\n\nWith such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled \u2013 so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just so\u0085obvious and easy \u2013 there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material \u2013 but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.\n\nOverall this is a very poor film and, although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination \u2013 a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time."

        "review_detailed_main": "We all know the classics, the films that have stood the tests of time, and refuse to become dated or lose an iota of their entertaining quality over the years. From the intellectual snob of a movie buff, to the casual movigoer, we've heard the names, if not seen the movies: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, North By Northwest, The Wizard Of Oz, etc., etc. Existing on the opposite end of the spectrem are movies so horrendously bad, so awful, that they remain equally engraved in the memories of fans for years to come. One such movie is Battlefield Earth, a unique film in the sense that every single aspect of production is poor and dreadfully uninspired.\n\nThe faults of Battlefield Earth are too enumerous to count, and the redeeming factors (if any) elusively hidden between overblown special effects, plot holes the size of Lake Tahoe, overacted performances which are going to give all of the lead actors permanent black marks. And worst of all, the movie takes itself seriously. It does not branch out into comic relief (at least not intentionally, Travolta's performance inspires laughs when it's supposed to be intimidating). In between the frames, as well as in various interviews, the filmmakers have hinted that they think (honestly) that they have created a classic film to be long remembered in Battlefield Earth.\n\nI hear about plans for a sequel, or spin-off TV show. I hope to God that this is not true! When I saw the film, I was first incredilous with shock at the film's astoundingly stupid dialogue and story which breezed from action scene to action scene (none of which are exciting, Die Hard 2 is better than this cheese) and how it lingered on boring, pointless plot \"revelations\" that the audience members who have IQ's above that of an eggplant must have figured out long before the characters on screen have. Then I was laughing, and I was not the only one. Finally, I just waited for it to be over. I walked out of the screening room, took unusually long breaks to the concession stand, meandered around the theater looking at posters for coming attractions, and when I returned to the movie, I found I had missed nothing, and was not surprised. The film does not work on any level. Not self-parody. It's not even campy. It's an embarrassment to all involved in its making, and anyone who had to endure it in theaters. The filmmakers were right about one thing: It's going to be remembered for a long time."

One side Barry Pepper is the good, who must understand the rules of the evil but at the same time find the weakness of the evil in the mercy (as time bought to gain more power). The other side is John Travolta as the evil, Terl, a villain who really is not so bad as it must to be, for that reason there's a chance to save the planet, not because Terl don't wanna destroy it, just cos he still learning about the way of life of his race (how they have not destroyed his world with such kind of life). Beyond these and a few other themes there's great treatment of the scientific concepts (the movie doesn't fall in the path of the fantasy). The music is very good as the special effects. The only problem: seems easy to understand but it's more than simple science fiction movie."

Honestly, I felt it was pretty flat, with not as much action as I would have liked. The acting was satisfactory, and John Travolta usually creates a character I can enjoy watching. But, for some undefinable reason, his skills didn't come through in this movie. You can tell he put effort into the movie, but I didn't get the same feeling from him as I did with characters like Howard Saint from the Punisher.\n\nOverall, I'd say this movie has merit, but it's really weak as far as selling itself.

The acting for this movie was exceptionally bad, with actors that have no emotion at all.The screenplay author wrote simply the poorest lines ever. It is unbelievable that Travolta agreed to say such empty and childish lines in a movie. The extremely predictable plot is also something that shows how poorly this film was made. People this century should know better than to have shallow plots such as this one. The movie drags for two hours. Very boring. The special effects certainly did NOT reflect the huge budget of this film. Take for instance, the part that Terl, character of Travolta, throws the \"man-animal\" down an abyss. I found it incredible the obviousness of the screen on the scene. (Don't forget to notice the bad acting in that scene, too.) To topple it up, the names, places, histories were extremely unbelievable. Yes, it is a fiction, but Artificial Intelligence and even Lord of the Rings are more believable than this! In every aspect, this is one of the worst displays of human talent yet. But hey, life goes on. Let the Matrixes and Godfathers come. Why waste time with the sadness of Hollywood, when the spectacles of image and sound are right there, at Blockbuster, right next to the Battlefield Earth tape, which, by the way, needs some dusting."

At the time, I wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered.\n\nIt was.\n\nAnd now today - April 9th 2006. I'd begun to develop fond memories for it and was curious to see if time had mellowed my opinion and allowed it to finally cross over into the 'so bad it's good category.'\n\nIt hadn't.\n\nMy original thoughts on the film had been and remain that if only every one involved had just tried a measly ten percent extra it would rank as perhaps one of the worst films ever made.\n\nSadly, it stops well short of the classic 'so bad it's good' category and instead ends up committing - the worst movie crime imaginable - being mind and arse numbingly boring.\n\nI hate films that bore me, it's infuriating, it's insulting and it's unforgivable! Battlefield Earth is a mess, the acting is more ham than human, the effects shoddy, the script shocking beyond belief! This film is an abomination against nature and a crime against humanity. They should amend the Human Rights Bill and have a clause added outlawing it or at the very least banning it.\n\nIt's cinematic equivalent of a bag of urine run over by a truck carrying excrement to a vomiting convention.\n\nI think Elvis Mitchell writing in The New York Times summed it up best when he wrote in May 2000 - 'It may be a bit early to make such judgements, but \"Battlefield Earth\" may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century.' An amazing shrewd man and no mistake.\n\nSo, why am I writing this rant? Well it's simple. I'm writing it in case I ever try watching this cinematic abomination ever again.\n\nHopefully, the next time I have the urge to watch it, I'll check out the IMDb reviews, read this and save myself two hours of my life.\n\nPlease, if you are me reading this I beg you, DON'T WATCH IT! WATCH SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD, IN FACT ANYTHING ELSE INSTEAD! OR YOU COULD TRY TALKING TO YOUR WIFE, PLAYING WITH YOUR CHILDREN OR DOING YOUR WASHING UP. IN FACT, TRY DOING ANYTHING OTHER THAN WASTE 2 MORE HOURS OF YOUR PRECIOUS LIFE WATCHING THIS RUBBISH!\n\nAnd if you're not me, but you are thinking of watching it, then trust me.\n\nDon't."

When I told a friend that 'Mars Attacks' was the worst movie ever, she said 'No way, check out Battlefield Earth'. I did, and she was right. Travolta, playing as an alien villain brute? Terrible. The rest of the acting, let's not even go there. The plot, there pretty much was none. Psychlo? That was the name of the planet! Who wrote this movie anyway? I'm surprised that Travolta still has a career after this one.

This movie cost over $70,000,000 & it grossed $21,000,000. I know box office results are petty & a poor indicator of a good movie, because some of the best movies ever made have been unsuccessful in their own times, but this movie was unsuccessful because it just plain sucks! This is one instance when the mass movie going public is correct. It didn't make much money because it is a very poorly made movie. If you haven't seen it, go watch it, & actually think about what you are watching. There are a lot of terrible movies out there, & many of them cost a lot of money, but this movie fails on every single principle of film making. The acting, the writing, the directing, the sfx, the camera work, you name it. I'm all for movies that are mindless & entertaining, even stupid at times.

Forest Whitaker, what a waste of some talent. And Barry Pepper, wonder how much they paid him for this. Obviously he must've been desperate."

So, when I was stalking around the video store on a Friday night, I thought that \"Battlefield Earth,\" would be a good thriller to keep me awake. I mean, how bad could it be?\n\nI've decided to stop renting movies.\n\nNot really, but I have decided to stop assuming that all sci-fi movies have something good about them. The cover of this particular video falsely hints at a film with plenty of clever action to cover up a most-likely thin plot. Well, I was right about one thing.\n\nYes, the movie does have action; in fact, the last half hour of the movie is crammed with large-scale battle scenes, including an eye-appealing dogfight between alien ships and harrier fighters (I'm not even going to ask what BRITISH-MADE harriers are doing in the UNITED STATES). But, as so many movies have shown us before, expensive special effects cannot always cover up a really, truly, AWFUL movie. Believe me, no film to date can attest to this as much as \"Battlefield Earth.\" The story isn't the problem; as a matter of fact, L. Ron Hubbard's idea of an alien-controlled Earth in the next millennium is quite intriguing for a sci-fi audience. It's just the horrible way the film was made that makes it, shall I say, Mystery Science Theater material.\n\nFirst, the movie plows right into an already underdeveloped plot, giving virtually no background for the main character (an achingly bad actor with whom one finds it very hard to sympathize). Then it continues on, boring its audience with unbelievable plot twists and annoying scenes transitions, each one with a screen wipe. What's with that?\n\nAnyway, I am essentially trying to tell those of you out there who find some of these bad movies intriguing, beware. It is rarely, if ever, worth it."

It takes certain elements of Scientology such as using the Psychlos as allegories of psychologists who, according to Scientology, only seek to control the human mind and without forgetting to mention alien life as the true creator of humanity. It's a simple story of a future dominated by aliens and humanity's struggle to reclaim their world. It's a pretty good story for a sci-fi epic, but sadly despite the budget, this movie failed to materialize this story in the way it should have been. Most of the characters are very basic and generic without much depth. Travolta's character is seriously a cartoon character to the point where he becomes inept and is funny instead of intimidating. Only the character of Forest Whitaker shows some common sense. The directing and editing are so rampant to the point where you can get lost and have to use your imagination to figure out what's going on. It is as if the film were trying to make the viewer dizzy. The slow-motion sequences are really good, but you have to keep up or they seem eternal. The digital effects are basic and simple which makes this movie made only for home format. The script is seriously quite mediocre since there are certain inconsistencies, holes and some errors that make one wonder how such a thing could happen. There are even things that become meaningless. Battlefield Earth is a movie that you either have to watch with your brain turned off and let yourself be carried away by the action it has or you have to use your imagination to understand things that it doesn't fully explain. It is not the worst movie that has ever existed since at least the story is good, but it has so many flaws in its development that it ends up being a mediocre movie that few can like. Even so, it is a rather rare and bizarre tape that turns out to be entertaining and more so because of Travolta's overperformance that sadly ended his career, but at least he left a villain so cartoonish and funny that it is not easy to forget. My final rating for this movie is 6/10."

Of course they would, but that doesn't make for a good movie. For a movie to be good you need to actually care about the characters. These cavemen are leaderless mongrels until Barry Pepper's character shows up & gives them a 30 second speech, & then all is well. There is no depth to it at all. The same positive review said it had a good message about how we treat those weaker than ourselves. Again, it was totally on the surface, no depth whatsoever. If you want to see a futuristic movie that actually conveys some universal truths about humans, watch \"Children of Men.\" \"Battlefield Earth\" had about as much depth & truth as a Hannah Montana song."

Unfortunately, John Travolta was the Scientologist involved this project.\n\nThe movie is set in the year 3,000. Earth has been ravaged by the Psyhclos, an evil ailen race, that is from the planet Psychlo, itself subject to periodic Psychlones and attended by Pscyhlologists and Psychliatrists. (OK I made the the last three up, but the movie is about that subtle. The Psychlos are psycho! Get it?) The human race has been virtually wiped out. Those left either work mining gold for the Psychlos or hide out in caves. Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Yes, that is his name) wanders out of his cave and into the mall-like structure that it is the Psychlo mining operation. He is enslaved, and after a series of ludicrious, poorly lit scenes, ends up leading a rebellion against the Psychlos and freeing the earth.\n\nJohnny's dreary, uninteresting story benefits from being inter spliced with the wild overacting, goofy make-up, and awful special effects in the scenes with Psychlos. John Travolta is a hoot as Frankie Badguy, I mean Terl, the 9-foot head of security for the Psychlo mining operation. He looks kind of like Gene Simmons in his KISS make-up and recently deceased. If Travolta didn't have a track record of appearing in garbage and of being a Scientologist, I'd give him a little props for his awful, funny performance.\n\nThe special effects in this movie deserve especial derision. The teleport device that the Psychlos use to travel is actually cheesier than the one used in the original Star Trek, made 40 years ago, mind you.\n\nThe cities are obviously matte paintings (lit poorly to hide the fact), and too often, the movie mismanages the forced perspective scenes involving the 9-foot Psychlos and the humans so that the height difference isn't accurately represented. The camera is either really really close to one of the Psychlos to make him look big, or the actors are obviously walking on stilts.\n\nThe shot of the Psychlo home planet: You have to see it for yourself. Really not much better than the Mystery Science Theater 3000 planet. I've never seen a worse special effect in a motion picture in major release.\n\nSpeaking of camera-work, most of the shots in this film are tilted so that the scene resembles a comic book panel. Though interesting at first, this technique begins to induce nausea.\n\nThe color palette, too--green, purple, black--is ugly and jarring.\n\nIn the end, Battlefield Earth approaches the so-bad-it's-good threshold but the filmmakers treat the material seriously enough to help it remain on the bad side. Only of value as a how not to make a movie guide."

By sticking to the overdramatic wordage of the penny-a-page hack Hubbard, it destroyed any possibility of connecting with a general audience. I was fortunate enough to watch with a former Scientologist who got some great laughs for the apparent propoganda in the film. Besides the horrible overacting and that crap-lousy faux British accent of Travolta's, I couldn't get past the major plot holes to get into the film. Some of the ones I noticed that haven't been discussed much on here: 1) Johnny uses a learning machine that teaches him Psychlo language and culture. Yet he discusses \"Euclidian Geometry\". Why is Euclid, an Earthling, discussed on the machine? 2) The \"man-animals\" seem to have no written language (evidenced by the lack of writing, other than primitive cave drawings) yet, by studying Psychlo culture, he can suddenly read books in English in the Denver Library and understand a complicated manual for a nuclear device. 3) Even getting past finding a WORKING flight simulator, these machines do not instruct those who have never flown. Understanding the hover systems, as well as weaponry, of a Harrier in a few days is inconceivable. 4) The Psychlos have been searching for and mining gold for 1000 years. Apparantly in that time, they did no research on the subject. Magically, in his short time in the Denver library, Johnny picks a book which discusses the huge gold reserves at Ft. Knox. 5) Travolta's character (like I ever worried about remembering his name) questions why the gold has been put into bars yet never questions how!\n\nAnd there are so many more. Put this movie up there with \"Look Who's Talking Too\" as painful to watch a fairly talented actor sinking like a stone."

First of all, the acting is simply atrocious - no-one, repeat, no-one is believable. Adding to this is that in shortening the book to fit in the obligatory 90 minutes, almost all of the important/exciting/interesting bits of the story were ignored or, at best, changed beyond recognition.\n\nI'd still recommend the book, but as for the film, avoid enriching the church's coffers!

That would not have gone well in a movie. In time, you do come to accept this and John Travolta makes a great Psychlo. I love how they ended it to allow a sequel, unfortunately, that I am sure is much more difficult, hence, no sequel. It accurately portrays the Psychlo hostility but not the why. That would be uncovered in the sequel I am sure. The book, takes a long time to unfurl, 900 pages worth, to get through what this movie presents. It is a bit painful to struggle through those 900 pages, so this movie covers it much better and in an entertaining way. I would recommend reading the book before the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book, you might be disappointed in the book. I find the criticism of the movie quite uninformed. No one seems to know why things are the way they are nor how things developed. The movie comes in well after the take over of earth and portrays a logical condition of man falling back to a primitive society such as the American Indians. Some of the grunts and actions portrayed in the movie is a bit more primitive than the book and does not seem to work well. Though, it does express how society has forgotten its past."

        "review_detailed_main": "A thousand years in the future, Earth has been taken over by a towering alien race called Psychlos, who have enslaved humanity with the intent of stripping the land of all resources. Other humans hide in the wilderness, living a primitive life. However, one \"man-animal\" (Barry Pepper) spurs a movement to free the planet. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker play chief-security Psychlos.\n\nBased on L. Ron Hubbard's book from 1982, \"Battlefield Earth\" (2000) is post-apocalyptic sci-fi that mixes \"Planet of the Apes\" and \"Logan's Run\" with a little \"Terminator\" and some \"Star Wars\" dogfighting in the last act. It is notorious as one of the worst movies ever made, at least those with a healthy budget. The nitpicking has been so out of hand that Roger Ebert even criticized the font chosen for the opening titles (rolling my eyes).\n\nThe truth is, it's not close to being that bad. Unlike the similar \"The Lost Future\" (a low-budget flick from 2010), the pace is a little too frenzied, no doubt because the script tried to cram the first half of a 1000-page novel into a 2-hour film. Despite this, it's not like the story's unintelligible, although it needed to flesh-out the heroes further in order to make it more compelling. Some complain about the use of Dutch angles, but this is barely perceptible and, besides, they give the movie a unique vibe. Then there's the cavil about the constant double wipes to change scenes. Seriously? Who cares? No one complains about the wipes in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nSure, Travolta takes a hammy approach to his Psychlo character, as do other Psychlo cast-members, but that's part of the fun. You're supposed to roll with it. There's a glaring wink of amusement to the proceedings. So anyone who says the movie's \"unintentionally\" funny is clueless.\n\nOne of the biggest real problems is the absent of any significant female characters. There's Sabine Karsenti as Chrissy, but her role isn't that big and she's underused. Meanwhile Kelly Preston has a long-tongued cameo as Psychlo Chirk, but that's it (not counting peripherals). The remake of \"Planet of the Apes\" came out the next year and had enough sense to include Estella Warren in a fairly prominent role; the same thing with \"The Lost Future\" with Annabelle Wallis, not to mention Hannah Tointon and Eleanor Tomlinson.\n\nTo the film's credit, a certain scene in the last act prefigures a (more) memorable scene in Abrams' \"Star Trek\" nine years later. I'm not saying this is a great movie, it has its issues, but the over-criticism is unjustified and reminiscent of the ridiculous response to the well-done \"Heaven's Gate.\" Perhaps due to the links to Sciencefictionology, the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued.\n\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations. Additional stuff was filmed California.\n\nGRADE: B-/C+"

Perhaps it's greatest fault is it's boring and unoriginal. If you want to see a good movie with more-or-less the same plot, watch \"Independence Day.\"\n\nOn the other hand I'd like to point out some of the films strengths, without implying that they mitigate this travesty in any way. Forrest Whitaker is actually pretty good in his role (which would have been a larger role in the sequel.) There were also some decent performances among the supporting cast of humans and Psychlos. People just tend to forget them because the two principals were so awful.\n\nBarry Pepper is probably the worst. I've seen high school kid productions with dad's video camera that contained better performances. The guy simply has no charisma or screen presence. He should go back to bad Sci-Fi channel movies, or wherever he came from.\n\nBut let me be an apologist for John Travolta. Granted he wasn't very good in this, but he did try to appropriately channel the character from the book. Terel literally is supposed to be on the verge of psychosis, as well as being deviously intelligent and delusional. In a lot of ways Travolta pulls this off.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is he didn't have much to work with. The true stinker of this film is it's awful script. Perhaps the worst in the last 30 years. The dialog is painful at best and uninspired. It revolves around colloquialisms and clich\u00e9's that the worst hack writer wouldn't touch, and nothing that comes out of any characters lips is believable. They don't even manage to follow some of the more interesting plot points of the book, settling for spectacle and silliness like resurrecting a fleet of AV-8B Harriers. (For my part, I think the Uranium tipped bullets from the book would have been cooler; causing the Psychlo's to explode on impact!)\n\nPerhaps the most telling comparison that can be made is that with L. Ron Hubbard's novel. The book is not good, but it is entertaining. The movie is neither.\n\n...and could somebody put the writers out of our misery?"

Of course, it didn't help that the acting was awful, the direction absent, and the special effects well off the state of the art. But religion, almost without exception makes lousey film - remember the Greatest Story Ever Told? The reason is that realism goes out of the window, but is not replaced by humour, or horror, or even the avant garde. Its replaced by homage. Battlefield Earth was a hymn of praise to L. Ron Hubbard. And it was quite the most ghastly film I have seen."

I would rather watch Tomb Raider movie three times in a row than this. It is horrible. If you get a chanse to see this movie, please don't. Instead go rent a river dance special.

They miss Fort Knox and Wall street for some unknown reason (Probably because they didn't want to spring for the sets and a lot of gold-tone blocks.)\n\nI saw on the ratings 386 people gave this turkey a 10.

Guillermo del Toro (Mimic), or Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu, (Amores Perros) , as an example for latin directors of science fiction, would and could have make an excellent movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh boy, I just had the time of my life watching Battlefield Earth tonight, but I don't believe it was for the reasons the filmmakers intended. This is the single funniest movie I've seen all year, and I am still somewhat in shock that someone, anyone involved in this 70-million dollar-plus travesty didn't stop and say, \"Is all this really wise?\" I'm somewhat glad they didn't, don't get me wrong, but oh my lord where to begin...\n\nThe plot? You really want to know? Okay, it's 1000 years into the future, and earth hasn't changed all that much. Except for the fact that humanity, and much of the known galaxy, it would seem, has been mostly wiped out and subjugated by the Psychlos. Who are the Psychlos? They're dreadlocked, platform-shoed, Klingonesqe morons, to put it succinctly. These are, quite honestly, the stupidest aliens I have ever seen on film, and that includes the hapless Stormtroopers as well as those Independence Day dolts. However, these aliens don't just shoot badly-they blather on about 'the corporation' and 'leverage' like 8-year-olds made vice-presidents for a day. You will not believe their petty bickering until you hear it, and I'm still not sure I believe it. Someone actually had to write this.\n\nOh yes, there's still some humans on Earth too, though they're not a whole lot smarter than the Psychlos. They mainly only succeed through deus ex machina plot contrivances (Fighter jets and weaponry stationed at Fort Hood still work after 1000 years of neglect? They can just waltz on into Fort Knox too? What the HECK?!?) and the blundering vapidity of the vaunted Psychlo 'Chief of Security', yes, our very own John Travolta! For such a self-aggrandizing vanity picture as this movie seems to be, Travolta really doesn't come out looking very good. He makes possible nearly every step in the human's revolt, supplementing it all with the worst dialogue imaginable, and diabolical laughter over every tired joke the audience will see coming from a mile away. To go along with the stupidest alien race, he's just about the worst evil villain I've ever seen too. Only just about though.\n\nIf you have even a shred of scientific knowledge, you can rip apart most all of this movie, so just go to town. Oh, and don't get me started on the rip-offs of The Matrix, which was a rip-off of other sci-fi in and of itself, so that's just doubly lame. Well, to sum up, if you like bad movies, you'll love this one. If you don't...um, don't touch this one with a ten-foot ugly stick.\n\nOh, and \"Piece of cake. Piece of cake.\" is now my new catch phrase for however long till I get bored of it. Just thought you'd like to know. Nice that idioms survive the coming apocalypse as well as thermonuclear bombs and library books."

As I think about it now, there's a real casting problem when the (supposed to be despicable) villain or villains in a movie (I'm thinking John Travolta here) have more \"presence\" and charisma than the hero. Yes, I think that's the source of my initial negative impressions: the villain (Travolta) out-classes the hero (Pepper). Yes, a movie annoys me when I find myself rooting for the bad guys.

Picture movie Utopia, where Star Wars Episode 1 lived up to the hype and more. It was the end-all and be-all of sci-fi. Well, that's what BE made Wing Commander look like. I hated all the characters and didn't care what happened to them. The plot was laugh out loud \"yeah, right\" even by summer movie standards. The dialogue was beyond pointless by same standards. And as one of the reviewers put it, someone had better audit the special effects team to see what happened to all the money. Why? Why was this movie made? Who besides John Travolta thought this movie was a good idea? Maybe this movie got made just to shut him up for awhile. Roger Corman, I mean Christian, would do well to brush this one under the rug. By no means should you pay money to see this movie; I only saw it because I got in free."

One thing lack of the effects is the alien being.\n\nThe aliens supposed to be tall but it can be easily seen that the actor wear some support on their leg and when they walk around, it can be noticed incredibly fast. Some effects are rather fake, some of the background is not well done.\n\nOther than that, a worth watching movie."

Who in their right mind gave this a score higher than 1?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, without a doubt this was the WORST movie I've seen this year and possibly one of the worst ever. The acting was atrocious, the script non-existent, the special effects unexceptional, the sound excessively loud, the story dumb, and the characters ranged from uninteresting to downright idiotic. Recently, I had thought that John Travolta had been improving as an actor. However, this piece of garbage set him down a notch or two in my book. What's worse, I hear there might be a SEQUEL!!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I always thought that advertising should be short and precise. This advertising of L. Ron Hubbard and his kind of religious beliefs, lastet far too long. It was almost 2 hrs of attempted brainwashing. Thank goodness I am not seduced by triviality of that kind, which in this case is almost a pity, as I would have enjoyed this movie far more if I were forced into some kind of trancelike acceptance.\n\nBut so, this movie is just BAD !!! Don\u00b4t spend any money on it, and don\u00b4t waste your own precious time on it. I did so quite some time ago and I still regret it.\n\nIn days to come, if I get the urge to watch any kind of SF, I\u00b4d even prefer the 100th sequel of Star Trek or that romance loaded s*** like Star Wars Episode II. At least something I COULD enjoy - with a bit of an effort.\n\nAh yes, there may be good acting (I don\u00b4t think so, personally )and one might appreciate things like the setting and the direction, etc. But for me it doesn\u00b4t make up for the rest. By the way, I am not one to care about the plot very much - but this was too much, even for me."

Some how it didn't because I laughed my head off.\n\nSorry John. You just don't learn do you? You first kill your career, get saved by Pulp Fiction, then decide, \"What the heck, let's kill it again\"\n\nSo in finalizing, Im not looking forward to any more John Travolta movies or religiously funded ones!"

BE even has some pretty good actors, but sadly they appear to have been stripped of their acting abilities during the making of this movie. As for the plot, it could have been written by a five year old child, it's completely unoriginal (and the bad guys are called Psychlos, what's up with that?). The only mildly redeeming thing is the special effects, but with everything else about the movie being crap they don't even come close to saving it.\n\nIn short, this movie is a big time stinker. I expected it to be poor when i rented it, but I was shocked when I discovered how crappy it really is. I rate it 1 out of 10 (since I can't rate 0)."

My conclusion: \"Battlefield Earth\" is that rare mix of a film that has NO appealing qualities - not even little ones - and a big-ass budget. I hereby christen it the biggest waste of money in Hollywood history. Not much else needs to be said; the film mocks itself. However, I did have a rollicking fun time at the movie theater, laughing my head off most of the time."
