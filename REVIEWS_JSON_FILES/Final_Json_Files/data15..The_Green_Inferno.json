        "review_detailed_main": "The Green Inferno is a standard Eli Roth fare - gore galore, cannibalism, and occasional humor - set in the Amazon rainforest. The acting is terrible right off the bat, but thankfully it isn't an issue halfway through the movie when the body count starts up. The characters themselves are paper thin, only about 3 of which are given actual personalities while the others are just fodder for the natives.\n\nThe premise of the movie is disturbing and will sound appealing to most horror fans, including myself, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, the gore is done very well; as usual Roth uses great practical effects to create some wince-inducing scenes. The problem is that the first half of the movie feels like a student film. Really bad acting, horrific dialogue, and the documentary style filming doesn't help at all. It's not so much an issue once the characters are captured, but you aren't able to get immersed into the world from the get-go so you're never truly frightened or concerned for them when the bloodshed begins.\n\nThe biggest issue is that The Green Inferno isn't scary in the slightest. Apart from a cheap jump scare near the end, there's little to no suspense or tension in the movie. It's just a linear storyline with characters getting killed off one by one with very little left to the imagination. It also isn't funny. There's maybe two times I chuckled at the tongue-in-cheek jokes. Most of them come across as forced, partly due to the acting and partly due to the jokes not being very funny. Roth tries for a darker, more disturbing atmosphere and he succeeds, but he sacrificed the potential fun to be had with the film. It's not terrible - Eli Roth fans will get exactly what they're expecting - but it also isn't anything new. The Green Inferno is a decent effort but a wholly mediocre movie watching experience."

        "review_title": "Eli Roth returns with an uneven cannibal flick",
        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth is a director whose fame certainly goes before him. These days you don't really get many directors unashamedly dedicated to the horror genre like you did in years gone by. I like Eli Roth for this reason and I do find him a somewhat engaging, funny and entertaining guy. On the flip side I would have to say that I have found his output to be somewhat patchy and uneven. And frustratingly sparse at that. The Green Inferno is his first feature film as director since Hostel: Part II from way back in 2007! It's a long time to be out of the game. The question would have to be has he came back in a good way? Well, despite the undoubted promise of the central idea, it's a film that is kind of as frustrating as most of his other work.\n\nThe basic idea here is to bring back a type of movie that only really existed briefly over thirty years ago. The cannibal film was a particularly notorious sub-genre. Most of the films got banned here in the UK; some still remain so to this day in their uncut forms. Their combination of graphic violence, sexual assault and real animal killing made them real bad boys of the horror genre. Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is the one film that Roth has mentioned in particular as an influence and for this viewer it is easily one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Its docudrama, found footage style mixed with a proper mean-spiritedness made it a pretty gruelling film but very well made. The Green Inferno takes a decidedly different approach to its material and it's not always a successful one. Where Holocaust was relentlessly confrontational, Roth's film is often quite jokey. This approach means that the tone overall fluctuates wildly but it definitely dissipates the overall threat posed by the cannibals. The choice of protagonists points to the change immediately in that it centres on a group of eco aware students who travel into the middle of the Amazonian rain-forest to stage a viral protest against some environment destroying workers, needless to say things take a bad turn and they wind up captive by a tribe of cannibals. The very fact that the film centres on a group of students makes this film surely the first cannibal film that doubles up as a teen movie! It's an awkward combination with a pretty ropey script and \u2013 the main girl played by Lorenzo Izzo aside - unlikable characters. The social commentary is not so unexpected for this type of movie, as Cannibal Holocaust had that too but it is modernised considerably here \u2013 the target is after all viral warriors who are more interested in being famous than for doing the right thing.\n\nSo how does it work simply as a horror movie? Well, it certainly has its fair share of gory violence. But it has less impact than it should because of the silly jokey tone that permeates it, even once the students have been captured. Because they aren't taking their situation seriously enough, it's hard for us in the audience to either unfortunately. The on-location photography certainly adds a fair bit it has to be said and the cannibals themselves are quite distinctive too, in particular the more prominent members of the tribe were somewhat creepy. I can't help feeling though that if Roth had reigned in the silly stuff and went full-on with this material with a more disciplined approach then it would have made for a far better film. It feels slightly like a missed opportunity and I am sad to say this as I was really on this one's side and had quite a bit of optimism for it."

A group of college students travel to a remote Peruvian location to protest a natural gas company's encroachment on an isolated, primitive native village. The students initial efforts are a success, but when their plane out crashes into the jungle, the natives aren't exactly thankful for the Americans' good deeds, preferring to butcher them and eat them.\n\nRoth skewers Western do-good-ism and liberal interference with foreign cultures, showing that even the best intentions can (literally) come back to bite them. The lead performance from Lorenza Izzo is good as the freshman student whose naivete is shattered in more ways than one. The rest of the cast just has to scream a lot. The violence is extreme, the blood copious, and the gore plentiful, but it becomes just a bunch of latex and Karo syrup after a while. I realized watching this that Roth seems to have specialized in the fear of the traveler in foreign lands, whether it's city folk in the deep country (Cabin Fever), Americans in Eastern Europe (the Hostel films), or South America (Aftershock and this movie). I would have given this a higher rating if it weren't for the nonsensical ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "If Eli Roth is known for one thing, it's that he is known for high levels of violence in his films and pushing the envelope. And The Green Inferno is no exception, it's easily the most graphic movie of the year to receive a theatrical release. The movie features some extremely cringe-worthy scenes where the villages show no mercy to the young students. Of course, this is the focal point of the movie, the gore/torture of these somewhat arrogant, twenty somethings.\n\nYes, there is some social commentary in the movie, mostly poking fun at today's society and how everyone wants to 'appear' to be fighting for a cause when in fact, they are doing very little. And yes, he has a point here, but it isn't as thought provoking as he wants it to be, especially once the carnage starts and those ideas fly out the window. Only for those ideas to awkwardly return at the end of the movie.\n\nThere is not much to say about this movie other than the obvious, it's extremely violent, nothing more nothing less. The Green Inferno is obviously a homage to those 80s cannibalistic horror movies. Which means the body count is high and the foreigners are going to be punished by the natives in some of the most cruel ways imaginable (at least since the SAW series). But I can't help but feel a bit letdown after years of build up with the movie being stuck in release hell.\n\nWhile The Green Inferno isn't on par with other strong horror contenders for best horror movie of 2015, it is easily the nastiest, most violent movie of the year. Thus, if the torture-porn genre is your cup of tea, then look no further, you've found your next fix!"

Honestly the Movie is just like wrong turn but with more cannibals and in a different terrain.the beginning was unnecessarily long ; especially one part where two of the people go taking a piss ; like the scene was so long and unnecessary in my opinion. Basically it's just a normal cannibal movie that's overrated in my opinion ye."

        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth is a director whose style is evolving, reaching a more refined level. In his beginnings he was much more direct and dirty, if I may say so, which has its advantages, because he gave you what you were looking for, a no-holds-barred gore, which sometimes turned into real fun-fests, but at other times became excessively repetitive and flat. This level up helps to cover up what for me, is his biggest Achilles heel, his limited level as a dialogue writer, which still hasn't improved. Focusing on The Green Inferno, we have a clear homage to the Italian cannibal cinema of the 70s and 80s. If you're familiar with Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox and liked them, you'll surely love Green Inferno, but if you disliked those, I don't think this is the film for you. Because let's face it, when you're about to see a film whose plot is cannibalism in the Amazon, well, Roth isn't fooling you. He may offer it to you in smaller quantities than you expected and yet it's still more substantial than the average level of horror today. Perhaps what most sets him apart from the older films is that first part of the film with a social critique never before seen in Roth's filmography. The presentation of the characters, both activists and indigenous and their interpretations are more than correct. You get to empathize with some of them, which may not be very pleasant when you know what awaits them... The music by Manuel Riveiro is a success, as well as the photography by Antonio Quercia and the FX by Ozzy Alvarez.\n\nBecause let's not fool ourselves, hell may be green, but its smell is red."

        "review_detailed_main": "Think about the first time you rode some big, new roller coaster. As you waited in line and contemplated what lay ahead, your heart started beating faster. When you occupied your seat, and the picture in front of you began to move, you found yourself wondering what you had gotten yourself into. As you arrived at that first really scary moment, you resisted the urge to close your eyes, even as others around you were enjoying the thrill by thrusting their arms into the air. From that point, everything was a blur of shouts and screams, ups and downs, punctuated by brief moments of relative stillness. Then, suddenly, the ride ended. You were surprised how quickly it went by and, even though you felt a little queasy, you were glad you had the experience. You even may have commented that it wasn't as bad as you thought it was going to be, and that you kind of enjoyed it, all as you started to look forward to that next uncomfortable challenge. You just rode a scary new coaster, but might as well have been experiencing the uncomfortable thrill of a new Eli Roth movie\u0085 one like \"The Green Inferno\" (R, 1:40), for example.\n\nPersonal feelings about graphically violent movies like the \"Saw\" franchise or Roth's own \"Hostel\" films aside, Roth's film \"The Green Inferno\" has a colorful history. The film traces its roots to cannibal-themed movies made in Italy during the 1970s and 80s. Roth's 2015 resurrection of this controversial horror sub-genre draws most directly from 1980's \"Cannibal Holocaust\", a movie so realistic that director Ruggero Deodato was arrested and put on trial for the murder of some of the actors in the film. (Deodato was only exonerated after he gathered all of his actors together for a TV show appearance and then demonstrated in court the special effects used to create the actors' \"deaths\".) That movie's working title was \"The Green Inferno\", a title which was eventually applied to the most gruesome scenes in \"Cannibal Holocaust\", specifically, the film within the film that purports to show footage from a missing documentary film crew. (This was the first use of the \"found footage\" or \"pseudo-documentary\" device, which was popularized in the U.S. by 1999's \"The Blair Witch Project\".) The title \"The Green Inferno\" was later also used as an alternate title for the 1988 sequel \"Cannibal Holocaust II\". Eli Roth filmed \"The Green Inferno\" in the jungles of Peru in 2012. His film opened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It was scheduled to be released in the U.S. in September 2014, but financial problems at the film's production company led to the film being pulled. Blumhouse Productions stepped in and the company's multi-platform releasing arm, BH Tilt, released \"The Green Inferno\" on September 25, 2015.\n\nAfter a brief scene of bulldozers flattening a rain forest in the Amazon, the narrative of Roth's cannibal film starts innocuously on the streets of New York City. College freshman Justine (Lorenza Izzo) and her roommate, Kaycee (singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira), are annoyed by the student activists protesting outside their window, but Justine is also intrigued. She attends one of the group's meetings in which their charismatic student leader, Alejandro (Ariel Levy), discusses their plan to save a village in Peru from being overrun by bulldozers paving the way for a natural gas mining operation. The students plan to dress as workers, chain themselves to trees and bulldozers, then live stream video from their cell phones to get the world's attention \u2013 and keep themselves from being shot by the armed mercenaries which protect the operation. Justine's dad (Richard Burgi), a lawyer at the U.N., expresses his reservations, but Justine goes on what she naively believes will be a weekend trip to save a native tribe from extinction.\n\nAfter landing in Peru, everything goes according to plan until their small plane crashes in the Amazonian jungle. Several of the students die in the crash, but the survivors are captured by the very tribe that the group was there to save. Not speaking any English or having had any positive experience with outsiders, the tribe considers their captives their enemy \u2013 and their dinner. One of the students is ritualistically killed by the village's elder / high priestess (Antonieta Pari) and then he is promptly dismembered, cooked and eaten. His friends watch in horror from behind the wooden bars where they are confined. What follows are more killings, more feasting and various attempts by the students to escape before the natives finish them off, whether for food, as punishment, or because of their brutal religious practices.\n\n\"The Green Inferno\" is a wonderful family movie. (Still reading? Just checking.) Actually, the film is more restrained than I expected. There's much less nudity than in previous Eli Roth movies and the gore, as disturbing as it is, could have been a lot more graphic, given what's happening on screen. Most of what's shown is on par with typical slasher flicks. You might even say that this is a relatively\u0085 tasteful cannibal movie. The story's solid, the acting's fairly decent for this genre and the film works as a horror movie, a thriller, a political commentary and there's even some dark comedy. Some call this kind of movie \"torture porn\". I think that's a stretch, but the more graphic scenes make it difficult to simply call this movie \"entertaining\" without qualifying the term. I judge movies based on how entertaining they are and how well they each accomplish their individual goals. Based on those measures, I'd have to say that, much like that big, new roller coaster, this movie isn't for everyone, but many will find it bloody good. \"B+\""

Filming and acting were better than expected and sold me. Part of the reason the acting was somewhat capturing was the reality of a tropical Peruvian forest and the gusto in which the novice tribal people took to their roles. End result is nobody (including the eco provocateurs, tribes peoples, deforesters) came away smelling like roses, in fact, I would not have been displeased if, in the end, they were all munched upon by the resident leopard, vanquisher of evil. A couple of picky points that lowered the rating. First, every tribal member (no matter the age) was totally painted in red clay like pigment - all the time; not realistic given the humid conditions and time they would have needed to apply said substance. Second, all the women (and young girls) wore tops to cover their breasts which as we all know about tropical tribes - that just doesn't happen. Third, why would the village attack the construction armed mercenaries in a clearing given their stealth in a forest. Fourth, a lot of gaps foremost was Samantha's escape then we hear nothing more. Supposedly we are suppose to pay attention to tattoos. Suggestion: Watch again, afterwards, with cast commentary as it's more interesting than the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The films of Eli Roth are an acquired taste, or at least for me personally they were. It's not because Quentin Tarantino proclaims that Roth is the future of the horror genre, simply based on having seen \"Cabin Fever\" that the rest of us genre fanatics obediently have to agree. It took me two viewings before I could remotely appreciate \"Cabin Fever\" and both \"Hostel\" movies are quite heavily flawed as well. But there's one thing you really can't deny and that is that Eli Roth is an avid and obsessive lover of the genre and that clearly shows in every film he delivers. \"The Green Inferno\" is a giant homage \u2013 love letter, even \u2013 to the temporarily popular trend of Italian cannibal movies from the late 70s & early 80s. This very secluded horror niche contains relatively few titles, but each and every single one is a notorious and bona fide cult classic. The most infamous and influential one is, of course, Ruggero Deodato's \"Cannibal Holocaust\", but there are several more beauties out there and Eli Roth refers to all of them here, like \"Deep River Savages\", \"Cannibal Ferox\", \"Mountain of the Cannibal God\", \"Jungle Holocaust\" and \"Cannibal Apocalypse\". In case \"The Green Inferno\" triggered your appetite \u2013 so to speak \u2013 make sure that you track down all these controversial but hugely fascinating films.\n\nThe beautiful and ambitious freshman student Justine joins an environmentalist activist group led by the charismatic Alejandro, as they are about to travel to Peru in order to protest against the deforestation of the Amazonian rain forest. After a successful, but for Justine very traumatizing confrontation with the deconstruction workers and their bulldozers, the group's ramshackle old plane crashes down in the jungle. Many of the group members die instantly in the crash or in freaky accidents, but the fate of the survivors is even worse as they are promptly surrounded by a tribe of red-colored cannibals. During their captivity in a cage, fear and desperation takes the upper hand while some of the group members \u2013 most notably Alejandro \u2013 show their true cowardly and repulsive nature. Jungle and cannibal exploitation movies are associated with extreme gore, shockingly explicit ritual killings and copious amounts of bloodshed. Eli Roth certainly doesn't cut back on grotesque violence, as I hoped and expected, but he was wise enough not to include or refer to any real animal killing sequences which made \"Cannibal Holocaust\" so controversial. \"The Green Inferno\" evidently isn't suitable for viewers with weak stomachs or sensitive nerves, as several characters are torn to pieces, impaled, beheaded or eaten alive. Although nicely disguised and face-painted (particularly the headhunter and the Elder lady) the extras playing the cannibal tribe members don't come across as too menacing or bloodthirsty, at least not in comparison to the old Italian movies. In a movie handling about primitive tribes and straightforward massacres, you obviously can't expect too much underlying tension or intelligent plot twists, but Roth and his co-writer Guillermo Amoedo nevertheless tried their hardest to provide the characters with some depth and the script with some political insights. Another thing they do rather well is bring variety and surprise in the order the group members are picked off. Some of the characters' deaths come unexpected and quicker/later than I thought. Unfortunately, however, it does remain an Eli Roth film and he continues to make annoying mistakes over and over again\u0085 I'm referring to an overlong first half hour in which practically nothing happens except for a lot of blah blah (although it's not as bad as in \"Hostel\"), the use of infantile toilet humor (the tarantula sequence or the ridiculous diarrhea moment) and downright idiotic stuff (like getting an entire cannibal tribe stoned by hiding a little bag of weed in a corpse about to be cooked). But hey, although flawed and badly acted most of the time, it's definitely my favorite Eli Roth film! Oh, and apparently Mr. Roth is also married to the incredibly cute (and 17 years younger than him) lead actress Lorena Izzo. Way to go, Eli!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Green Inferno is well done, and highly effective at creating tension and instilling fear in the viewers. Even though there are parts that look and feel fake, even cheesy.\n\nI'm assuming most of you reading this is familiar with Eli Roth, or at least the violent nature of his films. Yes, this one is violent. You want carnage, you want gore, it's got it. You cannot see this if you have a weak stomach, I'm telling you straight. It's not loaded with it, but a few scenes are very over-the-top and a few are even terribly realistic. I'm used to this sort of material and still I had to look away during two scenes first time I watched it.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's hit some other elements. The acting teeter-totters, some times it works, sometimes it doesn't. But I'm talking about the actual actors, the fact that the villagers are all authentic tribesmen and women, is one of the really cool things about this film. At times it almost feels like a documentary. The plot, basic. And from the start, you get an idea of what Eli Roth thinks about protesters and college students and their tendency to jump aboard the \"causes-ship\" to support their entitlement. This film is a message, but it's also a way to vicariously blow out some steam.\n\nMovie's a bit predictable, camera's too shaky, and there are times I felt like Eli Roth was trying too hard to stir up audiences' anger towards his characters, but all in all it's a well done movie and CAN be enjoyable, if you can stomach it and if you understand that it's just a movie. I personally felt it was too weak and where it wasn't, it was too strong. There wasn't really an in-between.\n\nIf anybody is planning on seeing this, and are not used to extreme graphic content, I suggest skipping this one.\n\nEDIT: I actually ended up showing this movie to a friend of mine, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it a bit more than I did previously. I gave it two more stars. It's still as brutal as I remember, but I gotta admit, it was very well done, and the actors did a fantastic job. Really decent throwback to the cannibal exploitation genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd hoped for something - maybe a more clearly horrifying, less trashy-exploitative reinterpretation of the 70's Italian shocker that Mr. Roth was faithfully emulating. There WAS something unnerving (and elusive) to \"Cannibal Holocaust,\"as grubby and amateur an effort that it was. Sadly however, \"The Green Inferno\" misses whatever that quality was by such a huge margin, one wonders what on earth the filmmaker was thinking. Did he even understand what made that earlier film work?\n\nCardboard characters with clich\u00e9 feelings, motivations so caricatured they border on contempt for the audience. We don't care that these characters may perish. Neither the story nor the filmmakers take them very seriously beyond their value as flesh, a miscalculation on several levels.\n\nThe internet has conditioned or calloused us to footage of dismemberment, beheading and viscera. This subject was taboo and terrifying in the 70's when one could only see it on the rare videotape - the secretive quality made it so much more forbidden. Today, we actually need more context to be horrified.\n\nThe primitive natives could have played a wonderful contrast to the American/European characters, but they were treated with even less interest beyond their basic caricature. A simple look at \"Apocalypto\" might have given Mr. Roth some pointers about how an alien culture can be horrifying with violence. But there is nothing that lofty here. What the natives do is given the aura of \"yikes\" rather than dread or horror.\n\n\"What is it that makes cannibalism horrifying?\" is a question which isn't even asked in this film. The filmmaker takes it for granted that it IS horrifying and leaves it there. There is no exploration beyond the visual; what we do get in terms of exploration feels tame since there is no awareness of why it even needs to be understood.\n\nHorror is not an easy genre to master, we are skeptical about the nature of manipulation. We are more aware than ever about psychology, media, character motivations and what makes stories compelling; it's the reason why TV and film has rapidly become so much more sophisticated. Death requires more context to induce terror - horror movies cannot take anything for granted. Mr Roth's successful efforts concentrate on the issues of sadism/torture and/or the fear of pain. This one takes the subject of cannibalism and doesn't explore it beyond it's basic mechanism.\n\nThis is a sad, bland film which is sadder given how much the intent was to be shocking and ghastly. It achieves neither."

So I was looking forward to finally see it and when Fangoria announced that it would be released around Halloween 2015 I immediately went for it.\n\nEli Roth is known for delivering gory flicks but this must took him to the edge of it all. Face it, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is the flick that is still the best and after seeing The Green Inferno it still is but this isn't bad at all.\n\nI must say that for me the only problem was the fact that it took 40 minutes before the gore comes in. before that we do have our lesson in destroying the world by tearing down the Amazon. Maybe it's a statement or maybe not but after that cheesy moment things go rather wrong. And it's from that point that this flick turns into a gorefest. It could gave been a 10 out of 10 wasn't it for the fact that it do has a few over the top moments that made it a bit funny. Intended, I don't know? For example the seat crashing down when the plane explodes or the caged girl having diarrhea.\n\nBut don't let that turn you away, I can guarantee that for those never seen a cannibal flick they will turn it off or the easily offended will be shocked. And don't let you be fooled by the brown guy being killed first. It was done that way back in the seventies and eighties.\n\nIt was worth the wait, comes straight on the must see list after Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox (1981).\n\nGore 5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

Also the Director keeps showing basically the same shot over and over of the natives, that being a wide shot of the village. The shooting is cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. It looks like an iphone. Seriously. I was Wondering early on what kind of camera they used because it was hideous to look at. This guy's friends with Tarantino? The setup is super weak and goes on forever. I fidgeted the whole time, nodding off at one point. There is 1 scene of cannibalism, it's half decent but brief. Most of the scenes in the movie are trite and simple minded. I read an interview with Roth recently and he said he would never do another Hostile because it would be like going back to High School, he's grown that much as a director. I'm sorry Eli but you've done exactly the opposite - you've regressed: This is as bad as many a 1st- timer's efforts."

Gore is all there, plenty of cannibalism and nice jungle shots with authentic tribe to boot.\n\nThe movie manages to pull additional layer of subversive commentary, which is a big plus. It satirizes the terrorist-activists, shows hypocrisy of cynical Che-wannabe and his adventure-seeking poser friends. Perhaps the most scarring thing in the movie is not the cannibalism, but crude brain washing indoctrination and imperialist condescension that goes in classrooms during what nowadays passes as University education. The acting becomes more convincing in the second, gore and action filled part.\n\nOverall, it is a pretty decent contemporary update on the genre that had its heyday in Italy, circa 1980."

        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth is one of those film makers that you don't have to love, but you can at least respect. An unabashed homage to Cannibal Holocaust (1980), one of the most notorious American horror films ever made, The Green Inferno follows a group of well meaning (ish) college students going to the Amazon to protest the bulldozing of the rainforest.\n\nOnly to then be captured by a tribe of truly ravenous and remorseless cannibals. Suffice to say, this movie is not for everything. Those with low tolerance for gore and violence, stay away. But for those who can take it, I honestly think The Green Inferno is a pretty good time.\n\nRoth's shortcomings as a film maker are apparent: the script can be hilariously bad at times, as can some of the performances. He also tends to struggle with tone; I know black comedy is inherent with some of his films, but there are some cartoonish moments that do feel a bit out of place (particularly involving a woman pooping).\n\nWhat I was surprised the most by with this movie was - incredibly - its nuance. The movie takes a little while to get going, which I prefer. I'm always struck by - despite the extreme gore and cruelty we see with a lot of Roth's fims - how patient they actually tend to be. It's not just nonstop violence for 90 minutes; it's actually well set up. I can't say that the characters and their relationships AREN'T developed well (even if some people believe it's the job of a film maker to get you to LOVE the characters).\n\nBut more than that, the movie does a good job at conveying its central point: people can be bad regardless of whether they're \"oppressed\" or not. The reality is, given the context, you'll find yourself rooting for the developers bulldozing the forest, as in this specific situation, they're the saviours our unlucky protagonists need to get out of this thing. Roth isn't saying that everything they do is justified, but he's kind of pointing out an obvious truth that most simplistic narratives tend to actively ignore (again, more on that later).\n\nAnd oh boy, are these people unlucky. Roth manages to paint the most nightmarish scenario you can imagine; the terror of the situation is conveyed thoroughly, with the wailing shrieks of our victims and copious amounts of shocking violence. Although, it never goes completely overboard, there's a prevailing sense watching this thing that ANYTHING can happen. It's the ultimate watch-through-your-fingers movie, honestly. Effective use of practical effects too really drives it all home.\n\nThe ending of this film is pretty polarizing, but I think it mostly works. Sure, Lorena Izzo's character was probably not the RIGHT person to make the choice that she does (frankly, I think a lot of other people in the movie would've been better suited for it). But, I think the message The Green Inferno sends is...well, the world is complicated. Obviously, there's a personal injustice to the ending that makes the audience's blood boil, but in the grand scheme of things, is her decision really THAT crazy?\n\nAs for the accusations of racism...I mean, it is what it is. You really can't make this movie without a tinge of \"fearing the other,\" and Roth's response to that criticism (i.e. \"this movie is not the biggest threat to these people, no one is taking their land because of this movie\"), was sensible.\n\nOverall, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie. It is a nightmare. It is extremely messed up. But it's also a surprisingly complicated movie that we probably wouldn't see made today, and for that, I have to commend Eli Roth."

The most frightening part was realizing that I wasted about 1.5 hours and five dollars on it. 2.A social commentary on rain forest deforestation. The film portrays a small group of college students lead by an uncompromising, hypocritical ideologue on a sojourn into the Peruvian rain forest to disrupt deforestation. While trite in theory, the action comes off even worse. The worst action, however, is reserved for the \"never-before-filmed\" tribe of Peruvian hut-dwellers. Let's hope they never have access to power down there in their huts so they won't see how lame this film is. 3. Well-filmed. The cinematography is just not particularly good (e.g. the jaguar that is barely visible and the airplane scene).It seems as though Roth elected to use the same quality of camera as the folks who made mid- 90s episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark. 4. Well-written. Deaths happen with no particular rhyme or reason with total disregard to improving the plot. There's also no particularly like-able character throughout the whole movie, and the conclusion leaves much to be desired. Just an altogether poor effort. 5. Well-acted.\n\nI suppose in summary, you could consider the Green Inferno to be a slightly gory waste of time (and yes, I did like Hostel)."

So be warned!\n\nSurprisingly, the film has a message: humans are an evil species. Indigenous and civilised humans.\n\nThe biggest criticism I have concerns the ending: while everyone probably agrees, that the boss of the group of young activists was a jerk, it is NOT enough to leave him with the cannibals behind to be tortured and eaten. But that was the main character's decision at the end of the movie.\n\nFurthermore, she protected the cannibals when she reported them. But why? Why did she lie for the benefit of the cannibals? So they get away with their horrible crimes against the rest of the members of the group who all died a horrible death. So these cannibals can continue with their crimes.\n\nEven if the cannibals believed, that this group of young people belonged to the evil \"bulldozer people\" (which was not the case): Nothing would justify torturing, killing and eating any humans.\n\nTherefore, the ending of the story has a bad aftertaste. I don't know what would have been a better ending, but I'm not a story writer.\n\nI would have rated the film 7 stars if the storywriters had come up with a better ending."

The field is so big \u2013 Spaghetti-Westerns, mercenary-flicks, Mondo, Blaxploitation, Nunsploitation, Nazisploitation\u0085\n\nLittle Eli: Please, no Nazis for me! You know\u0085 my image and all.\n\nBig Quentin: Well, then how about a Cannibal-flick? There hasn't been a real one for almost 40 years.\n\nLittle Eli: Like \"Cannibal Holocaust\"? I love that film! Always wanted to make a movie like that Lenzi-dude (pronounces it \"Lencee\").\n\nBig Quentin: Yeah\u0085 (rolls his eyes). But not just 'like' \"Cannibal Holocaust\", but more like a remake without calling it a remake. Remember: we don't call it \"plagiarizing\", we call it \"a nod\". You get my drift?\n\nLittle Eli: Yes, Sir. Stealing. But won't horror-buffs notice that? \"Cannibal Holocaust\" is rather influential and well-known among aficionados.\n\nBig Quentin: For god's sake, you think real horror-buffs watch your crap? No, you've got another target-audience. Impressionable teenagers, who wouldn't know a classic horror-film from Adam. So make it hip, make it snappy. Keep it light with the humour, add a few pretty faces. You know, a few hunks for the gals and a few bazongas for the boys. Think of \"Scream\", just with jungle-cannibals instead of psycho-killers.\n\nLittle Eli: What about the actors? Should I also work with laymen like Lenzi did in \"Cannibal Holocaust\"?\n\nBig Quentin: Well, perhaps not complete laymen. Bad actors will do. You know, Reality-TV-material, acting-school-graduates, bimbos. Heck, you tell me \u0085 you married one!\n\nLittle Eli: Great Idea!\n\nBig Quentin: And add some drugged-out socialites, kids will dig that. Like the one with the vacant stare \u0085\n\nLittle Eli: Who? Paris?\n\nBig Quentin: No, the newer model in the bleached wig.\n\nLittle Eli: And what about the animal-snuff? Don't think that stuff would be \"contemporary\".\n\nBig Quentin: Of course not, you numb-skull! Most of your fans are vegan college-kids, who consider eating fish-fingers genocide! Instead, give it an \"environmentally-friendly\"-twist. Those kids will gobble it down.\n\nLittle Eli: How about\u0085 (bites his lips in contemplation)\u0085 how about a group of wealthy, sheltered college-kids traveling to the rain forest to\u0085 to, you know, \"make a difference\"?\n\nBig Quentin: Atta boy! Have their plane crash in the jungle after they have saved some trees. You know: \"South-America\"? \"Plane-crash\"? \"Realism\"\u0085 hint-hint?\n\nLittle Eli: Of course, that was also such a great film! Oh, master! You're a genius! Maybe you could figure it out for me: In the real \"Cannibal Holocaust\", for the life of me, I don't get how they managed that scene with the impaled girl\u0085 I mean, it looked so\u0085 real!\n\nBig Quentin: That's because you're a hack, who doesn't know the first thing about convincing special-effects. Unlike Ruggero\u0085 but now get on with it! I don't want to sit here all day long!\n\nLittle Eli: Guess you're right, Sir. (Applies more spit and polishes at an even fast pace). By the way: What's a \"Rooggeroh\", Sir\u0085 ?\n\nBig Quentin: (sighs, puffs on his cigar and continues to read a copy of Variety)\n\n3/10"

Don't get me wrong, I love the guy since 'sentinel', But him being cast previously in Hostel (and killed), and seeing Roth has a cult following most of whom have therefore seen mr. Burgi before, is spoiling the illusion of realism. There was no reason not to use a fresh face.\n\nYou will get what you came for: cannibals, dismemberments, and flesh-eating. We also get some torture, female genitalia mutilation, and mass zombie-like behavior as well, the last of which seemed out of place and unrealistic. Some parts are silly and not in a good way, I can't tell which ones (spoiler). Some minor CGI, can't tell... (spoiler).\n\nThere are some nice 'setups' in the movie, and I applaud it for that. We aren't merely talking about a documentary, we have people with an actual agenda and some twists. Ariel Levy does a great job in being unlikeable and providing a story arc, evolving into a near psychopathic personality.\n\nThe movie got a little carried away with some methods that ruined the realism, but to each his own. To me, that's what hurt the most. The way how the movie wraps itself up makes little sense, we get some ideas thrown in that didn't really work, combine or satisfy - but that's just the last 2 minutes.\n\nIn all, a careful recommendation to the fans of the genre."

Also it was amusing that Eli Roth used a lot of over dramatic music, which adds to his whole \"joke\" directed towards Social Justice Warriors. The entire message of this film was to expose to people on how a lot of activists unfortunately get themselves into issues that end up being too extreme/dangerous for them to handle. In this case, the activists in the film end up crash landing into the forest they put efforts forth to protect only to be kidnapped and eaten by cannibals.\n\nDespite that there isn't a whole lot of \"deep meaning\" in this movie, I will say that it is definitely self aware when it comes to social commentary and how a lot of the characters lack \"common sense\". Personally, I found this very amusing. Plus I wouldn't say that this film is solely just a horror film, but as a whole a horror comedy without needing to \"stress\" the comedic value. Definitely would not recommend this film to any squeamish folks, but if you are all for the gore and the semi offensive aspects then dive on in!\n\nAlso as a last note; really not sure why people were disappointed in this film. Granted, not everyone is going to like a film. But as for the massive amount of negative feedback, I am kind of left scratching my head as to why that is. Cause I am sure this movie is a hell of a lot better than trash like Unfriended."

Even if we have \"sacrifice\" a bit for it (no puns intended). The story rolls on and might only take off (again, no pun intended), when there is an unplanned \"event\" happening. Our characters have to face that what they thought they were protecting. More than that would be spoiling the little story there is. Unfortunately the ending might spoil it for you too ... if it wasn't spoiled before ... Not great by any means, but decent enough for one watch"

Roth has given me a strange indulgence as I could not wait for all of them to die. It was an ensemble of college kids I could not wait to see killed.\n\nIf you like cannibal films at all you should check out the Green Inferno, it ups the whole genre thanks to the use of modern day special effects.At the same time if you ever wanted to punch an obnoxious hipster in his face than you should use this movie as therapy."

The story is not well-written and Justine joining the group of activists is totally unconvincing. The conclusion is awful.

Well, those terrible films didn't need an homage, most of them needed to be forgotten, like this. It's easy to see why it wasn't widely released, or liked. It's basically a rip off of Cannibal Feroux, only worse. The characters are shallow, the situations are stupid. This is nearly unwatchable, even the violence is so cartoony as to be laughable. Torture porn such as this should simply be pushed aside and forgotten. The little stupid scare at the end was ridiculous and expected. Just a silly, dull movie by a director whose didn't have a chance to be a has been, since he's a never was.

        "review_detailed_main": "Oddly enough I never got around to watch Eli Roth's \"The Green Inferno\" movie before 2017, although that I had been told that it was a rather good movie. I had watched the late 1970 and 1980's numerous cannibal movies, so I was no stranger to the genre.\n\n\"The Green Inferno\" starts out rather slow paced, in terms of establishing characters and plot. But despite a rather mundane start, \"The Green Inferno\" does quickly pick up pace and becomes rather entertaining.\n\nEli Roth is indeed known for his somewhat brutal movie if you take a look at his director credits, and \"The Green Inferno\" definitely makes an entry onto that list.\n\nThe effects in the movie were quite good and believable, and there was a sense of authenticity to it all. And on that account, I really must applaud the special effects team for their accomplishment. Especially for a cannibal movie, then having proper and realistic effects are very important.\n\nThe characters in the movie were also well established and fleshed out, pardon the pun, as the story was brought to life on the screen. There are characters that you instantly come to like and also instantly come to dislike.\n\nI must admit that I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, right up to the ending. Then it just totally lost momentum and became a flaccid farce. That ending of the movie was just a slap in the face with a cold, dead fish. And as such, then I am forced to settle for a 6 out of 10 rating, whereas the movie was set up for a 7. But that ending was just ridiculously bad and cheesy. Why Eli Roth opted for that ending is just beyond my comprehension, because it was a severe disappointment to an otherwise great film.\n\nAll in all, \"The Green Inferno\" is a good movie and an entertaining one. And if you haven't already seen it, and if you like the cannibal genre, then you should definitely take the time to watch this."

I remembered a few key scenes but not the entirety of the plot.\n\nI rewatched it now, with no distractions. Its what you would come to expect from an Eli Roth film.\n\nThere were a lot of good qualities to this film. The setting was brilliant. The acting exceeded my expectations. There was a certain creepiness to the realism of it all.\n\nSome scenes were a little deflated with the obvious foreshadowing. But the cast all turned in good roles.\n\nIts hard to do new things in horror. Sure, the premise of things can be done and redone. Its how you separate yourself from the pack that gets you noticed.\n\nThis film exploits our many weaknesses. Its endless, really. Like being dragged through all the alternate measures before finally saying \"enough\" or \"no more\", both covered here as well.\n\nThere's a much deeper story here. The only flaw was the story takes a turn at the end. Thinking about it now, it truly was the scariest part of the film.\n\nThe ending struck me as what was supposed to be one of those, epiphany or the greater good type things. In reality it was a concise topicalogical issue, plauging the globe. Given its time of release, I have to wonder if it was merely pandering jibberish.\n\nThe whole thing just wreaked of sub-culture BS; with fantasy revenge porn included. The further confusing factor was the mid-credit scene. Had there been a sequel, I would have loved to be the one to write it.\n\nI'm glad I waited until now to review this film, because my perception would have been vastly different with an overwhelmingly underserved optimism.\n\nNone the less, it was quite good and I am usually on board with Roth's films.... the good one's anyway.\n\nA lot of potential here. Clich\u00e9s aside, it was a good film. However the ending was not only illogical, but ridiculously intelligent, whether by mistake or accidentally on purpose.\n\nIt may even warrant another viewing just to see if anything was missed. But i'll wait another 8 years for that one.\n\nEntertainment Value 8/10 Overall Rating 7/10\n\nSome truly disturbing scenes with enough metaphorical bs to distract you and ignore the lack of nudity you come to expect in horror. Which in this case, was a welcome change."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I heard that Eli Roth was going to tackle the cannibal genre, I was quite excited. I really enjoyed the classic cannibal movies from Italy, especially \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (with slightly forced alibi social commentary messages). Unfortunately Roth wasn't interested in making any \"mean\" movie at all, but instead he came up with a completely boring and tame mix of teen slasher/\"cannibal\"-movie. The slapstick/comedy elements eliminate any attempt of creating a menacingly setting, which IMHO is the most important part about this kind of movie. As for gore - unfortunately this is extremely disappointing as well. The absolute highlight of the movie happens pretty much right after the confrontation with the cannibals, after that it turns into a bore-fest with embarrassingly bad attempts at humour (\"jacking off\" scene...). I prefer to cringe from mean deaths / gore than from pathetic and sad story writing.\n\nThe \"torture porn\" \"genre\" has been criticized heavily by many, but personally I think that that's what Roth's fans really want. Unfortunately he does not seem to be able to create a truly menacing, mean horror movie. Instead you get an immature film maker who is able to make you lose interest in any violence on screen thanks to his irrelevant sense of humour."

Actually, it's definitely one of the most disgusting movies I have ever watched, it was GROSS. Also, it was a very intense movie, especially the plane crash scene. The ending scene was kinda predictable and it was just fine. It wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, however there were many terrifying scenes.

(I don't want to spoil anything so I won't list any examples) I had a hard time caring about the characters because they weren't well acted, and often just unpleasant. Almost so much so that I thought it was intentional. Like a slasher film. The gore effects were pretty solid, I cringed a decent amount. But I was laughing pretty regularly too. The CG bits in the movie looked pretty bad, but the director at least tried to cover it up with camera filters and shaking. Except for one scene... that involved ants. That was bad ha ha. But the seriousness of the material didn't come across for me, the only thing that really held this movie up was the gore... and maybe the setting and the indigenous people. Although the only thing that I was really thinking about was the gore. If the acting was better from the \"college student\" actors then the setting and tribal people probably would have had more of an impact. If you want gore, or you want to get together with friends and go \"EWWWWWW\" then you won't be disappointed. If you want a proper horror movie that will make you feel scared and tense, this is definitely not it. I will probably forget about this movie with time unfortunately."

It cuts from one view to another abruptly, zero panning, zero moving shots, zero payroll for a good cinematographer. Acting is LITERAL GARBAGE. They could have done better picking up homeless folks off the street, and giving them lunch for every day they were on set; at least they could haven't written this film off as a charity at that point. Storyline is heavily recycled, overly focused on trying to sell a cheap, poorly CGI'ed Gore scene and patent it as good horror.

I honestly had a decent time with this movie and found it struck a decent balance between being horror and adventure.\n\nDirecting, the movie looks and flew pretty well, visually I don't think it's bad at all and it holds a certain aesthetic that encompasses the movie which I liked. It does tend to feel more like a 2005-ish movie than it should. It has that classic feel to it somehow, maybe it's the characters.\n\nMusic, shout out to the music being excellent, to my surprise, horror doesn't always have the best or most interesting but the more epic score doing the boat segment really build up the forthcoming events.\n\nWriting, probably the weakest part of the movie, most decisions and character writing are questionable. Some are fun/funny, whilst others just take you out of it a bit. The ''toilet'' scene was I hope intended to be funny because wow that was hilarious, also the weed scene, has to be comedy right..right? Like Alejandro who becomes a literal psychopath overnight. A little more insight into that transition would've helped. Besides that some lines just don't really click or are heavy exposition. The ending didn't sit right we me either and was a bit of a dud. Acting, Izzo was good, Levy decent, everyone else meh, and sorry to say but Martinez not great at all.\n\nHorror/scare factor. I knew a little about this being a homage to cannibal-h, and I've yet to see that but this movies scores high on gore, especially the first major scene is tough. But it starts out with the peak and that's unfortunate because it makes the latter kills not as impressive. The ants especially, what a poor decision, CGI ant's really? Who thought that was a smart idea? Either way, this isn't a horror for a first timer, as the scenes would quickly become too much. As in scary, it's never scary. Just disturbing with the whole cannibal aspect.\n\nEither way, I'm intrigued and look forward to seeing some more of Roth's work."

I was not disappointed, as the special FX are excellent and acting is believable. It is horrifying and unsettling in all senses, from start to finish. Much like The Human Centipede, you are left in a state of disgust for long after (not something I particularly enjoyed). However, good film making has to be credited, which is the reasoning for my 6 rating. If it's your sort of thing, then you'll enjoy it.\n\nThe trivia on the film is fascinating, so I would recommend reading it. I've never seen any of Roth's previous movies, so this was a real shock. Straight after, I watched Aftershock, engaged by the actors and style of film. (However, this film was nothing in comparison.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth is my favorite director of the audacious, \"I can't believe they made a movie about that,\" sub-genre of shock/horror cinema. This time he made an updated version of the cannibal sub-genre of the late 70s and early 80s.\n\nOther reviews have said that the acting is a little subpar, and it may have something to do with the conditions going in. They had to be in the Peruvian jungle and get yellow fever shots and be in a location where there were no bathrooms. It sounds like the TV series \"Survivor,\" but at least we know the actors got paid. So, it could be that Eli had trouble finding experienced actors who would agree to the conditions, but in the end they're all appropriately horrified, shocked, and disgusted by what becomes of them.\n\nAnd yes, willing suspension of disbelief gets stretched to the breaking point at several turns, including how the group of college students got involved with the protest in the first place. without going into too much detail, the cinematography is a huge strength of the movie as is the four-person team of makeup and effectss. Yes, the various disasters and cannibal carnage looks real!\n\nHad it been simply a 90 minute slaughterfest my rating would have been lower, but believe it or not Eli Roth shows restraint involving some clever off-screen action and a horrifying reveal later on. There are also some nuances involving the priestess, one of the main college kid girls, and the little native children. It took a couple of viewings for instance to realize how it all tied back to the opening scenes of the movie back at the college.\n\nAlso, as other reviewers have stated there's plenty of gallows humor, which many complained ruined the tone and made it uneven. For me, I appreciate good camp when I see it so the little black humor touches here and there worked. Yes, it's shlock in the end, but it's competent shlock and a must-see for any horror cinema fan."

I found myself scanning the audience to see their response to the movie more than I watched the screen. And the obligatory set-up for a needless sequel, shown partway through the closing credits, made me hope the filmmakers end up tortured by cannibals before any sequel materialises.\n\nFilmed in November and December 2012, shown only at a handful of Film festivals in 2013, then first released in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (!) in 2014, didn't get a proper US release until September 2015... Film's bizarre release history is more interesting than the film itself."

I'm waiting for something, that will really blow my away from this guy, if you discount the gory brilliant horror shocker, Hostel, which was the pinnacle of his movie making. It's the one, which stands out, among the rest of his credits. TGI isn't that something. I will say this, about The Green Inferno, It's truly a standalone, impressive, original, but is impressive, in it's originality. While also from my point of view, I'm at a curiousness, as to why he wrote this story. If still remembering the film, for it's in your face, and disgusting violence, it isn't a badly made film, for which you pretty much know how the fate of our young activist, environmental group, led by a selfish, callous hearted male hottie, who sexually entices the vulnerable led beauty/antagonist, Izzo, to take a trip, will ensue. As with these films, there are those cliche's of young 17+ characters, we've grown to accept and loathe, and cliche's of story. Characters like, fatty over homonic guy, stupid vulnerable girl, seedy unshaven host, bright, sensitive mature girl, etc.. The fatty guy character I liked, before ending on the cannibalistic villages menu, Roth again, using innocent kids to do despicable things. The film is quite terrifying, as in it's shock story/subject, and it succeeds in it's ability to shock and terrify, with some impactful moments of cruel violence, as in the plane crash. Roth, like Tarantino, indulges, in their homage to some movie titles. Richard Burgi (Hostel 2), a too gooder actor is wasted in this as Izzo's father. Overall, TGI, really adds up to a semi achievement, of exploitive and shock violence, a nasty little shocker, but that's it, and the Sid Haig looking guy/cannibalistic villager, with the world's largest metal ring through his head, bares a colorful body painted wardrobe, you won't forget."

It makes me wanna watch Hostel films again so I can be sure whether Eli Roth was a shitty director all along, and therefore I was too young to have noticed it, or his first features were just beginner's luck."

The plot does not offer any originality and therein lies the good thing about the film since by not innovating it necessarily honors all the rules of the genre. Both the photography and the extras are fantastic, the jungle invites us to savor death and when it takes place we will obviously be satisfied.

Beware that the film isn't really a horror movie in the sense that it's scary, it's more like Saw with cannibals. This movie takes gore and killing so far that it's really only for those who enjoy overly gory films. The acting, dialogue, and story are all weak, but the film's preliminary focus is more directed at how many ways can people be brutally murdered. It's the focus on killing that exemplifies that Roth didn't care as much about story, he wanted to take killing and gore, and make them an art form, like Tarantino. The movie did have a dark sense of humor, one example is that these people are being killed, while the tribe has a bunch of cows and pigs that remain untouched. In the end this movie is a cinematic experience, if you see it you'll probably leave the theater with an upset stomach, that being said this film's not for children or the weak stomached."

Its as though Eli is afraid to make a straight up balls out horror film without adding some sort of levity.\n\nSame thing goes with Green inferno. It has genuinely frightening moments and some well written and expertly directed scenes but all in all the director seems convinced that the audience needs to know that he is a dude and he's cool and we should all laugh at his jokes. This film had ALL the potential in the world to be a brake out horror sensation and scare the hell out of audiences but at the directors insistence we get misplaced fart jokes, an out of place masturbation scene and a juvenile teenage pot gag.\n\nI will continue to watch things with Eli Roth's name attached to it but not forever. I hope this doesn't come across to nerdy I was just disappointed that this film could easily have been a 10/10 but instead gets a still respectable 7/10"

The narcissistic mentality is at center stage in the film, and you can tell that Roth was making fun of the idiots who think that it is their job to change the world. Who the F#$k are you to go to another country and tell them what to do with it? Handled by a competent director, it would have made for great satire and social commentary, but Roth has not made anything worth watching since the original Cabin Fever, and even that was forgettable. I just wish he would take a step back and let the real talent take the reigns. Be a producer, or even a writer. But stop directing people. It's just embarrassing at this point."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Green Inferno (2013) is an Eli Roth gem that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a group of college students who head to the Amazon to protect the trees from deforestation. After they complete their task they get on their plane to fly home and it unfortunately crashes in the jungle. They encounter some hungry locals that are happy to find them.\n\nAs previously mentioned this movie is written and directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) and stars Lorenza Izzo (Knock Knock), Ariel Levy (Aftershock), Kirby Bliss Blanton (Death Wish), Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez (Aftershock), Magda Apanowicz (The Butterfly Effect) and Sky Ferreira (Promising Young Woman).\n\nThere's so much to like about this movie. The cast is perfectly selected and the ladies are beautiful. The cinematography and shots of the jungle are gorgeous. The plane crash scene is very well done and what happens to the people during the crash is brilliantly depicted. The gore and special effects are out of this world throughout this picture. The Cannibal scenes and how the people are depicted are a 100/10...just so well done. Every scene that involves flesh in anyway feels so realistic. The Amazonians were very entertaining, funny and easy to root for. I also adored the entire escape scene and twist at the end. Even the message of deforestation was good.\n\nOverall, this is one of the greatest Cannibal movies of all time. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had to see The Green Inferno in theaters, seeing as this would be the first (and probably the only) time I would get to see an old school-style cannibal film on the big screen. I was a little skeptical, but excited. While certain aspects of the The Green Inferno could have been better, I still left satisfied and happy as a fan of the original cannibal films of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWriter/Director Eli Roth brings 21st century college students to the Amazon to protest the destruction and killing of a tribe in order to exploit their land.After protesting and being put under arrest, their plane crashes into the jungle. The survivors then become victims to he natives that they were protesting to protect. The movie actually develops great social commentary and manages to create characters that are more than one-dimensional. The movie does a great job of exploiting how modern the world has become.\n\nSeeing modern actors/characters in a cannibal film was sort of mind bending for me. This definitely looks and (at certain times) feels like an actual cannibal movie from 30 years ago. Sure, the characters weren't making a good decision and come off as very ignorant, but that's exactly what made it work for me. It's watching a very modern civilized society realize that the world is way bigger than their cell phones. The movie's vibe worked well for me, even with the little bit of comic relief Eli Roth likes to slip in. It worked.\n\nI have to say, I was very impressed with how much on screen violence this was able to get away with. If this was the R-rated cut, I can't wait to see an Unrated version. The violence was very grisly and doesn't hold back. Eli Roth didn't disappoint on the gore in this film. Easily some of the most violent stuff I've seen on the big screen, period.\n\nThe main problem with this is movie is that it doesn't feel very authentic at times. I was very disappointed at the amount of computer generated effects were used, and not necessarily for the violence. There were way too many computer generated animals in this film, and that is were most of the authenticity of this film fell off. The gore is spot on, but the movie lacked good shots of real animals or good shots of the jungle in its natural habitat - with no characters. While the natives looked great on film in their location, so much more could have been done with the jungle around them. The Green Inferno was definitely not a letdown, but it wouldn't have taken much to make it a lot better.\n\nDon't expect the shock value of Cannibal Holocaust but get ready for one of the most violence films of the year. It is definitely a wild ride, and should be a lot of fun for fans of cannibal films or extremely violent horror films. Very disturbing, and I appreciate that it isn't completely brainless, and manages to fit in some social commentary with it."

Hopeless clich\u00e9d actors / characters ( you can hardly call this acting ) ... Really bad effects ... And of course written and directed by Roth who, lets be honest, seems to be somewhat intellectually challenged and stopped any development at age 17 ... This is the sort of cannibal film that is the equivalent of Jess Franco's two forays into the genre, though it has none of the fun of watching Al Cliver pretend he only has one arm for most of the film :) ... It has none of the gross out power mixed with hilarity of Ferrox and none of the power of Holocaust ... In fact this, made 35 years later is a limp imitation rather than any new spin on the genre Roth is obviously good at one thing ... Raising money ... Recently he seems to be fleecing some rich South Americans that frankly you would have thought would have more sense as the films are crap and are bombing left right and centre He saw the fact that most everyday cinema goers had never experienced hardcore gore and savagery like the genre film makers were doing in the 1970s - 80s and talked Tarantino and his Hollywood honcho into letting him pretend to invent something ... And there it was ... Torture Yawn ... Come in Mr Roth ... Your 15 minutes are up"

Justine is attracted to their leader, named Alejandro. Another guy named Jonah invites Justine to their next meeting. There Alejandro proposes their next mission--to fight against Amazon rainforest deforestation in Peru, which would kill some native tribe. Their plan is to provoke the logging corporation, film it all, and put it online. Of course the logging corporation is protected by an armed militia.\n\nA dozen or so take the trip, among them Justine, Jonah, Alejandro and his girlfriend, who is jealous that Justine has a crush on him, two lesbian girls, some goofy guy, another guy and some others. There's also some rich Peruvian guy who is their contact and organizes the trip, which starts on plane, then moped, then boat. They arrive at the site, chain themselves to trees, Justine who was given a defective lock is grabbed and threatened with a gun to her head. She is actually the daughter of a UN diplomat and the treehugers used her and set her up. Nevertheless, they succeed and post the event online.\n\nOn their way back on a plane over the jungle, the plane's engine blows up and they end up crashing in the middle of the jungle. Some of the kids don't survive the crash. Suddenly someone else arrives, next things they know, arrows start flying and the kids are sedated.\n\nWhen they wake up they find themselves taken to a village by the river by some aborigines. They are particularly interested in the hair of the girls. Jonah who is rather heavy is chopped to pieces, his body fried and then consumed. The rest are caged and will try to escape before they're eaten.\n\nIt's not a bad idea to bring us a cannibal movie, it's been a while since those have been made. The problem with The Green Inferno is the awful cast that for the most part gives pretty lousy performances. So you don't really connect with these people, let alone root for them. The best actors are actually the natives, who are on task and appear believable. Another problem is that this movie is not particularly scary or gruesome. It lacks a crudeness needed to make it effective. The story is pretty decent. There are some twists that make it richer than one expects it to be, except for the silly marijuana nonsense. I appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm of The Green Inferno, it just could have used more violence, gore, (female) nudity, scares."

As with all his films they are never quite perfect. This script had me rolling my eyes at times but regardless it is still very entertaining.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I've finally arrived to Eli Roth's The Green Inferno (2013). This is a movie that was made out of inspiration and pays homage to Cannibal Holocaust (1980), the infamous godfather of the found footage subgenre, and it's a movie that I still haven't seen yet. And while the movie's premise is interesting and terrifying on paper, The Green Inferno (2013) is by a landslide the worst movie in Eli Roth's filmography.\n\nPositives for The Green Inferno (2013): I appreciated and respect the fact that Eli Roth was trying to pay some homage to Cannibal Holocaust (1980). And finally, Greg Nicotero's practical effects are amazing. That's it for the positives.\n\nNegatives for The Green Inferno (2013): The Green Inferno (2013) is the perfect showcase of all of Eli Roth's worst tendencies as a filmmaker and they are all cranked up to 100 in this movie. The group of environmental activists that get captured by the tribe of indigenous people are some of the most despicable and unlikable characters that I've ever seen in any movie and I literally wanted all of them to die violent deaths. The gore and violence in the movie are extreme and it's purely to gross you out and for shock value. Eli Roth's writing in this movie are some of the most drastic tone-shifts that I've seen in any movie where he wants to be visceral, intense and horrific with his gore and violence and at the same time have a very juvenile sense of humor throughout the runtime. There is literally a scene where a man gets dismembered and eaten by these cannibals followed by a woman pooping in the corner of a prison cage with the cartoon poop sound effects 3 minutes later. There's even a scene where that same woman commits suicide with a shard from a bowl and it's immediately followed one of the men jerking off in the corner. It's a movie that goes for everything and none of it lands for me.\n\nOverall, The Green Inferno (2013) is an absolute mess from start to finish and it's the one movie in Eli Roth's filmography that I will never rewatch again."

Instead I was in front of a poorly executed premise, with horrible acting, only Lorena Izzo did a good job in my opinion, and also Daryl Sabara who served as a decent comic relief. Alejandro (Ariel Levy) portrays the typical activist leader with a revolutionary attitude that when they get caught by the cannibalistic tribe, he starts to show his true colors, as a compassionaless and unsympathetic foe. Yet this movie fails to bring down the wrongdoers. We don't get to see neither Alejandro nor the Peruvian tribe get what they deserve. Although one could argue about the tribe, after all these student activists were there to save them in the first place, that is why the ending of the film is understandable, even though I found it a bit unsatisfiying. Because in the face of such torture and gory violence, one would think that the characters would stand up against them somehow, fight back or at least try to come up with a creative way to escape rather than just run idiotically.\n\nThere's no character build up, so when the bloodshed begins, you feel nothing for these characters. I believe that out of the large group in the beginning, I only rooted for two of them. I will say though, that the gore does not disappoint, Eli Roth has that area well covered. There's one particulary disturbing scene that had me feeling in severe discomfort; when the first victim of the cannibals is chopped piece by piece and then prepared like a meal. Contrasting that notorious part, there is another scene which involves several members of the tribe go after one of the characters and literally eat him away in a zombie-like fashion, which I thought it was so utterly ridiculous that it just couldn't be taken seriously.\n\nThe film has many flaws, it does not commit, does not scare, it does not give you something truly satisfiying, besides the gore. The first half of the film is a bore fest; yet I believe this is an okayish tolerable cannibal movie acceptable for just one view; because if you are naive enough to come across this movie more than once, I'm afraid the grade or rating you gave it first can only go further low.\n\nNot impressed but I was mildly entertained, especially in the last 30 minutes or so. That's why I was generous enough to give it a 6."

The main actress basically carried this film and kept me watching.\n\nI do think we should encourage more woke university students to get down to South America though. I think it would really make the world a better place and help them grow as fully functioning roast dinners."

However, strangely, I found this film quite easy to watch, amidst the blood and guts, which felt sort of bizarre, but a good bizarre.\n\nThe Green Inferno wasn't as great as I hoped for, but with that said, it wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe. Yes it seems to suffer from a few weird scenarios, but in my opinion I feel that this goes beyond a tribute to cannibal films, and actually embraces the elements that make them 'bad' and creates an almost satire out of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "For what it's worth, I appreciate the time and effort Eli Roth put in to get this movie done. Especially working in the amazon and even working with local villagers, Its admirable to say the least.\n\nBiggest problem with this movie is that It tries to hone into the gore/horror that once was \"Cannibal Holocaust\". But Cannibal Holocaust preyed on the ignorance of people in the 1980's. Without the use of the internet, understanding of more things around the world, and the scare of serial killers running amok, it made sense why Cannibal Holocaust had an everlasting effect on people.\n\nIf you wanted to do a movie like that in the 21st century you need to be smarter than the audience and prey off the new fears of the new generation. This movie did not really do that. To give some more context, I even watched this when I worked at Walmart on lunch with 10 other employees. (Yes, it's inappropriate). But instead of people watching with disgust or anxiousness, we were cheering for the privileged college students to get picked off one by one and over analyzed the actual killings. We might be an exception, but this is a good example of the mindset people have these days that must be taken into account to have a good movie that is in the vein of something like Green Inferno.\n\nWith all that being said, I personally don't even think the gore was up to par. I don't think it will even please gore fans that maybe Hostel did. So not only did it not hold up for a horror flick but it didn't hold up for gore porn. I would say you're not missing much if you haven't seen this movie yet and you probably will never need too. Maybe next time Eli Roth. 4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "FINALLY!!! It has been 2 years that i have been waiting to see this damn movie. It was first shown at a film festival in 2013 and then got pulled from its 2014 release date due to financial issues and now it has finally arrived. Was it worth the wait? Yeh, it wasn't amazing but no-one was expecting that.\n\nThe Green Inferno is a film from the twisted mind of Eli Roth where a group of activists travel deep into Amazon in order to save the forest but come across an untouched tribe of cannibals, and all hell ensues. As expected from an Eli Roth film, this does feature his trademark excessive gore and would most definitely fall into the 'Torture Porn' horror sub-genre. Roth has been quoted saying that he took inspiration from 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust', a film that caused a whole lot of controversy when it was released. So from that you know that the focus of this film is going to be lots and lots of gore and you definitely get that. Despite my anticipation to see this film, i still went into it not expecting much in terms of getting an amazing film but it did tick all of the main boxes that i expected it to.\n\nLets start with the focus of the film, the gore. I personally like the idea showing a tonne of gore as long as there is a reason for it to be there. For example, the 'Saw' franchise is built around the gore so it makes sense that it would be gruesome and that is the same for this film. The gore in this film is definitely not for the faint of heart, it even made me cringe at some moments. Roth did a great job at creating these very confronting shots that show off the gore and blood and violence so effectively. The very graphic violence is what makes this film stand out above anything else, you take out that gore and you just have a generic horror flick that probably would never have been made. There isn't really much i can say about the gore other than it is bloody and it is disgusting, but overall it was exactly what i wanted to see. People getting excessively mutilated was what i wanted going in and it is exactly what i got.\n\nIn terms of the characters, i thought there were like 2 maybe 3 interesting characters and everyone else was either just a throwaway character or seemed a little too generic and clich\u00e9. This made it difficult to really care about some of the characters but at least the main protagonist i thought was well set up and well developed and did a good job at leading the film. Much of that was due to her performance, it wasn't amazing but Lorenza Izzo did well at leading this cast of mostly unknowns. (Yes, i know, that completely contradicts what i said in my 'Knock Knock' review where i said i didn't want to see her act anymore. Maybe she just made a bad decision, a really, really bad decision). Daryl Sabara and Aaron Burns held the film together and kept it interesting when nothing much was going on.\n\nThe plot of the film was also really weak i thought, but i'm not going to hold it against the film much. Eli Roth only really needed to find an excuse to get them into the forest and from there he let the gore take over. I still think the first act went for way too long, the first 30 minutes was progressing really slowly and was setting up some characters that were pretty much irrelevant for the rest of the film. The plot wasn't fascinating but it was OK, and let the film progress at a reasonable pace after the 30 minute mark.\n\nSo in the end, The Green Inferno was an accumulation of blood, gore and excessive violence from the sick mind of Eli Roth and through his use of sharp and confronting camera movements he managed to make it entertaining. If you don't like gore you won't like this film (pretty self-explanatory), as it is the main driver of the film and the best parts of the film. Some well done characters were a highlight but the throwaway supporting cast and lack of interesting plot really do hold the film down despite not being a focus. - 5.5/10"

The ending was probably one of the worst endings of a stereotypical movie. The most hated character we do not get to see their demise. It would have been a better movie if they showed their demise. Another terrible aspect of the ending is the survivor recounting the events that happened. This is the reason activists are hated."

        "review_detailed_main": "My quick rating - 6,4/10. After years of problems with legal, money, distribution and who else knows what, this movie is finally out and viewable to the masses. So the big question is \"Can Eli Roth bring us something worth all the hype?\" My answer is Yes BUT not a yes with all capital letters. Let me explain quickly. The movie is an homage to \"Cannibal Holocaust\" which is a flick that came out and was so disturbing, violent and original (the actual first found footage movie) that the makers of the movie were arrested since the government thought it was an actual snuff film and the people were killed. Obviously that failed since the creators brought the actors n TV and proved their point. Anyway, big shoes to fill and Eli Roth takes a shot at it. So armed with the plot of a group of college kids standing up for political reasons (here it is stop knocking down rainforests and destroying tribal cultures)crash land and met said tribe. Of course, they are cannibals and hence the fun begins. So of course the gore is heavy when need be but was it so bad to disgust? Not really. Actually the movie is very well written to also make a point. People stand on their soap box to make a point when in essence they don't care but want to just further themselves. Anyway, the rest of the plot is fill in the blank with double crosses, escape attempts, and dinner served up. Oh, and the scenery in this film is spectacular since Roth is definitely one who knows how to use a camera. Overall, a bit longer (I suspect there is a much longer version) and maybe more to the story aside from the lame soapbox ending and this would be scoring even higher but as is, very good stuff."

Holocaust - amongst many other lesser known entrees).\n\nThe good: the gore was prolific and realistic for the most part (save maybe for some of the downed plane original capture aspects - the blow dart and arrow wounds maybe). The story was interesting and plausible, sort of misdirection.\n\nThe could have been improved upon: the accents of the protestor leadership were unnessecarily distracting/difficult to understand. I did a rewatch of this with an older person and had to do quite a lot of translating what the actors said, I even found myself struggling to understand what was said. And finally (and I'm not sure there was a solution), the lack of actual full nudity of the tribe added a tinge of unbelievability but again with children involved Roth came as close as possible to representing an authentic cannibal tribe (all things considered).\n\nFor what this film was, it was very well done and worthy of a 9 (an 8 at least)."

They end up crashing with their plane and captured by cannibals.\n\nThe movie starts off slow but has an acceptable back story so it's okay. When the gore finally starts we get some nasty stuff, but it could have definitely been more. I would have particularly liked to see some more tributes to the kind of gore portrayed in Cannibal Holocaust. And honestly, even though it's always fun seeing people getting slaughtered no matter what sex they are, I would have liked to see some more graphic butchering of females. I'm not a misogynist (and not a feminist either), but come on, this is what we all want to see when we watch a movie like this one.\n\nThe make up could have honestly been better. I think they over did it. The actors playing cannibals looks very much just like that - actors playing cannibals. Deodato and Lenzi managed to do much better with much less. Some of the scenes were difficult to make sense of, like the scene where the kids are fed by the cannibals. But I won't go into detail of this since that would be a spoiler. There was some cynical social commentary which I personally liked, which also was present in the films this one payed homage to.\n\nAll in all, far from Roth's best and really over-hyped. But still an entertaining movie with some nice gore scenes. Know what to expect and you won't be that disappointed."

Given how big the \"cannibal movie boom\" was in the late '70s and '80s, this isn't exactly a groundbreaking plot.\n\nIt's definitely watchable though, especially for gore fanatics, its not a horror movie more an attempt at a shock factor. In terms of overall impact, it's nothing amazing. While it's still worth watching once for the experience, Cannibal Holocaust will always be the icon of this genre and I'm afraid will always overshadow the success of any films following in this plot genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having flown to Peru to protest deforestation, a group of students are captured by a cannibalistic local tribe when their plane crashes in this gory horror film with some nods to 'Cannibal Holocaust'. The movie is primarily propelled by the irony of the students thinking that they are protecting the locals when in fact the locals are well equipped to fend off any threat, and there is something pointed in how they do not distinguish between the students and the lopping company workers. There is more than just that to the film though; it also attacks the naivety of idealistic students. Live video streaming is a further curious element as the leader of the group claims that their iPhones \"are our guns\" since the company will (hopefully) not hurt them if they are being recorded. There are also some thought-provoking plot twists. Whether the onslaught of grisly violence is necessary is another question though; it soon becomes a repetitive (how many ways can a human body be pulled apart?) and considering that the horror angle does not ignite until 40 minutes in, 'The Green Inferno' may have been more effective as a compact short film. It is certainly nowhere near as powerful as 'Cannibal Holocaust', but then again, it is decidedly different. In 'Holocaust', the characters bring their slaughter upon themselves, whereas here (almost) all the victims have the best of intentions. This in turn makes 'The Green Inferno' more chilling, if not necessarily better, as the cannibals clearly do not realise their inhumanity. Flawed but interesting stuff overall, though not for the faint of heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is one special effects sequence in Eli Roth's \"The Green Inferno\" (2015) that is technically very well done. I won't describe it, for fear of spoilers here, but if you know that Greg Nicotero was in charge of effects for this movie, and you know the TV show with which he's associated, then you have a pretty good idea of what this sequence entails. (Hint: it's \"The Walking Dead.\")\n\nThis movie also makes excellent use of its Peruvian location, and the real tribe employed as extras.\n\nBeyond those two things \u0085 this really is a rather mediocre horror- thriller, folks. It's nothing to write home about. In fact, it seems amateurishly made on a few levels, especially considering the creative talent Roth exhibited with films like \"Hostel\" (2005), \"Hostel 2\" (2007) and \"Cabin Fever\" (2002).\n\nThis movie held my attention, and it does serve up a disturbing horror film that's weird and different \u2014 which is what I think Roth is known for. But, regrettably, it just wasn't especially well scripted, performed or directed. I'd give it a 4 out of 10."

The acting will have you laughing the entire film, and I mean laughing at the characters not with them. The film looks like it was shot with an HD video camera from Best Buy, and the script is unabashedly flimsy. But with all of these negatives they somehow coalesce into a film that's great fun if you walk in with an open mind. Eli Roth's passion for this film shines through so much that I can't help but think every detail, bad acting and all, was all designed that way. And when approaching this film with that mindset and watching it with friends, you're guaranteed an enjoyable experience. It's certainly not a letdown when it comes to the gore effects; this movie has numerous killing scenes that are extremely brutal. You'll be cringing at some scenes and then awkwardly laughing the next. The main story-line raises questions about activism and critiques the motivations behind those who tear down jungles and those who tie themselves to trees. It seems smart at first but a little on the nose in my opinion.\n\nSo overall I wouldn't recommend The Green Inferno to the average movie-goer but for those die hard Eli Roth and horror fans, you'll certainly find something to love."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, which is to say that I didn't think it was terrible.\n\nThe story of a bunch of well-meaning college activists who travel to the Peruvian Amazon to stop loggers from bulldozing a native tribal village and then get eaten by those villagers is that makings of pure schlock, and that's exactly what Eli Roth delivered.\n\nThere are some consistent issues that plague the movie a bit, though. The biggest problem is its structure and general disinterest in engaging with the few ideas it has, especially once you get into the second half. The other is that Roth doesn't seem to be a particularly good director of actors. Especially in the first half, when everyone isn't screaming endlessly, performances are universally stilted and awkward.\n\nStill, there's a deep cynical irony that permeates the film and actually drives it into comedy. The movie is usually categorized as a horror film, and I get the impression that Roth would disagree. The movie is definitely a comedy, even at its most gruesome. Roth hates every single one of his characters that he sends into the inferno. He finds the organizer to be pure scum (which everyone realizes he is). He finds the fat kid pathetic. He finds the vegan stupid. Even the main character is a na\u00eff who should know better, so she probably kind of deserves what comes to her. Roth is kind of a sick man (as you might expect from a guy who films someone getting their eyeballs ripped from their sockets and then every limb hacked off followed by the head, which all precedes the body being smoked and eaten), so I don't think it's a large stretch to imagine that he simply took glee in conceiving the different ways for these people to die.\n\nIt seems like a weird movie to not hate, isn't it? Well, I kinda liked it. Because there's a clear delineation between fantasy and reality, it's easy for me to watch horrific acts of violence in a film and potentially enjoy it. It's really a question of tone, which Roth largely seems to hit here. I really believe that he was shooting for comedy (mean, brutish comedy, but comedy, nonetheless).\n\nDefinitely not for the squeamish."

        "review_detailed_main": "Words can't describe how psyched I was to see this movie. After waiting for more than a year, and absolutely loving Eli Roth's first movie, and liking his next two, I really thought this would be something good. Or, at least, something worthwhile. Well, it's not, not really. I guess if you're not actually familiar with the cult, Euro sleaze cannibal flicks this is clearly inspired by, an homage to, and, ultimately, a blatant rip off of, you might sort of enjoy it. If you are, you'll find it derivative and pointless.\n\nThe movie has the same basic formula as the first Hostel. We spend the first half of the movie with a group of dim, annoying \"American\" college kids as they go on an adventure into a foreign county that they neither understand nor respect. The second half, they pay for their ignorance with pain and suffering.\n\nFirst, I'd like to say that American is in quotation marks because this is actually a Chilean film and you won't buy that you're in America for a second at the beginning.\n\nThe movie gets sort of interesting in its critique of self-important college activists, but this idea is pretty much totally abandoned in the second half making the first chunk of the movie rather pointless. You could argue that it's developing character, but given the weak performances and rather one dimensional nature of the players, it really doesn't. I also have to say that Ariel Levy, as the group's jerk leader, is awful beyond words. The best is Spy Kids star Daryl Sabara as the funny stoner type.\n\nWhen the cannibals attack, it's nothing that exceptionally brutal, especially if you've seen the older movies, that were meaner, nastier, and more creative. Seriously, nothing new is added here, except for a weird fixation on female circumcision, which is used as a looming threat throughout. There's only one really gory scene in the whole thing, surprising for Eli Roth, and even more surprising is that Roth has said the movie wasn't cut for the R rating meaning there's probably not an extended cut forthcoming.\n\nThe Green Inferno moves fast enough to rank watchable status, and the plane crash is pretty impressive, but that's all that really recommends this movie. Maybe it was Roth's long absence behind the camera and he was just plain rusty, maybe the cannibal sub-genre just can't be resurrected in our politically correct climate, or maybe Eli Roth needs to give up and admit that Chile is not a viable filming location, after failing with Aftershock, The Stranger, and this movie. Regardless, skip it and watch Cannibal Ferox again or for the first time, as it this movie's most direct ancestor. Better yet, watch Cannibal Holocaust, a genuinely great movie. Just don't waste your cash on The Green Inferno."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a great lover of horror films and used to be a great fan of Eli Roth. I was especially impressed with 'Hostel' and 'Cabin Fever' as (imho) both films pushed the boundaries of horror at the time. I am also old enough to remember and be impressed with Cannibal Holocaust, this film, directed by Ruggero Deodato in 1980 was unlike anything I had seen before and certainly justified the tag line 'The Most Controversial Movie ever made. As the title suggests it chronicled the meeting between a team of documentary makers and a cannibal tribe with resulting horrific and extremely graphic consequences.\n\nSo I was excited when one of my favourite directors was virtually remaking albeit up to date, the most explicit cannibal horror film ever. Boy was I disappointed!\n\nBelow contains several spoilers for which I apologise in advance. However they are needed to illustrate what a pile of tripe 'The Green Inferno' actually is.\n\nThe story line is similar to Cannibal Holocaust. Spoiler: It starts in New York where an environmental group are planning to visit the Amazon rain forest to confront corporation funded logging contractors who are systematically destroying the indigenous flora and fauna. Into this select group comes Justine played by Lorenza Izzo. It quickly transpires that she is not particularly interested in saving the rain forest just bedding the group leader. So far, so boring; we do not get the opportunity to begin to know, bond with or even like any of the characters let alone care what happens to them.\n\nWith the back story out of the way, our intrepid group arrive in the Amazon basin, confront the loggers, win a somewhat pointless victory and fly home. At least some way home! As they are flying over one of the most impenetrable areas of jungle the plane develops a fault and crash lands.\n\nSpoiler: At this point things get incredibly silly. The cannibals appear, painted red for some reason that is never explained, and disable the remaining crash survivors with their blow pipes. All except the annoying girlfriend of the team leader who receives two arrows in her head. Mr Roth obviously thought this was punishment not only for being terminally annoying but also thinking that red painted savages with blow pipes and bones through their noses were there to be of assistance.\n\nSpoiler: The survivors are transported back to the cannibal's village where they are stroked and fondled by the natives who obviously, apart from the loggers, surveyors etc. have never seen a white person before. This is definitely the case as they can't wait to see what one of them tastes like. The lucky winner is a portly chap who is laid out on some type of sacrificial rock (this must have recently been cleaned as there is not a spot of blood anywhere). Now call me pernickety if I was preparing 'long pig' for the feast I would remove the clothes first. Not so these cannibals, our portly victim had enough clothes to survive an Artic winter, but the cannibals just went ahead lopping off arms and legs. It was similar to preparing a steak that is still in a plastic bag!!\n\nSeveral other scenes pointed to Mr Roth's obvious embarrassment with the human form.\n\nSpoiler: One victim is killed by having some green stuff plastered all over him which attract the voracious 'Fire Ants'. Will he be eaten alive? Well no, not really, the man was fully dressed and the green stuff was plastered not on his body but on his outer garments so apart from a couple of bites on his face when death finally spared his agonies, there didn't seem to be anything wrong with the man.\n\nThere were many similar instances of the film while not shying away from gore was unnaturally cautious about displaying the human body even in circumstances where the authenticity of the script demanded it.\n\nFinally in it's own shy way the film attempted to tackle certain modern contentious issues. Spoiler: Female Genital Mutilation was, apparently, a practice the natives thought they would introduce to their captives, providing they were virgins. During one scene our heroine Justine is being prepared for this ritual. Although she is naked during this scene she is tied in a way that keeps her modesty intact. She manages to break free of her captives and at this point has managed to acquire and is seen sporting a fetching string bikini.\n\nScenes like the above are scattered throughout the film making it a ridiculous parody. What makes a good horror film is it's ability, no matter how preposterous, to make us believe that it could happen. Events in 'The Green Inferno' could happen but the way the various actions are portrayed make us believe that it never would."

Because she has a crush on Alejandro, she agrees to help him with his next project to save the Amazon. She will soon regret that decision when her plane crashes somewhere in the Peruvian jungle and after her and the rest of the group are captured by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nFirst of all, you know a movie isn't for everyone when you have to be ID'd before going in. I will say that it is rated R while most films (at least in Canada) are rated at most 18A but I did not let that dissuade me. I don't know the difference between the two ratings but I guess it's worse than 18A since they had to ID me and I never get ID'd when I see 18A films. As I have said on many occasions in other reviews, I was not familiar with other works of the film's director Eli Roth so my review will be based on that. Now I will just say that this film is definitely not for everyone and it earns the R rating. There is one scene in particular, that I will not spoil, that I thought earned it that rating. There are other moments, however, that come close. I will say that I did not find this film very scary but I do not think that it was the film's fault. I may have ruined it for myself because I was aware of the film's premise beforehand. Knowing this did not completely ruin it for me but I probably could have figured it out on my own quickly enough and I would have been in the same position. The film felt more suspenseful to me because most of the plot focused on whether or not the students would survive their predicament. The story isn't the most original I have ever seen for a horror film, a bunch of college students in the forest because that never ends well. I thought the story started off a little slowly for me. I found the buildup to their leaving for the Amazon to be a little boring and a little cheesy and bad. I felt like it could have just started with them in the Amazon and/or taking the time to introduce the characters that we will see because what we did see was little to no character development so we as viewers just don't care about the characters or about what happens to them. I've always felt that horror films are better with character development because if you care about the characters, you are more scared when something happens to them. Justine and to a lesser extent Alejandro got some character development but I didn't really care about them. I thought the acting was bad to mediocre but that wasn't a surprise and I thought the film just got sillier the further it went. I was not a big fan of the end either. I will admit to laughing at certain moments where people died, yes people died because it's a horror film. Overall. this isn't a terrible film but I don't think it's one worth spending money on at the theater, more like a rental.\n\nScore: 5.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

ROFL...then the fat boy carcass is moved to the butchering hut, where the tribe food preppers calmly skin him and remove organs. This is nice!!!\n\nSee let this be a lesson to all you woketards. You don't belong leaving your safe environs of the US, UK, and Canada, and venturing into the great beyond for a cause. They don't want you there!!! +1 Star for not wanting you there!!!\n\nBut bless us all, one fat boy a whole tribe can feed!!! And the tribe eats well, with even little baby piglets feeding on blood and licking pieces of dude out of his tshirt. Oh wow and then massive DIARRHEA!!! LOL, THE TRIBE bursts into laughter when a survivor has a diarrhea attack. Good stuff.\n\nOmg then a guy ripped open and his guts pulled out like a rope as the tribespeople munch on him. Man am I in the mood for some pizza or what??? Oh a couple of them managed to sneak off and get into the river. Oh no JUSTINE, our female STAR!!!, SHE gets swept away by that RAGING CURRENT!! Can the disposable cast member rescue her??? Oh he does, but the natives recapture them both and her rescuer is next on the menu!!!! Delicious!!!\n\nSo she escapes, natives chase, bulldozer dudes and guards kill natives, girl gets rescued. Goes home, lies about natives. Said all her 'friends' and fellow activists died in the crash. Because see? Thats the woke thing to do! Gotta protect those natives who just ate a bunch of your fellow activists right in front of you!!! Stupid Woke People!!! -1 Star for that dumbness\n\nOh +1 Star for the phone call at the very end in the credits!!! 5/10."

Having said all that, it is still better than the piece of rubbish that is called Iron Man 3. Which is why I gave it 2/10."

But if you like gore and things like that then you will probably like it because there are enough scenes like that. To me it was not the worst gore movie I saw. You have in that genre a ton of really bad B-movies. In The Green Inferno the actors are not as bad as in other slasher/gore movies. They are not the greatest actors either but certainly not the worst. If the story would have been a bit more entertaining then the movie would probably score more, but the lack of pursuits, hiding and waiting to be caught and things like that were not really present in this movie and so it loses in intensity. Now it's just a movie about cannibalism, with good gore moments, but with not enough suspense. They immediately get caught, eaten, and that's about it. The gore special effects are good, too bad we don't have more scenes like escaping and pursuits like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There it was also about cannibalism but you really had a horror feeling while in The Green Inferno it's just about the gore. All in all for gore fans The Green Inferno will score okay but for horror movie freaks it will be sadly not good enough."

Seeing this movie, without adequate prior knowledge about who Eli Roth is, makes me wonder what as it that enabled this stupid movie to steal a spot, as brief as it was, in the Box Office a few weeks back. Okay I admit I'm not really into the gory violent sub genre of horrors, particularly the cannibals. Still I braved this movie out of curiosity. But then again, me braving this movie didn't really pay anything since the movie was so bad, going as far as being stupid even. As a horror, it didn't even get to scare me, although it successfully grossed me out of the gory violence. The technicalities show that this movie lacks very much, as though the production was just a byproduct of a daydreaming delusion. The coloration choice is very bad. Being very bright for a horror? Indeed not a good choice. The acting overall feels very stupid as there's no real emotion depicted, even the mannerisms and body language didn't reflect the cast as students."

        "review_title": "Bloody Atrocious",
        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth's The Green Inferno has premiered at several film festivals over the past two years before finally getting a wide release in the United States. The Green Inferno is about a group of college activists who visit Peru in hopes of stopping the destruction of the indigenous people's land. The group soon finds themselves at the mercy of these indigenous people and their cannibalistic nature. Eli Roth's filmography has been very hit or miss for me. His directorial debut Cabin Fever is a great, campy horror movie, but I'm not a huge fan of his Hostel movies. The Green Inferno and its terrible script is more disturbing than any of the film's gory visuals and left me wondering the intended audience for this atrocious film.\n\nJustine (Lorenza Izzo) is the lead in The Green Inferno, and she looks like an Oscar caliber actress among the other terrible performances. While poorly acted, the characters have no depth and all are generic characters you've come to expect in horror movies. These include, but are not limited to, the nice guy, the loose girl, the stoner, etc. The indigenous people give the best performances in the entire film. They are actual villagers on the Amazon, and because of that, they feel very authentic.\n\nThere are so many things in the story that are silly and don't make any sense. One way I can sum this up is by using a mild spoiler as an example so SPOILER ALERT. At one point when the group is captured, they put a small bag of weed inside a dead body as part of an escape plan. So when the cannibals begin to cook this body, the weeds burns, and gets the tribe high. This knocks out a large group of them so the group can begin their escape. END SPOILER ALERT.\n\nKnowing what to show and what not to show is very important when it comes to movies in general, even more so with horror movies. The Green Inferno relies on gross-out visuals for a majority of its runtime, and after an onslaught of gore and violence, I became numb to it. Sometimes less is more, and I found myself tuning out after a certain amount of the relentless visuals. A lot of the violence is filmed in this hand-held, shaky style, and this gets old very quickly.\n\nThe special effects are not very good either. Some of the blood is practical, but the blood and other effects added in post-production leave a lot to be desired. A CGI panther is the worst offender and looks like it was pulled from a SyFy original movie.\n\nEli Roth is known for his strange humor in his movies, and he again attempts to break up the violence with laughs. The dark comedy amidst people eating other people doesn't mesh or make sense tonally.\n\nAll the generic characters, silly script, gross-out gore, and comedic misfires really make me wonder if this film is for anybody. Hardcore horror and gore fans will be put off by the shaky style of filmmaking, and your average movie fan will be sick to their stomach seeing the film's gross-out visuals. Which makes this even crazier is that this movie has received a wide release. I hope Eli Roth rebounds from this, but until then, he should just stick to Shark Week.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the rest of my reviews over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com"

I really enjoyed the Apocalypto side, that side had an authenticity to it that Holocaust lacked there were some moments of the tribe and children getting involved and the culture side that were really surreal and worth watching for.\n\nIt's tough to review because the unknown cast and realistic setting made for the immersive jungle horror I had hoped for but the digital effects and cinematic style took away from the authenticity that Holocaust had. It too often reminds you you're watching a film while Holocaust used so many layers of film making you got lost in the reality of it, that said I don't think this needed more shakey documentary cam, maybe less actually, like a Tarantino, often it pulls it's punches and feels too Hollywood to be intimidating.\n\nThe gore and the music are excellent and I loved the art direction but it leaves you feeling confused and underwhelmed what it's goals were. That said I would definitely recommend it, I just found myself more interested in the tribal rituals than worried about the characters, maybe the whole thing was a statement about cultural practices and social norms I dunno."

While Roth loves those days of film it is nearly impossible to do it today after being bombarded with years of \"torture porn\" movies. The acting though is definitely superior to Cannibal Holocaust, Not sure if that was a good thing though. The prior had more of a sense of realism like a documentary. This you can tell is no doubt a cinematic film. Roth does capture the terror of the crew captured. Some scenes he does add his usual touch of brutality so any fan of his will not be disappointed at all. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it as a stand alone film and not as a remake."

Lets just say it shows that they don't understand what TV/Movies are.\n\nThe sad part is that this movie really could have tried to make a very in-PC point that maybe the loggers are the good guys and the tribes (at least if they really were cannibals) need to be wiped out. It also missed it's chance to show that kids in college boycott things they know very little about makes them seem like the dumb people in this show.\n\nI cannot guarantee that added a little more commentary in it would make it a better movie but I don't see how it can be worse.\n\nRoth delivers plenty of gore like all his films but is nothing any seasoned film-goers has not seen many times before.\n\nI truly believe with a smarter plot, perhaps more humor, and creating more of a thin line could have made this a much smarter horror movie and allow it to stand on it's own merit other than being nothing more than an update of Cannibal Holocaust.\n\nDean"

        "review_title": "Cannibal Holocaust \u2013 the remake",
        "review_detailed_main": "Two questions: have you seen 'Cannibal Holocaust?' and 'Have you heard of Eli Roth?' Well, 'Cannibal Holocaust' is a disturbingly realistic film which many people forget almost single-handedly started the 'found footage' genre and Eli Roth is a modern horror writer/director. Put the two together and you get one hell of a grim bloodbath! So, as with 'Cannibal Holocaust' a group of youngsters end up deep within one of those jungles as yet unexplored by our iphone-wielding generation. In 'Cannibal Holocaust' they were making a documentary (hence the 'found footage' aspect), whereas here they're protesting for some socially just cause and end up crashing their plane. Once in this uncharted wilderness they encounter a bunch of locals who take quite a shine to them, i.e. they think these youngsters would look great with some fava beans and a nice chianti. Therefore, our hapless heroes quickly find themselves at the wrong end of a knife and fork and have to figure out a way of escaping before they're served up for brunch.\n\nNow, Eli Roth has had a bit of a 'spotted' career when it comes to his films. And, when I say 'spotted' I basically mean he made one awesome movie which everyone loved ('Cabin Fever') and since then almost every one of his films has been met with a certain level of distain. As a bit of a horror buff, I do tend to watch every movie which has his name on, as I'm certain that one day he'll recapture his former mojo and prove he wasn't just a one-hit wonder.\n\nIt's hardly an inspiring plot, but then if you're reading this far then you're not probably not really into deep and meaningful character development or high-concept plot arcs. You want to know about the blood and guts. Trust me \u2013 you shouldn't be disappointed there. It's fair to say that it's not that much of a spoiler to say that not all the characters live long and happy lives after leaving the jungle and, when they go, they go in style (and by 'style' I mean in the most unspeakably gruesome way possible). You have the good characters, the bad characters and the scared characters, but \u2013 ultimately \u2013 all the characters share one trait \u2013 you probably won't really remember any of their names. If you've seen more than a couple of horror movies then you'll have a pretty good idea which ones are going to live the longest. Most are just here to end up on the wrong end of a fork! So, is 'The Green Inferno' the film that does this? No, not really. 'Cabin Fever' was witty, different and \u2013 of course \u2013 bloodthirsty. It's a horror classic that still stands up to this day. 'The Green Inferno' is simple, nicely disgusting, but nothing that hasn't really been done before. I actually kind of enjoyed it (what does that say about me?!) as it's one of those films where if you're into the subject material then it's going to entertain you for an hour and a half. It's hardly going to be remembered in the future (like 'Cannibal Holocaust') or set any new records for gore, but it's horror \u2013plain and simple \u2013 and if you're as sick of the found footage genre, or those Japanese ghost-type films which seem to be infesting the genre these days, it makes a pleasant (if bloodthirsty) change from what else is out there. Maybe Roth was just a one-hit wonder, but he can still entertain a bit as well."

The African American fool's death is the first gruesome part of the film and is never surpassed. Another infamous modern horror film featuring graphic violence is \"Hostel\". Similarly, it has thrill seeking adolescents from the good ol' U S of A and sadistic weirdos from some eastern block s@#t hole. Both films are made by the same company. Furthermore, these films push the limit of violence because, it gets people talking about the movie. Above all, \"The Green Inferno\" is too similar to Mel Gibson's production, \"Apocalypto\". Gibson's story is about a young villager who is taken by Incans as a human sacrifice. As well as, \"Apocalypto\" there are myriad b-movies about flesh eaters including, some retro classics. This screamer Looks like it could have been made in LA, it is too long and the ending is an anti-climax."

It sure will made viewer feel so uneasy, difficult to watch, but if compare to Eli's previous film like Hostel 1 & 2, I think it may not have a great breakthrough. But overall film is just fine.\n\nPerhaps Eli wants to bring out the message of the earth pollution problem, have to protect the green, using a thriller film to get people remember on our earth issue..etc. I think the message is good, its quite clear~ But if for a thriller film, it may be still not really a good portfolio for Eli Roth. Anyway, I still respect Eli Roth as a director, story teller, producer. Salute! :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't usually review bad movies. Generally not worth the effort. But this film should usher in a new \"zero stars\" rating on IMDB.\n\nIt's a direct ripoff of that low-budget, amateurish, raunchy, exploitation film from almost 40 years ago, Cannibal Holocaust. However, that was a better film than this! And Eli Roth obviously had much more money to spend; he certainly wasted every penny.\n\nThe acting is atrocious, despite the fact that many of the cast members are professional actors. Perhaps their knowledge of English was limited to the point that they didn't realize what absurd lines they were being asked to speak. But isn't it the director's job to fix this? Roth either didn't care or is such a bad director that he can't distinguish between a good delivery and an awkward stumble. Then again, the script is so full of nonsense and trite cliches, the cast really didn't have a whole lot to work with. Roth is one of the writers, so again, we know where to lay blame.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this film it would be hard to make a list. The fact that Roth thought we want to see masturbation, deification, vomiting, urination, mutilation, torture, just to name a few, makes me wonder about his mental stability. He tries to save it by injecting some socially conscious environmental message about the fate of the Amazon Rain Forest - which is actually quite laughable in the context of everything else.\n\nThis isn't just a bad movie - it's totally inept. The kind of thing someone makes who has no clue how to actually do something worthwhile. Pathetically horrible in every sense."

The make-up and costume design is great and it allows for the natives to look absolutely barbaric and terrifying.\n\nCons: 1. There are stale performances all around, but especially from Ariel Levy (Alejandro) whose line delivery is awfully flat. 2. The foreshadowing is extremely heavy-handed and clunky. 3. A lot of the dialogue is really poor and laughably simple: \"Activism is really gay.\" 4. Some of the serious moments are unintentionally funny: Jonah (Aaron Burns) puking on himself aboard the crashing plane, and one of the students nonsensically jogging into the spinning rotor-blades of said plane. 5. The comedy never lands as it feels incredibly childish (there's even a weirdly placed poo gag) as well as being jarringly inserted. 6. The score sounds like generic scary horror music which adds almost nothing to the horror scenes. 7. The movie is thematically confused. It tries to pay homage to Cannibal Holocaust (1980) by portraying the natives savagery as reactionary to western deforestation and encroachment upon their land. However, it spends little time upon this point as most of the time is upon the natives brutally killing and cannibalising the students. This makes it impossible to side with the natives which is clearly what the film wanted you as the viewer to do. 8. Somehow, Alejandro miraculously escapes the natives' camp, off-camera. It's clearly done to set up a needless sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into a film like The Green Inferno you have two kinds of people; the aware and the unaware. Those who know the Italian- exploitation genre and have seen the films of the late 70\u2032s early 80\u2032s that director Eli Roth stems his appreciation from, and those who were dragged along by the former. This is a film that knows what it's doing and where it wants to go, which isn't how Hostel felt at times, though its sequel certainly improved upon. What makes The Green Inferno enjoyable is the initiative Roth takes in building a story around a group of activists intent on heading into the Peruvian jungle in order to stop acres of vegetation from getting slaughtered, as well as the guidance it has throughout the third act. The Green Inferno showcases a director's strengths attempting to escape the clutches of their weaknesses, giving an attentive nod to an adored genre while falling over the footsteps of exhausting dialogue and comedic gags that only deaden a pace crafted from obvious talent.\n\nIn the first act we are introduced to Justine, a dough eyed college freshman who quickly falls under the effortless spell of Alejandro, an activist bent on change at any cost. It's with naivety and jadedness that Eli Roth places us in the company of cookie cutter characters that we for the most part dislike given their hollow and callous centers, save for sweetheart Jonah and pragmatic Daniel. Walking the same path as Hostel, we're left wondering if we're meant to dislike these characters, rooting for their untimely demise or if we're suppose to embrace their naivety as a humanistic fault. Ultimately we are cast away with these characters as they plunge head first into unchartered territory, taken away with a story that is wholly Eli Roth; a story that is frequently engaging and surprisingly tense with lush cinematography by Antonio Quercia.\n\nOnce we are stranded with our doomed adventurers we begin to see The Green Inferno shift into a film that was pursued and given life as Frankenstein gave life to the dead; in order to see passion and love for what was watched and study have new meaning again. With a score by Manuel Riveiro breathing movement and life into each scene, we are taken on a ride into hell that has a fondness for dismemberment. Roth and fellow screenwriter Guillermo Amoedo fine tune a script that pulsates with ingenuity, with Roth knowing all too well what to give us once we reach the gates of hell. Flexing his skills and knowledge for tackling horror, Eli Roth gives us the films swan song with the tribes first ritualistic kill, knowing that it takes a lot more to get our pulses raised once the grisly terror halts in order to push the story along. It's a move that is frustratingly genius, as what's to come can never reach the climactic bullet we've barreled along with for over an hour.\n\nWhat we are subjected to till the very end is an effort that is indebted to its source material but tepid in its approach, feeling all too safe to truly feel respectful of the Italian-exploitation genre. When one of the captives gets ill within the confines of their prison cell, it feels all too comedic and amateurish to show her defecating in the corner, an approach both the genre and Eli Roth are better than. Perhaps with the time saved removing this scene there might have been extra funds in the budget to produce better CGI, which stand-out like a severed thumb within a gorgeous and natural environment. The Green Inferno isn't a bad film but one that plays it too safe in the third act, despite dealing with certain subject matter. With a flawed finale and unnecessary elements amidst almost palpable dread, The Green Inferno should be applauded for standing out as a beacon of hope for modern horror films and the directors that continually push for their films to be released."

Only real difference is where that was about journalists actually looking for evidence of cannibalistic tribes, this was about college protesters getting themselves mixed up with a vicious tribe while protesting a company bulldozing the rainforest.\n\nOverall the story and acting are fine, and the gore is pretty extreme. It doesn't pull many punches, but at the same time, the punches don't all land. If you want \"realistic\" type horror and a lot of blood and gore, this will do it for you. And again, the story's not bad."

He uses her for his purposes against the evil business industry (This is anarchist, job destroying propaganda) falsely professing that the 'oil industry' is responsible for destruction of the Amazon rain forest & the indigenous indians. For those who keep up with the Amazon rain forest destruction it is all about farming, not oil, so the movie presents a false plot to pursue its evil means. Izzo and her group face the gore of cannibalistic indians and blood & gore make up a fair amount of this movie. Izzo eventually becomes the judgmental, liar, and murderer that the left loves, as long as it serves their purpose. If you like this kind of movie go for it, otherwise, save yourself 103 minutes of your life that you will not get back & will leave you feeling terrible."

        "review_detailed_main": "Eli Roth has me trapped in his web. I don't particularly find his films that enjoyable, yet I sit down and watch all of them when they come out. I believe the man receives too much hype and credit from some horror fans because quite frankly, he hasn't done anything to deserve it. He sure as hell knows his horror films though, that is for damn sure. But what has he given us? Cabin Fever and Hostel are his two most well known films, they're decent, at best. Yet time after time I hear about how he's going to save the genre. Well he hasn't and he won't.\n\nLook no further than he last two entries. Knock Knock, the seductive thriller that stars Keanu Reeves as a cheating husband being tortured by his sex partners and The Green Inferno, Roth's homage to the cannibal genre. Did the cannibal genre need a film to homage it? That's up for debate, as is the quality of this film. The Green Inferno was actually shot 2 years ago, but has been stuck in release limbo since then. It has finally seen the light of day and as it is with any film that has been held back, it doesn't live up to the hype.\n\nIs it bloody? Yes. Is it sadistic? Yes. Is it a good movie? Not really. I can't really blame it on Roth though, the genre itself is nothing to wag a stick at. He manages to hit the same notes as all those other films do. They just seem tired and repetitive. He even acknowledges those films in the credits, so I would recommend seeing those movies instead.\n\nOur characters are in a plane crash somewhere in the jungle. The survivors are immediately captured by a tribe of cannibals and are held prisoner until the tribe feels the need to eat. One by one our characters bite the dust, either by being eaten, or killed while trying to escape. Either way, it doesn't look good for anyone. Nor does it look good for the audience as they have to sit through an hour of repetitive screams, decapitations and sleep inducing darts. For a film mainly about killing people and eating them, it's pretty routine.\n\nThe cast of characters range from tolerable to down right annoying. Two characters that we are suppose to like are the tolerable ones. One of them being Roth's wife, who was also one of the seductive torturers from Knock Knock. Here she is put through the wringer and dehumanized. Roth also seems to like the idea of showing his wife's naked body to as many people as possible. On the other end of the spectrum is the down right annoying lead activist, who has secrets...oooohhhhhh. Even in the face of death, the man still manages to be more despicable than the savages. What makes it worse is that we are not allowed to relish in any torture given to him. I won't explain, but the film doesn't seem interested in making this guy suffer at all, it's everyone else that has to take it.\n\nWith the exception of the first kill and eating, this film was surprisingly tame. I'm more shocked at how the film did not disgust me than I am with the acts depicted. When one character is eaten alive by the tribe, it's basically a shot for shot lift from Day of the Dead. This idea behind what happens is obviously more horrific than what Roth can come up with, but he still tries to one up us. It doesn't work out in the end and older cannibal films like Ferox or Holocaust are more shocking than what The Green Inferno can offer.\n\nGreen Inferno is a near miss for me, despite it falling almost perfectly in line with what it intended to do. Oh...and I really like the title of the film. I don't know why. It's the best thing about the movie."

        "review_title": "A bloodsoaked satire and uncommonly fun cannibal film",
        "review_detailed_main": "In September 2014, our theaters and favorite video-on-demand platforms were supposed to be graced by Eli Roth's heavily hyped cannibal film \"The Green Inferno.\" The film was said to be an homage to the genre-classic \"Cannibal Holocaust,\" guided by the same man who brought us the bloodbath \"Cabin Fever\" and the torture porn-pioneer \"Hostel.\" Everything was set to go until weeks before the cross-platform release, the production company Worldview Entertainment, a company that has produced everything from \"Birdman\" to \"The Sacrament,\" reported financial difficulties and had Open Road Films pull the plug on the release date and delay the project's release indefinitely. This put the fate of the film and its planned sequel in a bout of uncertainty, with no clear plan of when or if the film would ever see the light of day.\n\nWhat I fully expected to happen with \"The Green Inferno\" was the unfortunate circumstance that has happened to a lot of films that get delayed indefinitely; they receive a low-key release directly to DVD or video-on-demand to little buzz and, regardless of quality, come and go with barely a whimper. However, when I saw an muscled ad campaign for the film over the summer, including various trailers in the theater, TV spots, and billboards, I was quite proud. Let the marketing guys and production companies for \"Green Inferno\" be commended for not letting a project simply die when the future seemed grim; this is how you promote a film that looked to be down and out.\n\nWith that, \"The Green Inferno\" is a nasty, downright sick film, heavily reminiscent of the 1970's Italian gorefests that found their ways into seamy grindhouse theaters and drive-ins. It's such a bleak and uncommonly gory picture that the way it demands your attention is almost narcissistic. As wretched as it was, as bloodsoaked as it got, and as downright horrifying as it progressed, I simply couldn't shake the entire experience and probably won't for the remainder of the weekend.\n\nThe film concerns a group of college activists, led by the bossy Alejandro (Ariel Levy), who travel from New York City to the Amazon to save a native tribe that is rapidly growing extinct. They plan to attack a construction company looking to bulldoze over the natives' land by assembling a protest before everyone on social media, launching their organization's popularity and message virally. Justine (Lorenza Izzo) gets wind of this plan and impulsively decides to attend. When the group is traveling over the Amazon, their small plane crashes and plunges deep into a jungle, populated by violent, cannibalistic natives that take them hostage in their small village.\n\nA film like this can't entirely rely on the violence of the cannibals to carry itself, which is why it's nice to see Eli Roth and Guillermo Amoedo pen some characters that are equal parts amusing and satirical. Roth and Amoedo more-or-less make these characters thinly draw caricatures of your run-of-the-mill, liberal collegiates that think their presence alone, protesting actions that they think are morally wrong, will change the actions of corporations, natives, and a million dollar operation. The two poke fun at this notion by making these characters wise, but cutely naive, at one moment speaking about their willingness to do good, and another moment, having one character proclaim she will make her next tattoo a new animal she discovers. The result is a genial nudge-in-the-hip to those who feel that everyone in the world would be better off if they just followed their own set of rules.\n\nThe characters here, with the exception of one, are all likable in their own way. We have Aaron Burns' well-meaning, affable Jonah character, who tries to relax Justine when a situation goes awry and even Daryl Sabara of \"Spy Kids\" fame playing a goofy stoner, who's problems start and end at where to score potent Peruvian marijuana.\n\nThe real attraction, however, is the gore, and there's plenty of it, so much so that I feel people who have grown accustomed to largely bloodless paranormal affairs will wince and grow nauseous at the liberal display of blood here. This is a brutally violent film, capitalizing off of the ability to go from calm to immediately bloody (consider the scene when a certain character's fate is finally revealed and how another character responds to it) in the same twenty seconds. This makes \"The Green Inferno\" incredibly unsettling and suspenseful, as it relies on these momentary instances that could completely alter a characters' fate as a method of grabbing you in and taking you for a ride.\n\nAdmittedly, \"The Green Inferno\" is marketed as a bloodbath, and on that note, it does what it sets out to accomplish; it's a nasty, unrelenting piece of horror, made to make you squirm and uncomfortable at nearly every turn. All things considered, it holds up and makes for a great piece of late-night entertainment; Eli Roth throws caution to the wind here and makes one of the goriest mainstream American films since the remake of \"Evil Dead,\" and, surprisingly enough, succeeds at making this film interesting on more levels than just the bloodshed."

It was genuinely appalling, the main guy, who's name I've already forgotten even though I've just finished watching it, was, well, wooden is a compliment, the rest of the cast are equally as bad,l...except the indigenous cast, who are a legitimate tribe in the Amazon.\n\nThe camera work, flat, boring, uninspired. I've honestly seen student films with more imagination and panache\n\nScore, awful, obtrusive and cheap sounding\n\nI could go on to be honest about how awful everything in this film is.\n\nThe biggest crime? For a film going for shock value and echoing the previously mentioned films, it's not actually that gory, it has gore, but not what I was hoping for, and not as much as expected.\n\nIf you want a recent(ish) shocking gore horror film that doesn't let up, watch the Evil Dead remake, it's gorier, more savage and, as is with fans like this, more fun, if like me you find thaes films \"fun\""

        "review_detailed_main": "He needs to get over himself, as it's tarnishing fairly decent material that could've been so much more. Apparently paying homage to Italian cannibal features such as 'Cannibal Holocaust', yet clearly misunderstanding their original purpose. Social commentary on modern civilisation by comparing Western society to that of the indigenous \"savages\". Exploiting every aspect of sensationalism to explore a new culture. Time has passed though. Nearly three decades in fact. Deforestation threatens these tribes, wiping them out. Yet Roth, not one to shy away from controversy, depicts these \"savages\" in such a one-dimensional approach that the film evolves into a harmful message in neo-colonialism. Not to mention its technically inept. A group of social-activists set out to Peru to stop lumbering companies from destroying the Amazon, only to be then taken by a tribe of cannibals to which they must try and escape.\n\nRoth's filmography has always revolved around gore. 'Cabin Fever', 'Hostel' and even 'Thanksgiving' to a certain extent. The man has an eye for blood, and exploits it particularly well in this. Limbs ripped apart. Eyes gouged out. Spears piercing through necks. Enough to keep the squeamish looking away, but weaker than strawberry jam for mature audiences. And that's primarily due to the woeful acting. Diabolical. Not a single acceptable performance. The screams of pain were disingenuous. The general conversations were stilted. The expressions non-existent. Laughable. Never thought I'd see a cannibalistic comedy. What doesn't assist in Roth's screenplay? All characters were unlikeable. Detestable even. The students, the indigenous tribe, the private militia and the petrochemical company. Heck, even Justine's father was depicted as a pompous UN official. Absurdly ostentatious. When characters say such fruitful lines of dialogue such as \"activism is gay\", well you're about to unleash this beast.\n\nThe entire purpose of this exploitative mess was misguided, commentating on nothing. Roth's involvement only further descended this conflagration into the realms of immaturity. Puerility. Unsophistication. \"Yeah I wanted to the film to look like a Werner Herzog or Terrence Malick film\". Firstly, don't even compare yourself to those acclaimed masters. Secondly, they use subtlety. Where's the nuance here Eli? The satirical aura is instantly diminished when you force characters to masturbate over savaged peers and explode their guts whilst profusely apologising. Something tells me that scene hits more notes thematically than anything else shown. Asinine it its purest form.\n\nThe conclusive one-sided battle exhumes the wrong message, with a consequential taped interview falsifying the entire ordeal. As if Roth was forced to implement a positive result on social-activism. Foreshadowed right from the initial journey to Peru. Not only that, but the credits include the Twitter handles of the cast and crew whilst also setting up a potential sequel. Never questioned life so much.\n\nDespite the homage to gory flicks of old, enveloped in gloriously green cinematography, The Green Inferno infuriates more than it entertains. Cumbersome, predictable and incredibly weak. With its infantile narrative exposure, Roth cements himself as a director who is self-important as much as he is amateurish."

Some of the lines in the start are hilarious with how badly they're acted, but otherwise? Not too many positives."

When the group is about to return to civilization, their plane explodes and crashes in the middle of the jungle. As if that disaster was not enough, soon the survivors discover that they are not alone and are kidnapped by a tribe of cannibals.\n\nDirector Eli Roth (who has specialized his career in gore horror films) tries to pay tribute in this movie to the cannibal films by Italian directors that were very fashionable in the late 1970s and early 1980s. All I can say is that... well, he tried. Or perhaps it is me who after having watched some of those, this one seems just more of the same, but tamed and lamer.\n\nThe first part of the movie gets lost in a long exposition of the various characters and their motivations and only almost halfway through, after the plane crash, does the green inferno begin. Of course, this film has to unnecessarily include certain references to current socio-political culture, also some questionably humorous situations, and a final speech by the (sole) survivor that subverts expectations, which makes it not at all believable both in terms of characterization and cinematic effect.\n\nAlthough it adds nothing new to this horror sub-genre, the graphic violence is very present and evident here and will certainly satisfy gore fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "A group of annoying self-important college student activists venture into the jungles of Peru to stop deforestation and protect the gentle native people by chaining themselves to bulldozers and steaming it all online. These same vegetarian college students' ideals are tested when their plane crashes and a group of cannibals capture them, intent on eating their liberal bleeding hearts. Roth made a name for himself with \"Cabin Fever,\" a slasher film with a virus instead of a slasher. He made an even bigger splash with \"Hostel,\" which was unfairly dismissed as gratuitous torture porn, but is actually a clever take on international extreme horror cinema and added American horror film tropes, which he then used to play against audience expectations (if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't seen it I don't want to spoil anything). Roth knows horror cinema inside and out, so I was excited to see his take on the disreputable cannibal horror sub-genre of the 70s and 80s (i.e. \"Cannibal Holocaust,\" \"Cannibal Ferox,\" \"The Mountain of the Cannibal God,\" etc.). Unfortunately, with \"The Green Inferno\" he's crafted a love letter that's faithful to its source material, but fails to be much of a shocker and even more disappointingly fails to play against genre topes and audience expectations, which is what he's done so well in his previous films. The film does not offer many surprises, which was a major disappointment. His prior film felt as if anything could happen and usual rules of mainstream cinema did not apply. I suppose cannibal films in general do not follow mainstream film expectations, but for anyone who's seen a few cannibal films, this one won't offer any surprises. The gore is pretty gruesome (that's good or bad depending upon your taste) and the film does boast the use of authentic native people, which is somewhat controversial in itself (Roth reportedly showed them Ruggero Deodato's \"Cannibal Holocaust\" to explain what he was making), but although \"Green Inferno\" is a technically well crafted horror film, it's nowhere as original as Roth's prior films (which is also how I felt about his subsequent film, the tame remake of \"Death Wish\")."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE GREEN INFERNO follows a group of young activists who are held captive by a \"savage\" tribe of cannibals in the deep jungles of Peru. As we come to expect from an Eli Roth movie, there is a lot of gore and a lot of exploitation. Yes, the movie is at times indulging itself in torture porn. Yes, this movie\u2014despite relatively high production values\u2014has a cheesy feel to it with some pretty tacky dialogues and some pretty stereotypical characters. At the same time, this movie kept me entertained throughout. It had some smart ideas and a few twists towards the end that I genuinely didn't expect. And the suspense never faded away, which is what so often happens in gore flicks.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, THE GREEN INFERNO explores some interesting political and social themes. Despite having a B-movie feel to it, the final moments of the movie actually ask some deep questions: What is cultural progress? Where and how do we intervene on humanitarian grounds with what looks like wrongdoing from our cultural perspective?\n\nDon't get me wrong: Just like its spiritual predecessor CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this movie is thoroughly offensive and definitely not politically correct on most fronts, for example in its exoticization of seemingly \"primitive\" cultures. If you're an anthropologist, or basically anyone with a bit of cultural sensitivity, you'll be mad at how the \"natives\" are depicted. And the negative perspective on social activism is definitely over-the-top. Although it is good to raise the issue of whether social activism is hypocritical at times, I worry that people who already mock activism come away from this movie with their ideas vindicated. A lot of these social issues are dealt with in a tongue-and-cheek manner though, so you are free how to interpret them! And once you look beyond THE GREEN INFERNO's indulgence with shock and confrontation, you'll find a suspenseful movie with an interesting story arch and some relatable and interesting characters. Go for it, if you like gore and B-movies."

The only problem with this one is that it takes one hour for anything to start happening. Imagine watching a porn and the sex doesn't start for one hour. Well that is what its like for horror fans to watch this one. Once it gets going though its awesome. Watching cannibal families prepare bodies like they're turkey was disturbing but well done.

        "review_detailed_main": "Justine (Lorenza Izzo) is a college freshmen who finds herself fascinated with a social activism group headed by the enigmatic Alejandro (Ariel Levy). The group heads to the Amazon to stage a protest against developers using mercenaries to displace the native Yaje tribes and bulldoze the area, but Justine finds Alejandro's tactics to be dangerous and life threatening. On the flight back the plane's engine fails resulting in Justine and the other activists crashing in the jungle. Those who survive are soon taken prisoner by the Yaje and are subjected to horrors of torture and cannibalism.\n\nFollowing Hostel Part II's disappointing box office performance, Roth took a hiatus from directing. While Roth did have some writing and acting credits during this time, notably his role as The Bear Jew in Inglorious Basterds, Roth's directorial work was stalled with projects such as Endangered Species and the Stephen King adaptation Cell either being put on the backburner or taken over by another director. The Green Inferno was supposedly meant to be Roth's big comeback picture following his hiatus but financial problems with the distributor meant the film ended up in limbo and sat on a shelf for two years before being released. Now finally free of the hurdles does the movie serve as a comeback? It won't win over many (if any) of Roth's detractors, but it'll remind those with less animosity towards the man why he often receives praise.\n\nWith the Green Inferno, Roth largely trades his abrasive sex and drugs crazed stereotypes for abrasive two faced characters (and maybe one or two drug crazed stereotypes just to pad out the body count). The Green Inferno is heavily inspired by the Italian cannibal movies of the 1970s (down to the fact the movie is named after the film within a film from Cannibal Holocaust) and like those movies it has beautiful jungle locations covered in blood and gore from duplicitous characters who wallow in their own hypocrisy.\n\nLorenza Izzo as Justine is really quite good in the lead role and makes for an effective anchor/proxy for the audience to react to the horror. Ariel Levy is also quite good as Alejandro who plays up the sinister side of his character and makes his extreme activist character simultaneously sinister and threatening. The rest of the cast is decent for what's given to them. Richard Burgi has a brief two scene cameo as Justine's father and is a welcome addition. I also rather liked Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez as fellow activist Daniel who made me feel sympathy for a character that for all intents and purposes didn't have that much to him. The rest of the cast is mostly their as a way fro Roth to fit in his usually tropes of crass dialogue and odd humor, but in this case Roth dials it back so it works better here than it did in Hostel.\n\nThe story structure will be very familiar to anyone who's even passingly familiar with old Cannibal movies. The movie takes us from campus demonstrators, to corporate mercenaries, to finally cannibalistic nightmares and it's basically as the title suggests a journey into a green colored Hell. While the characters don't raise themselves too far above the typically kill fodder in Eli Roth film's they do give just enough character to give weight to the violence we witness. The Cannibal scenes are effectively gory and well done, but I wouldn't call The Green Inferno scary. It's definitely a shocking movie and keeps you invested to the end, but there's really no points in the movie where you feel fear. With that said however, the movie's adventure in violent carnage is pretty effective and still manages to be engaging.\n\nThe Green Inferno represents a massive improvement for Roth following his underwhelming Hostel films. While the movie doesn't stray too far from Roth's established wheelhouse he does break a bit from his conventions and makes a movie that feels unmistakably his while still giving us something we feel like he hasn't done before."

Yet, by the third killing we still don't learn anything new about the culture \u2013 the types of Gods they worship, hierarchy of power, annual celebrations \u2013 instead justifiably fearing them before we're told we're imperialists for feeling such away by Justine's jarring metamorphosis. At times, though, the unpredictability of the tribe works effectively as a means of organic suspense; the lack of a means of communication and the killing ritual did a commendable job at keeping me rigid in my seat.\"\n\nFULL REVIEW HERE: http://www.borrowingtape.com/latest-reviews/the-green-inferno-2015"

The 'othering' of anybody not white, middle class and American is like a throwback to an earlier age.\n\nAs a horror movie it kind of works, as anything else it falls woefully short.\n\nIf you want a take your brain on holiday horror movie, watch to your hearts content. If you want the homage to Italian cannibal movies that he purported to make, avoid this like the plague and instead seek out the originals that the directors have thankfully recently gone back to and to an extent removed the unnecessary animal cruelty.\n\nCannibal Holocaust is a (very): flawed classic, this is just very flawed.\n\nIt's competently directed and paced which is the only reason it elevates itself to a 3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering the experienced filmmakers working on this film and the genre of cinema to which it pays homage, I can't really understand how it managed to be so very bad.\n\nThe Green Inferno is badly acted, ineptly written, poorly directed and edited, and fundamentally misconceived. It has no idea what it is trying to say or how it is trying to say it, veering wildly between stark horror and puerile slapstick. One of the characters is so poorly-written that I actually shouted \"WHAT???\" at the screen in multiple scenes as they became a full-on villain with absolutely no justification.\n\nEven worse, this movie seems to be making a case that student activism is pointless and that some \"primitive\" people are savages who deserve to be wiped out. Parts of it come across as full-blown pro-colonial propaganda.\n\nPerhaps its worst sin, though, is that it chickens out on the gore and exploitation. Despite all the posturing about \"reviving a lost film genre\", there is clearly a line in the sand that the film refuses to cross, and as a result it feels cowardly. Nicotero and his team did a solid job of the gore, and it's insulting to their work that the camera shies away from showing too much of it.\n\nEli Roth may pretend to be following in the footsteps of Ruggero Deodato, but he doesn't have even a fraction of his imagination and sheer bravado. Deodato had his faults, but Cannibal Holocaust was at least an honest film that dared to go further than any other films dared. Roth is a weak copycat in comparison."

Their aim is to make an ecological statement by hindering the operations of a logging company, and streaming this live to YouTube. They succeed in this but on the way back their plane crashes. The survivors now have to deal with the cannibalistic tribe that lives in those parts...\n\nPretty weak, and doesn't work as any sort of movie. Seeing as it is directed by Eli Roth, you figure it will be a gory horror-type movie. There is gore, but it is pretty conventional and not that shocking by modern standards.\n\nI thought this may be some of 70s-like cannibal-exploitation movie, in the vein of Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox. No, it is far too tame for that, and quite unnaturally so (which is odd - Roth must have known this was going to get an MA or R rating, for the gore, yet he toned down the exploitation scenes. Once you've hit the top restrictions, no need to pull your punches).\n\nThe movie had potential as a survival movie, but instead of developing that for a spell, Roth went straight to the captives-of- cannibals plot.\n\nThere's also a greenie vibe, that Roth alternately extols and mocks, both equally half-heartedly.\n\nJust as a pure drama it's pretty bad: basic script, unimaginative direction, lacklustre performances.\n\nSo, won't work for anyone, no matter what they are in to. Focusing on one theme, and turning it up to the max would at least kept one group happy. Instead we have a hodge-podge of half-baked, diluted themes and genres."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE GREEN INFERNO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe new horror flick from director Eli Roth (the man behind such popular slasher classics as 'CABIN FEVER' and 'HOSTEL'). It was written by Roth and Guillermo Amoedo (who also co-wrote 'AFTER SHOCK' and the upcoming 'KNOCK KNOCK', with Roth and Nicolas Lopez). The film is about a group of college activists, who are attacked by cannibals in the Amazon rainforest. It stars Lorenza Izzo (Roth's wife), Ariel Levy, Daryl Sabara (of 'SPY KIDS' fame), Aaron Burns, Nicolas Martinez and Sky Ferreira. The movie was inspired by notorious Italian cannibal flicks, from the 70s and 80s, like 'CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST' and 'CANNIBAL FEROX'. It's not quite as good as those, but it is a nice throwback.\n\nJustine (Izzo) is a New York City college student, who becomes fascinated by a campus activist group; and it's leader, Alejandro (Levy). She's invited to join the group, by a member named Jonah (Burns), and she reluctantly accepts. Alejandro has a plan to enter the Amazon rainforest, to stop a logging company from destroying all the land there, and thereby killing an ancient tribe. Once there, they become endangered by the people they went there to protect.\n\nThe movie is pretty slow-paced, at first, during all of the story and character development. These scenes are also really poorly acted and cheesy; but I wonder how much of that is the director's intent, and how much is unintentional. The second half of the movie delivers all of the promised shock and gore. It's maybe not quite as disturbing, as all of the hype promised it would be, but it's pretty close. It's also full of dark comedy (like all of Roth's films) and it's a great tribute to exploitation cannibal movies of the past. It's not as good as 'CABIN FEVER', 'HOSTEL' or 'CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST', but it's still pretty horrific and memorable. There's also some kind of a message, hidden in there, about misguided activism, and big business destroying everything; but it's not what the movie is really about.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/553rKMZCAwE"

I've seen many cannibal films after discovering the Video Nasties list as a teenager and for a new cannibal film, I don't think it could have been done any better. My hat is off to Eli Roth, and the cast and crew of this film. The only thing that literally blows my mind is how this movie got an 'R' rating and not an 'NC-17' or an 'X'. The violent sequence in this film is one of the most brutal and hard to watch scenes I've ever seen in a theater. Anyone bashing this film or hating on it clearly did not see or did not enjoy any of the cannibal films of the late 70's/early 80's."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since writer/director/producer/actor Eli Roth made audiences squirm with unimpressive yet popular horror sequel Hostel: Part II and directed arguably the best of the three faux-trailers shown in between Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof in their failed experiment Grindhouse back in 2007, the once-horror prodigy has fallen under the radar. For his big comeback, he turned to a long-dead sub-genre for inspiration - the cannibal flick. These blood-spattered, animal-torturing movies churned out in Italy during the 1970's and early 80's are clearly movies Roth holds dearly, especially Cannibal Holocaust (1980). But the main issue with taking heavy inspiration from what are generally appalling movies - Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece aside - is that you're going to end up with another appalling movie.\n\nJustine (Lorenza Izzo), a freshman at Columbia University, starts to involve herself with the on-campus social activism after her eye is caught by the group's hunky leader Alejandro (Ariel Levy). Soon enough, Justine, Alejandro and the rest of the bearded, bead-wearing hipster types that make up the group are heading to the Amazon rainforest to highlight and hopefully stop an evil corporation who are tearing down chunks of a United Nations-protected area and massacring the native tribes in the process. When their plane crashes and poisoned darts start to fly into their necks, the group discover that the local tribe would rather be feasting on their flesh or mutilating their genitals.\n\nVisually, The Green Inferno looks rather splendid with cinematographer Antonio Quercia nicely capturing both the lushness and the natural brutality of the Amazon. There are also some very convincing effects work done during the scenes of dismemberment and eye-gouging, with plenty to satisfy gore-hounds. But aside from the technical aspects, there is little else positive to say about the film. Izzo is the only one who convinced me that she was a professional actor, with the rest a bunch of extremely annoying lambs for the slaughter, struggling with an awkward script. While I didn't care much for either Cabin Fever (2002) or the Hostel movies, there was enough there to established Roth as a film-maker of promise. Here, it seems he's lost his way, fumbling around from one scene of gore to the next and managing to defy all sense of logic at the same time. Where Cannibal Holocaust got under your skin, The Green Inferno just gets on your nerves."

THE GREEN INFERNO doesn't apologize, it doesn't hold back, it aims to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible. But ya know what, I don't expect anything less from the man who gave us \"Cabin Fever,\" and \"Hostel,\" point being that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you're about to watch an Eli Roth presentation.\n\nCo-written and directed by Eli Roth and starring many of the actors he's worked with in the past including his wife, his go-to actress Lorenza Izzo, THE GREEN INFERNO is essentially about a group of college student activists who travels to the Amazon to protest the corporation that's hurting the rain forest over there. These are young naive idealists who think that chaining themselves up to a tree and capturing that event on social media would spark worldwide attention, that's their sole plan. To a certain extent it works, but their plane then crash-landed in a remote area where they find themselves captured by the very primitive natives who happen to be cannibals. That's right, these guys eat humans.\n\nWhat's entertaining about THE GREEN INFERNO is that as disturbing as the cannibalism sequences may be, and trust me, they get really graphic, you will see eyeballs being pulled out and swallowed, but as disturbing as those scenes may be, the satire remains intact throughout the whole ordeal. It's not so much that Eli Roth is mocking the idea of activism, but I think THE GREEN INFERNO is poking fun at the idea of savior complex. Members of the group start to question the actual purpose of their being there in the first place, while seeing their fellow friends, one by one, getting chopped off into pieces and served as dinner. It's hilarious seeing them turn on each other, it's even funnier seeing some of their escape plans which speak loudly about each and everyone of their personalities. So it's not just simply a story about activism gone haywire, it's not one plot that drastically turns into a completely different plot halfway through. Eli's point, if he claims to have one, remains intact the entire time.\n\nDespite what you may think of THE GREEN INFERNO, you may quickly dismiss or judge it, you may be disgusted by it, but you've gotta admire the ambitious nature of this project, not to mention involving the local villagers in that area to participate and play these roles that don't actually represent who they are or what they're about. The fact that they agreed to do this is mind-blowing, I read somewhere that they had never even seen a moving picture, so Eli Roth had to screen for them a film prior to production. So it's an ambitious and impressive effort that I think pays off. The main key actors themselves, give a whole a new meaning of terror, you are scared just seeing them scared. But I hope films like the Dowdles' \"No Escape\" and Eli Roth's \"The Green Inferno\" do not end up scaring you into never wanting to visit these exotic places on earth. If anything, I think it should raise curiosity and awareness."

The acting in this is terrible and in no way redeeming. These characters are some of the most annoying, idiotic retards I've ever seen put to screen. At one point everyone is held in a huge cage, this guy just starts jerking off for no reason. Another character walks overs and starts choking him, and the guy just KEEPS SPANKING IT!!! I'ts shocking how dumb this script is. The gore is nothing special or freaky. The first kill is probably the best, and it almost got me excited, like, wow this might be a pretty gory, sick movie.

The story is paper thin and full of holes, the characters are one dimensional so you don#t care what happens to them, the film lucrhes from one horrific death to the next, but is ultimatly not even that scary or horrific,as its all just one dimensional crap. I am sure fans might say I missed the point, but if I did, I am glad I did. Don't waste your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "If this is one of the worst movies I've seen, why am I giving it a 4? It's technically fairly good. The photography looks nice, everything is as it should be as far as sound, color, etc. It holds attention pretty well.\n\nBut this movie has a problem that I've never seen in any other movie. It misses the point it was trying to make.\n\nA number of people have brought this up - Eli Roth's explicit focus was to make fun of what he characterizes as \"social justice warriors\" or \"slacktivists.\" It should be clarified that both of these are very different ideas.\n\nIn both cases, he's sending the exact opposite message than he intends. Instead of poking fun at people who want to do good, but are too lazy to do so, he focuses on a group of people who make the effort to do good.\n\nIs the point that it's a bad idea to try to do good if you don't have all of the details? Was the message that this cannibalistic tribe should have been wiped out in favor of deforestation? This may have been the direction his thought was going in, but it's remarkably oblique.\n\nThe other elements of the movie are not especially worthwhile. The gore is not especially shocking. It's usually sort of funny, since it plays out in a less-than-realistic way.\n\nIt's hard to not compare this to Cannibal Holocaust, which achieved a much more creepy and distressing story. While we are supposed to like the protagonist, it's hard to do that when she's mostly passive until the end, and even then, makes a completely bizarre decision that requires as much of a logical stretch as the so-called \"point\" of this movie.\n\nI watch a lot of bad movies, and I usually look for the good in them. Even stuff like The Room is intensely personal. This is... a tribute that seems strangely shortsighted. Like a nihilistic teenager looking to prove that everything sucks."

        "review_detailed_main": "It just so happens that this was my second Eli Roth (and also his wife Lorenza Izzo) film in the last week with 'Knock Knock' being the other. The films couldn't be more different however. If you told someone unfamiliar that they were made by the same man they'd think you were crazy. 'The Green Inferno' is more in line with what we've come to know Roth for. Brutal storytelling where anything can and does go.\n\nThe one thing missing from this that I usually love the most about his films, is that I never cared for any of the characters. Usually he does such a fantastic job of making us care for the characters before they swiftly meet there fate. Here though, I can honestly say I never did, and furthermore I never really felt like he tried to make me care. Perhaps he realised it was a lost cause when he considered this was after all a bunch of activists we are talking about. Not an easy group of people to portray as likable I'd imagine.\n\nThat aside though every other brilliant piece of filmmaking we expect from Roth is present. The unpredictable script (anything can and does happen in the blink of an eye), the extremely violent scene that even the toughest of viewers winces at (despite no doubt denying it afterwards) and the unique ending where things that would never even cross other filmmakers minds usually happen.\n\nTo be honest I was a little let down overall by 'The Green Inferno'. It's undoubtedly a very good movie but I think I'd built it up so much in my head and expect such a high standard from Roth that pretty much anything was going to be a let down to some degree. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what more I wanted out of it, but for me I don't think it's going to have quite the lasting effect 'Hostel' did. Still a very fine film worth giving your time to."

Now, going to the topic witch is The Green Inferno... Eli got it wrong... I think he was actually afraid... people say it was bad casting, or actors were just bad... If a story is no good, how can someone make it better? Bad scrip, actors trying to make it not taking things seriously. I bet that most of them weren't aware of the source material!!! Eli Roth needs to get his s**** together... just a blood filled picture with nothing behind it. Cannibal Holocaust could be great if some things would be done in other ways. But even that is almost forgotten because is a well written and directed story... with a real punchline. With a real purpose. This movie by Eli \"I was once a Quentin friend\" Roth???

        "review_detailed_main": "Today is Ms Antonieta Pari's Birthday (May 31), and it's night over here. To honor her I watched the movie that I knew her from, Eli Roth's The Green Inferno. This movie is a tribute to classic cannibal films from the 70s and 80s, a homage to \"Cannibal Holocaust.\" Antonieta plays a leader of a cannibal tribe, and her performance is terrifying and frightening, with her looks. She's just incredibly fearsome and amazing. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her films. Lorenza Izzo, who is Eli's wife, was the leading actress and did an outstanding job. The rest of the cast and crew was also awesome. It has that disturbing bloody gore, with scenes that will make you go WTF. It also has comedy, with a mixture of the bizarre that is guaranteed to shock viewers. I have seen lots of bad reviews for this movie and I just don't understand why. Some people says it's gory and some says it's not gory enough. Everyone has their opinions, but for me everything was perfect and it's in its order. Eli Roth really worked hard for this feature. It's not easy making a movie like this. He trained real life villagers who had no experience in acting. Lorenza risked her life in a scene where she nearly drowns. They busted their asses for the movie, and some people just don't give them credit. I truly respect and love them 100% for this bloody, dark, good, intense, adventurous fun ride. One of the reasons I loved it is that there is no animal cruelty in it, and I salute Eli Roth for that. Eli and Lorenza prove that they are one of the best duos in the Horror World. Whether you love it or hate it, this is one of those films people will be talking about for ages. Back in 2013, my Dad was so thrilled when he heard that Eli was doing a cannibal film. He was a huge fan of Eli's films. The sad part is he passed away in June. Fast forward to 2015, and it was released in my country on September 24, my Dad's Birthday. I was like, Dad, I am gonna celebrate your Birthday by watching the movie you waited for. I watched it on the big screen and it was heavily censored, but I still enjoyed it. In January 2016 I finally got to watch it uncut for the first time on iTunes. Later I got it on DVD, and this is a movie that every horror fan out there should own. And I'm so excited that there's a sequel in the works titled \"Beyond The Green Inferno,\" and I truly hope Antonieta Pari reprises her role as the Queen Of The Cannibal Clan!!!"

Although I remember when his debut Cabin Fever came out and myself and many others adored it. When Hostel came out it wasn't quite the fanfare as Cabin Fever, but I've grown to quite like it over the years. I think he doesn't take himself too seriously, he loves trolling his audience and he's a horror fans filmmaker, or at least he was.\n\nThe hate for him has evolved into quite something over the years. I can see why, he seems like a self aggrandising narcissist at times. He's also not done anything of worth since Hostel (and a lot of people wouldn't even consider Hostel something of worth).\n\nI've still been a defender of Eli Roth, and I also believe his best work is coming. However, It pains me to say this, but I did not like The Green Inferno.\n\nIn The Green Inferno, Eli Roth tries to recreate the brutality and excess of films like Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox while also trying to skewer Social Justice Warriors.\n\nWhat he actually does, is make his messiest and most amateurish film. The film's message and premise are badly realised and the filmmaking often has the cheap feel of those horrors that reside only in the depths of Netflix.\n\nIf you want bloodletting this will not disappoint. In fact, the excessive brutality and taboo pushing violence is where the film works. These sequences don't do much to save the film though.\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I think the 'haters' were right about this one."

Usually I won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever I see gore.\n\nAnyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. There is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. But for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. I have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. The story was decent, but intentional. You would guess most of the parts. But this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.\n\nIt was totally opposite to 'Embrace of the Serpent'. It was inspired by the 80s Italian film with the similar storyline. The film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the Amazon forest who are now hunted by Amazon tribes. There's already a sequel on making titled 'Beyond the Green Inferno'. I don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends.

Vital and all too human questions are addressed, such as when a fate is worse than death, when the value of a \"cause\" is greater than personal survival or that of people who trust you, what constitutes redemption, what constitutes a morally bankrupt society as opposed to a morally divergent one.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Green Inferno, directed by Eli Roth, is a visceral and unapologetically brutal survival horror film that taps into the primal fear of the unknown. The movie follows a group of naive college students whose altruistic mission to save the Amazon rainforest turns into a nightmare when they are captured by a cannibalistic tribe. While the premise is ripe for a terrifying and thought-provoking experience, the film leans heavily on gore and shock value, ultimately sacrificing depth and narrative cohesion.\n\nThe story centres on Justine (Lorenza Izzo), a college freshman drawn into an activist group led by the charismatic Alejandro (Ariel Levy). Their plan to protest illegal deforestation in the Amazon quickly goes awry after their plane crashes in the jungle, leaving them at the mercy of a native tribe with horrifying rituals. The premise offers potential for a harrowing exploration of culture clash, survival, and morality, but the execution falls flat, focusing more on grotesque violence than meaningful commentary.\n\nLorenza Izzo delivers a capable performance as Justine, effectively portraying her character's initial idealism and eventual desperation. Ariel Levy as Alejandro brings a manipulative arrogance to his role, serving as the film's human antagonist. However, most of the supporting cast are relegated to underdeveloped stereotypes, making it difficult for viewers to connect with their plight. This lack of character depth diminishes the stakes, leaving much of the tension feeling superficial.\n\nVisually, The Green Inferno excels in capturing the foreboding beauty of the Amazon rainforest. The cinematography immerses the audience in the remote and hostile environment, creating an effective backdrop for the horror. However, the film's reliance on graphic depictions of cannibalism and torture often feels gratuitous. While the gore is executed with impressive practical effects, it overshadows the potential for psychological tension or nuanced storytelling.\n\nEli Roth, known for his penchant for exploitation-style horror, channels the spirit of 1970s films like Cannibal Holocaust. While this homage may appeal to fans of the subgenre, it also carries the same pitfalls, including a focus on shock at the expense of substance. The film briefly touches on themes like Western privilege and the dangers of idealism but fails to explore them in any meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, The Green Inferno is a divisive film that offers moments of genuine tension and impressive practical effects but struggles to rise above its reliance on shock and gore. Fans of extreme horror may appreciate its unflinching brutality, but for others, it will likely feel shallow and exploitative. While it succeeds in unsettling its audience, it fails to provide the depth or emotional resonance that could have made it a standout entry in the genre. An unsettling watch for the curious, but not one that will linger beyond its visceral imagery."

Eli Roth is one of those brave folks who are still taking stabs at his beloved sub-genre with the ability to produce a film for a wide release. Roth's The Green Inferno had a lot of people talking but never did take off with good reviews or a cult following. I'll give Roth credit that cannibal movies and scenes are really disturbing for some reason, way worse than when a zombie feeds. However, unsettling gore sequences aren't going to create tone or a creepy atmosphere. More had to be done with character development, finesse dialogue and finer editing. The Green Inferno had none of these attributes and included an unrealistic storyline, laughable poor acting and a lack of mystery. The Green Inferno has its moment's midway through the film but falls totally flat where it should be at its most dynamic."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first 5 minutes are impressive, and at once we are led to believe we have the old Eli \"hostel\" Roth back. The tribes people are savage and authentic and the menacing slaughter of the rain forest by the dinosaur bulldozers fills us with impending conflict that we gleefully realize must end in proper sausage grinding. And then we are introduced to the characters. At this point we are only left to surmise that either Roth is a very, very bad director, got very, very unlucky with the casting, or that he is intentionally causing us to despise the characters so that we will cheer with imminent consumption. Because these actors\u2014and the script\u2014are probably the worst I've ever seen. Suspension of disbelief is about as possible as an non-believer being convinced of the afterlife after watching Constantine. Still, I'm only 15 minutes in, and this review will continue in real time, in true Kiefer Sutherland fashion. Okay, now at the \u00bd hour mark. Non-hilarious shenanigans ensue, such as a dude exposing his wee willy while a tarantula inches ever closer. Can you picture the madcap hilarity as he runs from the jungle to join his 18 year-old friends at the boat on the river? We almost expect him to make a joke about the token hot actress sucking the poison out, but thankfully we are spared this\u2014and yet are perplexed as to why the obvious chain of clich\u00e9s did not occur. Okay, and now after the next 15 minutes. Well, well, well, oh my brothers. Our little collective clan of altruists has succeeded in filming the evil destruction of the rain forest and innocent tribes that live there, by uploading video instantaneously, and so the powers that be have no option but to arrest them and put them back on the plane, where drinking and smoking ensue to never-ending non-hysterical abandon. Oh No! The plane goes down and the fledgling one-dimensional brats are now getting mowed down by poison spears, some killed, some merely inoculated. Let's see what happens\u0085Hawaii. Hawaii is what happens. Though the cannibal natives and the scenery and cinematography were once plausible they are now bereft with inescapable setting and lighting. We are left with a dull drizzle of Hollywood fakers. At this point, we can't help but to wonder, is it Eli Roth or Uwe Boll? Quentin Tarantino was a master of reinventing the seventies exploitation flicks, personified in the Kill Bill series. Roth fails miserably, unforgivably here, trying to revamp Cannibal Holocaust and the like, making a lover of unadulterated 70's B movies feel something akin to abject betrayal. And yet, the gore scenes at the first native feeding is just enough to make us not turn it off. We must see more. Remember the eyeball popping scene in the first Hostel? It's like that, only better. And more inspiring, we are glad the first feast is the most obnoxious of all the characters. And now the captives are sitting around contemplating their options, as string shoe bamboo shoots that could easily be crushed to pieces envelop them. And of course, the racism, is stewed to perfection, as we are all led to the belief that all indigenous tribes are nothing more than savage primal animals without conscience, empathy, regret or values of any kind. And now we are intruded to an earlier theme: female genital mutilation, as our star token beautiful female hero is now being prepped for this ceremony. What shall her jealous nemesis do to save her? Is there a hidden value or narrative for women's rights at play? Let's continue to watch and find out. Oh No! The natives feed on another captive\u2014a most unpleasant experience. And then for some inexplicable reason Alejandro (said nemesis) starts rubbing one out, thinking the stress relief will somehow immunize him from being picked next for cannibalization. Now we are left with the two escapees, with Alejandro left behind (busting nuts with impunity) as the make their way through the embryonic heart of darkness jungle maze (that is, the symbolic symbolism of how primitive persons are associated with defense mechanisms of civilized entitlement}. Oh No! They caught the two escapees, and now one of them is strung up and being eaten by ants. And the other is once again in danger of female genital mutilation. Will It happen? Hark! The child she embraced with her flute has come to her rescue! And now she runs and runs until she is caught between the militants and the indigenous tribes. And now, our heroine survives, lying to her idealistic gate-keeping class mongers about her treatment."

I know he could have done better. The writing was good, lots of foreshadowing, which was also done by Eli Roth. So kudos.\n\nI went into the movie having seen the \"scene\" that everyone told me about. It came and went and the film didn't shock me again. A bit disappointing on that part. Also the build up to that point was a tad overcooked.\n\nJustine played by Lorenza Izzo the main character did a wonderful job of convincing me she was fearing for her life and body parts. Alejandro played by Ariel Levy was a complicated character that I loved to hate. Just goes to show Eli Roth's storytelling.\n\nSky Ferreira shows the acting range of early Kristen Stewart a bland angst with bad timing on delivery. She set a very negative tone for the rest of the movie.\n\nThe film itself has a bad overall tone. Like my previous review the film wants to be a horror film. This time I finished feeling like the genre was more adventure with gore elements. Watching this makes me excited to see Knock Knock, since it's also written by Guillermo Amoedo and Eli Roth who co-wrote this movie.\n\nVerdict: If you know who Eli Roth is and what his movies are like then you should watch this and compare it to Hostel and Cabin Fever. Average moving going audience though, it's a pass."

Not by yourself, but with a group of friends where you can watch them react to the gruesome deaths, and ridicule the movie as it happens to you, which is the best way to describe how this movie plays out. The experience of watching this movie with a good group of friends is one to remember. Have fun watching the movie with others is what I'm trying to say, because you probably won't have fun otherwise."

Catering to the hypersensitive low intelligence sanctimonious section of the public is something no horror movie should ever do. This one did not. It had a great premise and went with it, bravely.

In this film he uses these tools to bring attention to some of the many issues that the rain forrest faces, and despite the Amazonian people preforming most of the violence it is an not without aggravation. He uses their brutality as a paradox of what large corporations are doing to the amazon.\n\nHe employs colors that compliment each other by ways of extreme contrast which gives a striking image appealing to the eye. There is also some great dialogue in this film that is very reminiscent of the many conversations that I have had with my college roommates and friends. For each character I could cast the perfect person just from my current friends and that is what really allows me to connect to this film.\n\nI am giving this movie an 8/10 because it is a great film that I recommend to everyone. This movie is a true homage to the 1980 Cannibal Holocaust with references to Cannibal Ferox and should be in contention for the best cannibal film of all time."

But if you are interested in jungle tribes, you might want to check out these films: The Naked Prey (1965), The Emerald Forest (1985 based on a true story) and Where The River Runs Black(1986).\n\nThe plot of the film is similar to Cannibal Holocaust. Justine, a college freshman at Columbia University, becomes interested in a social activism group on her campus, led by Alejandro and his girlfriend, Kara. The group plans a trip to the Amazon rainforest to stop a company from logging and obliterating ancient native tribes there; the goal is to film the logging crews with cell phones and stream footage to raise awareness.\n\nThe operation is funded by a drug dealer named Carlos, who takes the group of students to Peru via plane. They arrive in the Amazon and head to a logging site where they begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the loggers cutting down trees. The logger's private militia then arrives on the scene, but cannot seem to break open the chains to get them away from the logging site. The protest receives viral attention on the internet when Justine is almost shot dead by one of the militia officers. The group is then arrested, but Carlos pays the police to let them go. Justine then realizes that she was a pawn: if things went badly, nobody would kill the daughter of a UN attorney. As the plane leaves, it crashes into the forest.\n\nWhat happens next is for you to see and find out. This film contains graphic scenes of extreme nature. I would not allow any one below the age of 18 to see this film. The direction and photography is good and the background sound-effects are professionally handled. The cast is also decent, Lorenza Izzo being the principal character of the film as Justine. Director Eli Roth has made many other cult horror films: Cabin Fever(2001) and Hostel(2005)."

Once captured, they must try to escape from the cannibal native tribe members. This movie is very graphic and gory, like the Saw movies. I recommend that you watch this only if you are a Horror fan/Eli Roth Fan. I felt a bit scared and disturbed during some parts, this is a movie that is not for everyone; but it worked for me. The photography is good, the acting is top notch and the special effects, makeup and costuming are all done to perfection. The Green Inferno is a lot better than the Cannibal Holocaust movie, which I have no plans to rewatch that film. The Green Inferno contains a very simple story, and is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Unfortunately Eli Roth hasn't written or directed his own movies in quite some time. This movie impressed me a lot. I would definitely help Eli Roth out in making another horror movie. He has my utmost support, and I'm a fan of his. For the most part he does a great job. I love the way he scripted this movie. The directing was a little off at times, making some of the scenes over the top. But this movie is a lot better than Knock Knock and I do recommend this movie for anyone who is looking to be scared and entertained. The editing of this movie is great. I'm sure this movie had to be cut down a smidge to get an R rating instead of an NC-17. This is a horror movie that is aimed primarily towards Millennials. Eli Roth did a good job with this one, which is why he's one of my favorite favorIte horror movie directors, writers and producers of all time.\n\nI just want to let everyone know, if you're not a horror fan and you don't like graphic gore, then this movie isn't for you. But it will be very entertaining to most millennials."

I was unsure about the some of the acting but on reflection I think you were simply not supposed to really like many of the characters and I think that this clouded my judgement on their acting performances. In my opinion Eli Roth is a both a great Director and Writer but paradoxically for me because of this I sometimes feel he could do just slightly better.

There will be no spoilers here, I don't think people read movie reviews to find out what happens in the whole movie, that is kind of pointless...I am an Eli Roth fan, and I think this movie is well done, for what they had to work with. Yes, the story is a little slow in the beginning, but I think it sets the stage for how much you either like or dislike the characters and justifies what happens to them in the end.\n\nI really liked the commentary on the DVD, it helped to understand a little more of how hard the filming was and what they had to go through.\n\nThis was my daughter's first foray into cannibalism, lol, and she cringed a lot...although this is not the bloodfest of Cabin Fever, it is still done well. I think it is worth a watch for any cannibal fan, we all know there are some pretty bad films out there, lol, and this was not one of those! I recommend watching it once and then rewatching it with the commentary on!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Green Inferno is something special, it feels like a breath of fresh air when you see the huge number of all those supernatural horror films that come out. I am just going to come out and say that if you expecting a movie that has all the \"essentials\" of a great movie you are going to greatly disappointed! Are you people serious? Do you really expect great acting, a deep plot and well established characters from a cannibal movie? The shock value was pretty much the star of Cannibal Holocaust but no one today gives the movie backlash for that, but when it happens with this movie, people get outraged because they didn't get their OSCAR worthy horror film! This movie has wonderful cinematography, a decent if not always present story, and some pretty awesome gore! The first scene with the cannibals is one of the most intense and gruesome scenes I have seen in a LONG time! This movie is extremely entertaining, I was never bored at any time in the movie. Much like Hostel, it takes quite a while for the good stuff to start, but when it actually starts, it's so worth the wait! If I can say I had a complaint at all with the film, it's 2 things, the ant scene and the scene with the girl having diarrhea. The CGI on the ants was pretty bad, and the diarrhea scene was just unnecessary. Overall, if you are looking for the Oscar worthy film that many people here on IMDb were expecting to get, don't even bother watching it because you will be pretty angry! If you are just looking for some simple trashy entertainment, The Green Inferno will make you pretty happy!\n\nThe Green Inferno is a fun experience and I give it a 9/10"

After 30 minutes however, I was sucked right in. Everything suddenly became better, and I was experiencing the horror of everything with the people who were right there. After seeing it I realized the film was rather unique. The screenplay, the music, the behaviors and acting, the lack of subtitles and dialogue from the natives, everything was a very unique experience. I left horrified and you will to, beware ! I would compare this to the blare witch, a low budget project which proved to be a success."

Here, we get Roth staging privileged Columbia kids against vague, movie-ish South American geopolitics, with them first relying on their first-world- ed-ness to intervene in deforestation and then finding that first- world-ed-ness no big thing when they run into a tribe of cannibals.\n\nAs a work in the genre, Inferno's subject to some imperialist charges in terms of depiction, but his fantasy isn't one of imperialism but instead one in which imperialists are punished. And punished they are here! People are drawn and quartered, darted, shot with arrows, plane-crashed, etc.\n\nThis thing has a 50% on RT right now and a 5.0 on here which is pretty much a joke. This is better than many of the films you'll find in critic top-fives at the end of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched this yesterday here in the Philippines. I was following this movie ever since I saw a trailer for it I think in 2013. The movie sets off with a group of college students wanting to disrupt deforestation works in the Peruvian tropical forest, however something goes wrong and they land in the hands of a cannibalistic tribe.\n\nThe story telling is very realistic, as this could really be a reality and indeed if you google it, there is a certain island/tribe in the Indian Ocean where a tribe resides whose members kill any visitors.\n\nThis film just uses practical effects with exception of 1 scene and thus comes over as very convincing. It had good laughs several times and I wouldn't call this movie a \"gore\" or even R-rated movie, even though there is a certain shock value. It also has a nice plot twist at the end and interesting mid-credits scene that makes you anticipate a sequel.\n\nAll in all, it was an entertaining and chilling ride. Having this watched in the Philippines, I think the viewers could somewhat relate to the style of living of the cannibals as they had quite nice huts and social system where the elderly women keep themselves busy and where young kids are taught how to go about various chores or handy works. And truth to be told, those old ladies also could pass as Southeast Asian, sometimes you can't really tell the Southern American and Southeast Asian tribal/aboriginal people apart. Even the singing of the old women while they go about their things is similar to here in the Philippines and the kids could pass as Filipinos as well.\n\nAt any rate, the cinema was quite full and I think especially for people living in tropical countries or emerging countries, being confronted with having their natural resources exploited by money hungry global corporations and careless governments, this movie is very interesting. Definitely an eye-opener to other cultures and how wrong things can get when a superior civilization enters a feudal/tribal one.\n\nI am giving this a 9 out of 10 because the only thing I disliked was the picture quality. Even though it's screened digitally, some shots containing wide angles where a bit blurry and not sharp and I also wonder why the tribal people where all in red. It might be to make them look scarier, but with the mostly green background (trees, grass) in the village, my eyes hurt about from the color contrasts. But that's purely something aesthetic, go watch this movie if you want something refreshing aside from the usual Avengers or Marvel blockbusters."

        "review_detailed_main": "You get it all! There is little left un-seen in this movie. You get your token nudity, all the chicks are hot and so much gore and violence in general it will make you glad you were not there. I personally hate most activist groups and the like so watching them get potentially slaughtered and such was just an extra plus! The characters are believable and the acting is well done! The script is solid as well as the story line. This is in my opinion one of the best horror films to date and after watching it a few times now I honestly can say WELL DONE TO ALL! I cannot believe it gets such a low IMDb rating! What goes the extra mile here is that in so many other films done in this style (Cannibal Holocaust) with the same basic plot leave out details and backstory. This does not do so, you see every characters motives and thought processing, values and such. There is no thinking \"Hey they would not have done that\" or \"What the fxck are they doing?\" Nope, this is all done without overfeeding the audience such as the US version of Let the Right One In (which I would watch 10 times before watching the US Let Me In again.... which sucked in my opinion). It is a fine line of over doing things and subtly letting the audience know what is going on. This is done VERY well in The Green Inferno of not assuming we all are stupid and need a line scripted to let us know the non-verbals where we should have caught on such as the US version of The Girl with the Red Dragon Tattoo's line \"I hope you like anal sex.\" The french version implied it very well and no actual verbal cue was needed. I could go on about Let Me In doing the same thing but will not since one could go on quite literally all night about such since there were SOOO many of them in that flick particularly. It is insulting and actually makes me angry that directors do this assuming people need such literal cues to catch on to things that they should just understand. So, with this film it was very refreshing that they let you infer such things as lesbians and that certain characters met an ill demise with no line like \"Oh they ate _____\" no we all are not stupid and can pay some attention to cues you film without the need of spoon-feeding. The ending left me a bit puzzled as to what was said in the interview of the main character. I suppose the sequel may explain since if you watch the credits there is a set up extra scene there. So again, this movie was well done and very well filmed/edited. This is what really puts it apart along with actors and actresses that can all sort of act well. Great job to the special effects people and overall although a stressful thing to produce in a taboo subject matter that will make most not like it etc. this is a gem! If you like gore and slasher films and are a classic horror movie type of watcher this is for you! It is much better than the crappy re-makes everyone is pumping out nowadays such as Evildead and Halloween - both of these re-makes I would have paid not to have seen but out of some misplaced curiosity from the great originals I watched anyway in dismal disgust. It is NOT just a Cannibal Holocaust re-make! We have something much much more useful here people! I doubt it will ever get the credit it deserves as a film in this genre due to it's subject matter. That being said though, it is a VERY under rated film with everything in place put into a believable situation with believable characters in a believable story line in great HD filming with believable special effects and it is edited great also which really does set it apart since most films of this subject or similar types lack in many of these departments. It also does a great job of driving home the abuse of female mutilations that third world countries actually do (those of us who are slightly studious and know a little of the world other than our own backyard will note these things are not made up) but again, due to the subject matter it is easy for most to look away in disgust and dismiss things rather than face them head on in the light of day so I doubt it will be credited for that either. Great job on so many fronts of un-pleasantness and taboo subject matter! Well done I can not say this enough! Scary, gross and very real feeling!"

The indigenous tribes are depicted cannibalistic and their portrayal adds to the tension. A gripping movie which surely doesn't deserve the all hate it has got until now. Go watch it if you are truly a fan of survival genre.If only you got the strength in you to watch gory killings because the scenes will be visually disturbing.

They successfully stage a planned protest over deforestation but the trip quickly takes a dark turn as they find themselves stranded with the local Amazonians.\n\nThe movie delivers its gory action in spectacular fashion. It also has a couple of unexpected character plot twists. The movie's primary knock is its slow start. There are also some oddly timed gag-humor moments. Ultimately, the ending is controversial but one that certainly draws a reaction. For those that can stomach the tough scenes; it's a must-watch."
