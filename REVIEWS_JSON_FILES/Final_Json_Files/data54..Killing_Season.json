        "review_detailed_main": "I was expecting to despise this movie. I only watched it because I was in the mood to see a bad De Niro movie, so the one where he's opposite Travolta playing a Serbian seemed to fit the criteria perfectly. But I was actually on board for the first 15 or so minutes of Killing Season. De Niro's character is off in a cabin isolated from his family and still recovering from the effects the Bosnian war had on him however many years ago, and Travolta's character is out for vengeance because he was left for dead in the same war on the opposing side. It's a simple enough premise. And there's one interesting scene where De Niro and Travolta are drinking and sharing war stories where you actually feel some tension but mutual respect building between them. Kind of like Pacino and De Niro in Heat (a blasphemous comparison but it's the first thing that came to mind). Anyway, I wanted more of that.\n\nBut as soon as that's over, the movie turns into a cat-and-mouse game between the two of them that consists of one of them getting captured and tortured, then they somehow escape and the chase continues until the other guy gets captured and tortured, then they somehow escape and the cycle continues. It's just dumb and predictable. And let's talk about the accents for a minute. Travolta doesn't even have a bad accent. Mind you I don't know how authentic of a Serbian accent it is, but the accent itself is convincing enough. The problem is that he uses the same intonation for everything he says. At one point he's literally shot in the f*cking face and the next minute he's talking in exactly the same tone as before. And De Niro does this southern accent that drifts in and out, and you can tell he's just there for a paycheck because he's not even trying to pull it off convincingly. Hell it was more believable in Machete. And the special effects, holy god they're awful. They'll randomly cut to a close up of a wound and it just looks terrible. It's gratuitous, and I don't mind gratuity all that much but when you can clearly tell something is CGI, there's no excuse for that to make it in the final cut. It's unnecessary, it looks like crap, get it out of there.\n\nSo yeah, I ended up disliking the movie but not for the reasons I was expecting. Travolta's accent wasn't the worst part of the movie like I thought it'd be. The story was quite interesting but it gets resolved in the most half-assed way, like there's absolutely no pathos when there so easily could have been seeing as how it's about two opposing war vets encountering each other after all this time. I mean, it's not a terrible movie. It really isn't. De Niro has had much worse, so has Travolta. But there are glimpses of potential all over this movie that get squandered in the dumbest possible ways, and that itself makes Killing Season a frustrating watch."

If this was directed by John McTiernan as originally planned, this would have been a great movie. Sadly, instead we got the guy who did Daredevil and he once again delivered a bland, uninspiring product. Acting is OK, Travolta did his best to hold a consistent accent (it was the wrong accent, but hey!) throughout the movie, while DeNiro looked more like he was only concerned with the paycheck.\n\nAll in all, the movie is not terrible, I guess it wouldn't kill you to watch it if you have nothing better to do for an hour and a half. The sad part is that this could have been a much, much better movie, perhaps even a classic."

Despite it not being great, I really liked it for what it is. It's supposed to be a thriller with two war veterans and it's just that. It's nothing ingenious but it's a totally decent movie that would be a 6.5 in my book.\n\nTravolta was good, De Niro is always great cause I adore him as an actor! The action was as much as I wanted, the scenes of the fighting were really realistic and kept me at the edge of my seat. Even this back and forth thing that one was freed and the other was freed and so on and so forth, was nicely done and was not tiring.\n\nIt's a nice rental for a relaxed week night, with some pop corn or a pizza, if you can handle eating with bloody scenes!"

If you lived something from one side or another, the perception won't be the same thus History won't be the same. For me, only one thing was the key, the central element of that movie... hatred! And that my friends, we felt it. It was clear that Travolta saw what happened in a way when DeNiro saw it at the opposite... but when both of them were in that forest, they only were trying to kill each other or for Travolta, trying to admit DeNiro that he has done something wrong. But what is wrong or not? Who are them and who are we to say?\n\nTruth changes with camps and is not universal and Hatred naturally human! That was the guideline in this movie!"

Ultimately, the two engage in a back and forth battle on the countryside pitting wits against wits in hopes of killing one another. The movie has moments of intense action, followed by articulated scenes of survival. Could have been a bit longer with more build up, hence my 7-10 rating. Would have been a 6 had this not been a Deniro-Travolta flick. Cinematography is good, story is to the point, and Deniro and Travolta do what they do."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1995, a UN platoon executes a group of Serbian Soldiers. In the present days, in Belgrade, the Serbian Emil Kovac (John Travolta) that survived to the execution eighteen years before, gets information about his executioner Benjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) and travels to the remote Appalachian Mountain, where Benjamin lives alone, to revenge. Emil meets Benjamin in the beginning of a cat-and-mouse game.\n\n\"Killing Season\" is an awful thriller with shallow and shameful story of revenge. It is unbelievable that a man, traumatized by the cruelties of the war, waits for eighteen years to revenge; pays money for the information of his executioner; travels from Belgrade, in Serbia, to a remote area in the United States of America to kill the man; and after a few minutes talking, they almost become friends. Actually I was expecting that the executioner would invite him to a barbecue in family or to drink a beer. Maybe this drama is the further that Hollywood writers might expect from a traumatized man. The decadent Robert De Niro and John Travolta should consider the retirement or change agent to get better scripts to not compromise their brilliant filmographies. My vote is one (awful).\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Temporada de Ca\u00e7a\" (\"Hunting Season\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all this review focuses on the cinematography and acting of this movie and not its historical accuracy, I am not a judge of that. All I'm going to say is that history has many sides.\n\nKilling Season brings to the big screen the first collaboration of two great actors, Robert De Niro and John Travolta. Both of the actors bring mediocre performances and are basically the main reason that this movie is quite appealing. Travolta's Serbian accent, I thought, was decent enough and quite believable. De Niro's performance was a bit rushed, like he did this movie as a favour for someone, or simply for money.\n\nAlthough overly cheesy and quite violent this film is perfect for thrill seekers who like to see good actors play roles that do not suit them at all. The plot is simple and does not complicate things although I do believe that the flashback scenes were useless to the portrayal of the story. The only thing need said about the plot is that it is a simple \"revenge seeking\" story.\n\nTo summarize, this movie is an adventurous story with beautiful scenery and intense action scenes that appeals for both action and thrill seeking audiences but also to more critically thinking audiences that focus on exaggerated acting performances. Overall I give this movie a well deserved 6/10."

DeNiro and Travolta give average performances, which aren't helped at all by the accents they try to use during the film. Travolta's is painful, the worst part is, someone, somewhere along the line had to tell him it sounded good. DeNiro's southern drawl is nowhere near as bad, but it seems to come and go at different times in the movie, becoming more or less noticeable. KS starts out a little slow but picks up about 1/3 of the way in and keeps a decent pace. The plot is solid, but IMO the script writer didn't hold up his end of the bargain. Either that or Travolta and DeNiro were basically going through the motions with their main motivation seeming like the paycheck they got after the last day of shooting. All in all, the movie is entertaining, if only mildly at some points. It definitely will not win any awards, but it will help you to kill two hours. SKIP THE THEATER, RENT IT"

Disgust is largely because the film until recently was an art now increasingly becoming a cash machine without much thought.

Later, Kovac (John Travolta) meets Ford and they bond. That is, until Kovac announces his true intentions. Kovac was also in that war. Oh, oh!\n\nThis is perhaps the best cat and mouse movie I have seen in a long while. Ford and Kovac take turns at being the cat and then the mouse. This is not meant to be comical, as this is serious business, but cat and mouse is what we have. And, it all worked. At times, Kovac could have easily killed Ford, but didn't. Why?\n\nJohn Travolta, as Kovac, uses a Serbian accent and we get used to it as he does a good job of it. Both Travolta and DeNiro are in their elements in the movie. Oscars? Hmmm..\u0085.. maybe.\n\nFrom time to time, we are shown , I believe, scenes from the actual Bosnian war and they are not easy to see. Also, this is not an easy movie to watch, because there is torture involved, some quite bloody too. I cringed and had to look away more often than I would care to admit. It was like I was there. Oh, the horror.\n\nGood pacing throughout and some exciting action scenes as well. Excellent cinematography including some live and still photography of landscapes - that had that haunting look and feel - when the credits roll. And, the Johnny Cash song (Don't Take Your Guns to Town) played a lot in the beginning was spot on.\n\nThis is the story of the effects of that war on some who were there. (9/10)\n\nViolence: Yes.

Benjamin is now living in a cabin retreat out in the wild some place, photographing wild-life, wrestling with his demons, and dodging his family. The perfect setting for two veterans to \"have it out\", mano a mano, undisturbed by other people and the laws and conventions that govern them in a less secluded or more populated area.\n\nIt's a survival movie with Emil as the hunter and Benjamin as the prey. It's a tough, brutal movie that may make you wince in some places and perhaps unintentionally laugh in others. We've seen movies of this sort before and they are always entertaining --when done well. AND THIS ONE IS. The tit for tat between these two men as they try to get the better of the other seemed \"somewhat bizarre\" to me but engaging. The movie is also made interesting (and more complex) by the fact that both men are likable. So it's not a simple \"good vs evil\" movie where you clearly want the good guy to do away with the bad guy. Speaking of which, John Travolta really does good bad guys. There's always that intimidating sense of \"crazy dangerousness\" lying just beneath their surface. Good accent in the movie too. This is an entertaining movie with likable leads.

De Niro was good but not as good as in The Heat, and Travolta was way out Pulp Fiction.\n\nThis not anti-Serbian propaganda, because historical facts are telling us that Serbia is the aggressor. Serbia has a lot high ranking government officials tried for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, it also has high ranking military officials tried for the same crimes.\n\nMaybe 200.000 casualties is not the precise number but it is not far from that since there is no precise number of death toll in Bosnia, some reports are saying that there are more than 115.000 dead, so it can be even 200.000.\n\nWhat really pisses me off is that we all know that 40% of those killed there were Bosnian Muslims so how come that this cannot be called a genocide??!! So as for closure the movie was good, lacked a little bit of acting but it was worth watching it."

Thats just insane.\n\nMy home town had survived some heavy stuff, i could say that attack on police precinct was just as film from 70's.\n\nBut my god, please, let just put it all a side, and say that it was insanity, lets be friends, and move on...like that joke De Niro told at the end.\n\nActing OK, as if i doubt it with those two. script heavy crap, Locations beautiful.

The movie borrows ideas from \"Deer Hunter\" (1978) and \"Deliverance\" (1972), even from the western \"Run of the Arrow\" (1957).\n\nBasically, it's an anti-war movie, with interesting psychological study of impact of war on warriors involved in a combat, here shown from a prospective of two enemies who continue their personal war, long after it ended.\n\nThe project was originally set in the 1970s and titled Shrapnel. It was later decided to be put in a modern warfare, the one in Bosnia. So, the movie brings universal message which could be applied to any war and war veterans.\n\nDo not be fooled about all the negative comments here, because those come from people who do not want to understand the message of the movie. Most of those comments are really hilarious, claiming that the movie is not historically accurate, trying to explain the war in Bosnia from their prospective, forgetting the fact that the film makers never claimed it has been based on a true story, and in fact it is not."

I have never really been a Travolta fan and lately it seems that De Niro is very hit or miss so my excitement was tempered for this one. I have to say I really did enjoy this and the movie kept me interested the entire time. The movie is basically just these two hunting each other in the woods while they try to get inside the head of the other and try and understand why this is happening. The only real problem with this is that when Kovac catches Ford he lets him get away and vice versa so it gets a little repetitive but that doesn't really detract too much from the enjoyment of the movie. Overall, kind of a cross between First Blood and the Killer Elite. I enjoyed it. I give it a B."

        "review_detailed_main": "Killing Season (Rated R) is written by Evan Daughtry (Divergent and Snow White and the Huntsman) and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider movies). The 91 minute 220px-Killing_Season_film_posterfilm stars two of my favorites, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta.\n\nDuring the war in Bosnia, DeNiro (portraying Benjamin Ford) and his platoon stumble on a Serbian soldiers who have decimated a village. They've raped the women and killed the men and children. Taking the law into their own hands they form a firing squad and take-out the opposing soldiers, shooting them in the back of the head. Travolta's character (Emil Kovac) is one of those Serbian soldiers. Only he was left for dead.\n\nAngry, Kovac spends his life trying to track down the American soldiers responsible for the firing squad. Ford is a recluse. His marriage went to hell after the war. He barely knows his son. He lives in the mountains in a remote cabin and lives off the land.\n\nWhile on his way into town, Ford's Jeep breaks down. Kovac, posing as a hiker on vacation, assists Ford with getting the Jeep started. They go back to Ford's cabin and share dinner, and talk. Before long, it is clear that Kovac is there seeking revenge. Throughout, the two go at each other, back and forth. First Kovac has the upper hand. Then Ford. The torture they pour out is barbaric, and intense. (It almost is comical the cat-and-mouse game, if it weren't so brutal).\n\nBasically, Kovac wants a confession. Ford wants to leave the past in the past. It seems like the only way this will resolve is if one of them dies \u2014 and they way they go at it, death seems highly likely!\n\nKilling Season was . . . good. I enjoyed it. It could be because of the actors, though. I am not sure. I do know I did not play with my phone during it. It held my interest. I could not wait to see what would happen next. It was neither actor's best film, not by a long shot. But it was solid for a thriller. The story was interesting. Seeing each soldier's different point of view was interesting. I give Killing Season 7 out of 10!\n\nBest Selling Zombie Author Phillip Tomasso\n\nhttp://www.philliptomasso.com/"

The movie may not be accurately based on facts; Travolta's accent kinda sucks (but he seemed to give it his best shot and stayed in character throughout the film); it may not be their best movie, etc... But the movie wasn't a huge let down either. It was entertaining and is worth a watch. My husband and I were both entertained and it was good enough to pass the time without any fast-forwarding. No, it's not going to win any awards, but most of the poor reviews are from people outside the US and they are probably more aware of the point in history (and actual facts) that this movie portrays.\n\nIf you watched \"Phantom\" and sat through it criticizing the fact that no one even TRIED to have the appropriate accent, or that some of the historical facts were \"blurred\", then you probably won't like Killing Season. However, if you can go into this movie without expecting accuracy and just watch it for entertainment, then you might enjoy it! We did!"

With Travolta it is ridiculous. The second mistake is the screenplay. The elaborate 'discussion' of a former war criminal is just not believable and the need for apology is stupid.

Travoltas character (Emil Kovac) travels to the United States seeking revenge against the U.N. commander (De Niro) for atrocities committed by his troops against the Serbians. What follows is two heavyweights slugging it out with reckless abandon, each gaining the upper hand and both being knocked to the canvass on numerous occasions. Who will prevail in this intensely physical and psychological warfare being waged by the two old enemies? Will it be the last man standing or will they reach some kind of compromise and lay down their weapons? Travolta did well and was almost unrecognizable in this improbable role and DeNiro showed at the age of 70 he is still a force to be reckoned with."

I have not yet been studied the director past of this \"masterpiece\" because it is virtually impossible for someone so bad to get the money for shooting any kind of movie. Yet the director not only got the money but also the actors who deserve attention ... what is happening??? The director of this debacle, to put it mildly, did not even try to find the original Serbian name for the villain. He is, without knowing geography and history (close and distant), used the Czech of the Emil Kovac??? But for Christ's sake is just enough if he punched in the Google.com: \"Serbian names\" and to got the right name that sounds at least Serbian! Serbian accents, on the other hand, which Travolta trying to copy sounds more like accent of a retarded and drunken cowboys after a night spent with a oldest cow from his herd in the desert. A plot of the movie absolutely belongs to the genre of science fiction, because it has nothing to do with this planet. The plot its even worse than the plot of Angelina Jolie so-called movie \"the land of blood and honey\", which was virtually impossible to outperform in the stupidity and bad acting, but that's just happened, Mr. Mark Steven Johnson made a worse movie than Angelina Jolie . What I do not understand is Mr. R De Niro as a great actor, takes part in a movie that will haunt him for the rest of his career. It reminds me of a retired world champion boxer who returns to the ring to earn a few bucks more and then be beaten and run out of money and friends (maybe a good idea for a future film that Mark Steven Johnson needs to direct with De Niro in the lead role). As if someone had put a gun to his throat and forced him to act here ... Who knows maybe is that just the case? Totally disappointing and an insult to all those who love movies and who loved these actors when they had more pride in acting."

He could have put on some Arabic clothing and acted as a sheik for his acting talents.\n\nLike others said, this started out fairly decent, then quickly went off the deep end.

If they actually knew how inaccurate and ridiculous the script is, how sadly inadequate most of the props and background will be, would they accept it (even though I know the $$$ offer must have been saucy). Clearly a commercial, generic movie but does a superstar the likes of De Niro and Travolta really need the cash that much to allow himself to associate with this piece of garbage, let alone be the main reason people all over the world watch it. The saddest thing about it is a vast majority will never learn how idiotic this production is. The Serbian language doesn't sound like that at all and you can see from the very start that the movie is such a failure the only purpose it may have is to either enrage those that actually know how it should all look and sound, what happened, when, where and how... or make them laugh at this insanely flawed production. As for those who have no clue, the purpose is to yet again glorify the malefactors of the American government and their puppet masters who, in reality, fabricated, orchestrated and made sure that yet another \"divide-and-conquer\" war scenario is actualized."

In fact the systematic killing of Muslims were biggest after Jews in WWII in Europe, but all the ignorant from Europe and their supporters has to come and give some negative reviews about the historical facts and how this and that never happened there. I have seen so many newspaper reports, videos and heard the stories of survivor how they rounded up all the men in villages of Bosnia and killed them and how they took all the young women to use them as sex slave and to work for them 24/7. I challenge everyone to prove this wasn't happen in Bosnia and I will provide the evidence. Where were all these ignorant when some fictitious movie about some event in WWII like Defiance and Inglourious Basterds which were far from reality got more than 7 star ratings, why all these Euro Trash don't criticize then and why the movies about Vietnam War depict anything but reality gets more than 7 stars. If those movies are not historically accurate and get 7 stars then why all these Euro ignorant give movies like Killing Season and In the Land of Blood and Honey bad ratings. Yes, when it comes to movie making in order to present as drama they make some changes and don't stick to 100% accuracy historically. All these ignorant questions about the historical facts which happened just 20 years back in the modern age of internet and aerial photos which and technology. But same ignorant never questioned about historical accuracy about something happened about 70 years ago when there was no internet or aerial photography or any advance technology. When it comes to this movie, well of course I am bit disappointed with the way Travolta act, of late his acting skills are repeating and boring. De Niro gave great performance. Overall, this movie is good with few missing Historical facts, but this could be a great movie, a 5.1 rating is not justified when crappy movies like Inglourious Basterds got 8 rating."

I definitely agree with people when they say this film wasn't a 10 star blockbuster but also disagree with the ratings of 3 or below. I believe De Niro and Travolta performed as well as they could with the script that was provided.\n\nNicolas Cage was to be Benjamin Ford originally but was replaced by De Niro, I think i would have expected Cage to lower the standard of this movie a lot if he actually was cast in the end.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the film was Travoltas accent. I mean it could have been a lot worse but it still was noticeable. I think casting a actor with a genuine accent would have been the smartest bet. After all De Niro would have been all it took for me to watch this without Travolta in it at all.\n\nI'm not familiar with the war at all so can't comment on any of the accuracy of it or any faults they have with it.\n\nThe main part of the movie with the cat and mouse chase through the woodland around Benjamin Fords home was very suspenseful not know what the outcome of there very own war of revenge. The couple of torture scenes may be hard to watch by some people as they are quite graphic. Apart from the accent issue i enjoyed the movie. The story was there and the actors defiantly were. Maybe the script could have done with slight tweaking but if you can overlook that then you will enjoy it. 5.5/10"

The fact he even travelled to learn more about the war is a noble thing.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact, that the movie has some major issues. For some maybe even pacing issues. But having a heavy weight like De Niro in there helps the proceedings movie along quite nicely. It's tough to find and walk the thin red line in the blame game, but again the movie tries.

De Niro and Travolta performed well together and told an interesting story of coming to terms with the past. Some parts were anticipated but all in all the overarching plot plays out like it should. The more gory scenes particularly stood out as parts of Killing Season I enjoyed, even if some of the movie's ideas are a little far fetched. Definitely give it a try. - Spencer"

He and De Niro play well off of one another, and it's a shame that the script isn't up to their level.\n\nUltimately 'Killing Season' tries to marry both Hollywood and art house sensibilities, but the result is a bit like trying to connect a Lego to a Lincoln Log."

I am more than willing to look past historical inaccuracies, phony accents, and logical problems in a story if the story is strong enough. But here it is just the other way around: if you force yourself to overlook the flaws you are basically already too busy to actually watch the movie.\n\nAs an example, the much-berated accent is not that bad in itself (I cannot validate Serbian) but it is not believable simply because the guy talks like Joe average with a weird pronunciation (cultural references included - I have to ask myself: where and how did he learn them?).\n\nAnd then those little things: the pitcher of lemonade magically fills itself. The protagonists seem to be faster on foot than when driving a car.\n\nConclusion: Nobody involved in the making of that film seems to have cared very much about it, so why should you."

The casting hold much promise because of this star combination. Now is the film worth their names on the marquee?\n\n\"Killing Season\" tells the story Serbian ex-soldier Kovac (John Travolta) goes to America to seek out Ford (Robert de Niro), who was one of the US soldiers who executed Serbian soldiers back in 1995 when NATO intervened in the Serbian invasion of Bosnia.\n\nThis film is basically a revenge tale, but this was hyped up several notches because of the extreme torture scenes they want us to see. It becomes a game of alternating one-upmanship on who is torturing who, until the climactic confrontation scene.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is not too good, despite its cast. Or could the problem be BECAUSE of its cast.\n\nRobert de Niro seemed so bored doing the film. His acting was not convincing or as potent than when he was at his prime. He even looked too old to play this character Ford. When I found out that de Niro actually replaced Nicolas Cage for this role, now I understand why this character was written this over-the-top way.\n\nJohn Travolta was his usual hyper-sinister character we are used to seeing him in when he plays the villain in a movie. His accent was as thick as his goatee, both were atrocious. Actually, I would give him credit for being more restrained here when compared to the previous extra-psychotic bad guys he had portrayed before.\n\nI guess this lackluster story and ordinary execution are the reasons why this film is not receiving the attention that an unprecedented de Niro- Travolta pairing deserves. As directed by Mark Steven Johnson (who had previously directed mediocre action films like \"Ghost Rider\" and \"Daredevil\"), the events were rather predictable as they unfolded. There could have been more suspense and tension, but that was unfortunately not the case. What a waste. 4/10."

What could be an ultimate showdown of two acting titans with a storyline that closely follows \"The Most Dangerous Game,\" unfolds into abysmal exercise of nonsense, and thoroughly disappoints given its potential.\n\nBenjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) is a former American soldier and a Bosnian war veteran who now lives in a secluded cabin hidden deep in the Rocky Mountains. Emil Kovac (John Travolta) is a former Serbian soldier from the same war, who cannot let go of a particular run in he had with Ford. Finally acting on his obsession years later, Kovac uncovers Ford's location, and decides it's time to settle the score. After finding Ford and concealing his identity and motives from him, Kovac eventually reveals his intentions while out hunting with Ford, setting the stage for a struggle for survival. Kovac hunts his most elusive prey ever, but can Ford turn the tables on his Serbian hunter and make it out alive?\n\nQuickly and to the point, the primary problem is the material, written by Evan Daugherty \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" (2012). The movie promises an exercise in these two soldiers stalking and hunting each other, but ultimately it is nothing more than a series of graphic torture scenes with long-winded monologues, a series of power reversals, in which one gains the upper hand, just long enough for the other to escape. These reversals eventually happens with such frequency that it becomes entirely comical and ridiculous. I was more than a little confused as to why a movie pitting Robert DeNiro against John Travolta was getting such a limited release, but after watching \"Killing Season,\" I completely understand."

So, I won't bother defending it on the accuracy or inaccuracy of it's story. The important thing for me is that the movie is good, real good, and here's why. 1. Its very realistic as far as the characters, action, and plot are concerned. This could be something that could have happened all the way around. 2. It has a simple and yet powerful story that is easy to follow and is very fun. 3. It's cheap and in very good ways. The movie relies on acting and the natural shoot locations to do most of the work and not some special effects wizard to get the job done. It keeps you involved with real people and places. 4.

Which I'm sure someone else will go ahead and do w/out my help.\n\nAs for the movie, well it's a pretty good movie. Thought it was gonna go the gross-out route for awhile but turned out to be a well paced flick. I saw someone mention The Hunted or whatever, that movie w/Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones corpse. Aside from some general similarities I wouldn't bother comparing them. Though I didn't like The Hunted a whole lot either. They are both similar in that they are mainly about two soldiers that try and kill each other in the woods. As I recall, Tommy Lee Jones was supposed to have been the other guys teacher or superior officer, which at least slightly accounted for the age difference. Here, they don't even bother w/that. You're supposed to accept that Robert DeNiro and Travolta fought in the same war together. Well, maybe DeNiro's character was supposed to be an officer. Didn't look like it, but I was probably so distracted by the young soldier that had DeNiro's CGI'd 60yr old face plastered on it.\n\nBasically, it's a good movie that is horribly miscast. Which is especially a problem when they're really the only two people in the movie for any appreciable length of time. Accents are tough, and people are overly critical, but in this movie they're just ridiculous. I've had a hard time taking John Travolta seriously in anything since Broken Arrow and Face Off and all that other horrible schlock. Maybe he did do a good accent (at least he uses it consistently) but he comes off sounding like FPS Russia with a head cold or something. DeNiro throws a little \"southern boy\" accent in every once in a while, but it comes and goes about as often as the arrows in Travolta's quiver (12,3,5,2,3....never stays constant).\n\n(Haha, I said I wouldn't compare them then I went ahead and did anyway. Maybe my ex was right....)\n\nSo, if u can swallow that Clint Eastwood and Seth Rogen fought in the same war together, than you'll be fine w/this movie. It's a good movie if you have the mental energy to block out...well, how the actors look and sound...then you'll be fine. I'm glad they did it so that I can watch the remake in 4 years and enjoy that."

        "review_detailed_main": "What's happening with the people when the grow old? Morgan Freeman is spitting at his great career going to Srebrenica and listening only one side, Muslim, and declaring Serbia (which has nothing with it) as the genocide country. And, what is more interesting, de Niro, who was in Serbia, who was fed and welcomed here when he was young, by Serbian people, who loves Novak Djokovic, made this anti Serbian movie???? INCREDIBLE. Hollywood is really consistent. Serbs must be the bad guys and that is it. Nothing will change forever. 1. It is so interesting how Hollywood is IGNORANT. Does anyone there has one brain cell? The main, Serbian character has named EMIL KOVAC. So stupid. Emil is a MUSLIM name. KOVAC is a Croatian surname. And the beard he wore (John Travolta) is not Serbian style, it is more Muslim extremists one, that people are called WAHHABIST, the most fundamentalist current in Islam, they call it the origin of terrorism. Their members has that kind of beard without mustaches and they wear bermude (short pants). They still have their camps in Bosnia. And they are very active there. Of course, nobody cares about that future source of terrorism. Muslims are American pets. 2. How come that nobody asked WHAT THE US ARMY DID IN BOSNIA? As far as I know, America wasn't a part of the war??? How come that they fought at the side of MUSLIMS??? Even if they were part of the peace corp (which is NOT THE CASE), they didn't have a mandate to fight Serbs. And, in the film, they EXECUTE Serbian 'war criminals', they shoot them in the head, while they are kneeling in front of them? WHAT? So, this is the confession and proof that the USA WERE ON THE SIDE OF MUSLIMS. British general Rose, who was a peace core member, says that British SAS units (??? what did they do in Bosnia???) killed some Serbian patrol in 5 seconds. And he was bragging how he fought Serbs, instead to keep peace and be objective, not to fight any side. 3. I am really tired of accusations that Serbs killed other nations, and that other nation were just victims. There are war crimes at ALL SIDES. But Hollywood and the West sees only Serbian crimes. How come it doesn't remember that Mujahedins, the member of 'El Mujahedin', cut Serbian heads by swords?? That Muslims had so many camps for Serbs? That even so poor citizens of Srebrenica killed many Serbs in that Srebrenica and the other villages near Srebrenica and they were Serbs? And nobody was convicted for that? Hello! Did you hear this Mr. Morgan Freeman?\n\nMovie is dull. Movie is full of unnecessary violence, and they take turns who will held bigger gun and had the power over the other one. C\n\nConclusion. LIVE US ALONE! Serbs are not the only one who made war crimes, jerks! LIVE US ALONE. And you ask us why we love Russian? That's why. They consider us as a normal people. Not as the animals."

In comes Travolta who plays a tormented Bosnian vet, traveling to the us in search of De Niro to settle an old score.\n\nWhat follows is a cat and mouse game between both men, with no holds barred.\n\nThe producers didn't shy away to show explicit violence, sadism and even torture.The script made it difficult to draw the line between good and evil and leaves all to the viewers own imagination.\n\nAs usual De Niro is good, but he should stick to comedy films, once he started that. Travolta is surprisingly convincing as the Bosnian vet and almost impossible to recognize him during his first scenes.\n\nIs this a war movie ? No. A morality film ? No. Then what is it ? Well in my opinion it was an excuse to show explicit violence because that's what it's mainly about, meaning: who can inflict the most painful wounds ?\n\nIs this a movie to recommend ? Not in my opinion, unless you kick on torture scenes. Both actors deserved a better script, although both do their best in giving a believable performance but had to face a crummy and thin script.\n\nTo put SOME humanity in the story, there is little subplot involving the baptism of De Niro's grandson, whom he never saw before, but has no intention of attending.\n\nThe end is unsatisfying and incoherent. This could have been a winner if it had a strong script."

I loved watching Robert De Niro & John Travolta as they pull off their bumptious characters with ease, not to mention the latter's accent.\n\nTalking about the Bosnian-Serbian war (of which this is the first movie I watched; don't know if there ARE any movies made on), the revenge factor is taken to a new level. The ire the characters have is justified, but every time the plot stretches to reach their so-called karmic summit, it turns you off. But the next sequence is both predictable & stunning, forcing me to rate a humble 5.9.\n\nMusic is fine, so is the cinematography. A joke in the script which one of the lead characters doesn't understand, truly sparks the message of this action film based on post-war depression & desolation. Respite from implications, it causes bewilderment.\n\nAtheists may love this movie, but driven by a Johnny Cash single, Killing Season is, if not highly, recommended. The action sequences are very well carved into the locations. Humor sustains in the first half while the second half comes pouring down. It spills its guts.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A very watchable movie. And if you don't wanna miss the pair on-screen for the first time and a pretty commendable action film, go for it.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nProfanity: Strong | Nudity/Foreplay: No | Sex: Implied; No Visuals | Violence/Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Strong | Porn: No | Drugs: No"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1992 , the Servian Army invaded neighboring Bosnia , starting a war marked by large-scale massacres of civilians in the name of ethnic cleansing. More than 200.000 people died in the genocide , the most in any European conflict since World War II. In 1995 , American military forces and their NATO allies finally intervened , launching Operation Deliberate Force. Some years later , it is when the story begins, our starring Ford (Robert De Niro) has retreated to a remote cabin in the woods, trying to escape painful memories of war. The drama begins when Kovac (John Travolta) , a former Serbian soldier, seeks Ford out, hoping to settle an old score. The two veterans of the Bosnian War, one American, one Serbian, find their unlikely friendship tested when one of them reveals their true intentions. Both of whom clash in the Appalachian Mountain wilderness.\n\n\u00a8Killing Season\u00a8 tells the story of two veterans of the Bosnian War, one American, one Serbian, concerning a strong battle of wits and physical force between two tough protagonists , both of them holed up in the wet and tangled wilderness of Appalachian mountains , as the outdoors are frankly spectacular , the landscapes have been filmed in natural parks .What follows is a cat-and-mouse game in which Ford and Kovac fight their own personal World War III, with battles both physical and psychological. By the end of the film, old wounds are opened, suppressed memories are drawn to the surface and long-hidden secrets about both Ford and Kovac are revealed, eventually both of whom share a dramatic bond from the past that is unbreakable . Duo starrring with two awesome heavyweights actors playing ex-soldiers suffering dark nightmares from the past are pretty good , though their performances are inferior than other previous films . Robert De Niro gives a passable acting in his usual style as Ford , a former American soldier who is plagued by sinister memories when he fought on the front lines in Bosnia. And John Travolta is enormous as the two-fisted Servian soldier who survived an execution eighteen years before, and nowadays he seeks for vengeance .\n\nIt packs a suspenseful and stirring musical score by Christopher Young , a good composer expert on thrilling and terrifying atmosphere . Colorful and adequate cinematography by great cameraman Peter Menzies Jr. , shot on location in filming locations from Mountain City, Georgia, Stone Mountain , Tallulah Falls, Georgia, USA , Sofia, Bulgaria , and Nu Boyana Film Studios, Sofia, Bulgaria . The motion picture was professionally directed by Mark Steven Johnson , though it has several flaws , gaps and failures . Mark Steven is an American film director, screenwriter and producer. A Fine craftsman who's known for writing and directing the hit Marvel films \"Daredevil\" and \"Ghost Rider\" as well as writing \u00a8Elektra\u00a8, \"Grumpy Old Men\" and its successful sequel \"Grumpier Old Men.\" Later on , Johnson made \u00a8Finding Steve McQueen\u00a8 (2019) , Love Guaranteed (2020) and recently wrote, directed and produced \"Love in the Villa\" (2022) for Netflix. Johnson frequently makes films where the main characters are deranged or lonely people , and usually their parents are either absentee or dead. The father in Jack Frost (1998) comes back to life as a snowman ; in Simon Birch (1998), Joe's mother dies without telling him the identity of his father; in Daredevil (2003), Matt's father is killed by gangsters, and his mother is absentee. Rating : 5.5/10 . Only for Robert De Niro and John Travolta fans."

Once we see Travolta in the woods near DeNiro and they strike up a conversation we get the sense that Travolta knows everything about DeNiro and he's simply waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nThere were many different points where each character simply could have killed one another but they both ultimately decide not too. After a while all these teases simply got boring. In the end this isn't a memorable film and is lacking."

I've red some reviews before writing this one and I honestly don't care about people that put this craftsmanship down . The movie doesn't need to be perfect .

        "review_detailed_main": "Killing Season is not one of de Niro\u00b4s or Travoltas more memorable films, nor is it very original. The film kicks off with an American IFOR unit catching a Bosnian Serb death squad red-handed after an atrocity and summarily executing the serbs. A very late date is given in the film, October 1995, so the incident is completely imaginary as many have pointed out. I don\u00b4t see how this could possibly matter, though. This is not a film about the Bosnian war at all. This is a film about war in general, and the backdrop could be any war. The main body of the film takes place in the present and in the U.S.A. A former adversary comes to face off a troubled former American soldier after some cat and mouse play. As in the similar but much better film Shot Through The Heart (1998) both players are looking for a closure to their agonies rather than simple revenge. In that film the adversaries were snipers from the actual Bosnian war. Another related film would be the Estonian film Mandarines (2013) about the Russo-Georgian war of 2008. De Niro\u00b4s and Travolta\u00b4s characters fight it out in the woods in pretty much classic Rambo mode, but to make things more interesting they also exchange a lot of dialogue that explores their psychological traumas, similarities and differences. The pain they inflict on each other is an extension of the pain they can\u00b4t get rid of after the war. The point of the film is one to take seriously: you can\u00b4t expect to go to war and come back the same. Here it is made by world class actors in a beautiful natural forest setting. Worth watching before you go ethnic cleansing or decide to attack a foreign country."

Also, he looks like Muslim from Bosnia with this beard, not even reminding on Croatians or Serbians. It is worth to mention that Emil Kovac is not Serbian name orcsurname too. DeNiro looks like guy who was interested only in paycheck. Movie story is confusing, not clearly stating that Serbians and Croatians are Christians and Bosniaks are Muslims. All together, 2/10 is more than enough."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I heard there was a film on DVD that starred both Robert DeNiro and John Travolta, I kind of wondered how I'd missed its theatrical release in the cinema. Well, now I've watched it, I can sort of see why.\n\nIt's not bad. It's just not that good. It has all the feel of a B-movie that has somehow landed itself a couple of A-list actors to star in it.\n\nIt starts in the nineties where Robert DeNiro was a U.S. military commander in Eastern Europe. During his service time he was responsible for the (illegal) deaths of a squad of war criminals. Only he didn't kill John Travolta enough and now, several years later, he's tracked DeNiro down to his idyllic mountain cabin in the woods and is out for deadly revenge.\n\nWhat follows is the ultimate 'cat and mouse' chase. And it lasts for about an hour and a half. However, the film's major let-down is the fact that, once it becomes clear that each man wants and has to kill the other in order to survive, it leaves the viewer a little annoyed when they just don't bother. The balance of power shifts between the two so often that they take it in turns to have the upper hand, yet never bother actually killing the other. Yes, I know the film would be over at about the twenty minute mark if one of them bothered to 'off' the other, but it just became a little frustrating after the eighth time one had the other at his mercy, but decided to talk instead of kill.\n\nPlus DeNiro had Travolta's accent to worry about \u2013 sometimes it sounded like he was being stalked by Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Borat' character! But it's not all bad. Accent or no accent, both actors are pretty good (as you'd expect with such A-list weight on board). Plus there are some pretty sadistic moments of gore than really will leave you a little squeamish.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, it's basically one on one and you only really have to skip to the final chapter of the DVD to find out who ultimately comes out on top.\n\nOne for fans of DeNiro/Travolta only, as they do turn in decent enough performances, only the story (or lack of) does tend to let it down a bit and reduce what could have been a classic film into a glorified B-movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "'KILLING SEASON': Three Stars (Out of Five)\n\nRobert De Niro and John Travolta appear on-screen together, for the very first time, in this action thriller directed by Mark Steven Johnson. Johnson has written and directed such critically acclaimed (and fanboy loved) comic book superhero movies as 'GHOST RIDER' and 'DAREDEVIL' (can you detect my sarcasm?). It was written by Evan Daugherty (who also co-wrote the updated fairytale retelling of 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN' as well as the upcoming youth book and comic book film adaptations of 'DIVERGENT' and 'TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES'). Daugherty's script won the 2008 Script Pipeline Screen writing Competition and was heavily sought after (by film producers) because of this. It tells the story of two Bosnian War vets who engage in a violent personal battle, in the woods, when one reveals his plans for revenge against the other (due to a conflict during the war). Despite all it's grade A ingredients the film was panned by critics, most criticized was John Travolta's performance (and the accent he uses). While I agree with the critics about Travolta I did still enjoy the film.\n\nDe Niro plays a former colonel of the American military (and NATO soldier) named Benjamin Ford. He's a veteran of the Bosnian War who now lives alone, in seclusion, in a cabin in the Appalachian wilderness. He's tried to forget his violent past and doesn't see or talk to anyone, including his son (Milo Ventimiglia) and newborn grandson. Emil Kovac (Travolta) is a veteran of the Bosnian War as well, but he fought for Serbia as a Scorpions soldier. Kovac holds a grudge against Ford for something that happened to him during the war (18 years earlier) and has tracked his whereabouts to his current location in the mountains. He poses as a tourist and gets to know Benjamin first before then revealing his real reason for being there. A vicious one on one war ensues.\n\nI found both lead characters to be very interesting and compelling. Their backstory is intriguing and the in-depth look at war (specifically the crimes of the Bosnian War) is very involving. De Niro is very good and likable as the American vet. Travolta's character is written well too but his performance is kind of laughable. The accent is pretty bad and he just comes across as very cartoonish. Other than Travolta though I had no real problems with the film. The action is great (and very intense) and Johnson's directing is perfectly fitting for it. Daugherty did deliver an intelligent and well written script as well and you'd think De Niro and Travolta on-screen together would be one of the strong selling points of the movie too but Travolta is just such a bad actor (at least these days). He used to be a good actor in his past though. Still the movie is worth seeing (in my opinion).\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV24sbHK5H0"

        "review_title": "Less an iconic matchup of two acting veterans than a potential career-killing misfire, you'd be advised to stay away from this suspense-free action thriller",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Killing Season' marks the first time that Robert De Niro and John Travolta are sharing the screen, and especially for those born in the baby-boomer generation for whom either actor are icons, that matchup might be reason alone to catch this thriller. Yet it is precisely because of such anticipation that we urge you to stay far away from this one, for not only is the film one of the biggest missed opportunities, it is also a reprehensibly bad film in itself, and nothing but an utter embarrassment to both of the veterans' acting careers.\n\nEssentially a mano-a-mano setup in the Appalachian mountains, De Niro plays a United States military veteran who is paid an unexpected visit by Travolta's bitter Serbian soldier eighteen years after the end of the Bosnian war. The latter was shot in the back and left for dead by the former back then, and has waited this long to track down his executioner to settle the grudge. As we find out later, Travolta isn't simply out to kill De Niro; rather, he's found God in the years since, and wants his slaughterer to make a true and honest confession.\n\nYes, God is referenced from time to time throughout their cat-and-mouse game, and then invoked repeatedly with the weight of a sledgehammer in the anti-climactic ending which unfolds too conveniently in an abandoned church right smack in the middle of the forest. There's no such thing as subtlety here - not even with its art-house pretensions - and indeed, it's plainly obvious that the religious references are no more than a cheap narrative device to drag out a thinly plotted script.\n\nWhat's more maddening is how it is used to justify the gory interludes in between the hunt - and we might as well warn you that it does get pretty graphic. When Travolta first catches up with De Niro after shooting an arrow through his right calf, he forces the latter to thead a steel rod through and then proceeds to string him upside down. And then as payback, De Niro shoots an arrow that pierces through both of Travolta's cheeks and pins him to a cabin door - not to mention waterboarding him after with heavily salted lemonade.\n\nThe torture is gratuitous to say the least, and thoroughly vexing when executed in the name of guilt, redemption and other philosophising about God. It would have been much more gratifying if writer Evan Daugherty had simply settled for a straightforward action movie between two equally matched foes pitted against each other by circumstance - and yet even on that count, there is little remotely intelligent about the chase that ensues, which ultimately descends into a catch-and-release repetition that is just tedious.\n\nOne can see that boredom written on De Niro's face, who looks miserable and tired most of the time; especially in recent years, the respectable actor has taken on a number of questionable projects that seem only in the service of a paycheck, and this is unequivocally one of those. Well, at least Travolta seems to get a kick out of an over-the-top performance complete with a shaved head and a bizarre Eastern European accent - but though it's a darker role than his usual, he's played bad much better before in Tony Scott's 'Taking of Pelham 123'.\n\nIt remains a mystery therefore why two actors of such calibre would sign on for such a dreadful movie, so lacking in any suspense or excitement no thanks in part too by Mark Steven Johnson's workmanlike direction. What it does manage to hit on the mark are the reputations of De Niro and Travolta, more so given how heavily the movie is marketed on their marquee names. And so consider this a well-intentioned advice for both of their fans - stay away from this stinker, or risk having your love for either one killed by this terrible misfire.\n\n-www.moviexclusive.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "When somebody tells you that John Travolta and Robert De Niro are starring in a film like Killing Season, its hard for a fan to not get excited...then you actually sit down and watch the film. The first ten minutes of Killing Season is so painfully contrived and pretentious that you can't help but feel like the rest of the movie is going to be an absolute bomb...and if you feel like that then you are one hundred percent right. Killing Season is a mere direct-to-video film that could have really been something but instead it relishes in contrived moments between Travolta and De Niro that are so tongue in cheek that you can't really take it seriously, despite the film's intention. De Niro does the best with what he is given and, trust me, it isn't much to go off of. Travolta delivers the worst Russian accent I've ever seen on screen and that affects the rest of his performance because it is so campy and ridiculous that you just can't take him seriously, especially as the antagonist of the film. It is very hard to swallow.\n\nThe fact that this film is direct-to-video and is extremely mindless does not bother me, what does bother me is the action sequences. We have De Niro and Travolta, both of whom are in their sixties, and they are beating the living snot out of one another along with torturing one another for the better part of an hour and a half running time. This isn't The Expendables where you would expect this type of stuff, this is a film that is supposedly wants the audience to be set in a sense of reality and Killing Season represents none of that. In fact, it does not even acknowledge what it starts. By the end of it all, we're left with something so wrong, so bitter and so stupid that you can't help but want to kick your TV in."

I don't know what was harder to get through: Travolta's \"accent\" or the storyline as a whole.\n\nI was cringing when I watched the trailer for this back when it was still not out yet because these two just don't fit their roles. I absolutely adore Mr. De Niro but I don't know why he just isn't trying anymore with his role selection. Mr. Travolta hasn't really disappointed me because I haven't LOVED many of his performances. In the beginning, I wasn't sure how bad this would eventually end up being (although based on how little character development there is I should have suspected) and even though the synopsis gave me an idea of how awful it would be - I carried on.\n\nWithout going into spoiler territory, I can say that right from the beginning I knew exactly where it was going and how it would end. And boy was I right! (not a celebratory moment)\n\nMy final verdict is basically that I just feel sad watching De Niro commit his time and talent to these types of movies. I wish he would go back to doing well worth it films where the story isn't written by Evan Daugherty - whose credits are: Snow White and The Huntsman (utter sh*t, I mean, KRISTEN STEWART IS IN IT) and G.I. Joe 3 (no, not even the first one... which was sh*t, too)"

It's understandable that a man like Travolta might harbor a long-lived grudge against Mr. De Niro, but other than that we have a film about a war that obviously wasn't researched and even before the film started, the outcome was inevitable. Someone once said a good story should have an ending that's a surprise, yet inevitable. This one had no surprise. On the other hand, the chemistry of love \u2014 well, make that chemistry of like a little bit/hate between the two actors was pretty good and the scenery and photography was beautiful. Actors like this sort of film because they (a) get lots of screen time and (b) they get to emote, but a better story line wouldn't have hurt either.

        "review_detailed_main": "There are a lot of movies that come straight to video that feature A-list actors, but for some reason they bypass the theater. More often than not it's pretty obvious why, but some of them are actually pretty entertaining for what they are. The latest Killing Season features Robert DeNiro and John Travolta in a revenge action thriller, but could these two aging stars deliver or will it be quickly obvious why the hunt ended on the shelf?\n\nKilling Season follows a reclusive American military veteran and a European tourist who strike up an unlikely friendship deep in the Appalachian mountains. But when the tourist's true intentions come to light, what follows is a tense battle across some of America's most forbidding landscape proving the old adage: the purest form of war is one-on-one. The story here is pretty simple and works fine for what they are going for despite some lacking historical accuracy in its backstory. DeNiro gives a decent enough performance but never really seems to put forth the ability that we all know he has. He seems to phone it in a bit just giving enough to make it work as opposed making it effective. Travolta does fine and has become king of getting visually into character, but despite a valiant effort his accent throughout the film along with the sometimes silly dialogue makes his performance a bit of a distraction. The opening of the film sets a bad tone as it looks like some low budget straight to TV film, but once you get passed the long drawn out slow paced attempt at character development things pick up a bit. If you can let those things go and just focus on the deadly revenge hunt that makes up the second half of the film it's not all that bad. They never step it into unbelievable territory, but instead allow each of them to have their moments making for some pretty fun old school action. At this point in the film these guys seem to wake up a bit and started having a good time.\n\nThis is far from a perfect film, but for a rental it's really not all that bad. It's a far cry from their past work and hopefully not the end, but it does manage to entertain despite its numerous flaws. The ending is a bit of a disappointment, but attempts to give these characters the redemption they are trying to find, but after everything prior you are wanting so much more. If you like either of these guys and most people do, give this film a chance and just watch it for what it is as opposed to what you hope it to be."

        "review_title": "A strange, occasionally potent mix of torture porn and action thriller, just barely salvaged by but hardly worthy of its stars.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Looking through Robert De Niro's recent filmography is a rather disheartening process. In the past decade or so, he's soldiered his way through over-ripe dramas, unfunny comedies and pedestrian thrillers, with a gem of a film popping up every once in a while as reward for his efforts. One of the grand old men of Hollywood seems deeply intent on working as much as possible, even while the industry that once made full and glorious use of his prodigious talents no longer has any idea what to do with him. It's a shame \u2013 and a trend that isn't, sadly, bucked with Killing Season, an odd revenge drama that flits uncomfortably between the genres of action thriller, horror movie and torture porn.\n\nMany years after the Bosnian War, American military vet Benjamin Ford (De Niro) has retreated with his scars \u2013 of the physical and psychological variety \u2013 to a remote mountain cabin, hiding away from humanity in general and his loving son Chris (Milo Ventimiglia) specifically. Unexpectedly, he makes his first real human connection in a long time with Emil Kovacs (John Travolta), a garrulous ex-Serbian soldier he meets \u2013 seemingly by chance \u2013 in the woods. But it soon becomes clear to Ford that his new acquaintance harbours war wounds too: including a bitterly personal desire for revenge that can only be slaked in a hunting season of his own devising.\n\nThere's a germ of a great psychological drama buried beneath the troubling trappings of Killing Season. Both De Niro and Travolta rip into their roles with impressive levels of commitment: the former constructing a tough-as-nails exterior around a credibly vulnerable man riddled with the doubts and guilt of war, the latter somehow working his way around a thick European accent to lend an air of puzzling charisma to a character with deeply unsympathetic, sociopathic tendencies. It's largely because of their efforts that the film is strangely effective in its quieter moments.\n\nUnfortunately, those are few and far between. Evan Daugherty's script is concerned less with mining emotional drama and more with ramping up the film's action beats and ludicrously dark twists. To that end, Killing Season seems to almost revel in the physical pain and suffering it doles out to both Ford and Kovacs. This is not so much the action-thriller version of movies about post-traumatic stress disorder or battle fatigue, like The Hurt Locker, instead bringing to mind the brutally banal, horrifyingly pointless torture porn that forms the premise of the Saw franchise.\n\nTry as they might, neither De Niro nor Travolta can save a film that doesn't really know what it's trying to be. It takes one too many detours down the torture-porn route to be a truly effective psychological drama, and lacks any of the bite and wit required to lift it out of its more melodramatic moments. At one point, Killing Season was intended as a vehicle to reunite Travolta with Nicolas Cage for the first time since their barmy action smash-hit Face/Off. It says something unspeakably tragic about the final product \u2013 and De Niro's ongoing downward career trajectory \u2013 that the resulting film might actually have been better if it had stayed that course."

He then makes an elaborate blind from branches and pine boughs in a matter of minutes right out in the open. No sooner than he crawls inside two majestic Elk top the ridge in front of him as he gets his camera out. The Elk start to spar until De Niro winces in pain from a, more than likely, war wound sending the Elk running off. I had it, no more of this fake everything. Travolta can't act to save his life and De Niro has given up even trying to act. Put that together with the over the top obvious fake everything and I guess someone had money to just trow away, because that's what happened here with the train wreck at the beginning of the movie.

If one does not suspend their disbelief, then the movie watching experience is a total loss, which explains the many negative reviews attested here for this feature, and others before now and for many others to come in future productions! I could go on about the idiotic Terminator Movies of the late 1980s that were originally made in the nineteen seventies, and how ridiculous those movies were, everyone believed a walking Robot killing machine in our midst in this Century.

        "review_detailed_main": "Killing Season is an action/thriller directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider) which stars Robert De Niro, John Travolta and Milo Ventimiglia. It follows two veterans of the Bosnian War, an American named Benjamin (De Niro) and a Serbian named Emil (Travolta). After Emil helps Benjamin out with some car trouble, he is invited back to Benjamin's cabin in the woods for drinks to say 'thanks'. The friendship however turns stale after one of them reveals their true intentions, and it quickly becomes a case of 'cat and mouse'. Robert De Niro is one of my favourite actors of all time, so it was great to see him back in a more serious role compared to the light and fluffy films he has become accustom to in his later years. Travolta's transformation into a Serbian is partially convincing due to his dark complexion and the thick beard he has grown for the role, but his accent seems a little shaky at times. While this isn't an amazing film and it has received some fairly negative reviews due to its inaccuracies in relation to the Bosnian War, I think its main intentions were to focus on the duel between both men and how the war has effected each man's personal life. I thought it was entertaining enough, but probably won't watch it again anytime soon.\n\nMy Rating: 5.5/10 For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews"

The movie is really, no offense, it's not intended, American. It's like every other 'wanna be serious' Hollywood movie that you can smell a mile off.\n\nTravolta is awful in the movie. His accent is completely wrong which is particularly noticeable in the parts where he speaks Serbian - it's just terrible. I mean, if they wanted him to speak a language other than his own, at least they could've done a better job in finding a decent dialect coach for those few sentences he used.\n\nDe Niro does a decent job, like always, but it's really not significant given the quality of the movie it self.\n\nThe war in Bosnia & Herzegovina was bloody and I have no problems with the story-line, but when an outsider does a movie on the subject, it's just obviously fake. Like Angelina Jolie's directorial debut, In The Land Of Blood And Honey, intentions of people involved were clearly noble, but they just don't really completely understand what it was like to make a movie on it - that's why they use dumb dialog and a bunch of a-thousand-times- seen-before-things to cover the holes, which clearly doesn't work!\n\nIt's not boring and it can be easily used as a time waster, but... Just not good!"

I was surprised for De Niro to act in this roll, because of his love for Serbia and Serbians that he said several times.\n\nI can say that historical facts about the war in Bosnia are false, but that's our destiny for everyone else to make our history as they like.

This film is an absolute must-see for action fans, suspense thrill-seekers, and fans of these talented actors. You genuinely care about both of the individuals, and see the truth in combat.

I was completely fooled with the two big names, I figured, they would simply make Travolta talk as little as possible with that fake accent, and the movie would be a complete hit, but I guess that was not the case."

I wanted to like it alot because it has alot going for it: two great veteran actors, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta, a great setting in the Appalachian mountains in North Georgia, and lots of action and suspense. However, it's faults were too many to overcome. First of all, (and let's get this out of the way, because I'm sure you're all thinking about it), John Travolta's fake Eastern European accent and spray-painted hair was truly awful. At no point in the film was I able to believe that this guy was a real Bosnian unless all Bosnians have a wobbly mumbly drawl, and that's just not true. There are also alot plot holes related to the backstory, the story behind the story, if you will. It just doesn't make sense and to chalk it all up to the fact that the Bosnian war was just downright terrible is not a sufficient enough catalyst for the plot. Travolta's dialogue was also very heavy. He kept talking and talking. Would this guy please just shut up? As well, the violence is appropriate for the story but the decisions made by these two supposed war-hardened soldiers from opposing sides defy logic and common sense. Again, great setting though!"

Unbeknownst to Benjamin, he is being targeted by Emil.\n\nI was full aware of the STD release for this one. I also read a plethora of bad reviews for this one, but I was still quite excited to see this. Robert DeNiro & John Travolta are two of my favorite actors of all time, so I will rush out to see whatever they star in. DeNiro has become the brunt of many jokes for taking so many roles lately. Hell. I've even seen someone say \"He's been Nicholas Caged\" I apologize for the digression here, but grow up! Show some class and respect. DeNiro is one of the finest actors to ever grace our screens and is responsible for legendary roles. To say that kind of thing is abhorrently disrespectful. This movie isn't horrible by any means, but it's not that good. It starts off well enough. I was enjoying the banter between DeNiro & Travolta immensely. As soon as it took a turn for the serious, it became increasingly silly. It has plenty of bow & arrow chase sequences which I felt lacked suspense. It also grew rather tiresome. It got to the point where it felt like they were fighting like two 5 year old's fighting over a Christmas toy. It was just completely juvenile in my estimation. The violence factor is rather strong. I cringed in a couple scenes involving torture. Robert DeNiro is solid, even when he's not at his best. It's always a pleasure to watch him go to work. He was able to be sympathetic as well. I enjoyed his monologue in the finale. John Travolta fares a bit worse. His Serbian accent is OK at best, and I didn't get enough character development with him. His chemistry with DeNiro is good, though. Milo Ventimiglia is barely in the movie. It's a rather inconsequential part. He's basically, somewhat the \"estranged\" son. The ending was not surprising in the slightest, either.\n\nFinal Thoughts: This is a watchable affair. Let's face it. Even with DeNiro & Travolta on an off day, it's still better acting than quite a few others. This is worth a look on a rainy day. It's not as bad as people say, but it's not worthy of talents such as Bobby D & Travolta either. It's not something I'll ever watch again.\n\n5.4/10"

To watch this movie you need to forget what really happened and just enjoy a good revenge story, which is really not that bad. At least it was an enjoyable 90 minutes for me, although I have seen much better movies of both actors. I also don't see it as an anti-Serbian movie at all, since both sides and their crimes are portrayed. If there is a lil message in this, it's more that war at all causes people to do bad stuff for which they have to suffer their whole life. In the end it is just an entertaining movie for me, most important is the revenge thought in this movie, nothing more, nothing less."

Most of the action happens in the US but there are some scenes in Serbia. Travolta does great with the accent and Serbian language. Some bloody scenes so don't take your children to it.

The overall sensation is that someone squirted ketchup over a Disney nature film. The acting must be among the worst performed by De Niro/Travolta - but they are forgiven. One would have to assume that they realised what a load of crap this is and simply didn't bother to put on a performance.\n\nIf you add to the mix that Killing Season, in all likelihood, manages to offend thousands of people who have living memory of the horrors of war - it would be an enigma if Mark Steven Johnson gets funding for anything ever again.

        "review_detailed_main": "Of all the types of American films that are overdone, for me this is the most dreaded: The message flick. Especially since the message is usually \"women can do whatever they want, men don't matter\".\n\nEarly in the film we see with some scenes from the Bosnian war, including a mass execution of a group of war prisoners by some soldiers. Next, we see Deniro back in the states, milling around his log cabin, with segments of him going from one macho routine to the next- chopping wood, cleaning guns, reading by a crackling fire. I am surprised they didn't have a groin scratching while passing gas segment. Travolta shows up after having gotten some info . about De Niro back home in Eastern Europe. Naturally, they have to insert a baby into the film, so we are treated to some nauseating scenes of DeNiro's grandson, complete with that sound when you open a music box. At this point you know DeNiro is the good guy , and Travolta is in for some suffering.\n\nTravolta attempts to engage DeNiro in a cat and mouse war game, but Robert does not want to play until Travolta threatens DeNiro's family; then, SURPRISE, De Niro is out to kick some butt. The problem with the movie , there is no suspense. Once we see Travolta threaten a child, we know he is the bad guy, and that the ending will show DeNiro reconciling with the family, complete with violins . This in spite of the fact that his wife was having sex with his best friend while he was suffering at war. .So the message is - vigilantism is OK even if you are judge, jury and executioner; women can do whatever they want, men don't matter. Leave it to baby obsessed Hollywood to insert a baby into a war flick."

Iv seen a lot of things online yet there are some scenes in this that had me turning away not being able to watch, I recommend this movie, its a nice change this summer to see a movie based on performances rather than CGI, and De Niro is proving he's not to old when it comes to action, he definitely gives as good as he gets in this one :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a US Army veteran that served in Bosnia at the time in question, I was insulted by Di Niro's Ford character. I think if I were a Serb, I'd be even more offended by Travolta's Kovac.\n\nBoth characters commit horrible acts, and neither evokes much sympathy from the viewer, and so it's hard to care what happens to them. Di Niro plays the stereotypical maladjusted veteran living alone in the woods, a clich\u00e9 since the Vietnam War. Travolta's character is even worse, with an accent sounding like Boris from Boris and Natasha cartoons and beard that would be more appropriate on an Amish farmer.\n\nWhat is really distracting is how little the movie resembles the true history of Bosnia and NATO's involvement. In 1995 NATO conducted an air war against Serb held areas of Bosnia, and by the time US ground forces arrived as peacekeepers, we were not liberating concentration camps, getting in fire fights with Serbs, or executing prisoners. We were dodging land mines, searching for weapons, and trying to keep the peace. The Nazi-like scene of rail cars full of bodies was just that \u2013 a Nazi holocaust scene taken off a WWII script and inserted into a more recent genocide. And because it was a relatively recent genocide, you would think Hollywood would show a little more restraint.\n\n(Spoiler alert) The message of the movie \u2013 what little there seems to be of one \u2013 is that all sides do horrible things, but if you throw away your gun and confess your evil deeds while sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere, then you can immediately let go of years of anger, make friends, go home and start making your life right again. Uh huh."

I think those people are missing the point of the movie, which in my opinion was more about the relationship between DeNiro's character and Travolta's than historical accuracy. It's a movie and doesn't claim to be a true story. DeNiro was good as always, and Travolta gets a bad rap no matter what he does. I thought he did a good job, including the accent everyone is so focused on. Have any of you seen him in \"Love Song for Bobby Long\"? The man can act. I also noticed if you keep reading the reviews till you reach the third page, there are quite a lot of people that liked it and gave it 7-10 stars, and said basically what I'm saying, which is it's more of a relationship movie about the different effects of war on people than being about the war itself. Just felt like I needed to put a positive review on here after all the angry sounding \"1 star\" ones."

The thing that I didn't like about the film was that, one minute DeNiro is hostage and then the next minute Travolta is hostage, which gets a bit ridiculous after a while. The other thing is Travolta appalling attempt of a Serbian accent. Anyway, the director really lost the chance to make a decent movie with these 2 veteran actors. You can tell that there both not giving there all and the Rambo style concept in the woods really didn't work. The movie really did show that both characters couldn't have been that good at kidnapping because they kept on getting away from each other. Anyway, I did have high hopes for the movie because both actors have made some all time classics, but this movie won't go down as one of them.\n\nRound-Up: What is going on with Travoltas beard and accent in this movie? Anyway, Travolta hasn't made a decent movie for some time and after seeing his future projects, like the Gummie Bear Movie, I can't see him coming out with anything that good soon. It's a shame, because the man can really act, but he just isn't getting the right movies. He's even starting to pop up in TV series, which is never good for an actors career. As for Robert DeNiro, he just seems to be addicted to working. He seems to be starring in some weird movies like Crossfire and Killer Elite, but he will always be taken seriously in Hollywood. As for both of the stars in this movie, I think that they should just call it a bad day at the office because the takings were appalling and personally, the movie isn't one that I will remember.\n\nBudget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $40,000 (Terrible!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there revenge action thrillers about a Serbian war veteran, seeking revenge. 3/10"

However, one man, Emil Kovac (John Travolta), a Serbian man Ford was meant to have killed, cannot forgive and forget and has hunted him down to his mountain retreat. Initially friendly, Kovac soon has Ford locked in a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\n\"De Niro and Travolta, on screen for the first time ever\", the publicity on the cover for this film proudly booms. That would be a small screen, however, in this neck of the woods anyway, as Killing Season arrived straight to DVD over here, which sort of sets the bells of doom ringing well beforehand. It's still an interesting pair up, though, but it's quite clear this isn't going to have the sort of quality it would have had if it had came out maybe twenty years ago. It actually opens quite well, after the opening shaky camera battle sequence, establishing an atmospheric tension before the lead paths have even crossed, but somehow when they do, all the components of the machine fall apart, and it just descends on a downward spiral.\n\nDe Niro tries to inject his role with some dynamism and gravitas, but you can never shake the feeling that it's another one of his 'pay cheque' roles. Travolta, never the most naturalistic actor, here has a dodgy Croatian accent to carry, along with a silly mountie beard. It's a curious pairing, that doesn't work due to the writing they have to contend with, including an unconvincing meeting, an initial bonding that does nothing to establish any menace or sense of unease, and an unexpectedly reflective and gentle ending that shakes it all up. After all this, you might think the ending would be the best bit, and it is, but in a good way, with some beautiful cinematography of the mountains and a nice, gentle song to go with it.\n\nIt's another real time thriller, meaning it's at least a short affair, but that just shows what a shame it is. **"

First off, Travolta is still angry about his near death experience that happened years ago, so he's out for revenge. De Niro is just old and lives out in the middle of the absolute forest, with a family that's just dying to visit, but continuously refuses. In my opinion, this movie is way too scattered around. The fight scenes were iffy and the ending was no where near good. This really makes me wonder of they just took this job just to get out of the house or something. Both are really great actors, obviously. Yet, it didn't show in this film. I plainly found Travolta annoying, especially with that accent and De Niro was not attachable, which doesn't happen a lot. They were only pretty much asked to play their roles because they are well known and exceptional actors. I would honestly save yourself the headache and time and just avoid this movie. It'll do you great good."

Some of the plot points were a little weak also and Johnny T's accent, while not bad, isn't good enough to make you forget it's John Travolta.

Well, let me solve this riddle and inform you that this isn't always case and Killing Season (2013) is one of those.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this certainly was not a bad movie. But neither was it a particularly good movie. This simply was a movie that seems like it \"didn't happen\". It didn't have a soul, nor conviction. In other words, the movie started and then it ended. 1 \u00bd hours later and there was no meat in-between in spite of some high action scenes. I can't find the right way to describe how this movie missed-the-mark other than it felt like DeNiro and Travolta did a personal favor for a movie- director friend.\n\nKilling Season opened with a disturbing scene depicting some awful events that took place during the Bosnian War. While this scene was quite emotional this could have set the stage for a good plot, especially considering the star talent of both Academy Award winning actors. There was some attempt by the director to create an emotional attachment with the characters throughout the film. Yet in spite of the greatest of Robert and John's acting talent, it just didn't work well for me.\n\nTherefore I can easily summarize Killing Season as this: \"Start movie : Some action here in the middle : End movie\". The movie felt like it wanted to be great but it was just blah. This was a movie that seemed to have great potential so I was a bit disappointed in this under- achiever. If it weren't for Robert and John acting in this film then Killing Season would get a much lower rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "The tagline for his moody, atmospheric, harrowing and insightful films is 'The purest form of war is one on one' and that generally encircles the mood of the film from beginning to end. Written by Evan Daugherty and directed by Mark Steven Johnson this is a small cast film that concentrates much of the destructive impact of war on those who fight it and survive it. Many people seem to expect more from a film than simply viewing how war eats the brain and memory and after-war life, concentrating responses on actors' accents and implausible encounters, but the message is delivered well if you are open to hear it.\n\nKILLING SEASON is the confrontation of two veterans of the Bosnian War, an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 March 1992 and 14 December 1995 and is still remembered for the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns and the violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas endured murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, and deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas. One veteran is American, Benjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) whose life has become one of being a recluse in the back hills of Appalachia, ignoring his family and struggling with the atrocities he not only witnessed but participated in: the other a Serbian, Emil Kovac (John Travolta) who narrowly escaped assassination by Ford and the American troops and since the war has been hunting for Ford to make him confess his war crimes and suffer the consequences. Ford and Kovac meet surreptitiously at Ford's little cabin, and at first exchange food and drink only to have the reality surface of Kovac's intent to kill Ford. The remainder of the film is a cat-and-mouse game that braces the wills of each survivor in treacherous manners that make each man reopen old war wounds and find a new universality in the effects of war on the human mind.\n\nThe film is shot in Georgia (cinematography is by Peter Menzies, Jr) with flashback black and white and sepia toned footage of the horrors of the Bosnian War. De Niro and Travolta manage these difficult roles well in this basically two-person film (Ford's son and daughter in law and new baby are adroitly played by Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin, and the early scenes in Serbia are polished by performances by Diana Lyubenova, Kalin Sarmenov and Stefan Shterev). The tension is underlined by a fine musical score composed by Christopher Young.\n\nThis film may not meet everyone's expectations of big noisy extravaganzas, but as a powerful antiwar statement is works exceptionally well.\n\nGrady Harp"

I don't get why is everybody so upset!?\n\nso they killed too many Muslims!!? so what!!! even when they got cut, they told to media: \"we are going to kill more if we get the chance!!!\" so what? now you say scorpions got cut and executed?! more like Christmas coming early! I mean, come on guys!? But hey! at least you got to watch beautiful views of God's nature, instead of messy/filthy,bloody reality of what just really happened back then which all of them have been trying to cover-up ever since!!! this one is another ugly attempt! wonderful! I applause you! well done! I mean it! I'll give you an eight! but seriously! next time use a Tank! that is more like it!"

DeNiro does not look like he is ever gonna get old for action flicks and Travolta is his usual tough self and is the right guy for the job! As far as the plot is concerned I feel Americans will love the movie and Serbians would probably hate it but as a neutral, I have enjoyed both DeNiro and Travolta's performances enough to wipe out any negatives in the plot. The point of both characters being in the latter part of their ages has a sort of slow effect overall on the film but they way the plot has been panned out has reduced that feeling. Did not quite understand Milo Ventimiglia's character in there, he was better as not being there. It would be more enjoyable had he influenced the film a bit more by maybe a rescue or something. Overall WELL DONE!"

In war you are literally killing people that have different opinion and that is not what we call freedom or free speech it teaches us about how war is never a real solution and anger will always stay in people hearts.\n\nI wont spoil it, film is great, that's it."

As for acting, I don't get the complaints for Travolta, specially the accent, shouldn't you take that up with the casting director? An actor can only do so much. But why is everyone complaining about the screenplay anyway? It's first and foremost an action thriller, this isn't Gandhi? And most people gave high ranks to that crap \"No Way Home\" which even scored higher than \"Gandhi\". Puh-lease."

Both Robert de Niro and John Travolta are on fine form here and deliver good performances,but i loved John Travolta's character a lot. All these bad reviews i don't understand,because it's a great film with a good story, beautiful scenery and two veterans in the movie business. All i can say is, sit back and give this movie a chance and it won't dissapoint if you understand the powerful message."
