Jonah is about to sacrifice the baby in 3 day's time. Milton gets a ride off of roadside diner waitress Piper (Amber Heard). Meanwhile Milton is pursued by the powerful Accountant (William Fichtner).\n\nIt's all pumping music and overblown action with a splash of female nudity. Amber Heard is strutting around in her Daisy Dukes. There is a lot to like, but the story isn't that compelling. It is a simplistic balls-out no-holds-bar vulgar entertainment. It's not going to win any awards, but it's good for the midnight crowd."

        "review_detailed_main": "For every good film starring Nicolas Cage, there are a half dozen or so throwaway films that fade into the background. The 2011 semi-grindhouse film DRIVE ANGRY is pretty much one of those throwaways. I don't mean it's a crappy movie. There's enough here to keep the film somewhat entertaining if you're looking for some mindless fun. I suppose it might've been even better in 3D. From what I remember, this film was actually filmed with 3D cameras as opposed to the crappy post-conversion process. I've only seen it in 2D, so I couldn't tell you if the extra dimension adding anything to the experience. The story is straight out of the world of grindhouse: Nicholas Cage is John Milton, a man who's escaped from Hell, and he's on a mission. His daughter was murdered by the insane leader of a Satanic cult, and this same maniac has plans on sacrificing Milton's newborn grandchild in a ritual to open a gateway between Hell and Earth. But Milton didn't leave Hell alone...there's a mysterious figure known only as the Accountant on his tail with the intention of taking Milton back.\n\nSounds cool, huh? It sort of is. The movie's loaded with crazy action and violence, including a gun battle in a motel room while Milton chugs a bottle of whiskey and continues getting freaky with a barmaid while gunning down multiple opponents. The scene alone should earn this movie awesome status. It probably would if there were more scenes as off-the-wall as this one. The final confrontation where Milton reminds us why the film is titled DRIVE ANGRY is pretty crazy, but the rest of the action in the movie is nothing we haven't seen before. The action also suffers from weak effects. The movie had a $50 million budget but I guess it all went into the car chases. Seriously, cars are exploding at the slightest hit and there's plenty of opportunities for tossing cars here. What CG is in the movie, is generally pretty terrible. When Milton uses his \"god-killer\" in the finale, I nearly laughed at a moment when we're supposed to be cheering. When it comes to gore effects, I always prefer practical over CG and the practical effects in this film, while not always perfect, were much better.\n\nI understand that this film is following in the recent trend of bringing the grindhouse film back to mainstream (not that that's a bad thing, e.g. GRINDHOUSE, HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN), but even characters in a grindhouse film need to be interesting. Milton's character has a cool premise: he's busted out of Hell. So why is his character so boring? Cage delivers his lines with the energy of someone whose just been woken from his afternoon nap. For a man who's escaped from the bowels of the underworld, he sure doesn't have a whole lot of passion for his mission. Someone should've reminded him the movie's called DRIVE ANGRY, not DRIVE PEEVED. Amber Heard is a waitress who finds herself drawn into Milton's quest and, in addition to providing some amazing eye candy, is the only one who seems to care what's going on. The real scene-stealers in this movie are the villains. Billy Burke is downright creepy as cult leader Jonah King with his Southern drawl and a self-righteous attitude that convinces his followers that this man knows what he's doing. More than anyone, the best performance in the film comes from William Fichtner as the Accountant. He's mysterious (instant cool points for any character) and deadly, cool and calm as he trails Milton and dispatching anyone who gets in his way without breaking a sweat. It's just business as usual for this Hell minion.\n\nThe film really has all the best grindhouse staples: gratuitous violence, T&A, awful dialogue, and car chases with plenty of explosions. The problem is, when a scene isn't giving us one or more of these things, it slows to a crawl and I kept losing interest. The dialogue is pretty terrible and any attempt at delivering exposition or expressing emotion falls flat. So keep it short and keep the pace moving fast to get us to the next action scene. In the end, the movie is just forgettable. It's fun enough to watch, but I doubt it'll be leaving a lasting impression with anyone. Not Cage's best, but at least it's not THE WICKER MAN."

King has killed Milton's daughter and abducted her baby to sacrifice him at midnight of a full moon in Stillwater and Milton wants to rescue his granddaughter.\n\nMilton reaches Oklahoma and finds that Stillwater is a deactivated prison in Louisiana. Then he helps the waitress Piper (Amber Heard) first with her damaged car and then he protects her against her brutal boyfriend. In return, she gives a ride to him to Louisianna. Soon they discover that a mysterious stranger called The Accountant (William Fichtner) is chasing them. What is the secret of Milton and The Accountant?\n\n\"Drive Angry\" is a brainless, but also a highly entertaining movie with the trash story of a man that escapes from hell to save his granddaughter and is hunted by the reaper. There is non-stop action and havoc, with car chases; shootings; and the hot Amber Heard. The cast has Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner in a parody of the role of Alex Mahone in \"Prison Break\" and David Morse. My suggestion is to shutdown your brain and to enjoy this funny movie. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"F\u00faria Sobre Rodas\" (\"Rage over Wheels\")\n\nNote: On 19 June 2015, I saw this movie again."

        "review_title": "A serviceable pure exploitation flick with mediocre execution",
        "review_detailed_main": "A small but existent segment of the American population believes that any and all combinations of cars, guns and naked women make for the perfect care-free cinematic cocktail. But like any cocktail, there's a perfect blend required, not simply throwing them in a blend-er. Behold the difference between the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and \"Drive Angry.\" The former, for example, understands that women make the cars more beautiful, whereas Patrick Lussier, writer and director of \"Drive Angry,\" believes that they go together because they're two things men like.\n\n\"Drive Angry\" is not the awful kind of schlocky grindhouse flick, but it's completely hollow filmmaking. Shot in 3D, when you watch the film in the \"inferior\" two dimensions, you can tell the film was meant to be watched in 3D the way bullets and shrapnel come toward the camera. Fans of the 3-D medium who despise converted 3D will rejoice at the director's intention to use it, but this intention serves nothing more than the purpose of gimmick. In other words, cars, guns, naked women \u2014 and 3D.\n\nWho better for the driver seat than Nicolas Cage? Sporting yet another hairstyle, Cage gets to play angry stoic man escaped from hell. Vengeance, of course, lies at the heart of any reputable exploitation flick, so at least Lussier and writing partner Todd Farmer understand their genre. The execution, however, comes off as amateur, especially in an age with folks such as Robert Rodriguez pulling off the genre in a modern era with more success \u2014 and humor especially.\n\nCreativity for \"Drive Angry\" comes in the form of Cage's Milton shooting down several religious fanatics trying to kill him with farming tools \u2014 all while maintaining sexual intercourse with the waitress from the bar next door. That could be chalked up to a genre signature, but it doesn't serve any other purpose in the film. Usually the nudity or sex tells us something about the lone wolf lead character or adds to his mystique, but it really doesn't in this case. Milton's motivation is to get back his baby granddaughter from a Satanist cult that intends to sacrifice her. Having escaped from hell to do so and with Satan's \"accountant\" (William Fichtner) on his tail, his actions should be pretty clear-cut. After all, he doesn't even fall for the young blonde he's picked up for the ride (Amber Heard).\n\nHeard represents that kick-ass feminist force in the male-centric exploitation flick. Piper vice grips her boss's balls when he puts his hands on her at work and then promptly quits, goes home early in her '69 Charger with \"I Break for Pussy\" on the bumper and finds another woman on top of her fianc\u00e9. I won't spoil what happens after, but this spirit creates the bond between her and Milton as well as a troubled past relationship between Milton and his daughter for which Piper provides a second chance. Heard will one day be too A-list and above this material, so she's refreshing in the role.\n\nFichtner, who plays the devil's right hand of sorts, also brings a fun performance to the film. He's not one of those typical self-assured villains in spite of his other-worldly abilities, but he possesses the same malice. The slightest sense of humility makes him a memorable character despite the clich\u00e9 role. Billy Burke as Jonah King, the Satanist who fancies himself better than everyone else, goes a bit more over-the-top, but also makes an effective villain.\n\nThe action of \"Drive Angry,\" though much more about guns and gore than cars, satisfies for the most part except when it kowtows to the 3D. For those not watching with special glasses, that sort of zaps you out of the story.\n\n\"Drive Angry\" ends up being everything you'd expect it to be, provided you expected a 3-D camp-fest manufactured in a petri dish. There's definitely a place for those kinds of films, but the distinguishing factor between good and bad exploitation lies in disguising the man behind the curtain, the puppeteer or whatever force putting that product together merely to entertain at the surface level. \"Drive Angry\" entertains, but the failure to conceal prevents any investment into the story or characters.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie really is one of those guilty pleasure types, where you know it's a bad movie but really enjoy watching it because of the crazy entertainment value. It also has a grindhouse feel to it as well, a very entertaining grindhouse type film. There is just certain elements in this movie that made it entertaining despite it having a bad script and not a very well crafted dialogue with one liners. When I first saw the trailer to this movie I already could tell it's going to be a bad movie, it looked like \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" with a vengeance. The movie is ridiculous and absurd in so many levels, but for a movie like this that is one of the key factors why this movie is so enjoyable. Billy Burke is pretty good playing the cult leader but the most entertaining actor to watch in this movie is William Fichtner as The Accountant or the Devil's right hand man, he is great in this and I enjoyed every scene he was in. In fact I wouldn't mind seeing a prequel or a sequel to this movie where he is the main character. What I really enjoyed besides William Fichtner performance is the 3D effect, this is a movie that is well worth the extra cash to see it in 3D. The 3D is very well executed and used very well and added a lot to the entertainment factor. The sex scenes and nudity is very unique at times and kinda funny in others. Amber Heard is beautiful in this and hot, in fact I personally think the overrated Megan Fox has nothing on her when it comes to the level of hotness. Plus Amber Heard can act a bit better than Megan Fox, although she is pretty in other movies she is really beautiful in this. It's not a movie that should be taken seriously and it knows it's not going in a serious direction and does it well, with bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense. If your looking for a good story you will be disappointed, but if your looking for a crazy and entertaining balls to the wall type of movie I recommend you see this.\n\n7.6/10"

He also had this ridclious hairstyle making him look like a Robert Plant lookalike to add to this ridiculous film, i swear his face didn't change the whole way through, just the same stupid expression muttering unexplained story lines.\n\nYou may watch the trailer n think \"yeh this will be great , Nicolas cage n a blonde shooting people in a muscle car\" no wrong. It turns out it is just some nonsense about the satanic worshippers and a guy breaking out of hell to get them, Really Nick? is this what level you've dropped too? I just have no words to describe how bad this was, at some points there is serious violence which is just stupid, and then its trying to be funny and it fails and then it trys to be meaningful.Just a blurry mess of rubbish.\n\nThis film also highlights why 3D needs to stop. As if 3D is a new cool thing? no its not, its about 50 years old, just because its better quality means nothing and adds nothing to the film, instead every 5 minutes there's a bullet or a axe flying at you, yeh great, but I've seen it over and over again. 3D is only being pursued because they know they can charge more for it and they can sell T.V's like they did with HD, well I'm sorry but 3D will not work and if you don't believe me go watch this film.\n\n1/10 AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS, Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY"

        "review_detailed_main": "Nicolas Cage Week: Day 2\n\nDrive Angry is an hour and a half of beautiful, blissful exploitation and carnage, a grind house shot to the gut that never holds back, doesn't care an ounce about logic, and aims to do one thing: ensure the viewers enjoyment unconditionally. Nicolas Cage plays John Milton, a gruff badass who escapes from hell by literally charging his '74 Chevelle 454 right through the gate, hot on the pursuit of a roaming band of thugs who know what happened to his daughter and baby grandson. He wastes no second in pummelling both pavement with his tires and people with his fists, and pretty much any gun or blunt object he can get his hands on. His daughter was murdered, and his grandson kidnapped by a demented Louisiana satanist cult, led by eloquent monster Jonah King (Billy Burke, dryly subverting his nice guy image with evil aplomb). Milton aims to eradicate anyone and everyone who gets in his way, with the help of sexy Amher Heard and old pal David Morse. What he isn't prepared for is the arrival of 'The Accountant' (William Fichtner), the devil's suave, soft spoken bounty hunter, dispatched to bring Milton back to the fiery depths. Fichtner has always had an ice cool theatrical flair to his work, and he's the highlight of the film here, an unphased, silky prick, owning every moment with his unmistakable brand of cool. Tom Atkins also has a cameo as the worlds most enthusiastic Highway Patrol officer. The movie goes at full blast, and to go along with that energy there's a cheeky script that constantly nods at the viewer and let's us know what a fan of the genre the filmmakers are. Nowhere else can you see Nic Cage escape from hell, drink from the skull of his enemy and have a gunfight while in the middle of banging a bar waitress. If that isn't enough to get you excited, well..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Milton (Nicholas Cage), long hair bleached and greased back with vengeance, tosses his duffel bag into the back of newly-met stranger Piper's (Amber Heard) Dodge Charger. With her hands shoved into her daisy barely dukes, the uncertainty in her gaze is lost on, or possibly ignored by, Milton. As he opens the door to get in:\n\nPiper: \"I don't pick up hitchhikers, you know.\"\n\nMilton: \"I wasn't stickin' out my thumb.\"\n\n*car door slam*\n\nThis early scene sums up exactly what you're getting yourself into with the Nicholas Cage driven movie, Drive Angry. You've seen the trailers. You've experienced Cage's knack to play unhinged, surrealistic characters. This 70's throwback to the pulp, metal on metal, grindhouse era of film doesn't ask you if you want a ride. You jump in without invitation and only know one thing: you'd better strap in. And it's with this that Drive Angry does not disappoint.\n\nMilton, in his '64 Riviera, has just escaped from imprisonment and is searching for a baby snatched from her mother by a devil-worshipping cult hellbent on a full moon sacrifice led by Jonah King (Billy Burke of The Twilight Saga), a southernly sadistic soothsayer. It seems Milton's own daughter was once stolen from him by the same cult and, well, he's experiencing a little road rage as he shoots his way through one lead to the next. Along the way, he joins up with Piper and her '68 Charger who's pretty looks pack a pretty punch and isn't afraid to gun and run. All the while they are being chased across 6 state lines by trigger happy cops and The Accountant (William Fichtner of Prison Break), a seemingly supernatural hunter looking to return Milton to his warm, warm prison. Throw in a '71 Chevelle, unapologetic bloodshed, and absolutely necessary explosions, and you have one darkly comedic, action fueled vehicle.\n\nDrive Angry embraces the fact that it is ridiculous by nature which makes it very enjoyable. The over the top dialogue, car chases, and 3D shootouts really add to making this a midnight moviegoer's film. Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer (My Bloody Valentine 3D) aimed to keep the integral car sequences visceral and strayed away from CGI for a majority of the chases, though there is plenty of CGI elsewhere. Being an unabashed opponent to the influx of 3D in the cinema today, Drive Angry was filmed as a 3D film from the start and I actually liked it. Some shots were intentionally gimmicky which added to the humor, but the entire movie is a bit over the top and it flowed nicely.\n\nDrive Angry makes no assumptions that it is anything but a popcorn-spilling, laugh-out- loud, violently raw roller coaster on its way no where near an Oscar. And it's better for it. If you don't mind having an arm shot and projected at your face while Nic Cage loses touch with reality, Drive Angry will provide an entertaining distraction from the repetitive daily commute.\n\n3.5 seat belts out of 5\n\n-MovieFloss.com"

So even if you're like me and don't like Cage you can still see this movie. ;-) On to the movie itself. It's a rather straight forward action movie with a bad-ass good-guy who chases a bad guy with and his supporters. Milton (Cage) has some history with the baddie and on his way to get to him he uses guns, big explosions and prefers travel by classic American muscle car. While doing so he picks up a hot chick (Heard) to accompany him on the road. That's basically it.\n\nThe reason i still give it a 7 out of 10 is that the action is pretty nice, most of the special effects are good and the story, although limited, moves along at a steady pace so you won't get bored. Fichtner's side character is also quite cool. The things a don't like about the film are some clich\u00e9 dialogs with silly one-liners and the feeling that the makers aim for cult status. Too bad the movie isn't good enough for it, but if you hear a title like 'Drive Angry' you expect a simple action movie and that's exactly what you get. Always nice from time to time."

        "review_detailed_main": "One admonition that this viewer heard before deciding to watch \"Drive Angry\" was that it was suffering from the \"trying too hard\" syndrome; in this case, the film is trying too hard to be an instant cult favourite. That's kind of hard to argue, as it works overtime to establish an air of cool and a lot of style, while all the time pretty much winking at the audience.\n\nNicolas Cage plays John Milton, a lowlife who's literally escaped from Hell and roars down highways in pursuit of a creepy-ass cult leader, Jonah King (Billy Burke). You see, King and his cult have already BRUTALLY murdered Miltons' daughter and have abducted his granddaughter, intending to offer the child up as a ritual sacrifice. And hot on Miltons' heels is an emissary from Hell referred to as The Accountant (William Fichtner).\n\nRight from the start, co-writer / actor Todd Farmer and co-writer / co-editor / director Patrick Lussier let those of us in the audience know that we're going to be taken on an intense and corpse-littered ride. They keep the movie rocketing forward, and the tongue in cheek tone is always present, with frequent one-liners from Cage and a silly approach taken to some of the kill scenes. And speaking of Cage, one can't help but notice that his performance isn't plagued by eccentricities, and is actually more restrained than they'll expect.\n\nHe gets very effective support from the smoking-hot Amber Heard, who sears the screen as his feisty sidekick who always puts up a good fight. The under-rated Fichtner is a standout as the relentless bad (?) guy; he plays the part with wit and personality. Familiar faces among the supporting cast include David Morse as Miltons' old buddy Webster, Charlotte Ross as comely waitress Candy, the always welcome Tom Atkins as \"Cap\", and Jack McGee as diner owner Fat Lou. Ross and co-star Christa Campbell add additional, much appreciated eye candy; Lussier and Farmer keep up the trademark that they established in their \"My Bloody Valentine\" remake of protracted, gleefully gratuitous nudity. (One highlight has Milton taking out several villains while still in the embrace of Candy with whom he'd been having sex!)\n\nThe digital and 3D effects are plentiful, always throwing things right in your face. The pacing is fast and furious enough to make sure that viewers don't ever get bored. They're also likely to be laughing loudly and often, what with all of the general grisliness and mayhem.\n\nOverall, \"Drive Angry\" is not destined to become something iconic, but it's an amusing diversion and there are much worse ways to spend an hour and 45 minutes.\n\nSeven out of 10."

        "review_title": "A fun, little nasty Nic Cage action film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Nicolas Cage has gained a reputation for playing all kinds of characters with all kinds of backgrounds with all types of personalities. These range of behaviors have covered the banal, to the deranged. Nicolas Cage knows no bounds when it comes to acting. People love and hate him for both his dramatic performances as well as his idiotic ones. During the early 2010's, Cage was on the border of his popularity. He was still getting cast into films that were guaranteed to get a larger release, yet he also signed onto films that got less notoriety. Only some of which were critically well received. Much of them on the other hand failed to make their money back or leave any kind of an impression. Of them though, one action film that kind of went under the radar that should have gotten more attention was this feature. There have been plenty of hard R action films that contained enough interesting characters and witty humor to keep things going. Yet the premise to this movie feels fresh in ways others have no shown in a while.\n\nNicolas Cage plays John Milton, a dead man who escaped from the underworld to rescue his granddaughter from a satanic cult worshiper by the name of Jonah King (Billy Burke), who killed Milton's daughter. On his travels Milton gets the attention of Piper (Amber Heard), a wanderer looking for a purpose. All the while the devil's right hand man known as the accountant (William Fichtner) is looking to retrieve Milton and bring him back to where he belongs. Written by Todd Farmer and Patrick Lussier, the two seem to have taken what feel like a mix of different characters and made them into one. As an end result, the story is not the most unique, but it serves its purpose in creating likable characters. Patrick Lussier also directed the film, who has mainly served as an editor to other projects like Scream (1996) and two sequels after it. Todd Farmer has been more of a writer to movies like Jason X (2001) and My Bloody Valentine (2009). The real problems in the script are abrupt motivation changes and an unclear backstory.\n\nNicolas Cage as John Milton gives a familiar performance but nevertheless, the way the Milton character comes across is comical. So many lines are stated with such deadpan, it's hard not to laugh. So many things happen to Milton that he just rolls off, it becomes quite entertaining. William Fichtner as the accountant is another comical individual. The moments the accountant shares with other cast members is humorous just for the fact that nobody understands his purpose, which frustrates him. Also the fact that Amber Heard does not play a love interest to that of John Milton is a plus. Not every protagonist needs to have someone to fall in love with. As portrayed in the running time, Milton has no time for that. Billy Burke as Milton's enemy plays a fairly considerable opponent. He's not afraid to get his hands dirty and does not hesitate to kill. Burke is also known for playing in Lights Out (2016) and in the Twilight (2008) series. For supporting characters there are also appearances by several others.\n\nThese characters do not affect the plot in any real way, but they do bring some recognizable faces to the show. David Morse plays a friend of Milton by the name of Webster. His sarcasm is about an equal match to Milton's. Jack McGee has a small role as Fat Lou, the owner of a local diner. He has a funny exchange with the accountant. Also, Tom Atkins shows up to play the head of the police department. It's a role that only Atkins would easily fit in to. The action and special effects are well handled here too. The violence in this film vary with all kinds of sequences. Sometimes people are shot with guns, others are run over by vehicles and some suffer worse than that. Those kills are normally attributed to the accountant, since he is the most supernatural character in this story. The thing is, although it looks like he's having fun doing it, he comes across more inconvenienced. With these types of kills are the blood and gore, which looks pretty good. Gore fans should be well satisfied here if they want guts.\n\nWorking as the cinematographer to this project was Brian Pearson. For majority of the movie, Pearson's work was great looking. Hardly any of the action scenes involved shaky cam and much of it helped in the pacing of the experience. The lens used wasn't a wide angle but it was large enough to get the full scope of the surroundings. Pearson also worked on movies like The Fear: Resurrection (1999), Final Destination 5 (2011), Into the Storm (2014) and Insidious: Chapter 3 (2015). Topping things off however was the musical score composed by Michael Wandmacher. The film score has a unique mix of a hard rock guitar theme for Milton and a southern sound for Piper. There's also hints of horror cues that sound very close to typical stings. Being that Wandmacher also produced music for Punisher: War Zone (2008) and Piranha 3D (2010), it's no surprise this guy can combine both genres together with no problem. Thankfully a release of the score is available so anyone can listen because it is a lot of fun.\n\nThis may not go down in Nic Cage's career as the greatest movie he's made, but it sure is an enthralling one at that. There aren't many things to find wrong in this production other than a few minor holes in its writing. The action, camera-work, and music all coincide together to create an engaging experience. Plus the actors seem to be having a lot of fun in their roles."

        "review_detailed_main": "2011 is NOT Nicolas Cage's year for cinematic meaning and/or significance as Drive Angry is yet another GAWD-awful film from the Oscar-winning actor who also just gave us the bubonicly-bad Season of the Witch. As a matter-of-fact, the last FEW years haven't been overly kind to Cage's resume -- G-Force, Bangkok Dangerous, Knowing, Next, Ghost Rider, The Wicker Man, The Lord of War, Astro Boy ... as his \"bright spots\" have actually been few and VERY far between and include The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Kick-Ass and the two National Treasure films. The latter, better ones are \"merely good\" and/or enjoyable while the his others are ALL dreadful stinkers who's \"best moments\" are \"barely tolerable\".\n\nWhile Drive Angry is relentless and the punches/bullets come one-after-the-other, I found that it all became rather monotonous and a lot of the \"killing\" became meaningless and obsolete (not the best description of a high-octane thriller).\n\nCage stars as a hard-nosed felon who has broken out of Hell (yes ... hell) ... who's name is Milton. Hahaha ... right?!? His name is supposed to imply that the movie shouldn't be taken too seriously; but Drive Angry has a difficult time sustaining even THAT joke. An all-powerful devil/demon is played by Billy Burke (Twilight, Red Riding Hood) who appears to be even less-powerful than the film wants the viewer to believe ... it is all rather perplexing and odd (it still has me scratching my head).\n\nDrive Angry doesn't remain consistent with its fury ... at times the anger is only tepid ... and that keeps the film from working on its stupidly ridiculous level. Throwing-in such a questionable female lead (Amber Heard - Zombieland, The Joneses), the film leaves it's viewer more angry than the \"driver\" in the film. If the film's main character is a Hell-escapee, there should be plenty of road-rage, fury and scorn (PLEASE bring it on!!!); but there isn't much ... as he is simply upset/peeved at times (and this just doesn't cut it). He is very mild-mannered for an Escapee-of-Hell."

There's nudity and gore and a few laughs to be had along the way. Nicholas Cage gives another fine unhinged performance delivering these cheesy lines like he was doing Shakespeare. Amber Heard as the sexy sidekick is just as good, but possible the best performance is from William Fichtner as the accountant. The music is loud the gunshots louder and the 3D is great all the way through.\n\nFor me it had a similar feel to the crank movies and planet terror. It was just stupid fun and I loved it."

That's probably the only reason why I sat throughout the horror, that is, the movie.

        "review_title": "A ridiculously over-the-top and wildly enjoyable thrill ride",
        "review_detailed_main": "Nicolas Cage takes a lot of flack for his acting choices. The man is likely the most inconsistent actor in the entirety of Hollywood, jumping from headlining critically acclaimed films like Leaving Las Vegas and Adaptation to headlining putrid, bottom of the barrel films like Next and The Wicker Man. But going through his filmography, sorting the good from the bad, and the bad from the unwatchable, you will find a good handful of films that are just meant to be silly and fun. This is where Drive Angry 3D resides.\n\nJohn Milton (Cage) did some bad things, and was sent to hell as a result. After the death of his daughter and the kidnapping of his granddaughter at the hands of crazy cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke), Milton escapes hell and becomes a man on a mission. As he hunts and searches for King, he brings the gorgeous Piper (Amber Heard) along for the ride to assist him in his quest.\n\nDrive Angry 3D was unfairly trampled by critics when it was released just under a month ago, and it is a real shame it never was able to find a true audience. Just looking at the trailer should have suggested exactly what kind of film you were in for, and this one delivers at all turns. Right after its gory and explosion-filled opening, you get one ridiculous set piece after the next, moving at a near delirious speed through some of the most over-the-top sequences of the last decade. There is an almost automatic comparison to Grindhouse and more specifically, Death Proof, and it is well warranted. There is next to nothing to take seriously in Drive Angry 3D. There is no thinking involved. It was never meant to look or act like an Oscar-winner. All it wants is for you to strap in and enjoy the ride.\n\nA lot of the fun and enjoyment comes from the 3D more than I would like to admit. The film is of the rare breed of actually being filmed in 3D as opposed to being post-converted, and you can tell in just how much stronger and better it looks as a result. There are no real dull or dark moments, and only a few instances where it feels like the gimmick it actually is. In most cases, it just looks natural and stylish \u2013 a natural progression for the grindhouse, B-movie genre. And though the special effects do look cheesy, they fit in almost perfectly with the visual motif and landscape the 3D provides for the film. But it is not just the elements that pop out and on the screen that are impressive. A flashback scene, with Cage flashing back in the foreground and the scene playing out in the background is of particular note, because it actually does something unique outside of what we have come to expect from the 3D effects Hollywood continues to pump out. It adds to the medium, and suggests that we may see some creativity out of this format yet.\n\nThe rest of the fun, when not laughing near maniacally at all the brutal carnage going on (the effects of \"The Godkiller\" are of particular note), comes from the goofy dialogue and delivery from the cast. They may look stone faced, but you can tell they are having a great time acting out this preposterous storyline. Burke and William Fichtner (who plays the Devil's right hand man, The Accountant) seem to be having the most fun hamming it up, and doling out ridiculous one-liners. Just watching them react and play their roles so deliciously over-the-top is more than enough reason to see the film on its own. Heard plays the drop-dead gorgeous blonde she has perfected over the years to a tee, adding in a bad ass rebellious attitude for good measure. While she does not wear those fantastic booty shorts for the entirety of the film, rest assured that you will not complain about her other outfit choices (if of course, that is a selling point to your watching the film).\n\nSurprisingly, Cage plays Milton cool and monotone. He does the most outrageous things in the movie, and gets many of the great one-liners, but he seems very mellowed out in every instance. He seems to not be his over-the-top, absurdist self, which is saying a lot since he's made a habit in the last few years of making each character more unusually eccentric than the last (see The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans and Kick-Ass for proof). He seems perfectly comfortable playing his character as the closest thing to the straight man, while everyone else acts over-the-top.\n\nWhat I disliked about the film was that it stumbles as it nears the finish line. Late in the film, David Morse is introduced merely as a means for the plot to advance to the ludicrous ending. And all his character does is stall the film, and make it run longer than it needs to. While his entrance sheds a bit of light on Milton as a character, by that point it is too little, too late. As stated previously, this is not the kind of film that benefits from characterization and explanation. It revels in saying and doing irrational and silly things. Why try to turn the movie around on its audience, who had been eating up every word and action until that point? It just makes the film run longer, and takes away some of the fun.\n\nGranted you know what you are getting into, Drive Angry 3D is a ridiculously over-the-top and incredibly fun diversion. This not a serious movie in the least, and may even offend some people with how outrageous it is. But if you can handle the heat, this underrated gem may prove we cannot give up on Nicolas Cage just yet.\n\n8/10.\n\n(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Milton has escaped from Hell in order to save his baby granddaughter from a satanic cult which plans to sacrifice her on the night of the next full moon. His daughter had been a member of the cult until she realised its leader, Jonah King, was evil; he later murdered her. Soon after Milton's return he helps waitress, Piper, get away from her abusive fianc\u00e9. She turns out to be as tough as she is sexy. Together they head from Colorado to Louisiana meeting assorted violence on the way. Milton is being pursued by 'The Accountant' one of Satan's lieutenants who is to take him back to Hell; then there are the police who Milton and Piper for the shooting of two Colorado State Troopers and final King and his cultists who wish to unleash Hell on Earth.\n\nClearly this film is far from subtle; just about every detail is an exercise in excess... that is what makes it so much fun even though it is clearly not a 'good' movie. The opening scenes make it clear just how violent the film will be as Milton shoots a man's hand off with a shotgun before doing shooting off another man's leg and killing a third. It isn't just the violence that is excessive there is also some gratuitous sex and nudity... Milton even kills numerous cultists while 'on the job', much to the woman's dismay! The story is good trashy fun and the characters are just right for such a film. Nicolas Cage is solid as Milton; Amber Heard is fun as Piper; Billy Burke was delightfully over the top as King and William Fichtner stood out as The Accountant. The driving scenes, in a series of classic American muscle cars are joy to watch. The special effects were a bit poor at times but that might have been deliberate to give the film a retro feel to match the retro story. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of over the top, slightly trashy, action movies... it might not be a good film but it is a fun film."

        "review_detailed_main": "A grindhouse film with the all the ingredients: terrible one liners, graphic violence, and a fair amount of naked women, yet it somehow misses the mark and is just bad. Not even to the point of being so bad it's good, it's just bad. Nicolas Cage stars as Milton, a man hell bent on revenge and on a mission to rescue his grand daughter from a Satan worshiping cult, led by Billy Burke, that plans on sacrificing her so as to bring Hell to Earth. Along the way he gains the aid of Piper, played by Amber Heard, a southern, hard ass waitress, while also being chased down by The Accountant, played by William Fichter, who is in charge of bringing Milton back to the prison that he escaped from, Hell. That's pretty much it, there's a lot of violence, weak dialogue, and lots of sex, but even the 3D can't bring this grindhouse flick up the caliber of other successes like From Dusk Til Dawn, Machete, or Snakes on a Plane.\n\nThe 3D is sub par at best, they use it way too much for the stereotypical gimmicks like bullets, explosions, and debris flying at you. 3D's become just another way for studios to boost ticket prices, when lately the films that use it cripple the technology and make people feel like it is a pointless venture. 3D is suppose to enhance the experience of going to the theaters by placing the audience into the film itself. But all they seem to be able to do with it is throw things or shoot things at you, with the exceptions of few, like Avatar. There are times during Drive Angry where they do place in the scene but these scenes are few and far between and are overshadowed by the usual gimmicks.\n\nThe cast is pretty strong unfortunately there isn't much for them to work with. Heard pretty much steals the show which isn't too surprising. You have a gorgeous blonde with a strong personality, not to mention a southern accent on top of it, who would you rather see on screen. Nicolas Cage is his usual character here, one that he seems to be doing a lot of lately. He has some pretty good scenes here, one in particular that is especially funny, having sex whilst in a gun fight (unfortunately not too original, reminded me way too much of the a similar scene in Shoot Em Up). William Fichter and Billy Burke are the villains and are fairly compelling in their roles, almost to the degree of upstaging Cage in the title role.\n\nWhat Drive Angry does have going for it is the first half of the film. It's pretty entertaining and where most of the fun action takes place, starting from the very beginning. The supernatural aspect is pretty cool and makes it more than just a revenge story but I was looking for more of it. There could have been some great fight scenes between Milton and The Accountant however there was only one that I can remember and it wasn't even a good one at that. Basically your going to get what you pay for from Drive Angry, but I guess I was expecting more absurdity, more supernatural action, and really bad dialogue, instead it was kind of like they attempted to make a grindhouse movie with studio control and restrictions thus making this mess of a movie that even 3D can't save."

        "review_detailed_main": "Good Movie! Great Action enhanced by some of the best 3D FX till date (excluding Avatar). Nic Cage is a good actor, he might not be one of the all time greats, but he can act well - contrary to some of the backlash he has received recently - (he is an Oscar winner for crying out loud). & in roles like these, he doesn't need to act, his effortless charm helps him cruise through them.\n\nIts a rehashed plot about a guy out for revenge, who unleashes mayhem along the way, nothing brilliant, but narrated with an innovative concept & coupled with some cool stunts & dialogues (watch out for Cage's dialogue in the climax: 'I'm not from this earth') - which more than make up for the loose script. Both Amber Heard, playing a sexy chick with attitude & William Fichtner, playing a suave anti-hero are good. Another saving grace is that the action isn't relentless. Its interspersed by some good moments between Cage & Heard - they surprisingly have good chemistry - which drives some sense into the proceedings & - a rarity in action films nowadays.\n\nIf you like good old fashioned action flicks, which are real fun & coupled with some bad-ass anti-heroes with attitude, along with some cool dialogue & hardcore stunts minus overblown CGI, then don't miss 'Drive Angry 3D'.\n\nMy Rating: 7/10\n\nMy Fianl Verdict: Go For It & Enjoy A Fun Ride At The Movies."

I think my problem was that I didn't see it 3D, but still that wouldn't have changed the script which was the worst part of the movie. The whole plot was weak,the negative characters weren't clear till the end of the movie,the good guy wasn't so good but I guess that was their purpose.As a whole, the movie didn't add up.As for Cage, you can see that he doesn't get to choose his roles lately cause he can't go higher than lord of war or lower than this.I am not a big fan of Cage but he can do better than this or maybe he's getting too old for this sh(enanigan).If you pay attention to the movie you'll see some bad effects(saw it in 2d I repeat)I mean car backgrounds; their hair looked like it was contoured by kindergarten children on their drawing boards,I will stop here because the longer I write the more time this movie wastes of my life and I won't give it the satisfaction.

        "review_detailed_main": "Drive me angry, it's definitely a C-Class movie. There's even no one single memorable moment. Milton (Nicolas Cage) is a father who escapes from hell to avenge his daughter's death and urges to save the only baby granddaughter, meanwhile The Accountant from hell is assigned to retrieve Milton. I wish I don't have to review thiz movie, because all bad words are gonna break loose. Trapped inside the Cage again, we are tired of your experimental hot-shot wannabe since \"Ghost Rider\" (2007). Amber Heard is expected to be the hot chick element but on the contrary she has become unsexy and extremely boring. The villain, Billy Burke is expected to be fierce and memorable, but instead of that he delivers emptiness. The only appearance that's a little bit better comes from William Fichtner as The Accountant with his charismatic and eccentric character. The story itself is never clear since the beginning. The action sequences are amusing, always shaking all the time and not focus. I even don't know what is really going in that moment. Yeah, it's a terrible cinematography. It comes from the Director who almost every time puts anything that smells clich\u00e9 and not original into his films such as \"Dracula 2000\" (2000) and the remake \"My Bloody Valentine\" (2009). The intention is to become cult movie or something different, but eventually it turns out to be a big blunder. \"Gimme one good reason I shouldn't shoot you in the face\", well I know you're driving... But your driving is completely sucks.\n\nVisit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Cops and people shot with blood splattering out and limbs maimed that fly towards you at the speed of light in 3D plus plenty of female nudity, Drive Angry certainly earned it's 18 certificate. Add to that fast cars, explosions BOOM! and action with guns and hands POW! and you got the ultimate film for the guys (though there's no reason why women can't enjoy this).\n\nDon't expect deep characterisation of the characters or a great plot or intelligent script because you won't get that and you won't like this if you take it seriously, it's just absolute ridiculous over the top trashy fun.\n\nThe basic synopsis consists of vengeful father John Milton (Nicolas Cage) escaping from hell (seriously). He can't be killed and loves to smoke cigars and have sex (it's good to know when you go down to hell, you don't lose your appetite for everything). But his main mission is to get revenge on the leader of a satanic cult Jonah King (Billy Burke acting ridiculously hammy, but in a goofy fun way) who killed his daughter who was a member of the cult and tried to escape. He took her child and plans to sacrifice her at the full moon to achieve peace or some crap like that. Milton aided by ex waitress Piper whose foul mouthed but very attractive (Amber Heard) tries to help him save his granddaughter. Meanwhile \"The Accountant\" played by William Fichtner is sent to bring Milton back to hell.\n\nThe script is very cheesy and clich\u00e9 but like great trashy films before it like The Losers and The A-Team, the actors use it and make the dialogue and one liners funny. Cage gives an enjoyable performance, which is a relief as I didn't like him in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, which I saw him in only recently. He also in Drive Angry certainly looks the part. Amber Heard gives an okay performance (it isn't that great), but for this sort of film it will do, plus she gets through the film just fine on her looks. William Fichtner though steals the show as a deadpan psychopath. He's really funny and I'm not sure why but weirdly classy. He and the rest of the cast look like they are enjoying themselves.\n\nThe CGI is terrific in a cartoonish,arty sort of way and the action is exciting with the pace and tone flying along nicely. The 3D is actually quite good with me flinching a couple of times as a limb and such came flying off the screen, though there is a lack of 3D in certain scenes, it certainly beats The Green Hornet and the abysmal Clash of the Titans last year in terms of 3D quality, which was little. This is a very guilty pleasure from start to finish and should be taken with a high pinch of salt. Just turn your brain off, don't take it seriously and you should enjoy it. I certainly did."

OK, this is something i would give a couple of million dollars to make a movie with B stars straight to DVD. But it's supposed to be a mainstream movie with names like Nicholas Cage, William Fichtner, David Morse, shot in 3D.\n\nThe movie itself is like a fantasy of a 13 years old teenager: cool cars, hot chicks, and a lot of pew-pew. But it's rather ridiculous then cool. The bad soundtrack just lays emphasis on it. The so called evil character is pathetic, thanks to a really poor acting. The action sequences are boring and ordinary (except one cool moment when a car falls into a hole in the very front of Milton).\n\n3D does NOT help, a bottle of vodka before the movie DOES help.\n\nI'd say this is the worst movie of this decade, however it's only 2011. And there is another \"movie\" form a guy named Justin Bieber \"Never say never\" that has an average of 1.1. Which one will get the Razzie in 2011?"

He also drives angry.\n\nNicolas Cage gets a lot...and I mean A LOT of hate for his movies. People complain that the guy overacts in every scene, makes crappy movies and seems to only want a big paycheck. I'm a fan of Cage, always have been and you know what, I always will be. The guy can make a really crappy movie be fun, look at The Wicker Man for that. A movie so terrible, that Cage must have known this and thus we get the infamous \"Not the bees\" or \"Why'd it get burned\" lines that have since become internet favourites. His latest feature has him escaping hell, driving cool cars and shooting at everyone and everything in sight. He still has some lame hair though.\n\nDrive Angry is a 3D grindhouse flick that doesn't try to take itself seriously for a second. Every scene is ridiculous and over the top, from Cage having sex while killing people (same thing happens in Shoot Em Up) to William Fichtner walking out of a moving truck and onto the hood of a cop car while the truck flips over and explodes. Walking I tell you, he doesn't even blink, he makes it look natural. It helps that he is not human. He's known as The Accountant and he works for Satan. His job is to bring Milton back to hell.\n\nAmber Heard, beautiful young lady that she is, plays a foul mouth chick who likes to throw punches. She is pretty and fills the role of hot chick as expected. Basically she looks great and makes little boys feel funny in their pants. Finally Billy Burke shows up as the cult leader who wants to sacrifice the baby in the name of Satan. He plays the role in an overtly weird and sometimes sexual way.\n\nDrive Angry is a lot of fun. You need to know what to expect going in. It's a grindhouse flick through and through. I loved Death Proof, but I even agree with the critics who say that it was too chatty. I think if this were the second flick in the double feature, people would have really had a fun time. Of course it would have had to have been a bit shorter, it's a little long as it is now. Few parts drag on a bit and I could easily cut some scenes here and there.\n\nThe 3D is fun, it's the in your face kind of fun. The film was shot in 3D, if that helps anyone. Some parts of the film that were in 3D were nicely done, others were obvious (let's see how many times we can point the gun at the screen and have it pop in 3D). I had fun with SAW 3D, blood and guys flying at me, this is somewhat the same, but better. You can tell that it's a bit different from films that are converted to 3D, it just has a cleaner feel to it and next to no 'ghosting'. The only complaints were that sometimes when things were in 3D, the shot was focusing on something else. So the 3D object would be out of focus, thus it loses some of the flare.\n\nThe film is loud and in your face. It's one of those movies that will find an audience on DVD. I can see it becoming a cult favourite in some time. It screams b movie left right and centre and Cage knows this. He actually plays the role very monotone, he isn't over the top at all. I can tell you right now if you're going to enjoy this film or not. In a particular scene Cage is offered a beer, he denies it saying \"I'm not drinking a beer unless I'm drinking it from the skull of Jonah King\". He fulfills this later on in the film, actually drinking beer from a characters skull. Cool? Hell yes!!! Are you not entertained? Skip this flick."

It becomes a chore to sit through the rest of the uninvolving movie, waiting for a set-piece or genuine surprise. It's also a throwback to the '70s-era exploitation movies of old, but where PLANET TERROR delivered on that nostalgic potential, DRIVE ANGRY, like MACHETE before it, fumbles the ball.\n\nThat's not to say it's entirely without merit, because undemanding or forgiving viewers might well enjoy it more than I did. It's an action-packed movie that delivers heavily on the thrills, with all manner of gruesome murder, car chases and explosions thrown in along the way. Sadly, many of the CGI effects sequences are very cheesy looking, particularly one involving a tanker which is absolutely ridiculous; this may be because of the film's 3D origins. The splatter effects are a little more convincing.\n\nNicolas Cage underplays the protagonist role and some might say he sleepwalks through the part, because if you're looking for a flicker of emotion you won't find it. Amber Heard is pretty but also pretty vacuous as the heroine along for the ride, and Billy Burke is a particularly uninteresting bad guy; in an era of more-more-more! Hollywood blockbusters, genuine menace seems to have been long forgotten when it comes to villains. The good news is that William Fichtner, playing the Devil's agent, is much better and something of a scene-stealer in this film, thanks to his wry humour. Character actor David Morse is also strong, albeit in a tiny role.\n\nCall me jaded, but I just get the seen-it-all-before feeling from this movie. I'm still waiting for something fresh, inventive and full of energy, and mostly importantly, something that fully involves you and engages you in the story. DRIVE ANGRY, while a superficially entertaining piece of movie-making, isn't that film."

Over the top acting, cheesy dialogue, fast cars, fast women, guns, and violence. Those elements can definitely create one wreck of a film, but only if the director and actors don't realize just how silly all of it is. When it's done properly, then it feels like a movie where everyone is in on the joke. It becomes a lot of fun instead. That's what I got from this movie, people were spouting off just ridiculous one liners right and left, but they were FUNNY. The audience in the theater when I watched this was laughing left and right.\n\nIf people are looking for a hard-boiled, violent thriller, with a very serious tone...then yes, you're most likely not going to enjoy this movie. This isn't some Charles Bronson revenge flick. You have to understand that sometimes you just have to shut your brain off, and enjoy the mindless violence and goofy plot.\n\nThe plot being: Cage escapes from hell to chase down a group of cultists who have murdered his daughter and his son-in-law. They've kidnapped his baby granddaughter to use in a satanic ritual to bring hell to earth.\n\nGoofy right? Totally. That's why it was fun. Cage plays his character completely deadpan straight. The hot blond is fiery and smokin hot, she's not there for her acting ability (although it wasn't terrible), the cult leader is so over the top you can't take him seriously (he's a cajun sans-genitals). The 'Accountant', a guard of hell of sorts plays it malicious and calculated, while surprisingly compassionate. The soundtrack had some really surprisingly awesome moments as well.\n\nThe 3d was done exceptionally well. No herky jerky moments, no fuzzy lines, no headaches, and it was easy to focus on and settle in as if you were looking through a window. Probably one of the better 3D jobs I've seen with the exception of Avatar.\n\nIf you like movies with action, violence, hot chicks, awesome cars, and insane villains...then give it a watch. It's a lot of fun."

So if anybody loves having a hydrogen tank on a truck driven by a guy causing mayham and who is able to walk out of the truck while it is crashing and stand on another car without a slight hitch then check out Akshay Kumar movies because they are performed better. Expect a lot of sex, nudity and bullshit. Prior to watching this movie I suggest you leave your brains completely out of the room. I give it a 4 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "If imitation is the best form of flattery, then \"Drive Angry 3D\"- with its sex, gratuitous nudity, over-the-top action, gore and violence- is the perfect form of flattery to the '70s exploitation films. Whereas Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's tribute was the decidedly self-conscious \"Grindhouse\", Patrick Lussier's homage has no more than the intention to remind audiences of the visceral pleasures to be had in something crass, crude and low-brow.\n\nIndeed, how else would you describe a film whose best sequence is one where its lead character, a certain John Milton (think the 17th century poem \"Paradise Lost\"), guns down a dozen heavily-armed Satanist-cult men in a hotel room, while doing a girl (NYPD Blue's Charlotte Ross) and taking slugs from a bottle of whiskey? Yes, that's the kind of unabashed fun Lussier isn't afraid to have, and the kind of delirium that he invites his audience to join him in on this wild rollicking journey.\n\nThe vehicle of choice is a '69 Dodge Charger, driven by a sexy, tough-as-nails waitress (Amber Heard) whose very short shorts you won't be able to take your eyes of. Just so you know not to mess with her, Heard is seen barely minutes into the film fist-fighting with a fully naked woman whom she caught her boyfriend in bed with. Milton enlists her help to pursue a Satanic cult leader (Billy Burke from the \"Twilight\" series) responsible for the murder of his daughter and the kidnap of his granddaughter.\n\nBut Milton isn't any ordinary vigilante- he's escaped from hell to seek vengeance, and Satan's henchman, simply known as the Accountant (William Fitchner), is hot on Milton's trail, determined to return him to the depths of hell. Lussier, who co-wrote the script with Todd Farmer, fills the characters with snappy dialogue but largely his narrative is about as straightforward as a highway.\n\nOf course, plot is hardly the point in a movie like this, and Lussier shows he is fully aware with every bullet, car, body, car part and body part he hurls at his audience. Gimmicky though it definitely is, there's no denying that- like his earlier \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\"- Lussier knows how to take good advantage of the additional dimension to bring the action to you. Lussier shot the entire movie in 3D- none of that lousy post-production business- and his commitment to gleeful subversion means that this is probably the most R-rated fun you will have in a 3D movie this year.\n\nThat same spirit is embodied in the performances of all his actors. Say what you may about Cage's films, but the actor's dedication to solemnity in the face of the film's trashy grindhouse formula is truly admirable. He makes his character work, just as Heard pulls off her no-nonsense character with gumption and gusto. The standout however is Fitchner, the actor delivering his lines with a deliciously dry wit that easily steals almost every scene he is in. Audiences may also recognise David Morse, who plays one of the Accountant's old earthly cronies.\n\nEvery one of the cast knows how to have a good time, and the result is a movie whose sheer insouciance and cheerful abandon is simply infectious to watch. Granted that it won't be for anyone, but if epic shootouts, knuckle-to-knuckle brawls, bare breasts and muscle cars sounds like your idea of fun at the cinemas, then get a 3D ticket and hop on for a fast, fun and furious journey that will have your heart pounding and your blood racing."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Milton (Cage) escapes from Hell. His daughter was taken and killed by Jonah King (Burke) a religious cult leader, who has plans to sacrifice Milton's baby granddaughter to usher in hell on earth. Milton comes back to see that doesn't happen.\n\nYou don't see many movies about people who have come back from Hell, do you? Well, you might like this one.\n\nI thought the beatings, shootings, murders, killings, maimings etc were over the top, but then I remembered this was for 3D in the theaters. So the over the top business was for the 3D effects. Quite good actually. And, so far they don't make enough DVDs in 3D except for the cartoon crowd. Bummer.\n\nA combo of actual stunts and CGI effects and the acting all around make this film enjoyable. Some sexual simulations and nudity early in the movie didn't last too long and not sure they were necessary, but we have to please the 7th and 8th graders who sneak into these shows. The music was good too except for one song that had too many f-bombs in it. Hey, the kids grooved on that bonus.\n\nA great job was done by William Fichtner as he played The Accountant. You may remember him from that almost never-ending TV show Prison Break (great show btw), where he also played a good FBI agent before he went bad. But, here the badge was just for show as being the Devil's Accountant he can be anyone he wants. So you see, there will be some kind of magic in here too. Didn't I mention that Milton escaped from Hell? You did read that, right? Where do you think The Accountant came from?\n\nAmber Heard who played Piper, will be some kind of threat to the young sexy female array that is out there now. She can act and is very pretty. Liken her to Charlize Theron if you like and I do. And, it was nice to see David Morse again and he needs to do more movies or at least find another good TV show. And, of course, Billy Burke, who played the bad guy, Jonah King, was terrific in that role.\n\nAs for Nicolas Cage, I just cannot get enough of his acting. Okay, he made a few mistakes: Wicker Man and Kick Ass, but hey, no one is perfect. The only thing better than watching Nicolas Cage act is to watch someone do a really good impersonation of him. It's really good.\n\nYes, this movie can come across as a little over the top, but keep in mind all that stuff was for the 3D effect in theaters. I did mention they don't do 3Ds for regular movie DVDs, right? Hmmmm\u0085\u0085..thought so.\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Quite explicit too. Nudity: Yes. Sex Talk: Yes, some in the beginning. Language in song: Yes, too many f-bombs in one song. Language: Yes."

Something i have never done before in 25 years of going to the cinema.\n\nIt was mildly entertaining in parts, there was some style to it and it was good to see amber heard in hot pants...... It also made me all warm inside to see cage get shot in the face as he's done such a bad job on this film. thats the good over with.\n\nNormally when i watch a film my imagination sweeps me along with the story even if there are silly plot holes and bad acting etc but it has to be said my imagination was severely tested watching this rubbish. It was so unrealistic in the way it was filmed, the way the characters interacted with each other, the way the characters reacted to things that i just couldn't sit through the whole film.\n\nAmber heard a very attractive skinny girl was able to beat up several stronger guys by punching, elbowing etc I think she would have snapped in 2 if she tripped over the curb let alone got into a fight! She is stunning but totally out of place in this movie.\n\nI guess i would have stayed and watched this to the end and been mildly entertained (and bored at the same time) if it hadn't been 3D and 3D prices. I paid \u00a39.40 + \u00a31 for glasses thats \u00a310.40 to watch a movie!!! This is the 4th so called \"3D\" movie I have seen at the cinema. I have come to the conclusion that \"3D\" only works when they add graphics or animation to the screen in some way. During a normal scene without glasses the background is fuzzy and the main characters stick out, with glasses the background clears up a little and the characters or other \"3D\" objects supposedly stand out from the screen a little. For me this is so hard to notice i really don't know why they bother??? I think this \"3D\" nonsense is just a big con to get us to pay more to see a film. Why is no one saying anything??? All this press attention telling us about this amazing revolution in the world of cinema. It's just a big con. Avatar was good because of the graphics and animation, from what I've seen they cannot create proper \"3D\" images of movies and people. thats why the whole \"3D\" thing was canned back in the 80's...... because it just doesn't work!!! I think we are all crazy spending our money on this sh*t just because the TV adverts tell us to. Are we really a nation of sheep??"

Why did so few people come to see this?\n\nOnce again the trailer is misleading. Study the trailer closely. And enjoy it. Because all the action and what little plot there was is in that trailer. The movie felt like the trailer padded to nearly 2 hours, and felt like a 15 hour snooze marathon.\n\nWhat little plot there was is not explained until FORTY FIVE minutes into the film. The first action scene with cars? over an HOUR into the film.\n\nBy then I was ready to walk out or fall asleep.\n\nNOTHING happens for most of the film..except a lot of cursing and graphic nudity. and some mindless and unexciting gun shots. There was no humor as all the jokes were lame or fell flat.\n\nPeople talk, walk, shoot some people, fist fight, and some driving - but the car chases were lame to me. After Transporter and Fast and the Furious franchises, I think we deserve more than seeing a 65 Chevy drive on an open dusty road at 90 mph.\n\nThe plot was too insane even to talk about.. but you should be warned that in addition to some very graphic sex scenes, there are scenes of graphic torture and satanic rituals.\n\nThe last 20 minutes tried to make up for the rest of the film by having non stop shooting and cars jumping over other cars. None of it was compelling and I had to prevent myself from going asleep.\n\nI saw My Bloody Valentine 3D (by the same director), and while that was a b-movie too, at least that film MOVED.\n\nThere was nothing that drove this film (pun intended).\n\nIt just meandered on and on..\n\nCage was not the problem. The script, cinematography and the direction was the problem.\n\nThe film was dim in many scenes, and others had bright spots that hurt my eyes (the result of 3D technology?) This film used 3d so poorly, that it could be used as the poster child on why 3D should end right here, right now, and never come back.. Ever.\n\nI was never so bored in my life.\n\nThis is one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen.\n\nAnd yet I think it had potential to be a real fun flick. The premise (what little there was) wasn't bad. But even there, they had TWO villains! and one of them was pretty weak..having 2 bad guys was confusing in a film that did not need any level of confusion..\n\nI left the theater wondering why so many people showed up tonight.\n\nI ended up driving angry on my way home, realizing the time and money wasted on this 3d film.\n\nMaybe that is what the title meant after all.\n\nI give it a 1.\n\nIf you are still interested in seeing this film in the theater, then I suggest you see it no later than Feb 27, 2011. I really can't imagine it lasting in the theaters much past that.\n\np.s. why people are rating this above a 3 is beyond me. Maybe they were in a better mood that I was.. To each their own, as I say. But I can't recommend this film to anyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fast cars, wicked guns, gratuitous nudity and unadulterated violence. No, we're still about a month away to the next Fast and Furious franchise, but while waiting for Vin Diesel and gang to zoom into cinemas, Patrick Lussier's Drive Angry powers into 3D cinemas here offering what would be as close to a B-grade exploitation/grindhouse film as possible, with plenty of tongue-in-cheekiness that often raises your eyebrow and let out a guffaw or two at the audacity of it all.\n\nNicolas Cage revisits his links with Hell again, no longer making a pact like he did as Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider (which he will be reprising in another reboot of sorts), but a Crow-esque like character called John Milton who steals a heck of a multi-barreled gun from Hell, and busts out of Hades back to Earth in search of the cult leader Jonah King, (Billy Burke, who played Bella's dad in Twilight) who had murdered his daughter and taken his infant granddaughter (yes, Cage plays a grandfather!) as a sacrifice to the devil. Needing to save his only kin he returns with bad attitude as the avenger on fire seeking to kill every cult member who stands in his way, and then some.\n\nAmber Heard continues in her blonde femme fatale stereotype as Piper the waitress whom Milton hooks up with for a deliberate reason other than that she drives a mean car - the black Dodge Charger (seriously with that kind of wheels and velvety purr of the engine who wouldn't want to hook up?) and embarking on a gun totting adventure together, filled with car chases and adversaries from both Earth and the nether world with The Acccountant (William Fichtner, the bank manager in The Dark Knight's opening scene) hot on their heels to try and recapture Milton back to where he belongs in the underworld. She doesn't have much to do here other than to look hot, swear and deliver some hard hitting punches and kicks, though Nicolas Cage also didn't venture any further with this role, growling constantly, posing and preening to look good when behind the wheel, or in preparation with his gear all set up for the next hit, blessed with a certain degree of invulnerability given his character's background.\n\nEveryone seemed to be going over the top with their roles, even the supporting ones, and throughout the film you felt that director Lussier probably instructed his cast not to get too serious with the material, with lame one liners standing in for witty wisecracks, big bang action that borders on the impossible but undoubtedly a lot more fun, cheesy special effects at times to lend some B-level gravitas, and action that had comical results at times. Take for instance a knock off from the Clive Owen-Monica Belluci starrer Shoot 'Em Up where the hero takes on a constant stream of faceless goons while making love, although this one had an unexpected, wickedly comical moment midway through that impossible feat.\n\nI'd watched this in the 2D version since I'm jaded with the slew of mediocre 3D offerings that employs the cheat sheat of not shooting the film in 3D but converting them during post production. This would be one of those films that would justify the 3D format given that it was shot in it, and had plenty of specifically crafted scenes done to exploit that medium, which honestly are quite nicely done since one does notice them when things start flying toward the screen, from the opening title right down to the finale with almost everything blowing to smithereens, sans 3D glasses.\n\nThis is that guilt trip of escapism and entertainment that cinema offers, if you're in need for that right mix of screen violence, comedy and action all rolled into one. It probably won't be an instant classic, but it's one heck of a modern update and tamer version of the grindhouse genre accessible to mainstream audiences."

We are after all talking about a film where the plot line reads as Nic Cage playing a vengeful father who escapes from hell and chases after the Satanists who killed his daughter and simultaneously kidnapped his granddaughter. Cue much gratuitous nudity, over-the-top action, some sex, extreme gore, car racing erections and violence that Tarantino probably wet dreams about.

Cage is effortlessly cool, which isn't hard as you smoke a cigar, bang a woman, and have a gunfight simultaneously. Fichtner is devilishly charming in his role, given us some of the most quotable, if cheesy, lines of the year. He also makes his role more than just a demonic badass. The film goes for laughs more than stomach unsettling gore, which is great as things fly from the screen. This and Piranha 3D are what 3D were made for.

It is so terrible that no matter what he does next it will still look like a masterpiece. I will admit that the first 20 minutes are great entertainment: Extreme violence, hot chicks and ridiculous dialogues sometimes work for me. But honestly, this is so exagereted and incoherent that you don't know if this is comedy, action, horror or just a big piece of crap that goes nowhere. I think that it could be easily the last option and by the way never ever consider watching it in 3d it will be the same horrendous movie just more expensive."

You are looking for good looking cars, good looking girls, action, and a chance to forget about reality, shut down your brain, and get lost in absurd fantasy. That's what this movies is all about,no deep message, just fun. I love the charger in this flick. The chevelle is nice too, but unlike the star character, I'm partial to the charger :-) I would have like to see it remain through out the entire movie, but at least it's there for most of it. Nicolas Cage has been given a hard time lately for his choice of movies. I enjoy him in just about every movie he makes. Whether action, fantasy, family, or some bizarre niche film he's worked on. He always gives a solid performance. I hope to see a second one of these. Not likely, but I can hope."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nicholas Cage nowadays reads about at most one line in a script before he accepts it. We all know that, but how the producer got Amber Heard and David Morse (whose character is completely unnecessary, waste of Morse's talent) to sign up for this is beyond my knowledge.\n\n\"Drive Angry\" is the most strange movie I've witnessed in a long time - still it wasn't strange in a way that makes you want to stop the movie, more in a way like \"Haha that doesn't make any sense, I have to keep watching.\" Or maybe it's just me feeling like that sometimes. Oh well.\n\nCage plays Milton, a man from hell seeking revenge for his brutally killed daughter. Heard plays.. well, a pretty normal American girl, except that her temper is slightly above average. Two completely different characters that ends up in a car together through this conversation:\n\n\"I don't pick up hitchhikers, you know.\"\n\n\"I wasn't stickin' out my thumb.\" (gets into car)\n\nThen some scenes later, it goes something like this:\n\n\"Piper... I won't lie to you. It's going to be rough. Are you sure about this?\"\n\n\"My whole life's been nothing but waiting. Waiting for it to mean something. Now it means something. I'm with you til' the end.\"\n\nThe movie contains so many cheesy lines it makes it funny. The action- and killing scenes are so unrealistic you will at least a few times burst up laughing. At least the ones involving \"The Accountant\", played by William Fichtner. You know, he's one of those characters impossible to kill, walking around in a suit with a FBI-badge disguised as a coin, you know? The clich\u00e9-one liners saves the movie so many times they should consider adding \"Comedy\" as another genre. It plays with the rules of mother nature, it contains completely necessary explosions, and lots of muscle cars.\n\nApart from this being a movie not made for sense-making, I still recommend you to jump into that Chevelle 454, and go with Milton and Piper as far from the Academy Awards as possible.\n\nAs I said, the movie is saved by the one liners.\n\n\"Give me one good reason I shouldn't shoot you in the face.\"\n\n\"I'm driving.\"\n\nI rest my case. Watch this movie. 6,5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Drive Angry rolls along with equal portions of car chases, gunfights, fistfights, and little character moments in a manner that doesn't allow how dumb it all is to seep in too much. It is uneven at times and it tries too hard in the first twenty minutes. The director Patrick Lussier (\"Scream\" Franchise) does a really good job of delivering fare for fans of exploitation movies and traditional genre fans alike. The cast is solid, Nicolas Cage doesn't show much remorse but his character here is more laid back. Amber Heard is great as she steals the show as Piper, and William Finchtner does well as the Accountant. He uses the 3D in a wide variety of ways and there were long stretches where I forgot I was wearing glasses and was enjoying the mayhem and then all of a sudden bullets are shot into my eyes in rapid succession.\n\nDrive Angry starts off strong and intense, then gets into its dramatic elements, somewhat squanders in the latter middle, then kicks back for a good conclusion. Hollywood has used it as a crutch or marketing gimmick. Regardless, 3D when used well or embraced for its heightened contribution to the experience is a joy. Overall, don't take Drive Angry too seriously as it is meant to be over the top, and a fun thrill ride. ================== As a rewatch (03/30/18') after several years later, opinions remain same about Drive Angry, it is an over the top action revenge film which delivers upon what it's intended to. The film knows its intentions of what its meant for and it delivers the proper thrills. Overall Drive Angry is engaging and although the film has been panned and received mixed reviews, it is one of Nic Cage's better action films. Recommend for those of grindhouse over the top action revenge thrillers."

I don't go commenting movies that often (in fact this is my first one on IMDb) but I just had to do it this time! Nicholas Cage used to do so many good movies! This is a horses ass! Sry.. Don't waste your money on it!\n\nThe plot seemed good though! That's why I saw it! It's about a guy that breaks out of hell to find his granddaughter and save her life from a group of satanical bastards. He is pursued by this guy in a suit that works for the devil and the character could have been really cool but somehow it's also wasted! The movie also features cool cars, a good-looking girl and big guns! But it all falls apart with crappy acting and a bleak story.. It could have been so much more! I would like to see more intensity and grunt in these types of movies! If you haven't seen Faster (with Dwayne Johnsson) or Taken (with Liam Neeson) then go and do it! Loads of hardcore action that will please and crowd! As for the name of the movie \"Drive Angry\".. Hmm yeah well, I for one could not see the angry part in Cages face... He looked like he shat himself throughout the whole movie! :S\n\nAs for the 3D-part.. I'd like to add that movies in 3D is major rubbish and doesn't make any movie better!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"All Hell Breaks Loose\" is truly the perfect tagline. John Milton (Nicolas Cage) breaks out of hell to save his grandbaby from the clutches of the Satanic Cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke) that killed his daughter. Along the way he is chased by \"The Accountant\" (William Fichtner) who is sent by the Devil to take Milton back to hell. Milton also picks up some help in his mission after running into the feisty Piper and beating up her cheating abusive husband.\n\nI was having a lot of fun watching the opening scenes of this movie. Nicolas Cage is truly going all out as a ruthless badass from hell and the cheesy catch-lines and over the top violence are hard not to get a kick out of. From the opening scene Milton blows up a car that had been driven by some bad guys and walks away in slow motion with the clich\u00e9 explosion going off behind him and hard rock playing in the background as if the film is saying \"Yeah, this is what we are doing. If you don't like it you can kiss our ass.\" I'm on board. Piper is also out of the ordinary in an awesome way. Aside from her amazing looks, she is no poster girl. She talks about sex constantly and doesn't take any crap from anybody. At one point she gets into her car and thumps music with the lyrics \"F the pain away\" blaring from her speakers and singing it loudly. Maybe that's a little bit too much but again: the winner of the \"kiss my ass if you don't like it\" award goes to Drive Angry. The award also doubles as an ash tray in case you were wondering. Drive Angry really starts to drive the point home that they are quite original yet a bit trashy when in one scene Milton takes down several bad guys while at the same time having sex with a waitress. Not kidding. This much like the movie brings on some entertaining laughs but also kind of makes you feel like you need to take a shower after watching it.\n\nEvery so often \"The Accountant\" shows up on screen again almost in T- 1000 form to deliver a few hilarious lines and lighten the mood while murdering a few big mouths or driving a propane tank through a road block of police while humming a happy song playing on the radio in the truck in his pursuit of Milton. This is always a refreshing change of pace and Fichtner really steals the show when he is on screen. Amid all the fun, explosions and filthy business the film starts to taper off once they actually try focusing on the storyline and the bad guys. Billy Burke was a good cast for the part of the manipulative and evil cult leader but the cult story didn't match the rest of the films over the top antics and I found myself getting bored quickly. Drive Angry is an easy movie to think back on and laugh about and it was a pretty fun ride. I'm gonna go take a shower now.\n\nMike Holtz, WeWatchedAMovie http://www.youtube.com/WeWatchedAMovie"

And pursuing Milton we have The accountant who is there to return Milton to hell where he belongs but doesn't really bring any life to the film. Also there was seemingly a need to put as many lame one liners in the film as possible which was more embarrassing then anything else! It did on a plus side have some slightly entertaining action scenes and some very nice looking cars! All in all its a very poor film which leads to a very disappointing ending. Worth a watch once if you are a fan of Cage or some of the other actors if not then I'd suggest you stay away!"

Action star Cage, has excelled again, in bringing us sure rapid fire entertainment, and that's exactly what you get with Drive Angry. Though not one of Cage's best performances, which did earn him raspberry status, the cool, calm, collective Cage is always fun to watch. Somehow, he always involves us, a man on a mission. Here, his mission, is to snatch his baby granddaughter from a religious cult, with only few days to do so. If failing to find her, what will result, is basically a hell on earth, as the infant, is to be sacrificed, for evil purposes. We have heavy doses of violence, so over the top, it isn't funny, amongst some shocks and surprises in a darn original story that never lets up. Featuring some quite nasty characters, none more than Billy Burke, the stealer of this show, (what else has this guy done?) as the evil religious leader, who you can't wait to see square off with Cage, you've got 100 minutes of compulsive viewing with a nice little twist at the end. William Fichter is great and commandingly cool, as The Accountant, a sort of guardian angel figure to Cage, who at first, you think is really one of the bad guys. Amber Heard adds sexy female involvement to this tale. An exciting action spectacle and movie experience like this, is something you don't wanna miss, believe me. It almost should be mandatory, in fact."

However, it's very easy to attempt to make a cult movie and fail utterly from trying too hard. This one stars Nicholas Cage as a man escaped from Hell trying to save his infant granddaughter from being sacrificed by Satanists. Cage has become a cult icon of late, but a lot of the love he gets is purely ironic. Perhaps he realizes this, perhaps he doesn't. He really seems unenthused to be in this film, whatever the case, and his boredom saps any energy the film might otherwise have. He is the film's biggest problem, but hardly its only. The film's cynical over-the-topness is pretty annoying, too. There really is a fine line, isn't there? It depends on the viewer, of course. I find the Crank movies a lot of fun, Shoot 'Em Up just a tad too much, and then there's this. It doesn't help that the special effects suck pretty hard. Too much CGI blood and too many CGI explosions. That never looks right. Drive Angry has a couple of performances worth mentioning. William Fichtner, always a reliable character actor, has a nice role as Satan's accountant, up on Earth trying to get Cage back. The film's best performance comes from Billy Burke, who plays the lead Satanist. He's highly amusing. Amber Heard isn't too bad in the female lead, but I'd rather have had Katy Mixon (who was wonderful on HBO's Eastbound and Down), who plays her co-worker, as the lead. She's sexy in a unique way, with some fat in just the right areas, while Heard is more the generic, skinny blonde chick."

At the same time the devil sends one of his assailants to go after the Nicolas Cage character. One of the major problems is that the film assumes that because viewers are already aware of Nicolas Cage's previous films with hell themes in them, that we would tolerate him on this one without any kind of explanation whatsoever. The racing and car crash scenes are quite decent even though improbable. This is a film definitely not for children."

The makeup in some scenes is leveled to a trash movie. 100% disappointment and my expectations were not high at all.

I recommend you stay away from this movie if you expect the minimum accepted for the less thinking living beings and if you have some respect to Nicholas Cage work. Total disaster."

        "review_title": "Drive Angry 3D Review by Brian",
        "review_detailed_main": "So where to begin with magnum opus Drive Angry 3D? The movie is Nicolas Cage at his Best or his Worst, depending on how you feel about Cage. Cage is one of the best guilty pleasures. If you have not seen Vampires Kiss, do yourself a favor and get some friends, a six pack of beers, and watch Vampires Kiss. It will be a night you will soon not forget.\n\nDrive Angry 3D is directed by Patrick Lussier who recently gave us My Bloody Valentine 3D, which I have to say was quite the pile of crap. Despite it's financial gain and mind-boggling positive buzz, but what do I know. He also directed White Noise: 2 \"The Light\". Staring my personal hero Nathan Fillion. As far as direct to DVD sequels go, this one is actually wayyy better than the original, with Michael Keaton. I highly recommend Netflixing it, but I am getting off topic\u0085\n\nI need to start of by saying I have a deep dislike, almost hatred, of 3D. The technology is not there yet, it destroys the quality of the picture, and gives me headaches while watching. The 3d of this movie is what I call \"passable\". It was OK enough and not as annoying as Clash of the Titans or Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nOn to the real review! Drive Angry is the basically the story of Paradise Lost if you happen to know this book. Cage's character is even named John Milton, and there are several other references to the book. This however is a fantastic \"Carsploitation\" B-Movie, it completely lives up to its title. The Plot is Milton (Cage) escapes from hell to save his granddaughter from a satanic cult, lead by Jonah King (Billy Burke). Along the way Milton is accompanied by a tough as nails girl named Piper (Amber Heard). But trying to stop Milton is \"The Accountant\" (William Finchtner).\n\nSo Nic Cage plays a very similar to role to that of\u0085. I would say Con Air, without the silly accent. The movie never tries to take itself seriously so you are able to laugh the whole time at the insanity that ensues. I can tell you there are many fantastic one liner's Cage delivers in this movie, as well as Finchtner. All in all Cage does is exactly what we expect him to do. It's when he isn't trying to take himself seriously it works great (try to forget his streaming pile of crap from earlier this year, Season of the Witch). Amber Heard is in this movie as 100% eye candy, you can see See acting skills have not progressed at all over the past few years. She tries to deliver these heard felt lines but I can't take anything this girls says seriously, no offense. I think if we had maybe seen some explicit skin by the young lady I would have been more than happy with her appearance. Since this is a tongue in cheek movie her performance doesn't hurt the film in anyway.\n\nIt's Finnchter though that takes his role and knocks it out of the park, and makes the movie that much better. You've seen Finchtner in Heat and The Dark Knight. Finchtner is a fantastic character actor and on many accounts saves this movie, or just gives it that extra special something. He has one liner after one liner and you will remember and laugh at every single one of them. Quite possibly the best is when he runs a Nitroglycerin tanker towards a wall of police cars and simply walks out of the car and stands on a police car hood, as the tanker goes \"boom\". For the movie everyone acting serves its purpose.\n\nI quickly want to touch on David Morse. Morse is a fine actor and is severely underused in this movie. It's a shame they couldn't use him more, I can't even remember his characters name\u0085\n\nAll the cars, and the stunt driving in this movie is all top notch and very fun to watch. All of the cars are classic American muscle cars, no silly Japanese imports in this movie! They flip, roll, and do a bunch of different stunts, my hat goes out to the stunt drivers.\n\nThis is your basic revenge movie, in terms of plot. Milton wants to save his granddaughter from a satanic cult and will kill anyone in his way. Since his break out the Devil has been chasing down Milton on his quest, and has sent \"The Accountant\".\n\nI had a lot of fun at this movie and laughed out loud at several scenes and can recall a lot of them, mostly with Finchtner, I sound like a broken record, but he really does steal the show. For what it is, the movie is fantastic. For more positive there is a ton of nudity, violence, and cars.\n\nI highly recommend that Lussier stick to \"tongue in cheek\" movies. He should for sure try to advance his camera work & possibly storytelling, but his movies really don't really hinge on story. Let's be honest though, no one is seeing a movie titled \"Drive Angry\" for the story.\n\nIn the end I will give this movie 6.5 out 10 / or a C+/B-\n\nIf you are a guy, this is a good movie for the guy's night out. Girls, I may recommend letting your man go and taking a pass on this one.\n\nThank You for reading and as always ENJOY THE MOVIES!"

And so, beginning with the opening credits until the finale. Amber Heard is very pretty actress, but she absolutely can not act, her dialogues is terrible stupid. And Cage... O Lord, Nicolas Cage acts in the film so bad that's not even funny in the end it becomes. William Fichtner is the only person who act well in all movie, but unfortunately he has a small amount of time. Montage, special effects are terrible. Already in 2011, we could do something much better. All too cartoon, so much so that hurts the eyes.I do not recommend you watch this film, even in 3-D"

I just can't wrap my head around how Cage agreed to make this movie, it is way below his level !!! what ever happened to the \" Face off \" and the \" Rock \" days ?? I hope I see him do something better in the future.."

In contrast to CONSTANTINE (2005), DRIVE ANGRY (2011) focused more on the gore, 3D, the sex, nudity, humor rather than sophisticated and qualitative wry, intrigue of CONSTANTINE. The Accountant played by William Fichtner in DRIVE ANGRY was a credible counterpart to Peter Storemare's Satan. Pruitt Taylor Vince gets a small role in DRIVE ANGRY from his more involved role in CONSTANTINE. Nicholas Cage's character starts off with a fascinating serious/light demeanor in the initial cafe scene with the first waitress though unfortunately, his portrayal becomes more two-dimensional quickly. The 3-D effects are more prominent and effective (though still not authentically realistic yet) and put to good use than most 3-D movies. There were a few continuity issues. The fight scenes at times seemed a jumble and unnecessarily hard to follow, particularly as the cinematic technique at times was quite effective. The interplay between Cage's character and the Accountant was a nice touch. The cult leader, Jonah King, however, didn't seem to have the charismatic or strong presence to back up the importance of the role. One of the more intriguing and interesting characters was The Sarge played by Marc McCauley who brought a heavy-weight presence in his small role. Overall, the movie was decent enough, if not really that consistently tight and consistent in tone."

It's not Cage's fault to do a movie worth 50 mil budget but it is his fault to do a movie with a director, who has directed \"My bloody Valentine 3D\". First of all Nicolas Cage is too old to take revenge now and then revenge from Hell, that's little too much. The supernatural element has never been visualized in more horrendous way than we see here. The only reason I was interested in this movie was because of Amber Heard, she may not be a good actress but man she is smoking HOT. Even this time, I was able to tolerate this crap on DVD. Billy Burke is irritating, after watching him in \"Red Riding Hood\" as creepy father/Wolf & now here as creepy Devil/Di*kless Worshiper. O' it will be really tough to see him as Bella Swan's father in \"Twilight:Breaking Dawn\". I can't say more about this pukeble adventure of sh*t, Trash It!"

Shoot, the steamy Oscar winning productions are still playing in my area. While this isn't saying much, \"Drive Angry 3D\" may actually be the best out of your acquired taste. After all, what's playing? A Justin Bieber 3D concert, a lame Adam Sandler flick, and an out-of-style sex comedy. Those choices certainly won't put my hot butt into a seat. The difference is, \"Drive Angry\" is exactly what you pay for when walking in. So it's quite impossible to feel cheated going into something you knew full well what you were getting into. Boobs, sex, drugs, hell, severed limbs, hot chicks, and blood. All in 3D. It's like going to McDonalds, and ordering the most greasiest, unhealthiest burger, but it just tastes so good that you want to savor your every bite.\n\nThis latest Nicholas Cage camp-romp is about Cage's daughter being murdered. However, the daughter's baby is still alive, but some Satanic tribe is holding the baby captive. Cage, already dead in hell, must retrieve the child before it falls victim at the crack of dawn.\n\nFirst off, is this movie so-bad-it's-good or just so-bad-it's-bad? Definitely the former. The film knows exactly what it is, and always does its best to keep it that way. The jokes are funny, the actors are involved, and the film is just non-stop, juvenile fun. How's the gore? Not too bad. You get many unexpected deaths, some dismemberment here and there, and tons of blood splatter. How's the gratuitous nudity? Pretty moderate. There's no shortage, but it's definitely not over-excessive (ala \"Piranha 3D\"). Now, the 3D? It's just very immersing considering the fact it was shot in the third dimensions, it plays the gimmick off well, and you get some nice depth.\n\nCage hasn't been in anything good lately, but the film breaks that mold. Cage finally puts his fake wig, and campy persona to good use. What better way to flesh out than in a slice-'em- and-dice-'em B-flick. Also, this movie is very nostalgic. When I saw the opening credits, the typical \"diner\" setting, and the last 20 minutes, I just felt like it was the 70's all over again. This is a TRUE grindhouse movie.\n\nWhat are the problems? Well, this movie is pretty entertaining, but the gore ran a little lower than I expected. Sure, you get a lot of fluids, but not many severed limbs. Also, I thought the film could've pushed the envelope a bit more. For a 70's B-flick car film, you would think it would go over the edge a bit. \"Piranha 3D\" is the best example. It broke a record for the most blood in a film, it could potentially break another for most on-screen nudity in a mainstream film, and it pushed the envelope so far that it was just a hair away from an NC-17.\n\nIs \"Drive Angry 3D\" a good movie? No. Is it a fun, balls-to-the-wall one though? Hell yes (pun intended). It promises the goods, and it delivers them. While the grindhouse sub-genre has fared better in the past, this isn't such a bad addition. The outcome is satisfactory enough. Cage should just stick to movies like this from now on. He'll never go back to his \"Face/Off\" days, but just seeing him poke fun at himself isn't a bad way to throw in the towel. Right Cage?"

It can give you some great wild ideas. Some great driving sequences and who know a bit of revenge and fistful of action as well. But one thing I can say about 'Drive Angry'. If you are about to drive after watching this flick then you better tighten your seat belts as you will be so angry when you come out of the theater and yelling for your money back! I'm finding it difficult to come up with something to actually tell good about it. Maybe the explosions?\n\nNaaah. We have seen better ones than that. Maybe the acting then? You gotta be kidding me. Cage looks good in those shades but acting? He has totally lost the charisma. Do better movies dude. You used to be on top of my best actors list.\n\nAmber Heard you got my attention. But right where the skin is showing and the pants are short. The rest of you suck. What happened to all these people? It's just like you act on a movie with no one is acting. The only watch worthy performance comes from William Fichtner. Yeah man you rock. You are totally out of hell police.\n\nDrive Angry honestly is the worst movie I watched this year. The plot is typical with a bit of twist here and there. Packs a lot of BS in the name of hell and revenge. I don't buy that sorry. Maybe someone tried to be Quentine Torantino but has failed miserably. My advice to all the folks out there. If you want to waste time play a computer game at least.

        "review_detailed_main": "Drive Angry is what it is: a pulp film with 70s sensibilities and though pretty fun it's kind of the perfect DVD choice for the 4AM frat party cold pizza and beer after-party.\n\nThe plot sees John Milton out to rescue his daughter from a rather committed bunch of satanists - it's all pretty cheesy - and the horror elements are very lightweight - the violence is pretty much comic book style - limbs fly etc; but nothing \u00e0 la Sin City.\n\nAll in all this was pretty fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, but plays it just deadpan enough to live up to its pulp goals. If you like hard action films with guys chicks and cars you could do worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "Directed by Patrick Lussier, who edited all of Wes Craven's later films and directed the remake of My Bloody Valentine, this film was originally shot to take full advantage of the 3D process. It's as close as a grindhouse film as you're going to get when you're spending $29 million to make a film.\n\nJohn Milton (Cage) died ten years ago and went to Hell, but he's broken out and stolen Satan's gun, The Godkiller, to come back and get revenge against Jonah King (Billy Burke, Lights Out and The Twilight Saga), a cult leader who killed Milton's daughter and plans on killing his granddaughter in order to bring Hell to Earth.\n\nOn his way to the abandoned Stillwater prison to kill the evil cultist, he runs across Piper (Amber Heard, Mera in the upcoming Justice League, the remake of The Stepfather, Machete Kills), a waitress with bad luck in boyfriends. Directly after telling Milton her boyfriend is a good guy, she catches him in bed with a real estate agent. She kicks the woman's naked ass literally to the curb and attacking her boyfriend, who assaults her. Milton saves her and they make their escape by stealing his 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 440.\n\nThat's when we meet Satan's agent, The Accountant (William Fichtner, as close as we're going to get to a character actor in this day and age). His mission? Get Milton and The Godkiller back to Hell. He carries an Obolos, the coin that the Greeks would put over a dead man's eyes as a payment to Charon, the ferryman for the dead. He can use the coin to become a badge or as a weapon. He kills Piper's boyfriend and takes two cops with him to hunt down Milton.\n\nAfter a night of drinking, both Milton and Piper are hooking up (not with one another, but with folks they found at the bar, though all Piper lets the guy do is paint her nails) when King and his men attack. Milton doesn't even stop having sex with the blonde he's with, shooting and killing numerous men before he gets hit with a taser, which ends up giving her an orgasm \u2014 I've never seen that in a movie before!\n\nRead more at https://bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/08/28/drive-angry-2011/"

        "review_detailed_main": "This could have been amazing. A guy escapes from Hell to stop some devil worshippers from using his baby granddaughter as a human sacrifice. I'm not a fan of Nic Cage at all but in this film he puts in a decent performance, only surpassed by Amber Heard as his sidekick. Whenever Heard is on screen this is very watchable. She and Cage have pretty good chemistry and the plot in a nutshell is simple and fun. Unfortunately there are way too many dull subplots going on that really kill the pace of the film. One minute you'll be marvelling at what fun this film is. Some of it is bonkers, action packed and funny. And then there are tedious scenes that go on for ages where characters just explain the plot or reel off dull dialogue in very slow monotone voices. Billy Burke is sadly miscast as the bad guy. He has little in the way of motive and he's just mincing around making evil speeches. It should be a fun part, the kind that Gary Oldman used to do in his sleep or John Travolta did in Broken Arrow. Instead you find yourself wanting to skip scenes looking for more Nic and Amber and fast cars. William Fichtner is added into the mix too and although he's okay, many of his scenes could have been deleted. At times early in the film it felt like he and Burke were playing the same character. Overall it's worth a watch. I love this kind of film. It has fast cars, nudity, gun fights, slapstick violence with garden tools, a sexy sidekick, a guy who escaped from Hell, and devil worshippers. It could have been the best film ever. But it's just ok."

Hot car, hot chick, hot mess of a backstory. Wrap a thirteen-in-a-dozen revenge tale with a occult twist to it, and we have a movie! Nick Cage himself being an actor that has movies that are eather great or just 'meh', this one hangs a bit in between. It's a character that he does well because it's just his thing; unbalanced, damaged and out for killing, we've seen that a dozen times before. The female lead, portrayed by Amber Heard is pretty shallow. Some boyfriend problems, and suddenly her boobs are along for the ride. That's het role in a nutshell.\n\nThe story is okay for it being what it is, and the coating is pretty nice. I personally enjoy a bit of occult underlining anytime and Drive Angry has a good enjoyable version of it. The action scenes are nothing we have not seen before but also, as far as they go, are amusing to watch. But if you like movies with not too much plot to distract you from the brainless onslought of violence - and there is nothing wrong with that from time to time - this is a perfect flick."

A man in a suit known only as 'The Accountant' (William Fichtner, the ONLY reason for suffering this nonsense) is hot on his trail, keen to take him 'home'. Milton meets a stray girl, bangs a floozie, kills people, drives angry, and kills more. And I swear it is so boring you'll probably start reading a book before the credits end.\n\nThe car chases are so poorly done, the action so flatly staged, one has to wonder if Patrick Lussier was directing this inbetween afternoon naps. A very cheap, worthless film that is not worth keeping. If you insist on ridding yourself of your hard-earned dough...give it to the poor and needy."

In this throwback rife with cult cars like the Buick Riviera, Dodge Charger and the Chevrolet Chevelle audience are bound to get exactly what is suggested: threadbare plotting thrown over a bloody, but ultimately satisfying piece of pulp.\n\nNicholas Cage takes front stage with a typically crass performance, but thankfully this time it works without the confines of the story. Cage plays John Milton, an escapee straight from the ultimate prison: hell (thankfully a far cry from the terrible Johnny Cage role). Fresh on his heels is The Accountant (William Fichtner), a reinvented version of death, ruthless, cool and always professional. Milton however has a ultimate goal: save his grand-daughter from the clutches of an evil cult led by charismatic Satan-worshipper Jonah King (Billy Burke). While attempting to find a ride he meets waitress Piper (Amber Heard), soon heading off together to release the innocent infant from the clutches of the mad group before she is sacrificed during the full moon (thus bringing about hell-on-Earth)...\n\nHolding back no punches from the get-go \"Drive Angry\" lacks any pretence - if you dislike to opening crescendo just pass. Else strap yourselves in, enjoy the grinding bout of road rage and you might actually find a lot to your satisfaction, as long as you inhibit your logic receptacles and craptometers. Overflowing with one-liners (with some truly memorable ones like \"I never disrobe before a gunfight\") the true joy of the picture comes from an inspired performance by William Fichtner, whose Accountant truly brings the movie credence and memorable enjoyment. Played with admirable restraint in violence Fichtner brings devilish charm to his role and as if to highlight his importance is offered the best dialogue. Somewhat underused in the final act I sure as hell won't shy away from a sequel that features The Accountant even more prominently. All in all the dark comedy, gritty action and goretastic needless violence might not suit all tastes, but - then again - it never was meant to."

This is really not a great movie. It's actually a movie so bad, it is good. I could not help myself but enjoy some of these bloody scenes and extreme violence.\n\nThis film is about a guy named John Milton who has escaped from hell in order to find a satanic cult who has murdered his daughter and are about to sacrifice his only connection to her. He picks up a young waitress to help him on his job as they try to avoid \"The Accountant\" as he has to send John back into the depths of hell.\n\nWell, this film features lots of over-acting. Nicholas Cage is probably the only actor who would do this kind of role and he does it quite well. William Fichtner is very good as \"The Accountant.\" Billy Burke is also worth watching in his over-acting role as the leader of the cult.\n\nOverall, this is a film that makes no sense and should not have been made. But, I'm sort of glad it did. This is a film that requires no brains, but a stomach for blood. I had a good time watching this film even thought the last grindhouse film made, Machete is three times better. I actually liked Drive Angry up to a certain point. I rate this film 6/10."

This one is particularly violent, with a blood and gore and spilled guts ratio that would compare to what the average fan of this genre would hope to find. I am, of course, here for no other reason than, arguably, the most exciting contemporary actress, Amber Heard. Usually, when I wax lyrical, it is about some actress in a long- forgotten TV show or (Eighties/Nineties) old movie, but Amber's been pretty much in the news lately, she is well-known, and there are hordes Amber fans out there. I know her from ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE and AND SOON THE DARKNESS, and soon I will be settling in for another unlikely choice, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. Yeah, following on the trail of favorite actresses, I do encounter some odd titles, films I'd never have gone for.\n\nThis one, it is how it is described on Wikipedia, \"brash, loud\" in spades! High octane, tortured steel, smell the petrol fumes, the burning rubber.\n\nThere is really only one thing letting the side down.\n\nNicolas Cage.\n\nHe is some kinda big fraud. Actor? Him? I've never ever seen him in any way convincing in any movie. This is no exception. The man cannot pull off being an action hero. He couldn't even pull off being down and out in LEAVING LAS VEGAS. I have to admit, I've never been a Nicolas Cage fan, he was ridiculous in WILD AT HEART, disliked him ever since, and his presence in a movie is kinda off-putting for me already, which is why I was kinda skeptic about obtaining this title, but the trailer convinced me I gotta have it for Amber's sake.\n\nTestosterone-laden way the movie starts, quite too much for me. I'm thinking, what overblown junk, but okay, Amber movie, just hold on, she'll be here. And then she does, and when she transforms outside the diner, there is just no looking back. The most exciting female star of the time?\n\nAmber Heard is 1000% perfect for this movie. I doubt anybody else in the whole wide world could have remotely come close. She is jaw-dropping stunning, and portrays the necessary attitude, man, I cannot do the chick justice, she is just a force, a force beyond comparison that defies description.\n\nDo I go for a character like hers? No. I am old school. I do a bit of writing myself, and I have frilly-girl heroines, they are very gentle creatures, they do show their mettle when they are cornered, but they're not even really Me Generation types, what say Urban Grrrls, like Piper here, the type of survivor our declining society has produced.\n\nBut Amber is absolutely a thrill to behold. The action heroine to end all kick-ass action heroines. Utterly convincing. Which is more than can be said for old Nick there.\n\nBut okay, to be fair... The movie is such a force, sweeping you along, by the end all really got to me... And I even looked past my criticism of ol' Nick. This whole thing is BEYOND DESCRIPTION something unbelievably GREAT! Highly recommended, not for the squeamish, for action fans."

I'm not one of your average, everyday,fancy pants, wanna be movie critics who write a review just to read back to themselves time and time again, and in fact this is the first review I've ever written about anything, so now go and watch it at least once and enjoy! Having said that I will make an honest appraisal of Mr-Watson 2006 who wrote; that this movie won his Oscar for the worst movie he has ever seen; and chides the acting abilities of Nicolas Cage. Obviously Mr Watson has never seen 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' or Nicolas Cage in one of his finer performances such as '8MM'. End of story!"

Drive Angry, a 3D explosion of sex, violence and mythology is in the same tradition and that puts it centuries ahead of the typical thriller/horror movie in continual recycle today."

From the now legendary movies \"Con Air\" and \"Face Off\" his career has been on a steady downfall, for years now. Occasional bearable performances (like the one in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", mainly because the movie didn't utterly suck) from him, remind us that in those distant days, Nicolas Cage had some sense in choosing his movies. Nowadays he just \"stars\" in any crap they throw on his table.\n\nThis particular movie seems as though it was meant to be seen by 12-year old's as it contains a large number of \"cool\" moves and \"cool\" action scenes. Or rather a number of scenes that want to look cool, but come of as a mockery. Seemingly interesting story is left ruined by the quality of the script, which is indeed very poor and borders with absurdity. One thing that's even worse than script is directing. And another thing that's even more worse is acting. One of the most horrific performances of the, now notorious, Nicolas Cage, but in this movie, luckily for him, he's not alone. Billy Burke and David Morse complete the trilogy of bad acting. William Fichtner has a strange role, so he acts accordingly, which produces a performance you may or may not like, depending on your preference of quirky characters. The other standout is the beautiful, feisty, southern girl played by Amber Heard. She does an OK performance which comes off as a standout due to catastrophic acting all around her.\n\nThe motives of the characters are well portrayed, but everything else is horrible. Some scenes are absolute rubbish, and one cannot help but wonder, why, oh why... Avoid at all costs."

When I started watching it was with the sole intent of watching something easy and entertaining but it failed to deliver on all levels. The story is terrible, the acting is beyond bad and even the thing I figured would make this an OK film, the special effects, were awful. To be fair I have to say that I didn't watch it in 3D though.\n\nI've never been a big fan of Nicholas Cage as an actor even though I think he's done a few memorable roles throughout the years (I'm thinking about for instance \"Kick Ass\", \"Adaptation\" and \"Leaving Las Vegas\").\n\nMy advice to you, if you're not gonna watch this movie in 3D, don't see it at all!"

For the past several years his career has hit the wall and he has found himself in a lot of mediocre to poor movies that barely rate a mention. Today Nicolas Cage is a far cry from the actor who used to be one of my top 5 favourite actors growing up. On my list Leaving Las Vegas (1995), The Rock (1996), Con Air (1997), Face/Off (1997), Adaptation (2002) and Matchstick Men (2003) were certainly his most memorable movies. Drive Angry was certainly not a highlight for Nicolas Cage. This brainless car wreck of a movie was just awful. Drive Angry is another one of those movies that I disliked so much that I just could not persist with this movie right to the finish.\n\nJohn Milton (Nicolas Cage) manages to escape from hell after Satanist cult members led by Jonah King (Billy Burke) murder his daughter and take her baby with intention of sacrificing the baby. With the help of a waitress named Piper (Amber Heard). To stop the sacrifice going ahead, Milton and Piper tear through the highways in a 1971 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS that Milton has been given. To complicate further matters, Satan's merciless henchman known as The Accountant (William Fichtner) who is also disguised as a FBI agent has been sent to rein Milton back into hell.\n\nThis was one of the most disappointing and unmemorable movies for Nicolas Cage. His movies are just a joke now, and as an actor I have lost faith in him. The plot is a complete mess and a total disaster. As I said at the start, I could not be bothered finishing the movie. Everything about Drive Angry was bad.\n\nSave your money and save your brain cells, because Drive Angry is one of those movies that you should not waste your time with.\n\n1/10."

Rating: 6/10.\n\nTHIS wild, bizarre, ultra violent seventies-style grindhouse action horror flick finds Nic Cage wearing perhaps his most ridiculous on screen wig yet. Cage is pretty cool, though, as John Milton, a haunted father who escapes from Hell (with the Devil's right hand man, played by William Fichtner, in hot pursuit) and sets out to save his granddaughter from satanic cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke) who is about to sacrifice the infant under a full moon.\n\nMilton teams up with a tough, two-fisted, hot pants-wearing waitress named Piper (Amber Heard) - who has had enough of her cheating boyfriend and certainly does not hit like a girl , and the two head off down the Louisiana highway in a stolen 1969 Dodge Charger.\n\n\"Drive Angry 3D\" is not subtle, and the amount of blood-spattered violence and the abundant nudity ensure that is not for all tastes. Nor is it a particularly good film. Plus, it falls to pieces about two-thirds of the way through. But it so outrageous that anyone, like me, with a passion for gritty, violent, cheesy, car chase-filled seventies action cinema will find things to appreciate about it. The performances are interesting (especially from Fichtner and Morse), Heard is real easy on the eyes, a lecherous fat man gets his testicles twisted by Piper, and it contains the funniest, most violent, audacious and shocking sex scene/shoot out ever seen on the screen. Plus, the 3D effects are rather good."

Then throw Nick Cage in, blammo. It was all about giving the masses what they crave the most without any pretense about it. Reminds me of the opening of Swordfish, which was in the same league but a little better, where they tell you right up front that 90% of what Hollywood makes is crap, as if that is an excuse. They did it for the same reasons they put a warning on a pack of cigarettes.\n\nOf course, the makers and fans would lecture me about how ironic and cool it all is. As if everyone who is in the know knows that if you exploit or pay homage to bad movie concepts, you are merely being uber-hip. And if you complain about the poor taste and the absolute degeneracy and pointlessness of it all, you are being old fashioned and moralizing. After all, what more is important than keeping over grown 11 year olds satiated with macho violence, cheap sex and the cheesiests of supernatural, demonic and baby sacrificing plot elements.\n\nThere is a cult cache to this movie, because of Nick Cage and the extreme drive-in movie ascetics of the film. I will compare this to a true cult style film I saw recently, \"Super\". \"Super\" was cult like because it had a totally off the wall approach to the story, with a totally non traditional ending to boot. While \"Super\" had its share of violence, it didn't degenerate into one big gun battle, chase scene or explosion. There is a big difference to Nick Cage doing the usual Hollywood killing machine, tossing out the normal cheap one liners afterward, act versus huge ungainly Rainn Wilson bopping street criminals over the head with a 16\" pipe wrench while dressed in a home made red costume.\n\nThe makers know their market audience and there is no doubt they gave them what they wanted. So I guess it makes me an \"elitist\" of sorts, since basically by slamming this pile of exploitative trash, I slam a large group of lowbrow rubes who eat up this sort of video equivalent of a 3 liter plastic bottle of cheap soda. It is soul-less, crude, cheap movie and being candid about it doesn't cure the problem. Nor does Cage's presence make it any more palatable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some films do as the title suggests or give a good indication as what to expect but Drive Angry fails to deliver. Even with a budget of $50 million, every scene with cars sees them driving at moderately fast speeds but never reaches the insanity of Bad Boys 2 or The Rock. Although after all this time, I think I should know what to expect from Nicolas Cage today.\n\nWhether or not the actor is out of his financial troubles or not, the films keep on coming and while Drive Angry is not his worst one to date, it is by no means his best. He does give a fairly decent performance as John Milton, a man who escaped from hell to save his granddaughter but lacks any energy. In Season of the Witch he plays a soldier drained by endless war and here again he looks tired and beaten. This can work sometimes but we never feel any sympathy for him really because the film never tries. It doesn't help that the villain is no more than a crazed country lunatic in charge of a cult.\n\nWhat makes the film entertaining is William Fichtner who always gives a solid performance at the very least. Here is steals the entire film when he is on screen as The Accountant. Amber Heard pales in comparison to Fichtner but still does a good job even with a weak script and will undoubtedly move on to greater things in the future.\n\nThe action itself is fun but never really escalates. The way the film is clearly shot for 3D makes the action entertaining but since Cage's character is shot repeatedly and never dies takes something away from the film. There are also a few CGI moments that fail to impress, particularly one towards the end.\n\nAs a film not to be taken seriously, its OK and passes as an entertaining action film while watching it but in retrospect, the film lacks any substance or reason to care for what is going on. For a film that is meant to be about the driving but instead the characters stop at the sight of a roadblock and cannot deliver on one decent car chase, that should probably tell you enough."

For those who venture into these lands there is both idiocy and awesomeness to be found, but the exact points where idiocy becomes awesomeness and vice versa will vary from person to person. For me Drive Angry was a slightly frustrating experience, occasionally blossoming into awesome, often incredibly silly but strangely for a film of such fast pace, somewhat underpowered. The enticingly ludicrous premise sees Nic Cage as a dead criminal escaped from Hell, on a mission to retrieve his baby grand-daughter from a Devil worshipping cult who intend to sacrifice her and bring about Hell on earth or somesuch. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure known as The Accountant is on a mission to take him back to Hell where he belongs, sparing no excesses in doing so. Oh and a generic spunky waitress gets mixed up in it all as well, so teenagers have a bit of girl candy to look at alongside all the blood and explosions. By all rights this should be a real winner of a film, it doesn't take itself seriously, indeed packs a good deal of wilful absurdity and its excesses are often amusing. Somehow though, it doesn't all come off. One problem is the over stylised and frenetic nature of the action. The craziness by and large is such that all that is necessary to catch it in satisfactory fashion is a steady camera and some sense of framing, yet there are all too many uses of CGI or slow motion when they aren't needed, rather a bring down. Some of the action scenes are simply shot too fast and lack visual coherence too. Then there's the 3D, which other than its use to give scenes artificial depth is invariably cheap looking and ineffective. The hot waitress character (played by Amber Heard) is a drawback as well, the lack of realism I can deal with but the pathetic writing is harder, all of the characters are written as clich\u00e9s but hers is the only that is written as a dull, uncharismatic one.On the other hand Nic Cage does well as the lead, stone faced, violent and determined he brings an amusing gravitas to things. Billy Burke makes for a nicely wild and mean spirited cult leader, a suitably vicious adversary, but best of all is William Fichtner as The Accountant. A mixture of wry brutality and spot on deadpan delivery he gets all the best lines and is frequently very funny, bringing the film the majority of its best scenes. Altogether things just about come off, but somehow I never felt as stirred as the film clearly wanted me to be, I felt that it was trying too hard, a bit over-slick, in need of more dirtiness perhaps. Good fun, but I think in the end this sort of thing isn't best done on this kind of commercial level. Still a fair 6/10 from me though."

        "review_detailed_main": "With each successive role, Nicolas Cage becomes a sadder, more sulking version of his former self, which got me thinking: was Cage ever that great to begin with? While he has worked under the guidance of some impressive directors (including Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, and Werner Herzog), has his acting range ever truly transcended the mindset of a bland (and sometimes hyperactive) summer action hero? \"Drive Angry\" goes a long way toward answering that question. The latest 3D'ed effort from director Patrick Lussier and writer Todd Farmer, who previously visited a remake of \"My Bloody Valentine\" upon us, this tale of a Badass escaping from Hell to rain down retribution upon the Bad Dudes who killed his daughter and took her baby is formless in concept (imagine a really bad rip-off of the already-bad \"Constantine\"), with minimal explanation given to John Milton (said Badass, played by Cage) and his powers...and his backstory...etc. The awful Amber Heard shines awfully in the role of Cage's sidekick, hitching her boots on an awful Southern twang. Looking like Jimmy Fallon given over to a rock-star hangover, Billy Burke (\"Twilight\") shows up as the Satanic cult leader who killed Milton's daughter, and looks to ritually sacrifice her child because...well, um, like a lot else in \"Drive Angry,\" it's just never explained. Some filmmakers can float their concepts on a deliberate lack of conventional logic and exposition (early-period David Lynch and Roman Polanski comes to mind), delivering compelling work through a confident directorial vision. Lussier is not one of those filmmakers. As with \"My Bloody Valentine,\" the 3D effect is very well-integrated, but amounts to little more than a throwaway bit of eye candy that adds nothing to the film overall; and with a story as half-baked as this, it doesn't take long for tedium to settle in. Like last year's faux-grindhouse experiment \"Machete,\" \"Drive Angry\" is an awesome trailer hawking a lousy movie. The one bright spot: reliable character actor William Fichtner, showing up periodically as a commissioned-by-Hell \"Accountant\" tasked with bringing Milton back to the underworld; in his brief scenes, he brings a refreshingly mocking attitude to the proceedings that elicits some solid laughs."

It's not for the lactose intolerant though.\n\nOnce in a while a cheesy movie like this does really great, I think it will probably have more success given time. It's actually one I could set through again with a date or friends night out. Its not going to give you a migraine trying to follow the plot, but its still fun. 3D isn't turning out so bad after all."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you don't go into the theater with any expectations you won't be too disappointed. Audiences have come to expect that movies touted to be in 3D be spectacular. I was underwhelmed. This one was a waste of the 3D effort. There were fairly good CGI effects but nothing that took advantage of the 3D possibilities very much and nothing really new. There was enough of it to make it seem like making the effects was the excuse for making the film. That's the second big 3D disappointment to me in recent weeks; the other being The Green Hornet, which I won't even bother reviewing.\n\nThe story was a bit shaky with little to bolster it. It was choppy and muddled as one might expect from a film like this, which is an excuse to blow up stuff and pretend to extreme violence with a tiny bit of sex included for balance. The dialog was blatantly profane without the benefit of much imagination or creativity, sounding much like teenagers hanging out at the mall trying to impress each other.\n\nBeing something of an expert on committing violence, aside from the CGI, I thought the old-fashioned action stuff was as bit, well, old-fashioned. I haven't seen punches telegraphed that far since the days of Gene Autry; it bordered on camp. At least the principals gave it their all though Cage has done so much violence in film he has nothing new to see in swinging away on the bad guys.\n\nThe two interesting diversions in that action respect were, first, Amber Heard as Piper, a foul mouthed reluctant companion to Cage's escapee from hell (as they asked rhetorically, \"You kiss your mother with that mouth?\"). She was at least fun to watch in those violent scenes, even if she did come across completely as a girl (not really her fault). Her enthusiasm was a nice touch to what could have been a lame part. She stepped up to the plate and delivered. Second was the very fun performance by Charlotte Ross as Candy the waitress. Charlotte, I loved it, and not just for the visual quality you added to the film. I don't want to spoil one of the best scenes in the movie, but she get's the grand jury prize for one of the most unusual sex acts ever concocted; executed with zeal. It actually made me wish I was Cage for a few minutes. She is stunningly physically fit and really threw herself into the part. I'll leave it at that except to say, thank you Charlotte for making the film worth the price of admission.\n\nThat brings us to the cast. The cast actually wasn't too bad. Cage did his best with very meager material with a plot so thin you could read the bad reviews through it. I already mentioned Amber Heard and Charlotte Ross; thank you ladies for being the best part of the film. Another character worth watching was William Fichtner as The Accountant. He played it just right and was also fun to watch while he was on screen. Also good in the parts were David Morse as Webster and Billy Burke as Jonah King, the stereotypical bad guy (some day someone is going to be more creative in writing the bad guy role).\n\nThe only final thing I can say is that I often feel it very odd that American films will show the most incredibly graphic violence while being reluctant to show nudity and sex. That has always seem a bit perverse to me. All sex has ever done is make people feel good while violence, on the other hand ... .\n\nBy Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

The action was passable but the film felt adolescent because of the sex and gore. One scene looked like it was written by a 14-year-old since Nicolas Cage engaged in a shoot-out whilst in the middle of intercourse. The plot was a secondary concern to all the action, sex, and violence.\n\nIt was a film that was made during the 3D boom of the early 2010s, which meant there were a lot of shots of things going into the camera. There were some poor green screen effects when characters were 'driving.' It looked like a Nickelodeon show."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing INGLORIOUS BASTERDS a few years back, I've been waiting for some fun R-rated movies again since it's those films that really make my day. Sure, MACHETE came out but that's it; nothing like that came out.Thank God for stuff like DRIVE ANGRY 3D.\n\nUnlike most other 3D films, DRIVE ANGRY seems like it was MEANT to be in 3D (AVATAR, TRON LEGACY) since most other films (CLASH OF THE TITANS, THE GREEN HORNET, DESPICABLE ME) were rushed into 3D in during post-production for income's sake. And unlike most films, it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nThe story is very predictable but that was the point; at least the script is badass enough to make up for the story. Acting was good since the cast could fit in any other grindhouse film and make ti work, though the cult leader wasn't really fleshed enough. The Accountant and Milton stand out since it's obvious the actors were having fun playing their roles. And the film has a badass soundtrack to boot.\n\nThe action was rightfully violent and gory, balancing vehicular slaughter with firefights on par with Robert Rodriguez films though the main chase scene in the middle of the film seemed a bit too long and it dragged out in the end. Aside from that, the action served its purpose.\n\nThe only problem I saw with this film is that it isn't one of those films that you'd want to see over and over again. Sure, it's trashy fun, bringing back the old days of the exploitation film but for some reason this is the kind of movie I wouldn't pay to see twice. My best guess would be the running time; running at almost two hours, DRIVE ANGRY 3D is a bit too long compared to other faster paced action movies. The shock value decreases as the movie runs since the number of interesting ways to kill someone also decrease. Those aside, don't take the film too seriously and you'll have a fun time watching DRIVE ANGRY 3D."

        "review_detailed_main": "Co-written & directed by Patrick Lussier Drive Angry was originally shot & shown theatrically in 3D however the version I watched was plain old 2D so will be commenting on that rather than the 3D one, I had high hopes for Drive Angry from the trailers but I was left feeling very disappointed after having watched it. Drive Angry looked to have all the ingredients need to be an exploitation classic, hot girls, nudity, blood, gore, violence, big guns, fast cars, one liners, Satanism & a good versus evil battle with an anti-hero. However I thought Drive Angry tried too hard to be cool, it tried to hard to be exploitative & appeal to a young male audience. The title and the trailer just felt like a movie I would enjoy...man was I disappointed. The movie had horrible nonsense graphics. The Hydrogen truck flipping over for instance looks terrible as do some of the bullet shots where the camera follows the bullet through the air. Even the action scenes are poor with some very forgettable car chases that don't amount to much more than cars driving along the road.\n\nDrive Angry starts in Oklahoma where restaurant waitress Piper (Amber Heard) quits her job, while driving fianc\u00e9s 69 Dodge Charger it breaks down, a man named John Milton (Nicolas Cage) offers to fix the car in exchange for a lift to which Piper agrees. Milton is trying to catch up with Jonah King (Billy Burke) who happens to be the leader of a Satanic cult, he murdered Milton's daughter & now plans to offer Milton's baby grandson as a human sacrifice in order to open the gates of hell. Chasing Milton is the Accountant (William Fichter) who is a demon from hell sent to Earth to reclaim Milton who in fact escaped from hell in order to avenge his daughter's murder. With everyone trying to kill everyone else things get violent as car chases & shoot-outs break out all over the place as King tries to turn Earth into a living hell while the undead Milton tries to stop him & his cult followers...\n\nSay what you may about Cage's films, but the actor's dedication to solemnity in the face of the film's trashy grindhouse formula is truly admirable. He makes his character work, just as Heard pulls off her no- nonsense character with gumption and gusto. Heard pretty much steals the show which isn't too surprising. You have a gorgeous blonde with a strong personality, not to mention a southern accent on top of it, who would you rather see on screen. Another actor who standouts is Fitchner. He comes off somewhere between a bad guy and just a plain weird one. The actor delivers his lines with a deliciously dry wit that easily steals almost every scene he is in. He takes his role and knocks it out of the park, and makes the movie that much better. You've seen Finchtner in Heat and The Dark Knight. Finchtner is a fantastic character actor and on many accounts saves this movie, or just gives it that extra special something. He has one liner after one liner and you will remember and laugh at every single one of them. Quite possibly the best is when he runs a Nitroglycerin tanker towards a wall of police cars and simply walks out of the car and stands on a police car hood, as the tanker goes \"boom\". He steals every single scene as suit wearing The Accountant. One moment he's a menacing figure who can kill you with no mercy, the next he's cruising in a truck with liquid hydrogen listening to KC & The Sunshine Band. Billy Burke is good as the cult leader.\n\nWhat's really missing here is the 'Midas' touch that the genius Quentin Tarrantino himself would have provided and had this been his creation.\n\nI rate it 4.5 out of 10 for the gorgeous looking Amber Heard and the witty one liners of William Fichtner. You can give this a pass and utilize the time watching Cage's earlier better films."

Suddenly the the plot starts to get apparent but unfortunately it wasn't a very good one. I mean, I just wasn't taken at all by the whole cult plot and for me this took away a lot of the fun from the movie.\n\nIts such a shame since the movie had all of the other ingredients to make a good and fun B-movie out off in it. The movie tries to be a throwback to the B-movie days of the '70's, in which the main character seeks for revenge and stops at nothing. It's also being deliberately over-the-top with its action, graphic violence, characters and dialog, which is an enjoyment all but yet in the end the movie still falls flat as a genre attempt.\n\nBecause of its story, the movie is lacking a good or pleasant enough pace. Most of the time things don't really feel connected, as if this movie originated from two different scripts that were being thrown together. Some elements feel really out of place, such as all of the supernatural stuff, especially toward the end. It's maybe also all because director Patrick Lussier isn't the best one out there. His movies are often barely good enough and they, as of yet, have never surpassed that level. Maybe he just couldn't handle all of the ingredients being thrown toward him and couldn't decide on what to use and what to leave out, so he just simply decided on using everything. The movie is too often heading into far too many different directions because of that.\n\nNicolas Cage seems in his elements in this movie and Amber Heard is a great new young star, we will hopefully hear more off in the near future. But truly great was William Fichtner, who played the most amusing role out of the entire movie and did it in such a great way. I'm sure he really had fun with this movie!\n\nNot an horrible movie but still a very lacking attempt.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

After watching the preview I was not looking forward to watching this and after seeing it, it was much worse then I expected. I really am speechless about this movie. The effects were kinda cool. William Fichtner was actually good in this, but the dialog made his character not as threatening as he could have been.

Roger Ebert says you should not be friends with anyone that likes this. Peter Travers says it would be better if you were stoned or at least buzzed. I say the movie was 97% total crap, the 3% is because there was a lot of nudity. I know many people will love this because there are a lot of Cage fans that rent from us. That makes me sad. A big perk of my job is getting to watch for free and not paying $12 for a 3-D theater movie. I just wish I could get the 2 hours back. I give it a D-.\n\nWould I watch again? - No chance in Hell (get it?) *Also try - Ghost Rider & Machete"

I also give it kudos for not pandering to the PG-13 bigwigs, which it easily could have done. Instead it saturates the screen with copious amounts of gratuitous sex and comic book violence, the high point of which is a memorable simultaneous sex scene/shoot out.\n\nUnfortunately Nick Cage phones it in, and the script is a godawful mess, and the 3D stuff gets annoying on a standard screen... but hey, you can't have it all, right?\n\nTurn your brain off for a bit and you'll probably find this to be a popcorn-munching good time (not to mention a teenage boys' wet dream). It's not great by any stretch of the imagination and no doubt it will fade from my memory within a week... but right now I don't feel like a wasted my time at all."

Ive seen many crap moviesthat deserve a 3 or evwn 2, but to rate this movie 1 means these people are purposefully trying to drive down the overall rating instead of veing honest with they're reviews. IMDB seriously need to delete these silly reviews, i see it with almost any movie i look at on this site these days, its ridiculous to tell you the truth.\n\nAnyway give the movie a go, its no shawshank redemption or deep meaningful movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is either this month's Nicolas Cage mortgage payment or someone ran a reality show with the prize of Cage financing and starring in films made by randomly selected amateurs. How else can you explain Season of the Witch, The Wicker Man and Bangkok Dangerous all from the last 5 years? And I'll bet he had no idea that Kick-Ass or Bad Lieutenant would turn out as good as they did! Anyway here's Drive Angry, a sh*tty slapdash over the top piece of ridiculous with misguided style definitely taking precedence over any semblance of substance.\n\nI was actually pondering just how to insinuate the afterworld elements of Drive Angry without giving the film's main hook away when I read this outline trying to see who the lead actress was: \"In the high-octane, 3D action-adventure Drive Angry, Nicolas Cage stars as Milton, a hardened felon who has broken out of hell intent on finding the vicious cult who brutally murdered his daughter and kidnapped her baby.\" Well slim excuse of a hook gone.\n\nSo Cage is a stubbly loner named Milton, with the usual subtle hairpiece. Milton is driven by dark memories and is on a mission to\u0085 well you can read it above. Heard plays Piper, the usual 'way too hot to be a waitress' waitress and a potty mouth who sings along to such classics as 'F*ck the pain away' on the radio.\n\nA tall angular faced man in a suit who calls himself the Accountant (William Fichtner) is in hot pursuit, and the cult leader in this film is unbelievably enough the least over the top thing in it, operating at a level that by comparison might be described as subdued.\n\nFor some reason the cult holds an impromptu meeting to explain the rest of the plot \u2013 in a closed saloon where Piper just happens to be hiding \u2013 yep it's that kind of clumsy coincidence film.\n\nThe rest of the film is a dumb-ass 'Year 7 creative writing' with profanity, Dukes of Hazzard car chases, nudity and bloodshed. (I actually jotted down the Dukes reference before the closing sequences where a spitting image of the General Lee is busted out.) Before the hastily injected 'deep theological' elements are shoehorned in \u2013 that ended up being so ineffective they said 'f*ck it' and gave the twist away before the film even opened \u2013 Cage lurches around from scene to scene with every action supported by its own unnecessary guitar riff, he even gets to bang a chick and get attacked by a group of insidious bad guys simultaneously. No biggie, he caps six of the attackers without, ummmm, dismounting.\n\nA while later Cage is shot through the head \u2013 the left eye more specifically \u2013 again no dramas: was meaning to wear my sunnies anyway! I won't even mention the baseball bat pushed through a human body. As in through. Won't mention it.\n\nDrive Angry is the latest attempt at an alternative Crank, Shoot 'em up, Machete clone overflowing with gratuitousness: nudity, violence and profanity.\n\nThe only thing it doesn't have too much of is common sense, a plot line and entertainment value.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 5 / 10. Nic Cage's film choices are starting to look a lot less like 'taking chances' and more like the desperate grasping of a drowning man."

        "review_title": "Comic book supernatural thriller",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Drive Angry\" (2011) is a cartoony thriller with supernatural elements about a guy named Milton (Nicholas Cage) who escapes the underworld in order to save his infant granddaughter who's been taken captive by a band of satanists headed by Jonah King (Billy Burke). On Milton's trail is a mysterious man called The Accountant (William Fichtner) and it's unclear if he's friend or foe. Milton hooks up with an energetic young woman, Piper (Amber Heard), and the chase is on.\n\nThis is an over-the-top action thriller to the max -- a comic book come to life. It's meant to entertain and not to be taken seriously. It's also really funny, like the fat slob who immediately takes out his cell phone to take a picture of the half-naked brunette beaten-up by Piper.\n\nSpeaking of Heard, she's a little thin for my tastes but appealing nevertheless and the filmmakers definitely take advantage of her beauty, yet not in a crude way (although there are a couple of smutty scenes featuring other women).\n\nThe characters are of the redneck trash variety, including the two protagonists. I point this out because some might be turned off by their unwholesomeness. Despite their gruff exterior, however, you start to see their humanity, particularly as the story progresses. Milton's a literal lost soul, but he goes all-out to save his baby granddaughter, which is certainly Christ-like. Piper's not quite as lost, but she's just a product of her spiritually-bereft environment. She's also dynamic and bold, albeit foul. As the yarn unfolds these characters connect in a father-daughter fashion and their love and respect near the end is almost moving.\n\nAt the end of the day \"Drive Angry\" is about as forgettable as most Syfy flicks, except that it has a much bigger budget and therefore a slicker look. Regardless, it does its job; it entertains. It's similar to the Ghost Rider movies, but without the supernatural overtness of Ghost Rider, e.g. a flaming skeleton who rides a flame cycle, although it has some of this, mostly at the climax.\n\nThe film was shot in Louisiana and runs 104 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B-"

It is loud, fast paced, loaded with over the top violence and explosions and sexy women. Drive Angry feels a lot like Shoot 'em Up or Crank, but manages to differentiate itself from it's predecessors. The actors all manage to bring characters to life enough to suit the story, but I must say that William Fichtner was the most entertaining to watch through the film. The only downside was that the villain throughout the movie seemed to be a little too over the top for my liking, but didn't really detract too much from the overall movie. The story is petty standard for this type of film, but it manages to serve the movie well enough. Pretty standard action fare, but a fun enough ride if you just turn off your rational mind and go along with it."

He picks up a blonde spitfire (Amber Heard) along the way, and the two of them are pursued by cops and a grim reaper-type man (William Fichtner) who's job it is to bring Milton back to where he belongs. \n\nThe rest is all shoot-outs, explosions, muscle car chases, and Amber Heard looking sexy. \n\nDrive Angry is a fun movie, as long as you don't take it seriously.

And as I finally got round to watching, although not in 3D, I must admit it had a less annoying Cage on screen and a lot of fun moments.\n\nBut its still far from perfect!\n\nBy far, and as everyone no doubt agrees, William Fichtner as The Accountant is the highlight of the film. His darkly humorous role is worthy of a film itself and he comes in at the right times when the typically Hollywood crap starts to bore you.\n\nNot a lot is explained about the main characters which seems to work okay if you are smart enough or don't really care.\n\nDrive Angry passes the time. It could almost have passed as Ghost Rider 3 as Cage plays a similar role and the direction, CGI and insane moments are very alike also.\n\nWorth a watch, but once is enough!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Drive Angry is one of those Guilty Pleasures for me, as it is written in the book. Absolute B-Movie-Edeltrash of the very finest kind.\n\nActually Drive Angry is not a very good movie and absolute trash, but it absolutely hits a nerve with me. I love this movie because for me personally almost everything about the film is right.\n\nNicolas Cage plays an extremely cool pig in this movie and just does \"his thing\". Amber Heard plays a hot young woman who is also staged exactly like that, but also extremely tough and strong-willed. Billy Burke also plays the superstitious Satanist absolutely glauibhaft. You HATE this character, and we have Burke to thank for that. The secret star of the film, however, is William Fichtner, who has such incredibly awesome scenes and simply plays his role as the \"accountant\" with bravura and a lot of humor. Simply mega!\n\nThe film is a single action fest and one cool scene chases the next. The film contains a high degree of violence and is not squeamish with the death scenes. The running time of about 100 minutes is neither too long nor too short, but absolutely appropriate.\n\nI also find the humor of the film cool, which just ignites with me 100% always.\n\nAlso, the film offers a lot of allusions to other famous action films, such as Terminator.\n\nThe story is not worth mentioning and unfortunately contains one or the other logic gap, but hey, forget it, because it is a noble trash film and B-movie. I'm not asking for a perfect script or a groundbreaking story.\n\nFor me, anyway, Drive Angry is a true film fest. I've probably seen the movie seven times or so, but I'm not getting tired of it yet.\n\n9/10 points - High rewatch value."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is all over the place, most of the acting is garbage except for William Fichtner who actually stole the whole show (and surprisingly, some of the supporting actors). The protagonist's character arc is basically none existence, we can't feel what he feels, because we were never shown his origins or what he's like. The movie totally avoids every chances it has to show how he is able to do what he does, or why is stuff happening the way they are happening. Everything is just super vague and obscure. And to top it all off, I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw this movie, the VFX of a $50m 2011 movie looks like it was pulled off of \"The Mask\" from 1995. Most of the CGI looks so cheap, corny and cringe-worthy. Not even the brilliant acting of William Fichtner can save this movie. But after all, if you just want some fantasy action film to burn through your weekends, this movie can get the job done, it has guns, girls, and magic."

        "review_title": "Awake, arise or be for ever fall'n, Nicholas Cage!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Considered one of mankind's greatest works of literature, John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' is an epic reference to the battles of good versus evil and ultimately, the ever widening fissure between Heaven and Hell. Having said that, if Milton was around today, you can be sure he would have sued the film makers for total desecration of his work, even if it is just a suggestive theme. Adding insult to injury is scripting John Milton as a character out of hell. Believe me, it was no surprise (or excitement) to see Nicholas Cage play Milton, a condemned soul who breaks out of Hell to avenge his daughter's death and rescue his granddaughter from a satanic cult. If that does not make sense to you, the movie won't. Seriously, who breaks out of hell to do a good deed? If people are in hell for all the bad things they did, why bother to do any good now? So anyway, Milton runs after Jonah King (Billy Burke), a cult leader who believes in sacrificing Milton's granddaughter to invoke the immortal powers of hell. Joining Milton on his quest is a small town waitress played by Amber Heard. As Piper, I have no idea what Heard's real role is in the movie. Probably, and this is my biased assumption, that every movie that featuring classic, muscle or custom made cars, must be complemented with a hot babe with bare legs as one of the characters in on the joy ride. Think about it, One of the few good movies cage starred in was GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. Who is the only female actor in that film opposite an all-male star cast? Angelina Jolie. Then you have Megan fox and Shea LaBeouf in a very yellow Chevy Camero in the first two TRANSFORMERS movies. Speaking of cars, the film pays homage to the yesteryears of American muscle back. Expect to see a 1969 Charger, a 1972 Chevelle, a 1957 Chevy and many more rev through the action.\n\nWith repute in B movie horror thrillers, this was director Patrick Lussier's big budget break. What fails him is the utterly gutted screenplay. Having co-written the script, I don't see why anyone else should be blamed for this travesty. With a short history in writing B movie scripts like Dracula, followed by sequels II and III, how much more can you expect in terms of a thrilling plot? What he did do differently, is shoot the film using live action 3D. That means filming with cameras made for 3D, rather than post-converting footage into 3D. What's the difference? Except for slightly improved three-dimensional clarity, nothing to write home about. But then again, 3D films have been around for almost five decades. So what we are left with is just a gimmick, or a ploy to experience an over the top, uninspiring piece of garbage with some of the corniest one-liners ever seen or heard on film. Then it gets worse; Extreme blood and gore, over-the-top explosions, unnecessary nudity and abusive language. And all for what? According to Lussier, \"A little bit of fun\".\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment for this reviewer is having to see Nicholas Cage in another meaningless role. I used to think of Nicholas cage as a method actor- the ability of an actor to build into the flesh and blood of the character portrayed, even before and after the actual filming. But that used to be a long time ago. Given his recent choice in leading roles, method acting gets a kick through the window. The writing on the wall? THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE and SEASON OF THE WITCH were tell-tale signs of a downward spiral in terms of film choice. But before I call off the artillery barrage, I should also mention William Fichtner. Remember that wise-guy FBI agent hot on the heels of PRISON BREAK convicts Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows? Well guess what, after four seasons of PRISON BREAK, Fichtner couldn't get enough. Hot on the heels of John Milton, he plays \"The Accountant\", Hell's warden, in the guise of an indestructible human. On a positive note, Fichtner's character has some cool moves and is the only person who seems to possess some sanity. Everything else goes to hell and stays there. Pun intended."

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing these new exploitation movies keep doing wrong is the fact that they include big stars as their protagonists. Nicholas Cage, Kurt Russell, Robert De Niro, and many other big stars have been in these exploitation movies and it's nothing but awkward. Drive Angry 3D pairs the over-hyped Nicholas Cage and Amber Heard together and pretty much gives us our money's worth.\n\nThe plot is convoluted and twisted; a loner named Milton (Cage) escapes from Hell and is on the search for his daughter's baby who was stolen by Jonah King (Billy Burke). Jonah is a cult leader who is scheduled to perform a sadistic sacrifice on the infant. Milton teams up with bossy diner employee Piper (Heard) and they try to obtain the infant.\n\nThere is a fine line between a human being helpless and a child being helpless. But to have an infant be prepared to be sacrificed is scummy and disgusting. It's unnecessary, dirty work that the screenwriter and directors shouldn't have approved to be in a film. But why scold an exploitation movie for being way to violent and disturbing? That's its point, but there is even a limit to how far a no rules movie can go.\n\nAnd we have Nicholas Cage in the film. One of Hollywood's most overrated and overpraised actors who hasn't done in a good film in years. Ghost Rider, National Treasure, and The Weather Man are all his recent film failures, and I can't understand why. I loved him in Leaving Las Vegas and found The Rock very exciting. He won an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. Why does he continue to submerse himself into low grade and tasteless films. If he wanted to, he could probably win another Oscar. And I'm sure the Academy is cringing when they see the work he does now.\n\nThough I am throwing constant punches, in this he wasn't as bad as I thought. As Milton, he did fairly well. That hairdo is laughable, but other than that, his face on the cover of the DVD says it all. He drives angry and loves it. Some scenes of him kicking the crap out of everyone like he is being controlled by a sugar rushed twelve year old on Grand Theft Auto are entertaining and good fun. But ultimately, the movie fails in the field of special effects, dialog, and plot.\n\nI should also mention that watching the film in 2D is something that was never meant to be. When people make 3D movies and utilize it by having debris and fire flying towards the audience, they forget that when the movie is released on a regular, non-3D DVD it will look strange and out of place. So many moments in the film, including the credits, were meant to be seen in their original form.\n\nThe music is loud, but fitting. The storyline is grotesque, but welcomed. The characters classless and not behaved, but we like it. It's all it should be. It's successful at achieving recognition for being itself and what it succeeded to be, but still, everything is too silly and too obscure to even obtain status as a cult classic. It's all just too, you know, odd.\n\nStarring: Nicholas Cage, Amber Heard, Billy Burke, and William Fichtner. Directed by: Patrick Lussier."

The possibilities would be endless. Especially if he was played by the same actor.\n\nWilliam Fichtner, as the Accountant, once again shows his acting range. Whether he plays a special forces type in Black Hawk Down, a cowboy in the Lone Ranger or shows his comedic side in this movie, his acting credentials are fast making him a favourite."

Cage should know better. Amber Heard is more the capable of playing the femme fatale but we fail to see any of it. Demonic possession and the occult have been reduced to trivialities here; cliches. When it stops being fun it stops being fun very fast. I was pleasantly surprised at minutes in and then quickly annoyed at how this movie ended. The casting could have been better as well. Are there no hungry actors willing to giving it there all in hopes of getting their big break? Movies in the genre should titillate. Why go anywhere else with it?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Grindhouse. A sub-genre unfamiliar to me. Muscle cars, B-movie violence, satanism and acting so bad that it starts to corrupt your mind into thinking it's good. Drive Angry clearly takes the grungy nature of disposable drive-in films, but feels irritatingly obnoxious rather than genuinely entertaining. A man escapes from hell and returns to the real world to save a child from being sacrificed to Satan. Heard is absolutely stunning and acts surprisingly well. Fichtner steals every scene with his \"sophisticated\" dialogue. And some of the action sequences were watchable and well edited. Suffice to say though, this just was not my cup of tea. Cage was woefully monotonous, attempting to sound like a middle aged \"badass\". The plot never feels gripping and resorts to derivative storytelling by merging religious fantasy with car chases. The lack of involvement with these characters numbed any sense of emotional investment. Some scenes felt utterly pointless and were only used to showcase its B-movie strands. For example, Cage's character is midway through intercourse to which he shoots intruders and gets stunned whilst still inside her (talk about shocking penetration...). Or how about the scene where a car gently taps a wall and randomly starts flipping over it. Wait, Fichtner's coin! Why? I'll tell you why. Gimmicky 3D effects. Y'know, those really noticeable objects that come flying towards your face for no apparent reason, other than to hinder the quality of the film. We've got axes, baseball bats, bullets from a \"God killer\" (don't get me started on that) and coins. Even so, the traditional visual effects were horrific also, like really bad. Then the ending happens, everyone's driving on the highway to hell and they all live happily ever after in a burning inferno. My point is, with such a ludicrous plot, this should've been fun. Unfortunately it lacked the muscle and became more of a dragster, with the action lacking thrills and the pacing dipping frequently. It's stupid, just too stupid. Oh, and the correct syntax would be \"Drive Angrily\"."

It defies the laws of gravity, motion, physics, thermodynamics and anything else relating to any scientific logic. I know it's just a movie, but whilst I was watching this I found myself scratching my head wondering how the makers of this movie got away with the vast majority of the stunts pulled off in this over-hyped flick. Now I'll be honest, this film entertained me to a certain extent. I especially liked the last scene where Nicholas Cage defeated the satanists by driving recklessly, whilst shooting them all (what do you expect from a film titled 'drive angry) but the things I hate about this movie is they tried to go over board on the 'exhilaration' factor to the extent where its hard to gain an adrenaline rush watching the film due to the total lack of logic this movie has. I mean seriously 'The Accountant?' what a completely pointless character. In fact he just shows up to remind the viewer he is still in the film. I just think he is a pretty pointless role and the movie would be no different without him. He also has superhuman strength, manhandling fully grown men and kicking car doors off.. sorry *cough* booting car doors off and making them fly through the air at ridiculous speeds! what is that all about? is it supposed to be funny? When Milton recovered after being shot in the face instantly decided to hate the film. I also hate the special effects used when the Jonah King dies. I guess I just expected more from the film, everyone was making it out to be amazing... And i'm not going to lie, it entertained me. But didn't amuse me, nor did it convince me. Overall if you're looking for a 'serious' action flick, avoid this one at all costs. If you're looking for a silly, predictable film but still non the less entertaining with a touch of mild comedy, maybe this one is for you. And everyone has their own opinions so please don't judge me. We can't all like the same films or life would be boring! so for now I will leave you with a quote I picked up from watching this film. \"I never disrobe before gun play.\""

I had watched the usual classics (Con Air, Face/Off, The Rock) but wanted to check out his newer stuff (I'm on summer vacation with time to kill, why not?) So I did and man was I blown away. I loved it. Yes. Loved it. So much that I went and put down $5 for the blu ray. It's over-the- top, action packed, sexy and down right fun, a throwback to all the over- the-top 70s action movies. Sexy cars, sexy girls, explosions, shotguns, leather, you name it, this film's got it. A good popcorn, check your brain at the door type movie. The acting was good, but it was such a good action flick and we need more of those. If Ghost Rider was good, it would be Drive Angry. If you're looking for an action-packed movie, look no further. It was one of those films that once it starts it just keeps going and doesn't run out of action until the credits. Highly recommend for fans of action, Nick Cage and good movies. Don't think about, don't try to analyze, just sit back and enjoy the film"

        "review_detailed_main": "I would love to give this movie a 10/10, I loved every part of it. Its a grind-house-style action film with lots of dead bodies and gun fire and people getting messed up. It features a protagonist who escaped from Hell, a crazy gun called the god-killer, Hell's accountant, a crazy cult, and more people getting messed up. Plus there's also a decent amount of nudity. Those are all the reasons I want to give it a 10/10, but also the reasons why I can give it a 10/10. A 10/10 would be a movie that everyone could watch and love, but really Drive Angry is a movie that only real men can watch and love. Since I am a real man, it rules. Nicholas Cage has done a bunch of movies, but I really think his best films are the ridiculous, violent ones like this. Just so you know, this movie is totally ridiculous, that's what makes it awesome, don't watch it if you want to see a movie with a deep touching story, that simply isn't what this is, nor does it try to be. In fact it doesn't even try to be a decent movie, or have a decent story, instead it just tries to spend every frame being as awesome as possible. If you understand that last sentence, then this movie is for you (and if you hate it, then you didn't understand what I meant). Boom"

        "review_detailed_main": "From the director of My Bloody Vantentine 3D comes an action-packed movie, Drive Angry. It shows that a horror film director is capable of directing decent action scenes. Drive Angry features many car crashes and gun fights in real 3D. One of the rare action movie filmed with 3D camera and the movie shows.\n\nThe story: Nicolas Cage stars as the main character; an angry father bend on rescuing his daughter's baby. He meets a tough but pretty woman, Piper, acted by the hot Amber Heard. They go on a violent adventure to rescue the baby. Meanwhile, the Accountant from Hell chases them. All this add up to a fun and action-packed adventure. There are explosions, car wrecks and people being blown up. It is a hell of a ride. The pace is brisk and the action starts as soon as possible. The downside, Amber Heard shows a little skin. But it is good to see her act as a different role as it is one of the rare movies she shows little skin.\n\nOverall: It is pretty fun. The 3D is quite good, the action are in your face and there are some gimmick scenes where items fly out of the screen. And of course, Amber Heard looks good in 3D. I have no idea how this flopped in the box office in USA even Season of the witch did better than this. Maybe, people lose interest in Nicolas Cage; his recent movies are not worth mentioning except Kick-Ass. It will be a pity to see this being written as the worst box office flop for a wide 3D movie. It is good for what it is."

Seriously, you can check it. Everything about this movie is riveting, even if it's only because the film stock they use looks like it's been drenched in whisky. The cinematography gives this movie such a brilliant retro feel, the only thing that ruins the atmosphere from time to time is the overuse of CGI effects. It just doesn't mix right, everything about \"Drive Angry\" is yanked straight out of exploitation films from the 1970s (how gratuitous is the nudity?) but the most pivotal scene ends up being a computer-generated mess. It doesn't really harm the movie too much though, and it also helps a lot that Nicolas Cage gets to kill around two million people. Perhaps the makers of \"Drive Angry\" tried a bit too hard to purposely make a so-bad-it's-good flick, but in the end you can't really argue with these results."

        "review_detailed_main": "The thing I want the most out of a B-Movie is to be entertained. Social commentary and whatnot are all fine, but if you don't have anything else for me, then get out. Roger Corman got that back in the day, producing the likes of \"Death Race 2000\", \"Humanoids From the Deep\" and \"Forbidden World\" among others. While some of these movies might have made a social statement, they also remembered what audiences wanted. Well, \"Drive Angry\" doesn't say anything insightful or intelligent, but dammit if it isn't one of the most fun B-Movie experiences I've seen all year, from Hollywood or not.\n\nJohn Milton (Nicolas Cage) has broken out of hell to kill cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke), who killed his daughter and plans to sacrifice her baby in the name of Satan. In the process, he befriends Piper (Amber Heard), a down on her luck but tough as nails waitress, and finds the law (lead by Tom Atkins) and King's cult going after him. Oh, and to make matters worse, The Accountant (William Fichtner) has been sent by Satan to send Johnny boy back to hell.\n\nThe reason I mentioned Roger Corman earlier was mostly because of this: out of all the exploitation tributes I've seen, this is probably the one that most accurately captures the unapologetic fun and energy of the man's 70's/early 80's heyday. There's fast cars, humor that's actually funny, gratuitous nudity, gratuitous violence, gore, Satanic cults, souped up cars, car chases, explosions, likable characters, charismatic villains and anti-heroes, bare-knuckle action, and so much more. Unlike crap like \"Bitch Slap\" and \"The Bleeding\", this is clearly the work of people who not only love 70's exploitation and the like, but have done their homework and actually know what fans of those movies want, and, Hollywood sheen aside, delivers it.\n\nActing wise, it's pretty strong as well. Cage is good as our hero, delivering the kind of performance we should have gotten in \"Season of the Witch\", while Heard seems to be having a lot of fun as the tough as they get Piper and Billy Burke adds Southern swagger to Jonah King. The big standout though, is Fichtner as The Accountant. He steals the show here, adding an almost Christopher Walken level cool to his performance, delivering one liners with ease and making every scene he's in entertaining as hell.\n\nI will admit that I do have two minor complaints. For one, we don't really get to know anything about Jonah's followers, as they are simply available to be killed by Milton or get their asses kicked by Piper. It would have been nice to at least know a little bit about one of them. Also, while he's fun in his role, it would have been nice if we had gotten a bit more of Tom Atkins. Dude's a cult movie icon for a good reason, and a few more scenes with him would have been great.\n\nStill, those are minor complaints. \"Drive Angry\" is an unapologetic, crass, loud piece of work with nothing but mayhem on it's mind, and God bless it's heart for it. If only more tributes to exploitation where this fun."

However, if you have more mainstream tastes, you will probably hate and not understand this. Expect lots of one liners, over the top action, graphic violence, hot girls, fast cars all to the backdrop of white trash Americana. This is well performed all around and one good time of a tongue in cheek , violent action movie. One of Cage 's best in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie. For perspective, I'll say I don't usually like Nic Cage, NOR horror flicks. On the \"stupid scale\" out of 10, this one is a 10. REALLY stupid. But gloriously so! On the improbable scale, it's a 10. On the cool scale, it's also a 10. Sound like a mess? Nah--- it was great fun. I must point out that it is vulgar- for me that is OK, but more sensitive sorts could be offended.\n\nCage was great in \"Ghost Rider,\" and \"Kick Ass.\" This is in that category. Except that if one puts \"Drive Angry\" and \"Ghost Rider\" together, \"Ghost Rider\" suddenly looks like Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" in comparison.\n\nI note that Cage has done a handful of spectacular genuine art-fuelled movies: \"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" the Coen brothers' magnificent and somewhat underrated \"Raising Arizona,\" and \"Moonstruck\" with Cher. And one must include \"Kick Ass\" more recently. In my humble and possibly misguided opinion, everything else he's done has been rubbish. With this movie, \"Kick Ass,\" and \"Ghost Rider\" as his recent offerings, perhaps Cage has finally found his niche?\n\nI must sound like a curmudgeon, but 3-D has not resonated with me. \"Avatar\" was a fun ride with the format, but it seems as if everything else in 3-D has been a waste of time and money. \"Drive Angry\" has decent 3-D, but I must protest that there was no reason for it, other than to utilise a gimmick. This movie would have been every bit as good with 2- D. And less annoying, less cumbersome, and much brighter and more vivid, so it actually would have been much better without the 3-D gee-gaw tacked onto it.\n\nI loved this film, but could not give it a 10: boutique quirkiness and theatre of the absurd can satisfy, but sadly, in this universe anyway, the 10 score must be reserved for less ironic, less tricky fare."

        "review_title": "An underrated grindhouse comedy thriller that has Amber Heard at her best and a lot of action scenes to die for",
        "review_detailed_main": "I just recently watched this movie and I'm quite confused about why it has such low ratings here and in other places online. I mean, the action and comedy are crazy good, the writing is OK, the special and visual effects are above average, and the acting is out of this world (no pun intended). What's there not to love about it? This movie is literally as good as it gets for a well-done action-packed grindhouse comedy thriller that, unsurprisingly, became an instant cult classic when it was released.\n\nI won't go into the details of summarizing the plot for the reader but what I'll specially firstly point out (because it is absolutely worth doing so) is the fact that Amber Heard kills it - literally and figuratively - in the movie. Amber plays Piper, a down-on-her-luck young Texan woman that catches her fianc\u00e9 cheating and shortly after gets dragged into Milton's (Nicolas Cage) rage-fueled quest to avenge his daughter's brutal killing and rescue her baby in the process. This was, at the time, Amber's first time playing such a prominent role in such an action-packed thriller; her only other role that might come close to this one was her ensemble role in ExTerminators (2009) but those familiar with both movies would agree that the level of action and violence in Drive Angry is way above that in ExTerminators so the two roles are hardly the same.\n\nDespite it being her first such role, Amber manages to pull off what, in my view, was her best performance to date by seamlessly and entertainingly interweaving comedy with kick-ass no-nonsense bad-assery. And this attests not only to her impressive acting versatility and her tendency to keep growing as an actress (both of which I have noted before), it also, arguably for the first time at the time, undeniably attested to her talent in portraying powerful and independent women in action thriller roles - again, this is notwithstanding her well-played ensemble role in ExTerminators. Indeed, her gritty and confrontational portrayal of Piper gives us a relatively early showcasing of Amber's potential for outstandingly handling such roles; and it explains why it was inevitable that she would eventually land such bigger roles as DC's Mera in Aquaman. That said, I'm also quite pleased that while Patrick Lussier (director) did not hesitate to use Amber's body and attractiveness to captivate his audience, he did not needlessly exploit it as some other directors in her earlier movies tended to do. All of this is to say that if you'll watch the movie for nothing or no one else, watch it for Amber's performance and, of course, for her radiance and beauty. (It's not by accident that they put Amber in the foreground of the movie's official poster you know.)\n\nIt would be unfair if I did not also single out William Fitchner's (as The Accountant) performance which, in my view, is second only to Amber's, being better than even Nicolas Cage's. This is not to say that Cage's performance was not good; he does bring his A-game to this one but anyone familiar with his movies in the era would be disappointed by a lack of any unique content from him in it. In fact, it seems to me that part of the criticisms of this movie are simply people's expressions of this disappointment.\n\nDespite its positives, there are several negative elements to the movie that I feel need to be pointed out. One of them is its excessive and sometimes pointless use of nudity and violence (although one may defend this by alluding to its status as a grindhouse film). Another is its poor gender representation and its promotion of negative gender stereotypes. Its racial representation is also very wanting. And although its CGI's are phenomenal, they're also not always convincingly at the level they're supposed to be.\n\nI recommend the movie to all lovers of action thrillers and grindhouse and to fans of Amber Heard, Cage, and Fitchner. Lovers of comedy will also find plenty of laughs throughout the movie although this will come at the cost of them having to take a heavy dose of violence along with the laughs. In all, considering its positives and negatives, I'd have given the movie a 7, but Amber's presence and outstanding performance it led me to settle on an 8 for it."

I personally think the film was very funny, the main actors: Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner and Amber Heard played a good part.

        "review_detailed_main": "'DRIVE ANGRY': Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nNicolas Cage stars as a revenge crazed mad man who breaks out of Hell to avenge the death of his daughter and rescue his granddaughter. Of course this is not a stretch for Cage and it's actually much better than most of Cage's 'B' movie exploitation films. It co-stars the gorgeous Amber Heard (who looks hotter than ever), Billy Burke as the bad guy and William Fichtner in a scene stealing role as an officer of Satan. The film is directed and co-written by Patrick Lussier (who also directed such popular exploitation horror films as 'DRACULA 2000' and the 2009 remake of 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE'). It's co-written by Lussier's usual partner in crime Todd Farmer (who co-wrote 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE' as well as two upcoming Lussier projects) , he also plays a role (as usual) in the film. The film is one of the rare flicks that was actually shot in 3D (using new 3D equipment) and it looks spectacular ('MY BLOODY VALENTINE' was effectively done in 3D as well and in a time before 3D was so popular, before 'AVATAR'). Like 'VALENTINE' the movie is classic 'grindhouse' material!\n\nCage plays John Milton and Burke plays Jonah King. King is a Satanic cult leader who influenced Miltion's daughter into following him and then killed her and her husband and kidnapped their daughter to use in a sacrificial ritual. It turns out that Hell is just a big prison for wrong doers and sometimes criminals breakout. They're always brought back in though by 'The Accountant' (Fichtner) who hunts them down and sends them back to Hell. When Milton finds out what King has done he of course breaks out of Hell and hunts King down. He does so with the help of a young waitress named Piper (Heard). The whole time he of course has to elude 'The Accountant' who's hot on his trail.\n\nThe movie is wall to wall action, filled with excessive violence and packed with large amounts of blood and gore. It's ridiculously over the top and it revels in it. This is it's greatest strength as well as it's biggest weakness. It has a lot of fun being 'bad' but it almost does so to the extent where it becomes tiresome. I said almost. The first half of the film is more enjoyable then the second but it still, for the most part, really works. Cage is perfectly cast and although he gives no better a performance than in some of his absolute worst films he's still extremely entertaining to watch (including a scene where he's having sex with a naked hot blond while having a full shoot out with intruders in a hotel room and sipping off a bottle of whiskey the entire time). The movie is the type of film that, as I mentioned, is perfect grindhouse and something Tarantino would probably love. It would be great as a drive-in second feature or a low rent video rental but it looks amazing in 3D and on the big screen as well. It's too bad it's underperformed at the box office so far. In the long run I think it will be a hit and a long lasting cult favorite.\n\nWatch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPm2cMqqKGo"

        "review_title": "another exploitation, well checking it out",
        "review_detailed_main": "I came across this flick due a few reasons, first of all, the director Patrick Lussier isn't unknown for me, all his flicks so far were horrors, the best known My Bloody Valentine remake. He's even going to make Halloween 3. The second reason is Amber Heard. So far I have seen her in horror flicks like All The Boys Love Mandy Lane and The Ward amongst others. By reading the story on the back you could tell that it wasn't going to be a normal flick.\n\nLooking at the cast, Amber included, many names are known in the horror and exploitation flicks and face it, Cage is okay but he isn't anymore in blockbusters like he used to do. Tom Atkins was asked again to play a copper after seen in My Bloody Valentine (Jim Burke) by the director, he's is a sheriff again here. In fact there are so many faces in it that you will recognise.\n\nThe story itself is typical exploitation and it follows a bit that tradition. It isn't like Death Proof, but it do have it's nudity and red stuff. There's a bit of CGI in it but if you have seen Bitch Slap that contained also a lot of CGI and green screens. And it didn't bother at all just like in this flick. It isn't gory like in Hobo With A Shotgun fashion but I must say that there are a few messy shots in it. Naturally the story couldn't be true and that may be a reason why some disgust it but it also has a cult following due that aspect. I was rather surprised by the nudity in it and didn't expect to see full frontal nudity especially from Christa Campbell. She's only a few minutes in it but shows it all, I was surprised because seeing her in Hyena's her breasts were CGIed. So I could say that it surely can be put on the exploitation shelves, I liked it a lot and this time shots weren't made to add towards the 3D effects. Some 3D effects are full CGI (explosions) but if you watch it 2D it won't bother you. Amber Heard did it again, I wonder if she will ever be seen in a blockbuster but seeing so many flick with her she's ready for it.\n\nGore 2/5 Nudity 2,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

Not far behind comes the accountant from hell (William Fichtner) to bring Mr Milton back. Jonah King's plan is to sacrifice the baby at the next full moon to open the gates hell. John meets up with a waitress (Amber Heard) and they both run off to save his daughter. I liked it. Look it's a plate of steaks. Nothing fancy just meat. A A.D.D movie.

We kept asking each other \"they can't be serious?\" at the start of the move and then once we got into the tongue in cheek stuff it was a Coen brothers moment - this stuff is wonderful. It is full of irony, comedy and really fun action scenes. One caveat though, this is not the action movie you want your young adults and kids to see -I mean the guy drives around with an \"I brake for pussy\" bumper sticker on his car! But when the kids are in the other room and you want to see something other than a romance story of a young perfect couple working out their tough life problems -I'm being sarcastic here- then this is a good choice.

Cage exhibits the same ability to gun down others instantly and at the same time dodge a hail of bullets without even trying to as Arnie but so what? An excellent kick ass female - Amber Heard, some reasonably well delivered quips from Cage and cars, guns and girls. What's not to like? Well the pretty weak climax I suppose.

He decides to take along a white trash waitress (Amber Heard) with him, because he needed to borrow her car.\n\nThe only real actor in the movie is cast as a suit wearing weirdo calling himself the accountant (William Fichtner) who is on Milton's trail because apparently when you escape hell, just like the IRS, they get accountants to track you down.\n\nSo an 8 is high for this movie, but I have to give it up to the director for taking the route of making a bad movie and taking it to the limit.

He's a solid actor with the right script, and this is one of them.\n\nFichtner, as \"The Accountant,\" reminds me of Christopher Walken, but not in the sense that his style is a ripoff. He is a great actor and every scene in the movie with him is a joy to watch.\n\nA few scenes could use a bit of polish, and the ending honestly feels like maybe the final encounter should have lasted just a bit longer, but that's about as much of a complaint as I could make.

His agenda: save his granddaughter from being sacrificed at the hands of a backwoods Satanic cult led by Jonah King(Burke), who also murdered Milton's daughter. Along the way he meets tough chick Piper(Heard), who decides to tag along for the ride. But also in for the trip is The Accountant (Fichtner), Satan's right hand man who'll stop at nothing to bring Milton back where he belongs.\n\nIf any recent movie could be considered a sequel to the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino team up Grindhouse, Drive Angry would be that movie. This is a cheesy, gory, and scuzzy exploitation style flick that surprisingly entertains.\n\nThis is due to two things: One is the 3D. This is no cheap last minute post-production Clash of the Titans 3D. It's actually some of the best 3D seen all year. That's probably because director Patrick Lussier is no stranger to 3D(he did the 3D remake of My Bloody Valentine, which also had great effects). Bullets, skulls, bodies, and cars coming at me actually made the experience all the more better.\n\nNow the second reason is Fichtner, who steals every single scene as suit wearing The Accountant. One moment he's a menacing figure who can kill you with no mercy, the next he's cruising in a truck with liquid hydrogen listening to KC & The Sunshine Band. He made this movie, and I liked his character so much that I would pay to see a spin-off.\n\nNow what about the rest of the cast? Cage is, well, Cage. He's actually a little more tame that his normal insane persona. That also makes him look like cardboard through some scenes. His stupid one liners were also pretty terrible, but not in a good way. Burke is basically a psychotic Southern Louisiana boy who you'd rather laugh at than be afraid of. Heard is okay, but some of the time she just feels like filler. David Morse has a few scenes as Milton's old friend, but he didn't get that much screen time and I left myself wondering why he was there. was he a sidekick? One to seek advice from? I don't get it.\n\nThe script is crap but that's obvious. Throw in a guitar fueled score by Michael Wandmacher and you've got yourself a full hour and 45 minutes of insanity that left me smiling and cheering throughout. I actually wanted to give the movie a 9, but then I realized that extra star was just for the 3D. If you don't catch this at a theater, still give it a midnight view with a 6-pack and some friends. You won't be disappointed.\n\n8/10"

People went expecting something more than it is.\n\nBest performance in the movie is William Fichtner. I don't often like him in movies, but I absolutely LOVE HIM in this movie. He's a laugh a minute or MORE every time he's on screen. Nick Cage is simply Nick Cage in this I don't think he's anything else in anything else, but this time it fits. Billy Burke I love him in most things he's in and he's doing an over the top evil douche in this and doing it well.\n\nAll in all people. Don't expect anything, but an action dark comedy.

The violence is all over and people die in, well, creative ways so to say.\n\nIn the Grindhouse genre, plot or story are not that important. Mostly it's cheesy stuff. Character development is almost zero too. But like I said watch this movie for entertainment, not for the solid screenplays or whatever. The action is solid, lots of car chases and funny moments, guns and nudity complete this flick in a good way.\n\nI would recommend it to people who like movies like 'Machete' or 'Once upon a time in Mexico'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Please do NOT watch the trailer for starters.\n\nThis is like Supernatural meets Constantine. Horribly funny for horror/action fans, this literally made me laughing from the beginning.\n\nThroughout the film this was surprisingly good entertainment and very good laughs, some that are not so \"visible\" and others.\n\nDon't except some very intelligent script, take this as a pure entertainment and concentrate that way you get the best out of it.\n\nWilliam Fichtner did also very funny acting, good and funny. Try to avoid this if you don't like action etc. at all. Im not action fan actually but this one was so nicely put together with different genres and enjoyable.\n\nEven the ending was really cool. No need to tell the plot, it just this dude (Cage) who comes back from hell to save little girl, his granddaughter from slaughtering and it goes really really messed up.\n\nI truly recommend this one 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just what I was in the mood for. Vengeance, good special effects and great action. Not deep or realistic by any means, but it was effective in making it easy to suspend belief. In the vein of Rodriguez and Tarentino, closer to Rodriguez for it's gore. Well worth the $3.99 paid to download it from Amazon. In some respects similar to Ghostrider. Not a big fan of Cage and he's made some lousy movies, but this was one of his better ones. I've generally liked William Fichtner as an actor e.g. Black Hawk Down, Armagadon. I thought he was a little weak here as the \"Accountant\" but passable. Cage was decent. Amber Heard, who I never heard of was okay. Wouldn't be looking for a sequel anytime soon but it was definitely entertaining."
