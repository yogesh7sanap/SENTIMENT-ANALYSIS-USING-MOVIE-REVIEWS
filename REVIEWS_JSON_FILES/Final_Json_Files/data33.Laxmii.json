However, he seems to have done some decent work in this one. There is \u00e0 lot of overacting from the supporting cast. But it has been done to add masala to the movie. Kiara's role could be done by anyone as there was nothing important to be done by her. The climax is made with heavy graphics and mindless but visual."

The story was interesting, however I felt the movie was more heroic and masala(exaggeration) rather than realism. I know it's a horror movie anyway, but still there were situations that could have been made more real than just drama!\n\nLaxmii has some advantages over Kanchana, in terms of variations and realism. Although it stars Akshay Kumar who is one of the big actors in the whole Bollywood, it is much lesser 'hero centric' than Kanchana.\n\nI am really into horror movies, and that's why I get disappointed in most horror movies. Either the movie should be realistic(logical) or a tight packed story without realism. Most movies I've watched usually scares us by utilising our reflexes like a sudden sound. I personally prefer conscious build up of fear.\n\nFinally, in that experience Laxmii is a mix of little bit packed story with some drama. I feel it is better than several horror movies in the entire Bollywood, hence I give 7 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Laxmmi (2020) : Movie Review -\n\nIt's been almost a decade now that we saw Akshay Kumar in Horror Comedy in Bhool Bhullaiyya (2007) untill he come with Laxmmi. This is very much upto the fictional ghost story than Bhool Bhullaiyya which was more of a psychological thriller and both films are remakes. Kanchana directed and led by Raghava Lawrence was a sensation in it's regional industry but somehow on pan India level it looked cheap due to limited standard of that small industry. So when Bollywood remake was announced then it was obvious that those cheap things would be polished on large scale in Laxmmi. But unfortunately this shoe get more dusty while trying to polish the original layer.\n\nLaxmmi is about Asif, a happily married man working in organisation to clear the superstitions from society's mind. He transforms into Laxmmi, a ghost of a transgender who wants to take revenge against evils who stopped her from making something big in male oriented society. The scipt has seen a lot of changes from the original Kanchana and actually it should have worked as advanges but here it goes in opposite direction. Mainly couple of changes in the motive of the transgender looks much weaker than it was in the original. Music is decent where 'Burj Khalifa' tops the list while other songs are either bad or average.\n\nWhen it comes to remaking a popular film there is always an obsession about bringing something different in the story or else people won't like the copy paste so Laxmmi tries the same but fails and it fails exactly at it's strengths. The climax scene tries to make the hero look real hero of the story and not the Laxmmi which is terrible and somewhere it misses the chance of showing devotional powers. Usually, in horror films the devotional and God's powers things works and then there is Laxmmi which completely deletes this folder. The screenplay loses the grip the first half itself because cheap comedy doesn't help much nor any scene is scary enough.\n\nAkshay Kumar as Asif disappoints but as Laxmmi he's a big Bomb. Sharad Kelkar as Laxmmi gets only 4-5 scenes and still manages to overtake rest of the cast. Sharad's acting in speech scene is terrific, just brilliant. Kiara Advani looks beautiful and does nothing else. Supporting cast is decent and you can take it as an overstatement. Raghava Lawrence directed the orginal and he did some mistakes there too but now he had a chance to overcome his falters but he even forgot to make it to basics. Overall, Laxmmi is an average flick saved by two things, one is Akshay Kumar and Sharad Kelkar's performances as Laxmmi and two the social message it provides for transgender community with little bit emotional support.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"

The film was neither terrifying nor funny and above all it was as per thecode of conduct that such Ott films are following... disrespect and hurt the sentiments of the Hindus and Garner good reviews! But HELL NO I am severely disappointed by Akshay Kumar sir who wished to show off himself as a politically and religiously correct man but ended up being hilariously Muslim favourite.... There was a scene in the beginning of the film where a Hindu pundit was called out for being \"dhongi and pakhandi\" for he was faking the existence of a ghost inside of a girl... But in the latter half of the film when our Baba's were beating women for being allegedly possessed by spirits! Not hilarious but hilariously stupid and illogical film....I won't discuss the parts here as it would be a spoiler but I know this that you would for sure be able to notice a Void Of good story and logic but what you would find will only be MUSLIM FAVORITISM in this film throughout it's running minutes. You can read about everything else that is Sharad khelkar's Master class performance and A good performance by Akshay Kumar in the final minutes of the film...but that's only worth 2 stars for me.... I am highly dissatisfied by this film and I think that Kanchana should have been left alone and this remake was completely unnecessary."

The execution failed to be on par with its preemptive measures. Onliest reason being, an amateur & Ignorant mindset.\n\n\n\nAs it is a remake of a Tamil Film, the distinct flavour of South Indian content is perceivable. Let that be an over the top attire in some sections of comedy or a massy feel in its source material. From inessential inclusion of songs to emotions falling flat most of the time. An obvious bunch of missed opportunities.\n\nOther than a disheveled narration, the writing had its fair share of sluggishness too. Especially on the characters. Except few; others had discouraging sessions. Keeping all negativities aside, thankfully some of the performances kept me going. A praiseworthy attainment of Akshay Kumar as a transgender & a surprising act from Sharad Kelkar brought glimmers of hope and a nervy smile on my face.\n\nSo to conclude, I adore Akshay Kumar's versatility and sheer audacity to deliver social messages through his work. But this time, his venture has witnessed a failure. I'm not opposing its appearance as a mainstream entertainer, but when the crux of the concept held that much of an importance; If it was to me, I would have picked a more streamlined method."

There were instances that made us laugh, and there were instances which made us shiver out of fear. Lawrence attempted to recreate that perfect combo in Bollywood aiming a wider audience with a bigger budget and starcast. This however failed miserably , as with most Bollywood remakes. Neither scares nor entertains. It is quite surprising since Raghava himself made the original and even starred as the lead. Although the remake is almost a frame-to-frame copy, what falls short is poor dialogues which doesn't give justice to the screenplay. Dialogue writing is an art. Quality of a scene can be elevated with good lines and delivery. Most original films in respective language does throws a punch with every lines. Hindi, Tamil, Telugu , Malayalam, Kannada does have movies which had great scenes let down by poor lines while dubbing. KGF was good, but listening the lines in Kannada provides you goosebumps, so does Baahubali. This film sounds more like a Hindi dubbed south Indian film. Thats the quality of dialogues. Akshay did justice to his role and so did Sharad Kelkar. Kiara Advani did the same as Rai Laxmi in tamil. Look pretty and be on the film. Devadarshini and Kovai Sarala proved they are pioneers in physical comedy and comic timing in Kanchana. Sadly that's what is lost in remake. Much of the comedy in original was by the legendary Kovai Sarala whom we followed blindly in her laughs and screams. Here, sadly the replacement cast is not upto mark. They are not sure if they need to be serious or comic in this film, swithcing between the two even in the same scene. Rajesh Sharma was the only proper comic relief that too only for a while. The entire blame should be directed to Raghava who like other south directors tried to do the same as he did in Tamil entirely ignoring the fact that taste of audience is different and so is their culture and beliefs. Raghava had no control over the dialogues which he mindlessly dubbed to Hindi. He also rushed throughout the film, not allowing time for audience to connect with horror elements or the lead characters. Maybe he got too excited with big stars and budget. Better he sticks only in Tamil. Overall it is just a decent movie. Why poor reviews? Radical Hindus / andhbakts are too involved emotionally with their religion. Laxmi bomb is a diwali cracker in market not insult to Laxmi Devi. The day these buffoons grow a brain, the nation will prosper. Else, everything is entangled with caste and religion. The world is miles ahead and yet we are stuck in the web of narrow minded morons."

Mata ka bhajan is a parody of a rap song sung by a Muslim guy. 5.The hero is \"Asif\" who would talk about Islam whereas other Hindus will not shy away from praising Allah.\n\nActing by Akshay and Kelkar is good. The stupidity about ghosts and bad vfx will never let you enjoy the movie. Music is also below average.\n\nMovie is full of nonsense. 1)2 kids which are part of family disappears completely after the fist 15 minutes. 2) Pir baba catches the ghost in a bottle 3) many loose ends and bad editing"

Most bollywood audiences don't understand south-indian languages, so hindi remakes are often made.\n\nMovie was actually quite entertaining, with a comic angle to the traditional horror genre. It was not great like Bhulbhulaiya, etc., but still not as bad as Entertainment, Action Replay, etc."
