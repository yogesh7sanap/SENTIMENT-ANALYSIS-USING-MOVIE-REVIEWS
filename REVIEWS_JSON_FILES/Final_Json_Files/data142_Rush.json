        "review_detailed_main": "The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes.\n\nThe film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian \"professor\" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt.\n\nThe two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense.\n\nThe film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life.\n\nThe two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred.\n\nAfter that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail \u2013 although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then \u2013 and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash).\n\nWe are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here \u2013 the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time.\n\nThe casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame \u2013 only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt \u2013 Lord Hesketh, \"Bubbles\" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen.\n\nThe love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame \u2013 as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances.\n\nThe attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film \"feels\" like it's happening in the 70's.\n\nFor anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s.\n\n'Rush' did seem intriguing, Ron Howard has done some good work in the past and my sister and her boyfriend absolutely raving about it. However having no knowledge of auto racing and having never found it my cup of tea there was a touch of intrepidation. As well as the worry as to whether there was going to be any bias and whether it was going to stray from the facts. After watching 'Rush', this viewer is so glad that she gave it a chance because it was a gripping and entertaining film from start to finish, and quite easily Howard's best work in some time.\n\nSome occasional rushed pacing and some weak dialogue, that lacked flow, sounded awkward and stuck out like a sore thumb against everything else that was done to such a professional level, were the only drawbacks to overall one of 2013's better films. The time period is very evocatively depicted, there is a real sense of time and place, there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout, the editing is slick, clever and gives the race scenes the thrills they need and the photography is similarly audaciously slick and like the cinematographer was part of the action itself, especially good in the climactic Japanese race sequence. Hans Zimmer's score is not his best work by all means, but it went with the racing theme remarkably well and does capture the mid-70s time period and the atmosphere of the sport to such great effect (again the final race in Japan stood out). The sound effects also help, having a real authenticity.\n\nFor a film about auto racing, one does have to talk about how 'Rush' deals with the race sequences. The good news is that they are absolutely thrilling and keeps one to the edge of their seat, while all of them are brilliantly done, showing how glamorous and also dangerous the sport is (not many sports films I've seen have properly and fully captured the spirit of the sport it's portraying in the way Rush did) the highlight is the climactic Japanese race, which was both exhilarating and moving (masterful if having to sum it up in one word). Howard not only depicts the mid- 70s as if the viewer were transported back in time and part of the period (such was the evocativeness of the atmosphere) and adopts a visual style that never looks cheap and as said like the cinematographer was there part of the action, but he shows here that he knows how to tell a story. The storytelling is always compelling, thoughtful, informative and thrilling with a surprising amount of emotional impact, found myself really identifying with Lauda.\n\nThe film is faithful to the facts, the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is genuinely engaging and are shown a lot of respect and dimension here. Neirher Hunt or Lauda are one-dimensional here and, although Lauda is the more sympathetically drawn of the two, one does not takes sides with one or the other. It also is tightly paced and assured, never getting bogged down in too much back story, too much soap- opera, too much sentimentality or technical jargon/minutiae (that would likely have gone over the heads of first-time viewers or non-fans of the sport). All the supporting performances are well-done, though some with not much to do, with Olivia Wilde and Christian McKay faring the strongest.\n\nIt is however the two leads that carry 'Rush' cast wise, both of them as close to perfect as one can get. Daniel Br\u00fchl gives Niki Lauda a real brooding intensity and genuine poignancy, making it very easy to feel sorry for him, while swaggering Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Hunt.\n\nAll in all, a gripping and hugely entertaining film. Has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by the number of things 'Rush' does right. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.\n\nJames Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.\n\nDo yourself a favour and see it now."

The race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a pale reflection today's F1 is of this once great sport, and what great characters we have lost...\n\nA real must see movie"

You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable.\n\nIt is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Br\u00fchl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.\n\nA great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced.

While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.\n\nI was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films \"Le Mans\" and \"Grand Prix\"--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly \"Le Mans\"). However, both films were a bit light on plot. \"Rush\", on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.\n\nThe acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids."

        "review_title": "Thrilling character study",
        "review_detailed_main": "As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that), but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented these men were at driving these \"coffins on wheels\", every race could spell out death. Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired, dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent. His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical, and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain. But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed, but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976 Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames, and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred and bandaged. Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful, critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing personalities coming together on the world stage. Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of sport."

Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.\n\nIf your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever"

        "review_detailed_main": "''Rush'' is a very good film about the rivalry between two Formula 1 race car drivers and their lives behind it. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is a triumph concerning action sequences, film editing and sound. Despite it being a sports film about racing, ''Rush'' never fails to develop its characters, its story and its suspense thus delivering a deeply satisfying conclusion.\n\nBeginning with the film's performances, one would expect to see little character development, acting and emotion but a whole lot of action. However, this is not the case. The film's performances are very good. Daniel Br\u00fchl gives an outstanding performance as Austrian Niki Lauda: from the character's personality, body movement, expressions and emotions to his speaking accent, Br\u00fchl manages to handle it more than well and deliver a very authentic and powerful performance. From his first appearance in the film, he stays a very powerful figure throughout the film and very memorable after it. He realizes the character's motives and feelings which enables him to fully portray his character. Despite his performances in films such as ''Thor'', ''Red Dawn'' and ''The Cabin in the Woods'', Chris Hemsworth gives a decent enough performance as James Hunt. He is far from outstanding but he portrays his character as he should be, never overacting nor underplaying his character, thus delivering a satisfying and believable performance as a race car driver. The rest of the cast doesn't have much screen time since the film mainly focuses on the two protagonists but their acting does not disappoint.\n\nThe film's exhilarating action sequences are probably the main reason people will go to see it and they will not be disappointed. With rapid but smooth editing, the renowned film editing duo (Daniel P. Hanley, Mike Hill) manages to ''tell'' the story rather clearly rather than just smothering it under its heavy action scenes. Other technical aspects such as sound editing, sound mixing and cinematography are superb. Sound, especially, plays a very important role in the film and luckily, the sound is clear, realistic and not bombastic as most Hollywood action films. The racing sequences are superb: we see them from every angle possible, never confusing nor annoying the viewer with their rapid cuts, instead keeping the viewer interested (especially during the final climatic race). As for the score, Hans Zimmer's fast paced music adds nicely to the film's racing sequences, turning the suspense meter way up without distracting the viewer. As with most of Zimmer's works, the film's score is very epic and memorable which captures the film's action.\n\nWhat works very well in the film is the fact that it's not just a film full or car explosions, racing and trophies but a film which tells the story of two people who succeeded in the race tracks, a film which doesn't drown its characters under its impressive action sequences but allows them to breath."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard is the rare Hollywood auteur that doesn't have a distinctive style (how did the guy that gave us \"Frost /Nixon\" give us Jim Carrey's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\"?!). In his latest film \"Rush\", we get a glimpse of Howard playing with some Danny Boyle-esque flair, especially in the racing scenes. Unfortunately, outside of this visceral, kinetic spirit, \"Rush\" lacks an emotional connection with its audience, leaving us in the dust with only a memory of what just sped past. The amazing true story about the on-and-off-the-track rivalry of racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl) should be ripe pickings for good filmmaking. The story has some unexpected turns that are enlivened by their being true. Add to that some decent performances and a strong middle section involving a hospital, this should be a no-brainer success. Sadly the film fails in a number of other ways: the dialogue, while not bad, is unoriginal and boring, clich\u00e9d and overly-Hollywood. This along with some silly, overwrought Hollywood moments (\"We may hate each other, but at least we respect each other\") hurt \"Rush\" immensely. Admittedly, I am not a racing fan of any kind, and this is clearly a movie made for them. Nonetheless, I think Howard is trying to reach beyond this demographic but comes up short. \"Rush\" is by no means a complete failure, but when it steps away from the formula 1 racing and slows down, it really putters out\u0085pun totally intended."

I'd seen James Hunt in interviews and recently watched footage with Niki Lauda so got an idea of the characters.\n\nThe film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI.\n\nThe acting, on the whole is nothing short of miraculous, Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic, particularly Hemsworth, who's accent, mannerisms and natural acting was a big surprise. I could see a few awards for this role. I have seen Bruhl in quite a few films and I am always impressed so this just continues the trend. All the support actors are very good in smaller roles.\n\nThe film is well paced for 2 hours and quite graphic, particularly a few accident scenes.\n\nDirection: Ron Howard - nice job, I'm not a massive fan and particularly after the da vinci/Angels fiasco's a big return to decent form. The flair was there but played safe (As normal) but let the story and the actors take centre stage.\n\nIf you like History in F1, a well documented rivalry and a film that capture this, watch it.

He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.\n\nHowever, the great reviews of \"Rush\" and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.\n\nGrade: A-"

We know his manner and speech extremely well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible task.\n\nBut Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this production has used some artistic license to enhance them.\n\nBut the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events. That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents. And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as Niki was himself."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.\n\nI also really like the fact that Rush is more than just a sports film about racing. It's a character study about two masters of their craft, embedded in deep rivalry. Both of them know that they stand unopposed, except for that one man, who's their polar opposite in both personality and driving style, yet who is just as capable. That's a great setting for a movie and Rush beautifully explores the possibilities given to it. You buy the rivalry and by the time of the final race I found myself at the edge of my seat, even though I already knew the outcome.\n\nIt's also great how the movie never takes sides. It's not a film about Niki Lauda - even though he was involved in its making - nor is it about James Hunt. It's about them both and about the sport as a whole.\n\nTo sum it up, I'd say this is the best sports movie I've seen in my life. But it's that because it's more than a simple example of its genre. It's a brilliant character study, an interesting period piece, a gripping drama and yes, at its core, a film with furiously fast cars. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970\u2032s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.\n\nGrade: A\n\nSCRIPT The story follows two F1 drivers in the mid 1970\u2032s that don't always get a long but have a mutual respect for one another. It centers around British driver, James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. Peter Morgan's script is brilliant and Howard brings it to life in some really great ways. In essence, both characters are the protagonist and the antagonist of the story. The film explores Hunt and his immature ways but at the same time makes him very likable. Then the story switches to Lauda and his quest to live his own life outside the big family business, yet again making him likable. However, at the same time each take their own turn in being the \"bad guy\" and showing you qualities that make this person flawed and unlikable in some ways. But then the movie brings it back around showing you why these characters are good characters to root for and the mutual respect they have for one another. It's the competition that drives them in this story. What makes it so great though, is that the audience really gets to choose who they want to root for. They build up and tear down each character so flawlessly. The use of narration at the beginning and at the end was a perfect choice as well. The ending becomes a bit sentimental and hits the buttons that you'd expect from Howard and company.\n\nGrade: A\n\nPERFORMANCES Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth are amazing. This is perhaps Hemsworth's best as he portray's James Hunt in some incredible ways. He's the dangerous driver that has Tony Stark mentalities in terms of partying, women and being extremely likable. Yet Hemsworth shows some depth and some emotion here as well which this character calls for in some ways. Br\u00fchl, who you may know from Inglorious Basterds, almost steals the show. He's the Austrian car genius who becomes famous for knowing how to make the cars lighter and faster, thus making him part of the Ferrari team. One can argue he's the bigger lead here as he narrates a good chunk of the story and brings in some great perspectives. Br\u00fchl's performance is spot on though and brings life to this character even when Lauda is more deadpanned. Olivia Wilde is good here although her character is a small role. This is about Br\u00fchl and Hemsworth and they carry the movie extremely well.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nSCORE Freakin Hans Zimmer. The dude is on fire lately. A lot of people like to criticize Zimmer for having score's that are similar or nothing new but they work. His score for Man of Steel added a lot to that film and his score for The Lone Ranger was about the only good part of that movie. And his score for Rush was really great, again. It added a lot of intensity to the racing moments and has become something he's perfected. The score here is more laid back and in the backdrop though many moments but when the action ramped up, so did his score as well as your emotion.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS Rush was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Given the sports stature of F1 in the U.S., I didn't have much expectations but Ron Howard usually delivers and he does once again. The cinematography is gorgeous and makes it visually very exciting. The performances are stand outs which makes the story feel so alive in many places.\n\nOverall Grade: A"

        "review_detailed_main": "After a short framing section, this starts off with a bloody-mouthed Chris Hemsworth in half-undone racing coveralls strutting into an emergency room on a wave of testosterone like a cock into a hen house. Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places. In short, it looks like we're going to get a 16 year old boy's dream of being a race car driver.\n\nIt turns out to be a great deal more. Director Howard and writer Morgan turn out to have a lot more empathy with the precise, earnest, \u0171ber-professional Austrian Niki Lauda (known as the Rat or the Sour Kraut) than they do with long haired, gorgeous English party animal James Hunt \u2013 there's a montage after Hunt wins the 1976 Formula 1 driving championship that subtly trivializes and belittles what he does with his victory, and a concluding t\u00eate \u00e1 t\u00eate between Hunt and Lauda that makes it explicit. This isn't surprising considering the way the critics have treated Howard's body of work over the years.\n\nBut along the way we're treated to a struggle between Cavalier and Roundhead, JFK and Nixon, inspiration and perspiration that is never less than captivating. The personal distaste between the two men, the contrast of styles, and the way they get into each other's heads are too intense for the subject of their rivalry, which after all is only motor racing. You feel that they were born 30 years too late, and that they should have been up in the sky a generation earlier, trying to kill each other in Spitfires and Messerschmitts instead of zipping around in McLarens and Ferraris. The gorgeous women (Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) are more or less along for the ride as arm candy, although Hunt gets to display some dry, malicious English wit after his supermodel wife (Wilde) dumps him for Richard Burton. The racing sequences pull you in, and the overwhelming sound design gives you a real feel for the power (and fascination) of the internal combustion engine. The climactic race is subtly different than you'd expect from a sports movie but absolutely true to the characters.\n\nThis is not great art, but it is thrilling popcorn entertainment the way it's supposed to be done, and it is to racing movies like Das Boot is to submarine movies. They'll never have to make another one."

Instead, it's a very nice movie, fairly accurate, and a must-see for any racing enthusiast.\n\nFirst and foremost, the racing scenes and the championship events are accurate and spectacular, they're pure fun. I have to say there are some of the most perfect special effects I've ever seen, you can't say what's real and what's not.\n\nAlso, I've NEVER seen a more accurate depiction of the 70's style; that's a very important thing to preserve the atmosphere and let you believe the movie is actually set in the 70's. Lots of movies fail miserably while attempting this. Here, every single t-shirt and haircut of the crowds in the stands is spot-on, the film grain for the racing scenes is very good, the cars are perfect, and most notably the tracks are straight out of the seventies.\n\nI like when the actors look like the real people they are interpreting. Here, everybody is a dead ringer: Niki, Marlene, Clay, everyone.\n\nActing is good, Bruhl starts a bit over the top, but soon you'll get aquainted with his persona, and you'll find it's actually a very good performance. Supporting cast is on par. Just Hemsworth is a bit off target, because Hunt had a playful note he's not able to replicate. Here he plays just the \"handsome rogue\", and little more.\n\nThe Lauda-Hunt relationship is the less accurate part of the story, but this is an understandable license.\n\nLastly, some quotes have real swagger, the Drake makes a cameo appearence, and the scene where Lauda drives in the italian countryside is outstanding."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not bad but terribly overrated drama. Seems like these days every movie that is halfway good is over-hyped and hailed as a masterpiece. I don't know when it happened but at some point in the last decade or so the bar was lowered. Now every moderately good film is lumped in with the greatest of all time. I'm no racing fan but I have enjoyed racing films before. Rush is overlong and doesn't build to anything really. The ending, or more to the point the last half hour, felt like a story searching for a powerful finish that it never found. I know this is based on real people and events, but I fail to see how that matters in the context of judging how they told the story. A dramatic film is not a documentary and artistic license is acceptable and, in many cases, desperately needed. What it comes down to is that this is a middle-of-the-road drama. Nothing exceptional and certainly nothing new. The performances are adequate, but nothing to rave about. The story, real or not, is fractured and lacking in any sense of a point in the end. I felt like I learned nothing of significance about the two men that the film focuses on. This is particularly true for James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Other than being a walking clich\u00e9, what else was there to the man? The film has no answers. It has few more for Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda. Perhaps if they had chosen to focus on just one of the men rather than both, they could have told a more interesting story. As it is, it's a superficial drama about two men with unimpressive racing footage sprinkled throughout."

Hanz Zimmer is the man for scoring this movie. The movie is not about the sport, it's about the hateful and envious relationship between two rivals the whole world knows about. I did not expect this movie to surprise me so much as it did, the drama was invigorating and exciting at the same time. It was such an honor to meet Niki Lauda who flew himself specially from Monza, Italy for the premier at TIFF. Such an amazing night.\n\nThe movie is based on the rivalry of Britain's McLaren F1 driver James Hunt and Austrian driver Niki Lauda who represented Ferrari at the time. Great men!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Formula One racing isn't a sport that I watch regularly but I certainly respect it more than its competing leagues. The tracks are complex, the opportunities to pass are limited and the pit stops must be carefully timed. But this movie isn't current F1 racing, this movie largely takes place in the late 1960s till the mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous and that much more invigorating because of it. We get a classic storyline of two rivals with two very different styles, they had to respect each other due to the sheer magnificence of their driving.\n\nThere are so many things that I want to praise this movie for. I guess I'll start with how thrilling the world of 1970s Formula One is. The cinematography, the sound effects and the camera angles make this as close to a racing experience as you can imagine. I literally felt like I was in one of the cars racing and I haven't had a theatre experience like that in a while. It was like being on a roller coaster, I got caught up in the \"Rush\" so to speak. The racing sequences are exciting, and the movie does a great job reminding you of how dangerous the sport is. One of the taglines for the film is \"more powerful than the fear of death is the will to win\" I couldn't agree more. People are decapitated, ripped apart, cars burst into flames, this is not a sport for the weak hearted. The movie is involving, white-knuckle tense and I couldn't turn away for even a moment.\n\nPerhaps the biggest credit to Rush is how balanced and even the story is between the two main characters. Neither man is a hero, they both are arrogant jerks who are only interested in their own success. Lauda is cold, calculating, pompous but he has the wit and the skill to back up his big talk. Hunt on the other hand is like the handsome jock you knew in school. He is just as cocky, determined and unlikeable as Lauda but has the drive to win and the silver tongue to gain acceptance from the racing community. The movie does a great job showing you the virtues and faults of both men and amazingly enough you want both to come out on top. A good comparison on how well layered and how well balanced the characters are would be Warrior, another favourite of mine. It's a feat in storytelling and they pull it off perfectly here.\n\nThe acting in the movie is superb to say the least. Both leading actors give excellent nuanced performances that would be worthy of Oscar consideration. Chris Hemsworth seems like a logical choice for the charismatic and determined Hunt. Detractors from this movie claim that it's another typical Hemsworth performance, but I was really surprised with how effective he was at portraying the gauntlet of emotions that Hunt goes through. He has a ton of natural screen presence, but this movie shows he's got real leading man skills (outside of Thor) If I was forced to pick between them though, I would credit Daniel Bruhl with the best performance. I've only seen him in Inglorious Basterds but in this movie he does a flawless accent and has so many levels to his acting job as Lauda. You believe he is Lauda and he's just so wonderfully unlikeable, I would give him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lauda is a complex man with a strict code and due to Bruhlh's performance he's captivating.\n\nI've talked about the dual leads enough but another pleasant surprise about this movie is that it features some strong female characters. Olivia Wilde is only in the movie for a short period of time but she's good. Olivia is more known for her amazing good looks but she's a better actress than she's given credit for and has done some good work (House, Deadfall etc.). She's talented and she makes the most of her screen time. I also really enjoyed the performance of Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene who is the woman who eventually marries Niki. She's feisty and she's a good match for Niki. She's strong, beautiful and she plays a critical role in shaping where Niki heads in the course of the movie. With a cast that lacks proven Oscar contenders, the acting is Oscar calibre and is one more firing piston in the proverbial engine that is this movie.\n\nMuch like any classic, the movie runs the gauntlet of emotions so well. This movie was sold to audiences through the trailers as an action/sports movie but it's more of a drama with some solid action scenes in it. I've gone on about how much it involves the audience in its plot but what I haven't mentioned is how tense and thrilling the end is. Its lean back in your seat and hold your breath type nerve wracking. The movie has its comedic moments as well, largely thanks to Hemsworth's charm and timing. The movie touches all the bases, making you want to cheer your favourite racer when they cross the finish line first and then drop your jaw in awe when they risk it all, almost killing themselves in the process.\n\nRush had all the action you could want but turned out to be a superbly crafted drama. It's a beautiful movie with some Oscar calibre acting and wonderfully stylish moments. It's my favourite movie of 2013 and it's one of the bigger pleasant surprises I've ever seen in a theatre. I'm giving Rush a 9.5/10 rounding up to a 10/10."

He knew how to set up his racing car.\n\nDaniel Br\u00fchl captures the spirit of this almost cold, aloof character who will then have to recover from an almost fatal accident and make him appear human, even likable.\n\nChris Hemsworth has the showy role as the wild, erratic, playboy James Hunt.\n\nThe guy always looking to have a good time partying. He is reckless on the track, Hunt the shunt is his nickname.\n\nHowever Hunt as his own demons and in the 1976 Formula 1 season, he spends most of his time chasing Lauda who had a dominant points tally.\n\nUnlike other race films, director Ron Howard did not have to try too hard in getting a thrilling storyline. Real life provided it.\n\nLauda was well ahead in the championship until his accident which allowed Hunt to claw back. Lauda miraculously recovered enough despite his burns and returned to racing and the title went to the final race decider.\n\nBoth actors capture the spirit of the people they portray. Hunt became well known to racing fans after his retirement as a F1 commentator and Hemsworth does well in getting his vocal mannerisms with maybe just a lapse or two to his Aussie accent.\n\nI reckon the film would have little interest to those who despise racing but for others there is plenty of thrills here."

I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching \"Rush,\" because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, \"Rush\" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. \"Rush\" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to \"know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\" Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of \"Lonesome Dove\". Like, \"Lonesome Dove,\" \"Rush\" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. \"Rush\" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since \"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly\".\n\nIf you have not seen \"Rush,\" watch the international trailer, available on YouTube. This trailer is the perfect encapsulation of the movie. If you still are not interested, don't bother. However, I hope you are as impressed as I with my favorite film of 2013."

It's a film which explores what makes the two men tick in terms of their personal lives, but it also looks at the world of racing back in the 1970s, which was definitely a more dangerous time to be a racing driver.\n\nThe film begins quite slowly, with lots of extraneous sex scenes that director Ron Howard seems to enjoy slipping in for no real reason other than to titillate the audience. I'm not really a big fan of Howard as director and he's quite lazy here, repetitively using songs on the soundtrack to evoke the emotion of his leading characters when better writing in the script would have helped.\n\nStick with it though, because after the first hour this starts to get much more interesting. A sense of suspense and impending doom hangs over the whole production and you begin to get invested in the leading characters. Both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are good as the leads, with the latter putting in a particularly effective performance as a man whose desire to win leads to some tragic circumstances. RUSH is rounded out by a solid supporting cast and some excellently staged racing scenes which lift it above its average beginnings."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush has my personal distinction of being the first film I've seen after reading the script. Why did I do that? Mostly curiosity of how a film like this is written. I want to be a screenwriter so I wanted to see how it's done, especially those races. It's not the only film of the next four months that I've read nor the first of the bunch. I read upcoming films because reading scripts of films I know can be distracting trying to picture them for myself and unproduced scripts are most likely unproduced for a reason. Upcoming films means I have seen glimpses of them from the trailer but not too much and they're considered good enough to be produced right now. I wouldn't read a potential favourite but I'm still generally excited for the big films of the year. Anyway, it had to be said as it did affect my viewing experience, but it was certainly not a hindrance. It was only a hindrance for differentiating the film and script between the few scenes cut and added but there are only few and mostly for the better.\n\nThe first thing I got from the script was that Rush is all about sex appeal. James Hunt's introduction is written in big bold words given its own line: Sexy. The characters inhabit the extravagant sexy world of the 1970s with all of its grainy flavours and gritty vices. The use of words in the script invite vibrant technical potential in the editing and cinematography department for a audio-visual sensory experience over anything else. All this is designed as a juxtaposition to Niki Lauda, of whom is frequently described as a rat. Rush is sex vs. rat. Which is fine as an oversimplification, but it trades characterisation for superficial personality traits. As charming as Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (who is good, not as great as his current acclaim) are in their roles, they rarely feel like relatable human beings. Granted, the film wants them to feel larger than life but personally I prefer emotional immersion than a spectacle that pushes its audiences away. But flash if it must and flash it does well.\n\nThe rival's back-and-forth continues throughout the film by constantly switching protagonists which although its intentions are that it wants to cover all ground, it results in us never feeling intimate with either of them, especially as each scene is rather short. Ironically, it feels rushed. It's scared of being boring. However, it's the film's third act that makes it all worth it. In that final race, everyone in front and behind camera is at the top of their game and it's a fantastically nail-biting sequence. Even if you know the result, it raises the stakes magnificently. I even forgot what happened by then. Not only is it thrilling but by this point the rivals have found an emotionally rewarding bond, even if they are still at odds. The film quite reminds me of last year's Argo in its pace and rock and roll atmosphere but its final cathartic act makes Rush a stronger film over last years Best Picture. Some have considered that this might be this year's Best Picture and Director. Even if 12 Years A Slave and Gravity weren't this year, I wouldn't see it happening, but after seeing the film I can see it earning a nomination, which I didn't after reading the script.\n\nHowever, the representation of women is still terribly neglected. They are forever on the side, forever turned on (or off) for the men and racing. Olivia Wilde's character is a joke. It's not her fault, it's just what she had to work with. I wish the film didn't bother rather than awkwardly work women in, as there isn't a developed one here, even though the existence of Lauda's wife becomes key in the third act. That's what Rush is like until its third act, unfocused. The best scenes are the longer ones which move the story forward. Ron Howard is usually a very bland director. My favourite of his films is The Grinch, mostly for nostalgic reasons. What lifts Rush is the signature work of Danny Boyle's regular cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. He may have let Trance down but his kinetic closeups make the film, even his documentary-esque wides can be messy and not cut well together. They still made it cinematic. Zimmer's score does a great job of matching up to that standard. I wouldn't call Rush a winner, but it's worth watching.\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The true story of the rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda and the 1976 Formula One season is one of those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction. Fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories, Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, have taken this project on, giving us a movie that is about a clash of ideals and personalities as well as about the drive of motor sports.\n\nJames Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) are racing drivers with different approaches and philosophies whose rivalry starts in Formula Three racing. Hunt is a good looking playboy who enjoys drinking, partying and sex and has charisma to boot. Lauda is a serious minded, extremely determined, technically astute and is able to get the most out of a car, but is a cold, distant man who drives people away. Soon the men's rivalry see them battling it out in Formula One leading to the 1976 season where back-stabbing, danger and disaster affects the sport.\n\nAs a sports movie Rush is a very well made and entertaining film that focuses on its characters ideals and differences. Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl are in top form as they play these very different men. Lauda is a self- determined man who is willing to risk everything to get into F1, but easily rubs people the wrong way, whilst Hunt had a greater support network, media friendly but is a loose cannon. Both end up becoming each other's hubris as they take bigger risks in a sport that already dangerous.\n\nAs well as the focus of their profession, Rush looks at the personal lifestyles of the two drivers, particularly Hunt's as he womanizes as Lauda settles down with a woman. Hunt is a thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst Lauda is aware of the risks of his profession, but does not want to add to them.\n\nTo anyone who knows about Niki Lauda is he suffers a tragedy and the easy route would have been to make Rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity. Fortunately, Howard and Morgan made something more interesting by showing both men to be faulted, that Lauda is not a man who is easy to like, making personal digs against and being a very sore loser.\n\nAt a running of two hours, three minutes, Rush moves along at a very brisk pace. The first 40 to 45 minutes focuses on a six year period as the rivalry builds up. Many story elements are dealt with quickly. A great example of this is when Hunt meets model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde, who does an impressive English accent) in the team garages and the next scene is them getting married. Rush is a movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes. It does seem like a longer cut may exist.\n\nEven though the film is called Rush, Howard and Morgan build up to the racing segments. We get a F3 race near the beginning and then we have a long wait the F1 races. Howard and Morgan focus on three main races in the 1976 season, N\u00fcrburgring, Germany, Monza, Italy and Fuji, Japan. Howard shows his technical acumen with the racing sequences, as we get up close to the action on screen with camera being place many on the parts of the cars, in the driving seat and even in the engine and in the air gun during a tyre change. There are intense, exciting sequences as Howard uses stylistic flashes and slo-mo as we see how dangerous races were in the 70s. Morgan also uses a similar montage trick he used in The Damned United to quickly build a picture of the '76 season with Howard using title cards to the sequence a bit of flash.\n\nThe story about James Hunt or Niki Lauda could have made for a compelling movie on their own terms, but Howard and Morgan give us two films in one. Rush is a very well-made, engaging and compelling sports flick that is character driven and is about the build-up as well as the racing.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

This movie is the most apt adaptation of the real life events between the F1 racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.\n\nIt is obvious that the crew and cast have worked sagaciously to make this as good (and better) to describe the relationship between these two racers perfectly to the real life characters that the movie is based upon.\n\nEvery scene in the movie has been exciting till the very end and towards the end the viewer would only feel the awe of the whole experience. It is my hope that there be a sequel to this with the same crew perhaps based on the life of 7-time world champion Michael Schumacher as it is in the same genre and I'm certain it would be a wonderful watch like how this movie turned out to be!"

Enough importance is given to the technical know how of the Formula one cars without making it over bearing. The racing is shown beautifully! Daniel Bruhl is really impressive in the role of Nikki Lauda and Chris Hemsworth does not look like Thor for a change! Formula 1 fans like myself is grateful for Ron Howard for actually making this movie. All in all, a treat to watch. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard's handsomely-staged drama unfolds in the pit lanes, plush homes, and smoky offices of the Formula 1 world of the mid-1970s. A period biopic, it has a similar look and feel to Tom Hooper's The Damned United, and while it also shares a writer (Peter Morgan), this film isn't buoyed by the same standard of cast.\n\nThe story concerns the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) as they work (or buy) their way up from Formula 3 and compete for the 1976 World Championship. When a film is based on real events, professional critics have a habit of giving away the entire plot, as if we should already be aware of every twist and turn. Ignorance is bliss, as far as this non-professional is concerned, so all I'll say is that there are crashes and squeals on and off the track, and the Championship goes down to the wire.\n\nSome things about Rush are very good. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is pristinely flashy and grimy in the right measures. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring - and suitably drowned out by the excellent sound design. The performances are all solid.\n\nThe problems are with the script, whose dialogue can be lousy at times; really clunky and by-the-numbers. Ron Howard works with workmanlike efficiency, concentrating on moving the plot onward, but never allowing a scene to breathe, perhaps for fear our attention won't hold before the next engine roar. I would rather have seen a tighter focus on fewer characters, and got more involved in Lauda's unusual relationship with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara, making the most of a virtually silent role). The psychology of those who dance with death for a living is referred to without being explored.\n\nSo we're left with a swift, visceral, formulaic page-turner - one that's worth a watch, for non-drivers and petrolheads alike."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rush\" is one of the best films of the year. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth and emotional story telling this film possess. From its brilliant script that infuses humor, drama, and a story about a fascinating rivalry to its impeccable and detailed oriented direction, this film succeeds on every level.\n\nRon Howard's direction is extremely noteworthy as I felt like a part of the journey and involved with the characters as I cheered them on. In the beginning, I was rooting for James, but as the movie progresses and things unravel, I was cheering for Niki. However, as the movie moves forward, I couldn't choose one over the other. This is the type of engagement that I love in movies, it keeps the audience involved and contently thinking about every situation and the characters as a whole.\n\nThis film is well edited and shot as well. I couldn't find a useless or uninteresting moment in this film. Everything flowed very well and the film moved at a brisk pace. It felt as every shot or sequence is catered to moving and developing the characters and their story forward. The racing sequences are well shot and make you feel a part of the race. My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing.\n\nThe cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn't appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It's interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can't stand each other, but can't be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It's quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks.\n\nOverall, \"Rush\" is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It's a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer. His score gives the right amount of emotional punch along with improving everything we see and giving the film a greater amount of importance. I give this film an extremely high 4.5/5, a well oiled film that has no wasted parts."

        "review_title": "Very good true-life sporting drama",
        "review_detailed_main": "There was a time during my boyhood in the sixties and seventies when I took a keen interest in Formula One racing, but my enthusiasm quickly disappeared when I realised what an appallingly dangerous sport it was; during this period several of my heroes were either killed (Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, Piers Courage, Jochen Rindt, Peter Revson) or seriously injured (Stirling Moss, Graham Hill). Despite my disillusionment, however, even I could not fail to be captured by the rivalry between James Hunt of Britain and Niki Lauda of Austria in the 1976 season.\n\nThe events of this season read more like the script of a Hollywood film or of a blockbuster novel than the record of actual historical events. Lauda, the reigning champion, dominated the early part of the season, opening up a big lead in the championship ahead of Hunt, who was regarded as his closest challenger. Hunt won the Spanish Grand Prix, but was disqualified after the race for a technical infringement of the rules. (He was eventually reinstated and his points restored). To add to Hunt's problems, his marriage fell apart when his glamorous model wife Suzy left him for the actor Richard Burton.\n\nThe drama reached a climax when Lauda was seriously injured in a crash during the German Grand Prix. It seemed that his racing career was over, but only six weeks later, defying his doctor's orders, he returned to the wheel of his car in the Italian Grand Prix. During his absence, however, Hunt had whittled down his lead in the championship, and everything now turned upon the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nApart from their love of their sport, the two men had two things in common. Both were from a prosperous upper-middle-class background, and both had defied their families by taking up a career in motor racing rather than in the professions. Both were married to beautiful wives. (Lauda's wife was the socialite Marlene Knaus). In personality, however, they were very different. Hunt was a brash, outgoing playboy and party animal, a lover of the good life and of beautiful women. (Suzy was far from being his only conquest, and his frequent infidelities were a major cause of the breakdown of his marriage. It is, however, perhaps ironic that she left him for Burton, a man twenty years his senior and with an even greater reputation as a hellraiser and womaniser). He started his Formula One career driving for Alexander Hesketh, an eccentric aristocrat and kindred spirit who had founded his own racing team. His aggressive, and often controversial, driving style won him the nickname of \"Hunt the Shunt\". Lauda was much quieter, a calm, calculating perfectionist who was an expert motor mechanic and knew as much about the technical side of the sport as about the actual driving. According to this film, the two men disliked one another intensely, although the accuracy of this has been questioned.\n\nRon Howard is one of the more versatile directors currently working in Hollywood, able to turn his hand to a number of different genres, including comedy (\"The Paper\"), the Western (\"The Missing\") and sword- and-sorcery fantasy (\"Willow\"). \"Rush\", like some of his earlier films such as \"Apollo 13\" and \"A Beautiful Mind\", is a biographical drama, but is quite different in content to either of those films. Howard is able to elicit good performances from his two leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl, who are able to bring out the contrasting personalities of the two rivals. Hemsworth also achieves a remarkable physical likeness to the real James Hunt.\n\nAs with some other sports, notably soccer, there have been a number of films about motor racing, including some good ones, but no really great ones. (For some reason, apart from \"Chariots of Fire\" about athletics, nearly all the great sports films seem to be about either boxing or baseball). \"Rush\" does not quite come into the \"great\" category, but it is nevertheless a very good sporting drama, with some fine acting and exciting action sequences. 7/10"

You might think that a dramatic reconstruction of their careers might not seem very appealing; but you might also remember that the documentary 'Senna', about another talented, spoilt and arrogant young racer was actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Ron Howard's 'Rush' takes a simplistic approach to representing both the character of the two men and also the intricacies of racing, sometimes combining idiocies in both departments simultaneously (in the first race we see, Hunt is beating Lauda to some championship - the cumulation of a season's racing - without apparently even knowing who he is). You won't learn much about motor racing from this film, nor what makes a good driver, nor even much about the two men's characters beyond a tabloid characterisation. Even the track footage is strangely uncompelling."

The racing action is exciting. The 70s style looks good. I love all the cars. Everybody is great in this. I do have two minor problems. I hate most narrations and this is no exception. It is good for exposition but mostly takes the audience out of the movie. However a narration from the real Niki Lauda at the end would be great.\n\nThe other problem is more basic. The movie follows both drivers equally. Although it's filled with details from both men, it's not as easy to fully commit to either men. A more traditional structure would follow one protagonist and it would be a more compelling story. My personal preference would be to follow Hunt up to the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife race. Then they could go back to Niki Lauda's story from the beginning showing the other side of the story all the way to the end. That way it would minimize the back and forth and maximize the rooting interest. Nevertheless this is a very solid thrilling movie. It's compelling and well worth the praise that it gets."

Daniel Br\u00fchl might be German, but his performance as Austrian racing legend Lauda is his best to date. Ron Howard knows how to make movies and this is another showcase for that. Because while this does focus on the drama and the life story, you still get racing scenes, on and off the tracks. Men will be men, I guess ..."

It's simply proof that a good story/movie can exist in any genre or subject. Though I think even the most distant auto racing fans will find Howard's race sequences exhilarating, they're not the focus of the movie nor what makes it great. It's a character story examining the racers and they're rivalry. Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as such a fascinating (and likable) character Lauda is what drives this film but Hemsworth's Hunt is the perfect contrast to him. Just as in real life the absolutely contrasting figures elevate and play off each other beautifully in what made great races and a great film. From Howard, Morgan through Bruhl, Hemsworth, Zimmer and many more, Rush is excellence."

In many ways, I wonder if that wasn't to my advantage going into Ron Howard's 'Rush', a sleek, well tuned film that focuses on the brief, but intense rivalry between these two very different men.\n\nThough the film is tightly focused on Hunt and Lauda, I still found it to be a somewhat superficial examination of them. Like the cars they drive, the movie races by at breakneck speed, rarely taking a pit stop. It's a gorgeous looking film that totally immerses you in its time and place, and the performances are all top-notch, but if I had one complaint it would be that it's just a tad too shallow in its observations and characterizations of these two men and the compelling rivalry they shared."

It shows how Lauda's discipline gives him an edge over his rival but also how Hunt's likability and sometimes cunning ways evens this score! All in a riveting movie which will keep you glued to your screen till the end. everyone of us will relate to one of the two opposing characters in the movie, and will probably be rooting for your guy to come out tops.. the danger in the races will keep you on toes throughout, remember this is from a true story and things do get awry in true stories..\n\nall in all riveting - from start to finish!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to the screening of Rush with high hopes after what i found were Rave Reviews of the Movie.\n\nNo Doubt, the movie is decent solid watch, but falls short of being a classic or worthy of an Oscar nomination as claimed by many.\n\nMild Spoilers ahead.\n\nAs we know by now the story revolves around the rivalry between the Brit James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda with emphasis on the 1976 season. The plot is pretty straight forward and inspired by the true events portrayed authentically.\n\nThe story moves at decent pace and i also kind of liked the way the season is depicted race by race in a tight gritty manner. Technically the film is good, visually authentic, with decent film editing and good cinematography.\n\nHowever, what seriously limits the film is mediocre dialog, and the lack of an emotional connect to the characters. The women and pretty much the entire cast have precious little to do both in terms of dialog or impact.\n\nChris and Daniel are good in their roles but at some level fail to make us deeply care about them. They do of course have their moments but they are few and far between.\n\nIf you are an avid F1 fan like me, you d be aware of how, much up to the 70's (hell even 90's till senna's death)F1 was a very dangerous sport with few security regulations, high risk tracks and an indifferent FIA. The film touches on these themes, but alas, fails to draw the kind of emotions/empathy for the drivers.\n\nSo, all in all a good film which could have been so much more :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Most sports movies involve an underdog trying to defeat an established champion. We've seen a million variations of Rocky Balboa taking on Apollo Creed. But what if someone made a film about Rocky fighting another Rocky? That's what director Ron Howard has done with his excellent new racing movie, \"Rush.\" The most compelling aspect of this tale of two long shots is that it's not the invention of a screenwriter. It actually happened. The drama centers on the rivalry between two drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the movie follows each man's unlikely rise to the top ranks of the Formula One circuit. The heart of the action takes place during the dramatic 1976-racing season during which the British Hunt and the Austrian Lauda vied for the world championship. They both overcame enormous adversity and risked their lives for the chance to win it all. Danger is a major theme hovering over the story, as the potential for death lurks around every turn of track. In this era of racing, an average of two drivers were killed each year.\n\nHoward seems to be at his best when he's telling true stories (\"Apollo 13,\" \"A Beautiful Mind\"). The Academy Award winner here re-teams with his \"Frost/Nixon\" collaborator Peter Morgan, a screenwriter who also specializes in films based on real events (\"The Queen, \" \"The Deal\"). Howard and Morgan resist the urge to embellish the story for dramatic effect, unlike some other filmmakers (I'm talking to you, Ben Affleck). The great script is paired with stunning visuals. Howard immerses us in the racing scenes. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras put us on the course, on the cars, behind the wheel and even inside the engines. The track sequences demand to be seen -- and just as importantly, heard \u2013 in the theater.\n\nBut the drivers themselves are the reason we want to go along for the ride. The two competitors could not be more different. Hunt, the charismatic, womanizing playboy, is played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), while Daniel Bruhl plays Lauda, the quirky mechanical savant who has a way with machines, but not with people. Both actors create engaging portraits of the respective drivers, but Bruhl's performance is the one that will no doubt generate awards buzz.\n\nAudiences, however will root for both men. Neither is the villain. The intense competition pushes each man to excel beyond what they would have otherwise achieved. They make each other better. It's Sosa vs. McGwire, only with spark plugs instead of steroids. The only shame is that one of the men had to lose."

No stupid CGI and feeling was strong all along.\n\nI don't watch these kind of movies usually they are so boring but this woke me up, like what if you lived your life like every day was the last one huh? To be honest, this was most entertaining film I have seen in years, forget the category if you cant stay awake for few hours because there is no explosions or so then go back to the grad school... Even if you didn't like formulas, driving, watching driving this has something so deep in it that it flows in you. Even if you are bored at the beginning and so \"this movie is full of crap\" etc. try to watch 'till the end.\n\nTotally enjoyable and inspiring! This is how formulas should go even nowadays but they sadly doesn't.\n\n10/10 with super experience."

Even though the plot is centered around the racing and the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, the main focus lies on the characters- how they cope differently with the F1 lifestyle, and the fact that any race could be their last.\n\nThe story itself is almost unbelievable if you didn't know it was based on true events. A dramatic ride from start to finish.\n\nHighly recommended!"

Unusually its shot from both points of view that been Hunt and Lauda as each are given equal screen time. The Two lead actors are well cast and convincing even the makeup for Lauda's facial injuries are near perfect, it just goes to show that when Ron Howard when he's on top of his game what he can give to the screen.\n\nVery little archive footage is used and this is at the end of the film which follows up life after the 1976 championships. The costumes, hair styles and mannerism's of the time from what I remember of the 70's are spot on.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember seeing the trailers for RUSH when it was just about to hit the cinemas in the early Autumn of 2013 and thinking it was going to be a major contender for the Oscars . This is the type of movie the Academy Awards love in theory . True life story with actors playing true life people and at the heart of the story rivalry where men risk their lives to show they're better than their rival . On top of that from what you're able to glean from the trailers this is a very proficient film from a technical point of view and I had this down as walking off with the Oscar for editing and sound . Therefore I was totally shocked that the film did not receive a single nomination when the nominations were revealed at the start of 2014 . True 2013 was an exceptional year for films but after finally getting round to watching RUSH I'm still at a loss why it didn't pick up more awards and nominations\n\nNow I've got to put my cards on the table and say motor sport doesn't interest me in the slightest . Formula one is the personification of \"spectator sport\" and totally uninvolving . If you or I were to drive a car a couple of hundred miles per hour down a stretch of road we'd be looking at a court case . As I said I've no interest in this so called sport but as a child I do vaguely remember the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda . Of course all the British press were on the side of Hunt due to chauvinism , To be blunt Hunt was the type of man you're going to instinctively hate on every level . A privileged background , an out and out playboy , too handsome by half and uses every opportunity as an absolute sex magnet it's difficult to find any type of likability in him . Add to this he was a success and bingo , you've got a ready made villain . RUSH doesn't waste much time in showing whose side we should take . Lauda isn't exactly short of money himself but with his arrival on the racing circuit we see a very introverted unassuming man who wants to win . Again this single minded will to succeed in sport can be potentially alienating . Speaking as a Brit our sports heroes are flawed , self destructive people and we don't like dominant winners but this film despite the bias doesn't paint either man as black or white and we see two very complex men at the zenith of their careers trying to be champion . It also points out how dangerous F1 racing was back in those days . In the last 20 years three formula one drivers died in races and I had to check to see if \"Two drivers being killed every season\" wasn't in fact hyperbole and it was indeed a tragic statistic in the mid 1970s\n\nThe acting is uniformly superb and never for a moment did I think was watching actors playing roles . Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth is James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda . . The races themselves are fast and exciting but the film really concentrates on the drama between two men and has a great sense of time and place . Again I've got to repeat that I was puzzled why it wasn't Oscar nominated in any category and seeing it at last I am now doubly puzzled . It's one of the rare occasions where the IMDb members have found a film underrated and put it in the top 250 movies where as the more prestigious award ceremonies had snubbed it"

With the exception of Ron Howard, all aspects of this film where keeping me from seeing it. However, the racing (Formula 1) aspect is the least poignant part of the film. As always, Howard's multi-faceted approach to a film is a grasping angle to what this film offers. Hemsworth's role was far from the macho and mundane characters he has been type-casted in in the past, and Brulh's performance is probably the best of the film. The dynamic relationship between the two main characters and their impeccable direction of their story, from Howard, makes this film an enjoyable watch and perhaps a reference point for the genre of future racing films, that until now have always exhausted my senses."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sure, cutting edge is sexy and gets a lot of attention from both critics and casual movie goers\u2014it's easy to recognize and even easier to talk about. However, there is a place for supreme competence and Ron Howard is one of the most supremely competent. But just because he isn't pushing the limits of style or technique\u2014which can sometimes be little too calculated and self conscious\u2014doesn't mean he's not versatile. Consider the impressive Frost/Nixon and his latest effort, Rush\u2014about as far from each other in style and scale as you can get\u2014even if they do share a common theme. Both films are, essentially, about two men, rivals, who need each other in order to reach their full potential and self awareness.\n\nRush is the story of one of the greatest sports rivalries of all time\u2014 the battle for title of the best Formula 1 racer in the world. The sometimes friendly, and often bitter, rivalry between Britain James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), captivated the racing world through much of the seventies, reaching a dramatic peak in 1976. Note here that in Europe, where Formula1 racers are accorded rock star status (something Hunt's overactive libido takes full advantage of), it captivated far more than the racing world\u2014it captivated an entire continent. One of the best scenes in the film shows, in amusing fashion, that for Italian men the only things in the world more exciting than a beautiful woman are a fast car and Formula 1 driver.\n\nJame Hunt, a brash and sometimes offensively arrogant playboy, navigates his McLaren \"bomb on wheels\" by instinct and guts; Nikki Lauda, a calculating and sometimes offensively arrogant technician, drives his Ferrari by the book, assessing risk and reward like a bond trading statistician. When the car isn't what he wants it to be, Hunt berates his mechanics to make it better; Lauda tells his mechanics precisely what is wrong and how to fix it. Hunt is the charming bon vivant, comfortable in any social situation because he makes it his own; Lauda is an acerbic social misfit with no idea that he repels almost everyone he meets.\n\nDaniel Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda transcends the genre, elevating the film to more than just an action-filled biopic. He plays Lauda as humorless, but with a subtle, squashed wryness behind the eyes. It's a nomination quality performance. Chris Hemsworth proves himself to be better than the pretty boy roles he's had until now\u2014much better. This guy can really act. One problem throughout the film is that Hemsworth is just too damn good-looking, distractingly so. The casting smacks of manipulation. It feels as if the film uses every angle to make us like Hunt as much as we dislike Lauda , to the extent of making Hunt overly attractive and Lauda, well, not so much, in order to set us up for self- chagrin when, later in the film, Lauda faces a personal disaster that can invoke only the most profound sympathy. But in retrospect it makes sense\u2014actual footage of the two runs behind the final credits and it turns out that Hunt was strikingly handsome and Lauda.....\n\nHoward brings together his standing team of Anthony Dod Mantle, cinematographer, and Daniel P. Hanley as editor\u2014and to good effect\u2014the three work together seamlessly. The colors are bright and saturated (A red Ferrari is a damn red Ferrari) with with almost garish seventies style banners flashing on the screen announcing the location of every race\u2014and there are a lot of races. The film does not want for road action. One of the reasons for going to a race movie is to see racing. Rush delivers, and delivers well. To the credit of Hanley, the scenes on the track are exciting and tense in just the right proportion and show in visceral detail how these machines work and just what they and their drivers are capable of\u2014truly awesome, and not in the pop sense of the word.\n\nIt's hard to come up with a criticism of Rush. After all, it is a racing movie and a story of a spirited rivalry between two of the best in their field\u2014each a time-worn genre and somewhat limiting in their strict forms \u2014so it gets a little room for having a few clich\u00e9s, which it does. But, having said that, it is one of the absolute best of both types. It's fun, it's exciting, there are no slow spots and it's got some really cool cars in it. (Maybe the Italians have their priorities in line, after all.) It's definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing on the big screen\u2014the racing scenes deserve far more than a small screen can deliver."

I found this even more so with true stories where the short time the director has to portray a significant amount of information and events, usually fails to do so; this was not the case with Rush. Ron Howard, i have to take my hat off to you, you have annoyed me on the grid walks at the F1 races for the last 6 months with his over the top American nature but his excitement must have been fuelled by his masterpiece that he has created.\n\nI Highly suggest, either prior to watching it or post film, you watch the documentary on them with the real life footage and you will see how to each minor detail of Niki Lauda's (Daniel Br\u00fchl) facial expressions, his rat like teeth, his confident yet calculated persona and James Hunts (Chris Hemsworth) arrogant, lavish, reckless aura. I would have given it a 9/10 as 10/10 is just virtually impossible in my book but seeing the documentary after, you just see how much research and detail has been put into this and how they have turned one of racing most incredible rivalries and tragedies into a living masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's been a lot of hype surrounding Academy Award winning director Ron Howard's newest venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. It's safe to report that \"Rush\" from Universal Pictures is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one. Telling the dual stories of rival racers Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth), two polar opposite personalities and their appreciations for the sport are put in the forefront by screenwriter Peter Morgan.\n\nOff the bat, one of the greatest takeaways from the picture is how confident Ron Howard has become as a director. He handles this sport and story with perfect execution, knowing exactly how he wanted to tell the story. He's never been as stylistically profound as he's been in this film. It's his best outing since \"Cinderella Man\" - a film I found massively underrated in its awards year.\n\nThe technical team assembled debuts some of their finest works in years. From the first frame, you immediately recognize the power and execution of the Sound team. Polarizing, loud, and engaging, nothing makes the film sing more than aural elements put together. DP and Oscar-winner Anthony Dod Mantle has finally found the right vehicle that not only showcases his unique style but takes liberties and chances that pay off in a big way. It's not easy filming a racing movie, in what feels like 48 frames per second, and have the audience catch everything you're doing along the way.\n\nHans Zimmer is on a roll. After infusing his own style into Superman earlier this year with \"Man of Steel\" and added tender qualities into the arsenal of \"12 Years a Slave,\" his work in \"Rush\" is just as impressive and awards worthy for a Original Score mention. Film Editors Mike Hill and Dan P. Hanley cut the film brilliantly. There's a consistent pace that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The editing duo have delivered time and time again in works like \"Frost/Nixon\" and their Oscar-winning works in \"Apollo 13.\" This stands firmly next to those films.\n\nWhat helps the film move along are the impressive turns by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. Two outstanding actors that haven't been given their chance yet to show what their made of in the film world, nail each of their characters beats and motivations that are completely lively. Hemsworth, who has been quite successful in the \"Thor\" franchises and even dipped into the horror genre in \"The Cabin in the Woods,\" has all the goods as a leading man. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamour, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature.\n\nBr\u00fchl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. The co-leading man is just as charismatic, even when he's unlikable, the character actor who has starred in \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"The Fifth Estate,\" displays his abilities when given the opportunity to do so in his own film. Motivating and awkward, Br\u00fchl gets what Niki is all about. It's a remarkable turn from the Spanish-German actor.\n\nTwo things happened when the credits started rolling. The first was I got in my car, which is an automatic Toyota Yaris, and attempted to down shift like a race car driver. \"Rush\" does for Racing the way \"Rocky\" did for Boxing. The second was a burned scene in my brain of a lonely James and an apprehensive Niki speaking by an airplane about what they did for each other. A scene that stands as one of the best of the year so far. Where Morgan falters in the middle with weird character rhythms and missed opportunities for a stronger foundation into their lives, he nails some instrumental scenes that makes the film succeed.\n\nRead More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having seen the rating this film has on this site, I was expecting something much more compelling. For starters, the film takes a few liberties with historical accuracy - such as shifting the races on the F1 calendar - but most of all, it fails to capture the shade of the period. Hunt and Lauda are starting their careers in the immediate aftermath of the Sixties, a period characterised by an increasing gloom. There were fuel crises, there was terrorism, economies on the downturn and people trodden over by capitalism, side by side with the events in the film (1973-76). Meanwhile, this film makes the period seem as rosy as the two main characters, essentially spoiled rich kids driven by their personal manias. Even in its treatment of the drama of F1 - the death of numerous F1 drivers during the 70s, before the sport was regulated into an entertainment behemoth by Ecclestone & co. - the film offers only the occasional piece of gore, making it really hard to feel for the bunch of a-holes sitting in those tiny metal boxes. The sharp editing and vivid colours turn this into a comic book fairytale, largely evading the underlying historical shifts that can well be personified by Hunt and Lauda. All of this wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that this film purports to represent a historically-accurate image of two actual historical personages during an actual historic moment in F1's history. To even out the narrative burden between Hunt and Lauda, \"Rush\" makes Lauda the narrator while focusing the attention primarily on Hunt. There's reason to that, since Lauda is being presented as a quiet perfectionist, while Hunt is the loud, romantic hero of the kind they don't make anymore. This might make it easier for the viewer to recognise the Austrian as someone who's looking out to the future, while Hunt is locked in the past. At the same time, though, the film actively sells Hunt as the hero we can identify with or look up to, selling his childishness and shallowness as evidence of some inner depths, while the thoroughly two-dimensional Lauda is afforded just enough screen time to deliver some of the blandest and most obvious lines about the heroism of an F1 driver. Hunt may win the title in the end, while Lauda will get it back the following year, but in this film, no one really wins. As for acting, this is definitely Hemsworth's film. For all his undeniable talent, Bruhl is too quietly competent to steal the limelight. There's a whole list of decent cameos here, but they're essentially edited beyond recognition, and in some cases, so firmly circumscribed by the bland writing that they are limited to a gallery of nice faces. If your choice is between \"Days of Thunder\" and this, by all means, go for \"Rush.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I was energised by the reviews for this seemingly out-of-water subject for director Ron Howard. Especially the talk of the technical advancement of small cameras that can give you a microscopic glimpse of the physics at play when racing a formula 1 car. I was almost stunned at how clich\u00e9 sounding the exposition was in the first act. I thought, OK it starts out by-the-numbers, but it will finish off a winner (can't help with the racing analogies). I was disappointed how little racing footage was shown. I have yet to see a properly made movie about the drama that occurs on the track during a race. I don't know why directors claim that watching racing is boring. We get glimpses of the forces at hand as the camera is jerked around when attached to the car. I suppose ultimately they are afraid to spend the money to make such action scenes.\n\nIt was made clear in the reviews that this was not a film about racing, but about two prominent characters from the racing world. With the 70s period being depicted, it's almost like \"Forrest Gump\" or something as we relive 1976. I was also feeling kind of trapped in the script that insists on keeping the story factual. The movie spends a great deal of time on relationships, and exploring what their relationships are about. But I felt their was too much time in sacrifice for good old racing footage for the touchy feely stuff.\n\nIf there was any talk of Oscars, the only one I would consider is Daniel Bruhl for lead actor. That is kind of strange that the marketing features Chris Hemsworth, despite the striking persona Niki Lauda displays as a major component to this film. Worth noting is the careful balance of action, tech talk, and marital relations the script adheres to. Such as a major race being shown through the wife watching it on TV.\n\nI enjoy racing movies sometimes, but not when it really isn't about racing. This movie spends less than half the time on racing, and the rest doesn't resonate in an award winning way. Despite my cynicism about this imbalance, there were certainly some poignant quotes that made me think. So credit that to the screenplay. As for director Ron Howard, the only sense of his style that helps perhaps is the pacing. He keeps the momentum going, deliberately sacrificing a beat or two that would normally allow a heavy moment to sink in. For this film it works, because it represents how shallow the main characters are. My final verdict is that it is a watchable movie, but still is not the definitive racing movie. I would wait for the DVD"

It says a lot I couldn't finish 'ford vs Ferrari' but this one grabbed me immediately and didn't let go until it had me in tears. This film really proved Hemsworth as a good actor, and Br\u00fchl, who I've been a fan of a long time, an even better one. It's infuriating to me to find out only now Bruhl was nominated for practically every single award except the oscar. My only consolation is this is considered an industry travesty. Looking up the 2014 oscar year, it was inundated by 'Dallas buyers club', so no surprise there this film would be snubbed. It wasn't political enough. I'm also not saying Hemsworth deserved the oscar over mccaunghey, but Br\u00fchl definitely deserved it over Leto. C'est la vie. I'm just glad to have found this film and will be watching it again over the years."

Meanwhile Daniel Br\u00fchl quietly stamps his authority over the drama with a disciplined take on Lauda's acerbic, neurotic Austrian. The script trowels on the stereotypes a tad thick at times, but both leads deliver, pulling off the not inconsiderable feat of making the audience root for both sides in during their battles.\n\nMeanwhile Howard, and his DOP, the brilliant Anthony Dod Mantle, find all manner of extraordinary places to stick their cameras, wedging us into the cockpit in ways that give each race a distinct personality, as well as a tremendous vitality and urgency, and then matching this with a glorious, cacophonous sound design that places one deep inside the action.\n\nIt ain't subtle. True or not, Hunt's team of amateur Hooray-Henrys appear to have been culled from the Four Weddings understudies list, and the leads' almost comically contrary character traits are perhaps spelled out rather too frequently. But nonetheless, this tale grips like a Brabham, convincingly delivering the thrills and excitement of an era when Formula One was a perilous and free-spirited enterprise."

Rush begins with their humble beginnings in Formula 3 and their instant distaste for each other, and continues with their rise to Formula 1 and Niki Lauda's infamous crash that almost claimed his life. After the accident, their rivalry evolves from being fueled by hatred to one of mutual respect\n\nRush gets off to a rocky start, but once it gets its footing it envelops you in an atmosphere that is gloriously 70's. The cars, the hair, and vibrate colors is pure time machine. Rush is a born entertainer, a natural extrovert, the people are beautiful, the cars are flash, the sun is bright, the locations are breathtaking and the action is remarkable. You are constantly bombarded with high quality sensations. It's a dazzling experience.\n\nRush is fun in a superficial sort of way, but the script only sporadically delves below surface of its source material. It comes down to the script not spending enough time on Hunt and Lauda's rivalry and hanging around too long on some of it's side plots. Also, there is no reason this movie needed to be \"R\" rated; The sex scenes and cursing could have easily been toned down or cut all together and taken nothing away from the core of Rush's appeal. In fact it would have streamlined the script and made Rush appeal to a wider audience.\n\nDon't worry, you probably won't notice my complaints, and if you do you won't care a damn. Rush is entertaining, gloriously action packed, beautiful to look at and is exceptionally well executed. Ron Howard's directing, particularly during the racing scenes is stellar and Hans Zimmer's scoring is hair-raisingly awesome. Rush is refreshingly slick, suave and adrenaline-infused. I say you'll be beguiled by it like I have, but the feeling won't resonate."

That film brilliantly presented the thrill and drama of F1 in all its glory, excitement and tragedy. Grand Prix's story line is generally considered rather weak but that is a very small concession for it incredible racing sequences. John Frankenheimer was an extraordinary director who visually captured the excitement of open cockpit racing in what was truly its golden era. Ron Howard on the other hand uses a combination of slapdash racing sequences and optical effects which fail, in my estimation, to truly convey the stunning excitement of this incredible sport."

        "review_title": "The Apollonian-Dionysian balance",
        "review_detailed_main": "Friederich Nietzsche identified enduring dichotomies within and amongst us that make our world tick. These two attitudes, both named after Greek Gods, have clashing features. Apollo, son of Zeus, stands for order, logic and reason while Dionysius, the God of Wine, represents chaos, madness and drunkenness. Nietzsche thinks we need both. It emerges from nature itself and can be applied in our day-to-day activities, from art, psychology, ethics to politics.\n\nApollonian way of doing things can be visualised how a scientist functions with his obsession with precision, discipline and punctuality. The Dionysian effect can be seen in music and art form, which may appear chaotic and not following the rules but nevertheless is music as it is, pleasant to the ears and emotive.\n\nNietzche saw the fusion of frenzied energy of the Dionysian to be applied constructively inside an Apollonian framework as ideal.\n\nThis biopic depiction of the professional rivalry between two F1 racing legends, Niki Lauda and James Hunt brings us to a time when F1 racing meant booze, girls and drug. Even though the movie depicts them as mortal enemies, in real life, they were close friends and had kept in touch for a long time.\n\nJames Hunt is the impulsive hard-drinking, the hard-partying late-night bad boy of F1. Lauda, on the other hand, is a fastidious, calculative and disciplined racer who prepares his every move meticulously and goes to bed early.\n\nA memorable quote in the film goes like this. 'Drivers are revered not because of what they do, driving around in circles but because of their brush with death. The closer they are with death, the more people find them fascinating.' I suppose the same applies to other professions that deal with or hold people's life at the clutch of their hands. This would include people in the medical fraternity or in the mafia business.\n\nThis opposing features in the drivers form a compelling narrative for a cliffhanging adrenaline-fueled, rubber-burning suspense at the F1 track set in the early to mid-70s. The excellent direction by Ron Howard makes the experience more enjoyable.\n\nLife would be boring if everyone conforms to a universal set of rules and practises fair play all the way. The Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy remains a useful way to view art, psychology, society and every other aspect of life."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's my firm belief that if you have to start a movie in medias res and go back to the beginning, then your original beginning isn't strong enough. This holds true in Ron Howard's latest film about F1 racing legends, the Maverick Brit James Hunt and his prickly Austrian rival Niki Lauda, where the movie opens at a critical moment only to immediately go back in time to recap. Ron Howard knows how to create drama, pace and suspense perfectly but there seemed to lack a cohesive narrative thread that would have made Rush outstanding.\n\nWhat I liked: The movie is as slick as a race car and the racing scenes are wonderfully executed, especially when there is poor weather conditions. The movie is certainly entertaining. The characters and relationships however are underdeveloped and, frankly, a little wasted; except for Daniel Bruehl who plays Niki Lauda and adds all the heart and soul to this film. He is brilliant and seemingly reaches beyond the written character, if I am to compare him to Chris Hemsworth's less dynamic portrayal. Somehow, while Hemsworth is convincing his character, ironically, lacks the charm to carry the emotion of each short scene, whereas Bruehl's Lauda grows on us and stays with us. The best moments of the film come late when we come to respect the rivalry as they do. I enjoyed that there is no definitive hero and both characters make for a series of well captured scenes but\u0085\n\nWhat I didn't like: The film unfolds like a feast of tasty appetizers that never settles into a meal. The story is interesting and there are well-executed moments of real connection and emotion but they never last long enough or fit properly to create a fluid whole. The camera-work by Anthony Dod Mantle was electric and worked very well in some seems but, again, seemed to piece together different moods or ideas that contributed my overall sense of disharmony.\n\nMy rating: Wishing for an Oscar nod for Daniel Br\u00fchl.\n\nhttp://canyoutellastory.wordpress.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had never heard of the actual rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt prior to having watched this movie. However, I now feel compelled to start watching Formula 1 racing or at least do some Wikipedia research. The cinematography and filming of the racing scenes was done in a very vibrant manner. The pistons firing, gears turning, and constantly changing camera angles made the scenes very captivating. Chris Hemsworth did a solid job as Hunt, but I think that Bruhl stole the show in his role as Lauda. The mannerisms and speaking style with the overbite made him the more enthralling character over Chris's Hunt. Olivia Wilde plays a minor role with a very convincing British accent in her limited screen time. This is an excellent movie for both racing fans, and non-racing fans alike."

        "review_detailed_main": "For whatever reason, the sport of Formula One is one that hasn't been served incredibly well in the movies. Aside from Asif Kapadia's 'Senna', there haven't really been any shining standouts. Thankfully, 'Rush' the latest movie from Ron Howard (reteaming with his 'Frost/Nixon' screenwriter Peter Morgan) is excellent, managing to make someone with no knowledge of the sport (i.e. this writer) compelled during the race sequences and throughout the entire championship.\n\nThe movie centres on the rivalry between two F1 racers during the 1970s \u2013 the British playboy James Hunt and the disciplined Austrian Niki Lauda, played by Chris Hemswoth and Daniel Br\u00fchl respectively \u2013 and particularly during the 1976 Championship. This chalk-and-cheese relationship is at the very heart of 'Rush', with the differences between the two painted broadly, but effective nonetheless. Hunt is a racing pop star \u2013 with a legion of screaming fans and tendency to the go to a party after race. Lauda, on the other hand, is socially-inept and rigidly determined to win the championship, consequently being unafraid to speak his mind as he calls an extremely expensive Ferrari made for him, \"a s***box\". Hemsworth plays Hunt in a way similar to how he played Thor but still gives a good performance, while Br\u00fchl once again proves him to be a great actor, delivering a terrific and always engaging performance as Lauda. It wouldn't be a great surprise if he picks up some major acting nominations.\n\nThe race scenes in 'Rush' are a sight to behold \u2013 Howard uses every trick going to make them exciting and he succeeds. With the shadow of death looming over each race, they are simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying, particularly N\u00fcburgring in Germany, as Lauda and Hunt dart furiously around an incredibly dangerous track in extremely stormy weather conditions. Aiding these sequences, are Anthony Dod Mantle's excellent cinematography, some roaring sound design and Hans Zimmer's score, which sounds unlike much of his recent work, wonderfully sounding like The Edge from U2 at times and at others like Ramin Djawadi's score for 'Game of Thrones'.\n\n'Rush' is easily one of the best movies Ron Howard has directed in recent years, (it's a vast improvement on 'The Dilemma', that's for sure) and possibly one of his best films in general. You could level numerous complaints at the film, that many of the characters are thinly- drawn or that the script isn't up to the standard of 'Frost/Nixon', but when said movie is emotionally engaging with heart-pounding races, such flaws don't even register. It may not break the mould, but 'Rush' is funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving."

The film about genuine sportsmen who are doing own job like sheer professionals. A lot of dialogs on change languages and one of film-star is spoken with a German's accent. It's absolutely amazing. Film is watching on an one breathe, never look aside. An action is doing for all time. I persistently recommend it for all people who are loving sport- films. You will be pleased. Maybe, it an one of the best film about it. I will watch it again and not once. Actor who is played Niki Lauda is awesome."

        "review_title": "Superb Performances...Great Authenticity",
        "review_detailed_main": "I am an F1 fanatic - I not only follow the current events, but also the background stories and history of the sport. Therefore I am fully aware of the dynamics of the sport throughout the decades, and the details of the Lauda and Hunt careers.\n\nAs such this film was a must-see for me, in the hope that it gives justice to F1 as a film topic, and also to see how this fantastic story is told.\n\nThe performances of Hemsworth and Bruhl are superb...without doubt the best thing about this film...both performances are Oscar-worthy. I had already heard acclaim for Bruhl as Lauda (and he was great), but for me Hemsworth as Hunt was surprising - he really nailed the accent and mannerisms.\n\nThe second success of the film is its authenticity. Clearly a lot of effort has been made to get the details of the era - the cars, the sponsors, the fashion, the F1 facts, the characters. Without this authenticity, real F1 fans would hate this film, but I believe they will be satisfied.\n\nThe look and sound of the F1 action is pretty good. Some of the CGI is not the best, particularly when used to make a car spin more dramatic that it perhaps was, but overall it does not ruin the film.\n\nThe film is more about the characters of Lauda and Hunt, than the sporting action, and that's fine. If you want to see more about the racing events and actual footage, watch the season reviews. This film does not provide a detailed insight into what happens throughout the seasons, nor events beyond the main characters.\n\nThere are some weaker aspects to the film: 1. The film feels fairly clunky, almost like a series of movie trailers stitched together...it does not flow from chapter to chapter. I think this is because the makers are trying to cover all points in 2 hours - character background, on-track action, news events, etc. Perhaps it would work better as a TV mini-series (episode 1: pre-F1 careers, episode 2: pre-1976 F1, episode 3: 1976 up to German GP, episode 4: 1976 and career climax). 2. The commentators are simply annoying. There is a continuous commentator narration around the race events, and also a poorly cast Stirling Moss character pops up at each race. These are supposed to provide an update on what is going on in the season, but it could have been done better - at least with variety. 3. There is a little poetic license. Non-F1 fans or even casual F1 fans probably will not notice, but if you know the details of the era, how F1 operates, and Lauda/Hunt as drivers, you will spot them. Obviously these are there to add to the drama, and in general they can be accepted.\n\nDocumentaries aside, I believe this is the best motorport movie so far. Sure it is not full of action, but it's a drama...a character study. When the action does intervene, it is heart (and ear) pounding.\n\nF1 and motorsport films have been a challenging topic, and there are not many about, so I hope this will encourage more, because there are some equally fantastic stories to be told."

Oh Yea, its an Intense Tale of Superstar Rivalry but the Movie is Never Intense. It just sort of Stays Parked. When it does Creep Off the Starting Line it Rolls Along at about the Speed of a Sunday Drive.\n\nBoring, Restrained, Common, and Formula Film of a Motor Sport that Most People have Very Little Knowledge and After Watching this will Know just about the Same. It is Hardly Informative, Barely Entertaining, and is a Mega-Budgeted Movie from an Award Winning Director that is Extremely Overrated.\n\nNever Once does the Rivalry Seem Powerful and On the Edge.

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush (2013) Director: Ron Howard\n\nThis movie narrates the true accounts of the sporting rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt, F1 racing champions in the mid 1970's.\n\nDirector Ron Howard returns to his brilliant version as a story-teller after crowd-pleasers like the two Robert Langdon movies and the middling movie 'The Dilemma'. His last real good movie was Frost/Nixon about 5 years prior to this one.\n\nThis movie narrates the stories of two F1 legends who are not very popular to the post 1980's ilk. I actually read about Niki Lauda a few years ago in a story of guts and perseverance \u2013 Niki suffered severe burns when his car crashed in a F1 race in Germany with part of his face burnt off and his lungs damaged with internal burns. However 6 weeks after that incident, he returns to the race track in Italy and comes in 4th place. Just an amazing story. Didn't realize then that I was going to see it in a movie.\n\nHoward does a good job setting up the back story of characters \u2013 Hemsworth (Thor) as Hunt and Bruhl as Lauda \u2013 about their appetite for racing, cars and success. Their initial disdain for each other sets each on the path for achieving racing glory. While Hunt partied, Lauda engineered. The movie explores the dynamics and business of racing, the life of racers, the engineering marvel and the frenzy of the sport.\n\nZimmer's music is outstanding, and the camera work & sound editing is simply brilliant. The race sequences are a stand-out and keep you on the edge of your seat. If you don't know your F1 history then it's even more nerve wracking.\n\nIn my opinion, the movie focused on Hunt \u2013 how he was wronged and how he wronged. But my attention and respect was saved for Niki Lauda who was able to manage his fame and stature in real life. He is truly a living icon.\n\nBoth Hemsworth and Bruhl give memorable performances and they live their characters on screen plus a fine return to form for our good old Richie Cunningham. :)\n\nThis is one of the best movies released in 2013. Watch it if you haven't."

Like the similarly adrenaline-drenched \"Warrior\" before it, Rush does an excellent job of evenly pursuing its dual leads, examining both to such lengths that we have ample reason to pull for each in their climactic showdown. Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival. An excellent, impressive blend of moods that touches many nerves."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's much to admire in Ron Howard's biopic of the battle between Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), not least both actors' portrayals of the leads and Howard's, at times, brilliant action sequences.\n\nSad to say though there's a lot that simply doesn't work.\n\nAct 1 (the set up - early years) has moments of cringeworthy scripting and acting with little that engages (in fact I found myself wishing it was all over).\n\nAct 2 (the action sequences when 1976 is dramatically recreated, race by race) is mostly enthralling and really brings together all that is good about this movie (Bruhl, Hemsworth and Howard's direction).\n\nAct 3 (the denouement) is a missed opportunity. It's desperately rushed - despite its two hour length. I suspect an order from the studio to cut the timelength came into play with the consequence that it feels like an afterthought.\n\nWhat makes Rush worth seeing is the most important aspect of the movie, the bitter rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. Both actors uncannily capture the drivers' individual personalities but the script by The Queen writer Peter Morgan sometimes leaves them with nowhere to go, at others it dazzles, \"You're the only man that is better looking after skin grafts\" quips Hunt to Lauda in Act 3; and Lauda's repeated statement that a 20% risk of death in each race is all that's acceptable is used well and resonates.\n\nIt's the supporting actors that lets it down; an unconvincing Murray Walker, an unlikeable Lord Hesketh, Hunt's wife - all fail to convince. Only Alexandra Maria Lara, as Lauda's wife, strikes a real chord.\n\nAt $38million this is a big budget movie for the UK. Its ambitions are clear to see. Just a shame the whole doesn't amount to more than the sum of its variable parts.\n\nWant to see a great motor racing movie?\n\n(There's very few of merit and despite my reservations this one's definitely among the elite.)\n\nWatch Senna."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you think Ron Howard, you think Richie, obviously; and then you think blockbusters. He's made a quite a few of them. Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, Cocoon; and those are just the films that I like. Pretty much all of his films are commercial and/or critical successes, and every new film is met with a lot of hype and fanfare. We can now add Rush to that list of blockbusters.\n\nFor those that don't know, Rush is the true story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Formula 1 drivers in the 1970s. The two men were at the top of their game, which led to a very personal and merciless rivalry both on and off the track.\n\nRush follows the same pattern that all of Ron Howard's films seem to, which, considering his track record, is probably a good thing. The main similarity is the very strong story, and Rush has a fantastic one. The rivalry between Lauda and Hunt was a vicious one, with incidents that arguably could only have been the stuff of fiction. The fact that it's all true is incredible, and you don't need to be a racing fan to appreciate it. Another similarity. Like with Apollo 13 and Frost/Nixon, Howard is able to take a subject with a niche interest and make it appeal to the masses.\n\nIn Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, we are also witness to two very good performances. If you've seen Inglorious Basterds, then you probably already know that Bruhl is a very good actor; and here, he's excellent as the cold, boring Lauda. The real star, though, is Hemsworth. After a filmography that includes superhero and horror movies, this might be seen his breakthrough as a serious actor. It was very impressive. The supporting cast were decent enough, but nobody else really stands out beyond the top two. What was nice to see is Green Wing alumni Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt make appearances. But, at the end of the day, you're watching the movie for the two leads, and they're very good.\n\nHere's the problem, though. As good as the story is, and as good as the actors and the performances are, Rush falls down where so many of his films have done. The script. They're not awful, don't get me wrong \u2013 his films wouldn't be successful if the scripts were horrendous. The problem with the scripts are that they're overly sentimental and, at times, very cheesy. It really gets a little hard to watch when the stuff being said is so full of exposition.\n\nHowever, if you're happy to forgive the filmmakers for that (and most audiences seem to), then you're still really going to enjoy this movie. Despite the subject matter, it manages to balance a good amount of humour and drama. Add in some excellent performances, and you've got a fun film to watch.\n\nThis will never go down as one of Ron Howard's best movies, and he won't win any awards for it probably, but it's a great effort. Give it a look."

I can't even drive, but the dialogue in this film is how race car drivers explain racing, from too fast in the corners, to rain on the track, to the grip on the tires. It's ironic that Lauda wanted to boycott the race he was hurt in. And I like how the film shows the way the right kind of adversity makes people better at what they do. The dark clouds covering the sun seem so literary I don't know how I feel about them in a film, but it was a good way to show the dread involved. I think the film could've been longer. I saw an interview with Ron Howard where he said it was hard to get it down to two hours, and I wish he'd made this three hours or so. It felt like a sample tray of these two men's lives. (Am I being too feminine here?) Although I wouldn't want anything weepy, a little go get'em, honey, would've warmed my little girl heart. (And can you tell I really couldn't stand the Englishman?) But as I'm writing this I know I'm wrong. It is a good film the way they have it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Daniel Bruhl's intelligent performance as Austrian race car driver Niki Lauda is about all there is to recommend in director Ron Howard's film about the rivalry between Lauda and English driver James Hunt (a preening Chris Hemsworth). Bruhl's focused, steel-eyed stare and effortlessly executed diction is filled with a sly sense of irony and sets apart what could have been a routine impersonation of a cold, clipped Germanic workhorse. After all these years, Howard still can't figure out how to deliver action without having to explain it to you and, as such, relies heavily on screenwriter Peter Morgan's heavy-handed exposition to tell you what you need to know. Morgan accomplishes this by having sportscasters yell into microphones about how the action taking place is so exciting; the result is condescending. Other than Bruhl, there isn't much else to recommend, with a couple of Howard's collaborators worth noting, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and composer Hans Zimmer, turning in lesser work than they are capable of. Being a racing movie, it's edited within an inch of its life by longtime Howard colleagues Dan Hanley and Mike Hill; but their work is at least clean enough that you can reasonably follow along. Which is all Howard requires from you."

But with Rush, it was difficult to find that something. It was just terrifically made. And I'm not being a biased gearhead either. Granted, I did not know too much about these two drivers until the movie came out. And maybe there were other highlights from the 1976 seasons that were not included, but that was not the point of the movie.\n\nFirst and foremost, a big shout out to the make-up crew and whoever else deals with the appearance of the actors because what they have done is marvelous. I looked into the way the real Hunt, Lauda, and others looked and there was not much of a difference. I have not seen a documentary type film be so accurate in that respect maybe ever. And the actors. Man, they really knew their characters well. Job very well done.\n\nWhat Ron Howard has done here is expose what really goes on in a driver's mind on and off the track and how he interacts with his competitors. For the duration of the film, the viewer is immersed in the world of Formula 1 and all the drama associated with it.\n\nIt is impossible to not have your heart beat at an elevated rate and impossible to not develop a connection with the people and the time because everything in the film was very 1970s (at least, what I know of the 1970s), including the clothing and all the technology.\n\nAll in all, Rush is probably the best motorsport movie I have ever watched and definitely one of the best overall. I was truly touched by the story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda and learned a lot in the process about the history of Formula 1. It is extremely genuine and not one to be missed at all!

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard has a thing for movies based on true stories (see Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon and A Beautiful Mind), but none has been quite as high- octane as Rush, which has a very different feel from his previous work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. After all, Howard is arguably one of the most consistent directors working today as far as quality goes, and Rush is a high-quality film. However, it feels like it's lost somewhere between a drama and an action movie. There are a lot of scenes representing both genres, but the two somehow seem out of sync. Something holds Rush back from being a truly great film.\n\nBeing that it's Ron Howard in the director's chair, I had high expectations for the movie, especially because it stars Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, who is quickly becoming a household name and is deserving of a role in which he can flex his acting muscles rather than his biceps. For the most part, he does a convincing job as Formula 1 driver James Hunt. This is probably because he has Daniel Br\u00fchl to work with as his arch rival, Niki Lauda, who shares tremendous chemistry with Hemsworth. And yet, the two are comically different from each other. Hunt is the playboy, partying it up and living each day to the fullest, while Lauda is cold and calculating, as finely tuned as the machines he drives. Really, it would have been next to impossible for these two not to be rivals, and indeed that's the focus of Rush.\n\nThe film takes a firm look at what it takes to be a champion and, more importantly, the cost that such a drive can have on a man. The best example is the brutal car crash Lauda experiences mid-season, from which he miraculously recovered in order to return and finish the last of the races that year. While Niki's cost was more physical, James has quite an emotionally driven journey as well, as he literally destroys his life in pursuit of that championship title. Really, it's as though the two drivers represent different aspects of one person, and the movie represents the personal tragedy from which all great tales are built.\n\nVisually speaking, this is Ron Howard's most unique film to date. It's a lot more visceral than his previous films, with sex scenes and even a few stomach-churning wrecks (Niki Lauda suffers horrifying injuries as a result of his crash). It's also a lot bolder than his previous works. Howard adopts a style meant to mirror the high-adrenaline lifestyle that these two men enjoy, with plenty of slow motion and tight editing. With all this, though, I have to ask: \"Why does it feel so slow at certain parts?\" I'm not normally the type of guy who shrugs off a movie's story, but I couldn't help feeling impatient waiting for the dialogue to end and the racing to begin. This is one reason I don't feel like Rush was a truly great film.\n\nI'm not saying that it's a bad film, though; quite the contrary, Rush is a very good movie, and probably one of the best racing movies ever made. It pretty much gives the audience everything they expect, and in some cases even more (props to Hemsworth for being so much more that a pretty face). I'm almost positive that it will pop up for some sort of award during the Oscars. For me, though, the film never really shifts into high gear. It doesn't cross that line into greatness, and I'm pretty sure I wont remember much about it when 2014 rolls around. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth seeing, though, and I would actually highly recommend it. After all, it's a very human tale, and it's one about which I can imagine everyone finding something to enjoy. It's just not something that echos with the viewer after the end credits."

You never get bored watching and just when you're about to get bored, it switches brilliantly. The story is, for me, one of the strongest points and one of the best sports film stories ever.\n\nBut that's just the plot and the balance and pacing; the achievement in cinematography is just stunning. Engines being fired, ultra zoomed cameras attached to the car's gear where you see every little thing moving, rain falling in slow-motion... everything is so, so beautiful.\n\nBut that's just graphically: the sound is so deep, so real, it reels you in and echoes afterwards. In combination with the music, just brilliant.\n\nBut that's just the cinematography: the actors deliver an astonishing performance; you hate them both, but you wish them both the best, they should both win. Hemsworth is truly arrogant and believable, Br\u00fchl is truly driven and professional. The chemistry, although I hate that word, is just spot on."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush is such a pleasant surprise!\n\nI have never much cared about Ron Howard's intent and style as film director, yet admire his ability to zero into what sells now - whenever now is - in Movieland. His populist touch once made me thoroughly dislike A Beautiful Mind (2001), a film that has everything in it for me to love and was deluged with awards. Cryptography, mental illness and Russell Crowe as John Nash seemed a perfect match, but a tendency to ease the audience's experience by spelling out the future drove me away. That tendency still exists. In less subtle territories such as Apollo 13 (1995), Ron Howard really does himself justice. And in Rush where sports history serves as guide, kudos to him for straying from philosophical considerations and going for pulsating material, hand-held camera first.\n\nFormula 1, a compelling rivalry, 70's glamour and serious speed with Thor/Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl at the wheels cannot fail. In principle, that's what Rush is. However, in the hands of Peter Morgan who wrote The Queen and the adapted screenplay for The Last King of Scotland, something incredible happens: the perfect Saturday date night movie scripted as if the author personally knew James Hunt and Niki Lauda when they put everything on the line in 1976.\n\nRush is the closest most of us will ever come to driving a Formula 1 race-car. It excels at giving the audience a genuine sense of the speed such finely engineered machines generate and the relative lack of protection they offer. The polarity of James Hunt's gregarious rock 'n' roll persona played by a charismatic Chris Hemsworth with Br\u00fchl's technically brilliant but emotionally remote Niki Lauda, eventually feels more like a duality. Both these extreme athletes from before the X Games era may have had more in common than they probably ever acknowledged.\n\nIn 2013, they are revisited by two actors who for disappearing into their respective roles could find themselves sharing centre stage with Ron Howard and Peter Morgan in March 2014. I would not be surprised for Julian Day's costume design to receive an Academy Award nomination too. Frida Giannini's period-evoking looks for Chris Hemsworth and Olivia Wilde (Suzy Miller) are so in tune to the glamour of the times they represent, they are desirable now. Rush is a beautiful movie to watch and Gucci can expect a stampede for several bespoke items. I wish product placement was always this subtle!\n\nLike the absorbing Senna (2010) by Asif Kapadia, Rush does not require in-depth Formula 1 knowledge. One is a meticulously crafted audiovisual memoir in documentary form and the other is a cool action flick for a cosy night spent in good company. The journey starts with Rush."

That being said, we honestly didn't expect to really enjoy the movie - to us, it was just a free movie. Let me tell you though, we all came out of the theater and just said, \"wow\".\n\nThe movie has racing scenes, yes, but the movie is not a racing movie. Racing fans will appreciate the mild technicality of the F1 scenes, but EVERYONE will love the meaningful message and themes that Ron Howard successfully portrays through these two characters.\n\nI wasn't fully familiar with the Hunt-Lauda rivalry prior to the movie, but even if I was, I really think this movie is a fresh new look at these two important F1 figures and their interaction with each other. The casting was just spot on and you can just see a glimpse of that if you ever watch live interviews of the characters after seeing the movie (which I did, admittedly).\n\nSo, I saw it again. I got to really focus on the background scenes and the beautiful cinematography the second time around. It's really just a well crafted movie, and you need to go see it. Don't let the F1-ness of the movie turn you off. I almost let it, but I'm glad I went. Bravo to Howard, Hemsworth, Bruhl and the rest of the cast!"

And makeup.\n\nAll of the above really give energy to the races and put the viewer inside the race. Great job. I loved the rough cinematography and editing - it gave the movie a documentary-like feel.\n\nDaniel Bruhl is excellent in his role and gives one of the better performances I've seen this year. I just noticed that he's nominated for a Golden Globe - he deserves that. Wait, he's nominated in \"supporting role\"? wtf?\n\nChris Hemsworth is basically playing himself, but he's a good casting choice and fits the role very well.\n\nDon't get me wrong: A #149 place on IMDb is ridiculous and 2013 was a very weak year at the cinema, but this movie gets my vote on the list of the \"Best Movies of 2013\".\n\nI'm surprised to see that it did so poorly at the cinema: $90m worldwide on a $38m budget. I was certain it made much more.\n\n7/10 Highly recommended"

Howard clearly has a passion for sports competition and wants to make a film comparable to the best sports films. In that, he succeeds. Beyond that, it's little more than typical sports propaganda, complete with product placement as if the film itself sold out ad space.\n\nIt's clearly designed to promote racing and persuade some to become fans and racers, trying to make it seem like a sexy outlet for rule breakers and full of something other than physically talented morons sniffing too many fuel fumes. The screenwriter and Howard do that by giving the characters more depth and faults than usual.\n\nAmongst other failures, the Formula 1 scoring system is never explained, so it feels as if there's some sort of back-room manipulation going on like in \"pro\" wrestling. That and the leader board mishaps might make for a more interesting story.\n\nTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is still the racing, and maybe all sports, film of choice."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am old enough to remember the real duel between Lauda and Hunt, and am delighted that someone has finally spotted what a great story it was. I loved the film because it took me back to being an impressionable sixteen-year-old who, in common with most of my friends had fallen completely for James Hunt's charm and offbeat good looks. We hadn't been Formula 1 fans - or fans of blokes with posh accents, being northerners - but we definitely were now! I remember following the whole season on the radio, deciphering Murray Walker's near-hysterical commentary to find out what was going on.\n\nNeedless to say, I loved the film and I thought the two main characters were unbelievably good, especially Chris Hemsworth, who pulled off the depiction of something close to a national icon incredibly well, getting Hunt's public-school drawl and round-shouldered walk perfectly, as well as his dangerous mixture of immaturity and charisma. I also thought that Daniel Bruhl made an unlikeable character, - frowning, earnest, pedantic and generally irritating - much more accessible than he could have been.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1970s was captured perfectly - leather miniskirts, dubious haircuts, rampant sexism, and incredible freedom and glamour for those who could afford it. I also liked the way the grime and scruffiness of Formula 1 came across, as well as its hazardous and uncertain nature: it's hard to believe that nowadays the Nurburgring simply isn't used any more because it's too dangerous.\n\nMy only caveat was that some of the other characters in the sport, like Enzo Ferrari, and some of the other drivers like Fittipaldi and Scheckter could have been used to greater effect, but maybe that would have detracted from the leads, who were just electrifying.\n\nI hope Ron Howard can collect some kind of award for this film because he certainly deserves it. As to the warts-and-all depiction of Hunt, I hope the film stirs memories of a great sportsman, so British he was almost a clich\u00e9, but who in addition to being insanely brave also had humour and intelligence way beyond the capacity of many of the much lesser characters in the media nowadays. His family should be really proud."

        "review_detailed_main": "Making films about real life characters always presents a challenge; more so if one of them doesn't live to see the day his tale is made into a film. Coming from director Ron Howard, known for films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Rush' is about two great personalities in the high adrenalin Formula 1 racing.\n\nThe story begins on the start line where Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) narrates the story of how James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) influenced his life and the days of Formula 1 in the 1970's where it was not uncommon for drivers to die in accidents.\n\nJames Hunt, who in real life was known as a playboy is appropriately portrayed on screen. There's a scene from his early days where he walks into at a hospital to get his injuries treated and lo behold, he seduces the nurse in James Bond style! Then, we are introduced to his career in Formula 3 where he drives for Lord Hesketh's team.\n\nAlthough the film marks the meeting of Lauda and Hunt in the F3 race on a sour note, it is believed that the duo were actually friends and shared an apartment during their early days. Was this an error? Or was it deliberately avoided to bring about dramatic tension between its lead stars right from the start? We wouldn't know.\n\nThe character of Niki Lauda starkly contrasts with Hunt as he is cool, calculating, working with the team on developing the car and isn't bothered about partying or popularity. In real life too, it is believed that Lauda never let the achievements get into his head and he gave away his trophies to a local garage in exchange for car wash.\n\nDiscussing the story itself isn't necessary for the review as most of the critical elements of the plot are based on actual, well known events. Its most poignant moment is how Lauda returns to track merely six weeks after a near-fatal crash with bandages on his wounds and leads the championship till he pulls out of the season's last race at Fuji when the treacherous weather conditions made the race too dangerous.\n\n'Rush' does a wonderful job in recreating the F1 races, the imagery of powerful engines, tires ready to zoom as pedal hits metal, and the infamous N\u00fcrburgring crash of 1976. In fact, Niki Lauda in his interviews has praised the filmmakers for portraying the crash and his treatments in a realistic manner and that the scenes 'shocked' him.\n\nReportedly, the actors weren't allowed to drive real Formula 1 cars. So, the film makers are said to have used F3 cars with the bodywork of F1 cars of that era to make them look like the real deal. Still, they drove some mean machines. Wow!\n\nThe actors have done a good job and look like their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth still seems like Thor with the long hair, but less bulky. Daniel Br\u00fchl, an acclaimed German actor embodies the role of Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller, Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Knaus and Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni have done a neat job and there's not a moment where it feels inauthentic.\n\nWhat works for the movie, other than the stunningly recreated visuals is the emphasis on its characters. At its soul is the portrayal of how Hunt and Lauda influenced each other's lives and careers. Although the two champions were very different by their outwardly lives, they shared a common passion for racing and winning and looking at each other to seek the much needed challenge and why you need enemies!\n\nVerdict: if you are one of those who like Bollywood family dramas branded as racing films, like Ta Ra Rum Pum, let me assure you that 'Rush' isn't for you. But, if you are a Formula 1 fan, don't even think twice; just go for it."

The races did not drag on, something I thought could ruin the film but it was better than I thought. The one thing I loved more than anything is that there was no mistakes. The directing from Ron Howard was flawless, the score by Hans Zimmer was without surprise breath-taking and among his best work in my eyes. The film ends when you want it to, not too early or too late. I was not alive when the actual events took place but I have been told that the plot follows the events accurately. This film was pretty much perfection to me, there's nothing I can criticize about the film and I would be very surprised if this doesn't pick up a few awards."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: This movie was made extremely well by Ron Howard and the actors done a great job portraying the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. The only problem that I found with the movie was that none of there personal stories were seen through. Hunt seemed to jump from one girl to the other and Lauda seemed to keep his personal life secret so there true personalities came out when they were racing. The scenes on the track were very realistic and they brought some intensity to the movie. I also liked the fact that you actually see the real drivers at the end of the movie. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch if your a racing fan or if your into your intense dramas. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: Chris Hemsworth played Hunt really well and he suited the cocky character very well. After all his fame from being Thor and the Huntsman, you can actually see him being like that in real life. Daniel Bruhl brought intensity to his role which made the rivalry realistic and great to watch. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the fact that I'm not really into racing so I didn't know that much about the characters. Of course, I have heard about them before, but I never knew anything about there careers. This is were Ron Howard done well by entertaining fans of racing and people who are not into that particular sport.\n\nBudget: $38million Worldwide Gross: $90million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there racing movies about the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. 7/10"

I don't see Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, i even don't see him as a good actor. The same with Olivia Wilde, who appears this days in every single movie they make. The only good performance was by Daniel Bruhl. There was no feeling to the story, i didn't see the world from the 70's, there was no f1 feeling, no petrol head passion, just a pale excuse of a movie. Also as far as i know the movie is not following the exact historical events from the life of this drivers, i mean in 1970 Formula 3 season. They didn't even take part in the 1970 Formula 3 Championship. Sorry but that's the way i see this work"

The soundtrack was excellent, I watched the credits to see who did it, and of course it was a main player. Highly recommend it for a fun afternoon movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have no interest in motor racing (or the history of the sport), however, I will confess to actually enjoying this film. Yes, it has enough of a budget to include some (pretty realistic) re-enactments of motor racing from the seventies (when it's set), but don't think that that's all there is here.\n\nIt's based on the real life rivalry between two formula one drivers in the seventies. Now, normally when you have a film like this, one of the drivers is the 'goodie' and one is the 'baddie.' However, here, both have their pros and cons and sometimes you'll find yourself rooting for Thor (joke) and sometimes for the other one (not Thor).\n\nIt's basically a good drama with some entertaining driving scenes thrown in. If you can forgive Thor's (slightly dubious) 'British' accent, then you'll probably have a good time. I hear from what I've read on the internet that it's actually quite a historically accurate representation of what went on in the seventies, so bonus points for \u2013 apparently \u2013 getting it right.\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Rush is a magnificent movie that will grip the audience even if they have no interest in racing.\n\nNicki Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, gave up the chance to manage his family's business back in Austria in order to become a racer. In a Formula Three race in 1970, he meets the flamboyant Brit James Hunt, who is played by Chris Hemsworth. The two develop a rivalry and eventually cross paths in the Formula One. The movie takes place during the 1976 Formula One season, where Lauda and Hunt try to not only win the World Championship, but prove who the better racer is. Along the way, we see that both men are polar opposites of each other. Lauda is a more calculating, vigilant racer who only races because it's the thing he does best. Racing is almost like solving an equation for him. For Hunt however, racing is his passion. He wants to \"stare death in the face, and to cheat it\".\n\nOne thing I loved about Rush was that it didn't have a good guy for us to cheer, and a bad guy for us to boo. Both of these men have flaws but in the end, they're human and it really felt like it in the movie. You'll find yourself cheering for Hunt at times and for Lauda at other times.\n\nBefore the movie was released I saw pictures of the cast and their real life counterparts. I thought that the casting was perfect. They looked almost identical. But I didn't know that the acting would be so good. This movie wouldn't have been nearly as good if the acting was sub-par. We needed to believe that we were seeing James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and that's what we got. If the movie wasn't released in such a stacked year, I think both of them would've got an Oscar nomination.\n\nBut you need more than good actors and a good premise to make a good movie, you also need a good director who is capable of bringing everything together, and this movie has just that. On his day, Ron Howard is one of the best directors working right now, and he shows why with Rush. The movie looks beautiful. The racing scenes where masterfully captured and along with the great work of Hans Zimmer, you felt like you were right in the middle of the action.\n\nAll in all, Rush is an outstanding movie. Anyone who appreciates wonderful cinematography and acting, or even just wants to see a good sports movie, should check this one out."

Here the subject is racing rivalry, not something that would normally having me rushing to the big screen, but that's exactly where 'Rush' should be seen.\n\nThe topic here is the rivalry between posh boy and self stylised playboy James Hunt, and the more stoic and conservative Nikki Louder. Their competitive nature on the track was something even I vaguely remember, my mother being a James Hunt fan. He was probably a lot of Mums favourites at the time.\n\nWhy the film works are largely down to two factors, a really well written script which captures the two contrasting characters brilliantly and makes them jump off the page. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Hunt, despite occasionally missing the mark on the accent and no doubt the late Hunt himself would have been very happy with the casting, but its the German actor Daniel Bruhl who carries off the colours here with his portrayal as the determined no nonsense Nikki Lauda with a really perfectly pitched performance.\n\nYou never entirely sure who too root for here, which could have been the film's failing, but its not, as Howard manages to convey sympathy for both his characters in equal measure for your capacity to dislike them. The approach of the characters towards life varies as much as it does to their attitude on the track, and this is the engine of this film. The icing on the cake is the racing sequences. Well realised and seamless from any special effects that may have contributed, by the end of the film you will be griped.\n\nIt's an interesting, well acted film on a subject that I don't especially care for normally, but this film made me care enough to watch it and I am very glad I did. See while you still can on the big screen."

The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.\n\nThe film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Br\u00fchl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda. This is an action film with doubt, but it is also a psychological dramatization of a true story that for once works very well on film."

When Niki Lauda told the BRM guys the car was too heavy, it gave me a chill. When I hung around BRM, they were struggling to develop a new motor. They came up with a contraption called an H-15. It was massive, and it was heavy. The N\u00fcrburgring is not just dangerous, it wrecks cars with its dips and rolls. A heavy car bottoms out and destroys its undercarriage, and sure enough...well, so much for BRM. The H-15 was before this story. Obviously, BRM never learned their lesson.\n\nOf course, there's the human element. I've often thought that bullfighters and race car drivers are the only successors to the gladiators. The personal and professional rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt reveals the mentality behind men who flirt with violent death. For one it's a means to an end, for the other it's the end in itself. And this is the hub of the story.\n\nRush is the real thing. It is simply the best racing movie ever made. It's a crime that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar."

        "review_detailed_main": "I flip flopped quite a lot on this film. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it looked like another cookie cutter Hollywood film, particularly because of Chris Hemsworth. Then I read up on the backstory about the great rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, which actually created some anticipation. I went into the theater expecting it to be a modern classic after reading the reviews, but within the first ten minutes I was aware of its flaws.\n\nA slightly insipid music score by go-to-guy Hans Zimmer, a seemingly unnecessary voice over that holds the viewer's hand throughout the opening, and a rather rushed beginning. The computer effects for the recreated stadiums and the car races were below par as well. I didn't even get a good 1970s vibe from the atmosphere of the piece. The period seemed glossed over with some by the numbers pop songs to demonstrate different ups and downs in the character's lives. James Hunt is struggling with his celebrity status, so let's play \"Fame\" by David Bowie, seems like a good match! The whole experience appeared to be very vanilla, as is usual with Ron Howard.\n\nBut I hung in there, and by the second half of the film, it had improved dramatically. Daniel Bruhl's performance as Nikki Lauda was extraordinary. He captured perfectly the raw determination, the slightly misanthropic nature of the Austrian rival. He was a bastard, but relatable, and his emergence as the protagonist made me concentrate more on their relationship, which was really the crux on the film, than my petty remarks about the cinematography or score. Besides, the sound design was top notch. While I absolutely detest montages that were used to artificially speed up time after each competition, the races did improve so that by the end, the tension had reached exponential levels. The tragedy suffered by the characters gave insight into the nature of sport and what makes the daring feats and psyche of these men so alluring.\n\nThe performances of Chris Hemsworth and Bruhl, and their likeness to the respective people, were extraordinary. The exploration of their personal lives added verisimilitude to the story as well.\n\nRush is a good film, and while it isn't the best in the past 10 years like some are saying, nor is it Ron Howard's most accomplished work (that honour still belongs to 'Apollo 13' or even 'The Missing') it's certainly one of the better releases this year and a sure fire Oscar contender."

Of course liberties have been taken with the facts, but this is inevitable when the events of several years are compressed into a couple of hours. The recreation of racing in the seventies is generally well done but for those who lived through the 1976 season the movie lacks dramatic impact. Hemsworth and Bruhl do a good job as Hunt and Lauda, but the other roles are virtually bit parts. The portrayal of BRM's Louis Stanley (a notorious tyrant) is particularly poor. If you know nothing of seventies racing you may enjoy it, but if you are not a racing fan it probably has little to offer."

The women in the film have nothing to do but look miserable and/or have sex because they are SO turned on by men who are willing to die in cars. Really? The hospital scenes are purely gross. I did not even watch most of it. The car racing scenes are techno--meaning that they are quick cut aways and close ups of people's faces ==a lot of nothing. If you want a race movie go see Grand Prix. This is getting good reviews because Ron Howard directed it. Sad. The guy has lost whatever went into making Apollo 13 or Beautiful Mind or Splash etc."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"RUSH\" is the incredible true story of Formula 1 drivers Jim Hunt and Niki Lauda in the epic 1976 Grand Prix. The race is exciting on and off the tracks. Directed with precision and heart by Ron Howard, \"Rush\" runs on adrenaline at 220 miles an hour and the audience is instantly taken on an unforgettable ride. Chris Hemsworth plays the reckless charismatic English playboy Jim Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl gives a spot on performance of meticulous and serious Austrian racer Niki Lauda. The story would be unbelievable if it wasn't true. But Director Ron Howard has brought to life all the excitement of the 1976 Grand Prix complete with the personal stories of Hunt and Lauda. The film is gripping and a visual rush as Academy award cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle puts the viewer directly in the driver seat. Hans Zimmer's moves the story in a wonderful and pulsating soundtrack. The drama depicts rivals Hunt and Lauda and the incredible events that lead to the perilous Nurburgring race and finally the Japanese Grand Prix. As each driver accrues points in each race, they reach the dangerous rain drenched final head to head for the championship title. \"RUSH\" is an exhilarating film between two talented drivers beautifully performed by Hemsworth and Bruhl. The lives and personalities of these two drivers couldn't be more different and yet their respect and admiration for each other and passion for racing formula 1 is palpable. The film is excellent and accurate in its details of the true story and rivalry of Hunt and Lauda. \"RUSH\" drives and delivers!"

The acting by both Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl is one of strenghts of the film as they portray their characters perfectly, they transmitted what they wanted to show to us, I expect some awards for these two interpretations. The sound mixing and editing is great also, and I have to include the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer as one of the best things of the film. I never felt like the movie was 2 hours long. By the last minutes I thought my heart was going to explode, I was excited.\n\nThis is more than a movie about racing, it's sublime, one of the best films of the year so far."

Then I watched a recent Indy car race on TV and was swept away by the much better camera work and amazing wreck footage. It's sad to say that I can get better and higher quality camera work from my TV on a Sunday afternoon than I can by paying to see the latest Ron Howard movie.

I will be the first to let you know a good movie from the next and I am really surprised with all the high ratings for this movie, but I was very disappointed with this one. Yes, you get great shots from the drivers perspective, okay racing scenes, decent character development, but not your leave the theater in deep thought and feeling like I took something with me from the theater like mostly all Ron Howard films. I actually saved the ticked stub right after I purchased it as a kind of memento to say I saw this film in the theaters, maybe 20 years down the road, but I actually threw this stub away in major disappointment that I Just spent 11.50 for this movie. yes, the plot is there, and I understand its a true story between these 2 racers, but this should have made it even more excellent of a movie that Ron Howard takes on. I should have known when I saw three other companies that were part producers of this movie besides Imagine, that right there should of shown that Ron didn't have full say when it came down to certain decisions. Has Ron finally sold out for money, instead of great film. It seems that way, and I have lost a lot of respect from him from this film he just put out. I had a feeling since I haven't heard much about this movie from the word of mouth movie chatter that I normally pick up on, I thought maybe it was because everyone has broken bad and that is all there was to talk about, but I see now that I couldn't even be excited to start a conversation or be involved excitedly to discuss this movie with friends or family. I gave it 6 and that's pretty good just based on the okay visuals you get and how hard it is to shoot fast driving scenes. Say it ain't so Ron, is this what we should be expecting from here on out. What is with all the other partnering companies we saw with your Iconic IMAGINE company in the beginning of the film? Remember when we use to see just that one single IMAGINE logo before all of your other movies and there we knew we were in for a great one? Im not sure where these other band wagon companies came from but please just make sure your next movie is from IMAGINE alone or I can Imagine Ron Howard losing all his credibility for great movie making."

Yes, there are a few of those, but the film as a whole, portrays in a vivid manner all that made F1 racing so great in the '70s.\n\nSome of the unrealistic facts that caught my eye: - Hesketh, as a Team, did not pull out from F1 at the end of 1975. James Hunt simply left them for a better team. - The driver that was killed during Watkins Glen GP 1975, is Francois Cevert and was not decapitated. - Nurburgring 1976. Lauda did not lose his helmet and no driver was hurt in the qualifying session, before the race. There are a few more, but Ron Howard managed to knit those events so nicely in the story, that you could pretty much believe that things happened that way!\n\nAnother area that really impressed me, was the resemblance of the actors to the real people and the amount of work that went into Daniel Br\u00fchl's make up, in order to make his scars look the same like Lauda's did, after the accident. It is really amazing!\n\nIn conclusion, everyone can enjoy this film, no matter how much into F1 he/she is. But you have to remember one thing, this is not a documentary, it is a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard's \"Rush\" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.\n\nAs befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the \"bad boy,\" was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the \"good-boy,\" was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described \"rat face,\" barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.\n\nThe movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or overdramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.\n\nWhy then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about \"Rush\" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus."

The difference between this move and the previous 2 is that racing is really a backdrop to the clash of 2 very different personalities who came to respect each other.\n\nIn one professional interview with Niki Lauda the UKs Guardian I believe, it was suggested that Hunt was Lauda's foil - I agree but if it is possible from a screen writing perspective Lauda was also a foil for Hunt.\n\nIt has been said that the film highlights Lauda - I don't agree - it highlights the both with their contrasts.\n\nTo me - even more than Lauda's brilliant driving, I will always remember him for his courage after his accident (hardly a spoiler alert since this is common knowledge).\n\nIn Road & Track's interview with Ron Howard, Howard detailed the effort that he went to insure that this was an accurate portrayal - consulting people directly involved from Lauda himself to Ron Dennis and a dozen others.\n\nIt has, from what I understand, been well received in the F1 community.\n\nAbove all it is a fantastic film on 2 very different personalities and how they came to respect each other."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan are back in their wheelhouse with a film based on real people. Their previous collaboration was Frost/Nixon, and they also had separate \"true stories\": Howard with Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, and Morgan with The Queen and Last King of Scotland. Here they tackle personality opposites and fierce Formula One competitors James Hunt and Niki Lauda.\n\nThe two lead actors are perfectly cast. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) slips seamlessly into the swashbuckling, rebellious playboy that was Great Britain's James Hunt. Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds, Goodbye Lenin!) becomes the focused, determined, meticulous Spanish-German Niki Lauda. You might think of Hunt as an X-Games type who thrives on publicity and fun, while Lauda is more scientist or engineer driven by the quest for perfection. Both were World Champions and their rivalry brought out the best in each.\n\nDo not think for a second that you need be a Formula One expert or even know the backstory of Hunt and Lauda to enjoy this movie. It is extremely entertaining and exciting. Morgan's script might hover a bit more on the oh-so-photogenic Hunt/Hemsworth character, but it also does a nice job of preventing the not-so-likable Lauda from being a bad guy. In fact, it demonstrates that champions are not all alike.\n\nThe look of the film is exemplary. Beautifully photographed by DP Anthony Dod Mantle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire), the colors and grainy texture make this look like it was filmed in the 1970's, not just based then. While the racing scenes are stunning, it is actually an intimate look at this world and the men of this era. Without dwelling on it, we get a realistic feel for the fiery crash that caused Lauda's horrific injuries and his extraordinary fight to recovery while in the hospital.\n\nWe also get a peek at the very different marriages of these two men. Hunt's short lived bond with model Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde)ended when her affair with Richard Burton caused the final split between Burton and Liz Taylor. Lauda's relationship with his wife (Alexandria Maria Lara) occurred without the whirlwind, but in a very real and organic manner. Both are an additional touch of realism to a quite real story.\n\nThere have been no shortage of racing movies over the years. Some good: Le Mans (Steve McQueen) and Grand Prix (James Garner). Some not so good: Days of Thunder (Tom Cruise) and Driven (Sylvester Stallone). Ron Howard's latest clearly finishes near the top at the finish line."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was the movie I have been looking forward to watching all year, if not longer, from when I first heard it was being produced a year or so ago during Formula 1 coverage. When I first heard about it, I didn't have the greatest of hopes, worrying that Ron Howard wouldn't portray the sport correctly, or do it a disservice, but after seeing various interviews & him popping up at various events throughout the Formula 1 calendar, I was starting to go along with the hype & was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I was gripped from start to finish. It really had it all, from the authentic racing perspective, to the drama on track & the off track lives of both Hunt & Lauda, being portrayed excellently. This is the first film I've seen in a while where I can see myself watching this over & over again in the years to come.\n\nThe movie is based on the unbelievably true story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) & Niki Lauda's (Daniel Br\u00fchl) rivalry during the 1970's in Formula 1. The story follows their starkly contrasting lifestyles both on the track, as well as in their personal lives off the track. James Hunt is your charming English playboy, living every day like its his last in both his driving and his party going lifestyle, whereas in contrast Niki Lauda is the consummate professional, having that extraordinary ability to know exactly what's required to get the utmost performance out of his car. They both push each other to strive for the world championship, to outdo each other, from their Formula 3 days in the early 1970's to the dramatic 1976 Formula 1 season.\n\nI don't believe there are enough superlatives to describe this movie, from the fantastic cinematography & the staging of the racing scenes. Yes there is a bit of use of CGI, but strip that back, there were real stunt drivers driving the real cars, with cameras mounted in ideal positions to get great shots. Even both Hemsworth & Br\u00fchl both entered into driver training to prepare for their roles, which added to the authenticity. I think Ron Howard nailed this, from the look of the cars, to capturing the spirit of 1970's Grand Prix. I was especially impressed with the detail in the sounds of the cars. You can tell it was crafted to hear the sound from the drivers perspective during shots focused on the drivers. You top off all this with an incredible story, which is even more impressive that its based on a true story.\n\nI really felt gripped throughout the movie, from the highs of the racing and the rivalry, through to the excruciating pain Lauda went through on his recovery, I really felt like I felt every emotion, good or bad throughout the movie. This is an incredible movie and I'm sure even if your not a Formula 1 fan, or even a sports fan, you will find something in the drama of the legendary rivalry between Hunt & Lauda, that is Rush!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Ron Howard ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Apollo 13' etc) doesn't narrate the story of 'Rush' by letting you choose sides through one driver's perspective. In fact, with some adept writing by Peter Morgan ('The Queen', 'Frost/Nixon'), we travel in time to witness the events that lead up to the Formula 1 World Championship of 1976 and the formation of an unparallelled rivalry. Back then, racing wasn't as safe as it now is. It was rather an era when recklessness and flamboyance brought glory to some racers while two of the others on the grid, died every year. In the midst of this, are two men driven by danger; two rivals driven by passion; two legends driven by each other. Ron Howard is renowned for having a keen sense of the idiosyncrasies of his protagonists and here too, he depicts the influence of their personal lifestyles that shaped their racing styles. But where he really excels, is with the rivalry on track. The sheer thrill, excitement and dangers of Formula 1 racing are brilliantly captured as we travel the globe through stormy wet weather with cars screaming across the screen at 170 mph.\n\nThey called him a loose cannon but his raw talent was unmistakable. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was aggressive on the circuit and foolhardy off it. Being an outspoken, alcoholic casanova was his way of having fun and believed that it was a necessary balance to the challenges of being a risk-taking race car driver. With an independent, small budget team, Hunt moves up from Formula 3 to the join the ranks of the F1 racers, only to meet his nemesis from the past season. The methodical, reserved but often brash and terribly fast Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) enters Formula 1 by buying out a team with his loaned money and engineers his car meticulously to be the fastest man and champion in only his second season. The cool headed and thoughtful Lauda was quite the opposite of the aggressive and impulsive Hunt and therefore, their confrontations are a treat to watch and more often than not, they battle it out on the track. The film's turning point though is the incident at the German GP in Nurburgring (deemed to be too unsafe to race on by Lauda). 6 weeks later, a struggle for survival, the willpower to race again and the hunger for victory, bring the rivals together once more to fight for the title. In the spectacularly soaked Japanese GP, the engines rev up once more and the tyres spin over the track in a thrilling finale to one of the greatest rivalries in sports history.\n\nRon Howard has made his most exhilarating and brilliant film. Peter Morgan's exemplary screenplay and dialogue make the confrontations between the drivers edgy while giving the story some good substance to keep the non-racing scenes interesting as well. Cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is quite simply, superb. The close up of rain drops against wheels spinning off the starting grid, the gloomy sun on a stormy race day in Japan, the slow motion effects of the crashes and the point-of-view angles during the races make for some compelling viewing. The essence of Hans Zimmer's background score is the theme of each race being a risk that is only rewarded with a victory. The tone somehow reflects the aggression and tragedy of the rivalry itself and is quite epic upon reflection.\n\nThe ravishing Olivia Wilde and a well composed Alexandra Maria Lara support the racers on and off the track but the film is completely dominated by the two powerful performances of the racers. Chris Hemsworth is quite a revelation when one simply attributes his noteworthy work to being an angry, strong yet charming superhero. With his aggressive driving, impulsive drive for sex and outspoken brashness, Hemsworth appears well collected and mature to tackle the challenges of being the legendary James Hunt. Among his best scenes is one with some positive argument with Lauda towards the end of the film, where he justifies his lifestyle and his winning ways. While one sees the fun, reckless and victorious Hunt, there couldn't have been a better portrayal of his opposite. Daniel Bruhl has portrayed Niki Lauda in the most remarkable manner. With the prosthetics and speech, Bruhl emphasizes the technicalities and his focus to take racing seriously just as the living legend would. Much more reserved than Hunt ever was, Lauda was a dedicated and disciplined racer for whom mental focus and physical conditioning were key to winning in a well engineered car. Bruhl's performance showcases this keen understanding of Niki Lauda while adding the matter-of-factness to his dialogues. He seldom smiles because when he does, the joke is upon him. In being calculative, his emotion of happiness in love is a loss to him as he considers it a weakness that won't let him risk it all on the track.\n\nDriven by the actors' sincerest performances, 'Rush' feels more alive. Peter Morgan's exemplary writing gives the film its exciting moments and Mantle's superb cinematography brings the thrilling intensity of F1 racing on the big screen in epic fashion. Ron Howard pulled in some great talent and added his expertise of characterized drama with a surprising jolt of epic visuals to recreate the magical era of racing in the 70s. James Hunt and Niki Lauda conclude an important point of the story that they are both driven by each other. From their low points to their victories, what kept them going, was their rivalry and their hunger for victory. They often reached a physical and emotional breaking point but there was no margin of error when the championship was at stake. 'Rush' is a grand prize from Ron Howard and should be cherished by fans of Formula 1 racing as well as movie-goers who simply like a tale of triumphant human spirits."

First half (that would be one hour) of the movie is particularly bad, painting main protagonists as one-dimensional characters and skipping through events with music video editing style and pace. Only after first hour we get first proper race action, and we only get one more at the end of the movie. It's OK, does it job of kicking movie in the higher gear, but it looks to \"modern\" for my tastes. That means, too unnatural and \"assisted\", with extra bright and vivid colors. I guess in theater sound does help in creating the atmosphere, but watching at home you won't smell the tires burning."

It's the classic clash of psychologies setup: Hemsworth is a fun-loving womanizer who races for the thrill, while Bruhl is the strict disciplinarian. There's nothing really surprising or deep about this movie, but, my lord, is it excellent. It's just a great example of straightforward, Hollywood filmmaking, perfectly put together in every way. The racing scenes are exhilarating, but it's really the great lead performances that impress the most. You almost have to hate Hemsworth. How can anyone be as handsome as he is and as good an actor? Bruhl gave perhaps the most undervalued performance in Inglourious Basterds, and this movie proves he ought to be a huge star."

        "review_detailed_main": "A new film by Ron Howard and written by Peter Morgen. I instantly added this into my watchlist when I watched the first trailer and avoided all the other ones, even though I knew some about the story through my brother.\n\nThe story of two legends of Formula One's rivalry James Hunt and Nikki Lauda in 1976, and I love how the film starts introducing these main characters and the inception of their competition. I also really love how much they've stayed truthful to the true story and showing both sides of the characters, it's not like the usual films to have a bad and a good character and the audience would root for the good one, either of these characters are good in something and bad in other things, and both their weakness and strength are shown here. It's just so interesting to me how these two characters use each other to improve themselves, which is why their race in that season was very exciting,. Great performances by Christ Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, particularly Daniel Bruhl, if you watch any interviews of Nikki Lauda, you realize how much he has nailed this role; however, I've never enjoyed Olivia Wilde's performance, she's not terrible here but this is just a personal thing that I can't like it, she definitely looks astonishing and she has a small part, so overall it is fine. Hans Zimmer once again has done a wonderful job on composing the soundtrack, and I love the sound editing, the score and the cars' sound are edited so well and blended together that it doesn't bother or ruin the moments, in fact it makes those scenes better - I really hope it gets some recognition in the award season. I must admit the cinematography is done perfectly, otherwise the race scenes wouldn't look beautiful and exciting. I should mention that I'm so glad that Nikki Lauda himself appreciated the film and its accuracy, a big applause and thumbs up to Ron Howard.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this film and it's one best films are made for this year so far (I'm glad they didn't go to PG13 rating, I think that would kill the tone), definitely check it out in theaters and own it on bluray, I give it 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a huge F1 fan and have been since the early 80s. It is very rare that I find any film that I can find little fault with, but this is one such movie.\n\nHistorical nuts may take umbridge that the film is not 100% geek-accurate and correct (most films seldom are) but I was very happy with what Ron Howard has done here (I am one such geek!). The casting is so spot on that you genuinely believe that it is Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Chris Hemsworth was never going to quite get Hunt's public school boy accent absolutely bang on but he's done a cracking job nevertheless, and Daniel Bruhl is quite simply spectacular as the matter of fact, calculating Lauda.\n\nThe race scenes are particularly realistic and it's great to see that genuine period F1 cars were used in the filming rather than the generic \"racing cars\" one normally sees. The film brings home the danger that these drivers put themselves in during the 70s; Lauda's crash is particularly graphic, being seen from both an outside vantage point and the driver's point of view. There are enough grisly bits to make you wince but you do realise the driving force behind why they did it.\n\nThe support cast is also fantastic; Lord Hesketh is EXACTLY like real life, and the likeness of the actor playing Clay Regazzoni is uncanny. Olivia Wilde, playing Hunt's wife Suzy, is smouldering and has an excellent English accent.\n\nRon Howard has always been about telling an accurate true-life story which keeps you glued to your seat, and here he tells a story of two World Champions the way it should be done. Even if you don't like Formula 1, this is a MUST SEE film. It will be worth it - it is the best film I have seen in 10 years."

It's refreshing to have heroes not based on a comic! Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl do a superb job, Br\u00fchl even manages to talk in the viennese dialect of Lauda, which is really really hard(trust me, I am from Vienna and I couldn't do it).\n\nThe story is a kind of modern Shakespeare drama, with two actors giving us their best performances as actors so far.\n\nThis movie should get a bunch of Oscars (Director, Music, Sound Effects, Hemsworth, Br\u00fchl, Script).\n\nDo not miss it on the big screen!"

        "review_title": "Review: Rush Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com",
        "review_detailed_main": "Loud, proud, and relentless in its portrayal of sport rivals, Ron Howard's Rush is another entry into his formulaic and conventional directing resume. Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linear narrative with striking and beautiful aesthetic choices, even if the narrative follows the rivalry between two Formula One drivers whose careers and competition is anything but straight-cut.\n\nRush isn't the best film of the year by far, and in terms of narrative the film suffers from clich\u00e9d plot-points, predictable sport film tropes and by-the-book autobiographical rules, but one of the highlights of Rush is the effortlessness of telling the story of two incredible men's lives, without making one or the other the lead protagonist or antagonist. Rush is the true story of two passionate and talented drivers whose race to becoming the Formula One World Champion is something quite unbelievable.\n\nThe film begins in the middle of its narrative, at the beginning of the 1976 German Grand Prix in N\u00fcrburgring, mere moments before Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) experiences what is suspected to be a rear suspension failure that hospitalized him for a month and a half. We then flashback to 1970 at a Formula Three race in the Crystal Palace circuit in England where the rivalry between Lauda and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) begins. Destined to be rivals since their initial meeting, the film follows the trails and tribulations of Lauda and Hunt's fight to the Formula One circuit. Lauda, a mechanical genius who uses his skills on cars to earn his spot beside Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, shows skill as a engineer but suffers socially, proving to be somewhat inept when it comes to interacting with people. While Hunt, an unapologetic, globetrotting playboy, seems to have no problems interacting with his fans (maybe a little too often). Where Hunt lacks for meticulous calculations and mechanical understanding, things Lauda posses, Hunt makes up for in raw talent, ambition and \"balls\".\n\nThe film chronicles not only an intense rivalry set in the dangerous world of Formula One Racing, but the film also depicts a rivalry of wits between two men, who suffer and sacrifice so much for respect in a world inhabited by high-adrelanline, death-defying racers.\n\nRush is definitely a return to form for Howard, who, after the problematic and chaotic The Dilemma, had a lot to prove aesthetically and narratively. Aesthetically, Howard had his wheels spinning uncontrollably with inspiration. From the film's 1970\u2032s grainy look, to its very artistic slow-motion racing scenes (which acts as a nice irony to the sport), to the choice of camera angles when covering the pivotal scenes of the race, usually shooting at a very low angle, Howard does use the film to solidify his place as a stylistic filmmaker again, as he did previously with Cinderella Man, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.\n\nHoward surrounded himself with the best this time around, and made no mistakes. With a modest $38 Million budget for a Hollywood film, Howard was able to create an high-octane Formula One film, grounded as a character piece. Written by Peter Morgan (The Queen), shot by Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire), Scored by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy), and produced by film-extraordinaire and longtime collaborator Brian Grazer, Rush is assembled just like any other team in the Formula One cockpit, meticulously and strategically.\n\nIt also did not hurt that Howard was able to get Hemsworth out of Nordic armour and deliver his finest performance to date. The real star of the film is Br\u00fchl. Underrated and overlooked since his career-defining role in Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards, Br\u00fchl inhabits his rat-like character and shows the intolerable side of a man obsessed with perfection, discontent with happiness, and who shows no emotional response to the fast pace world which exists around him. Br\u00fchl's transformation into Lauda is one that will hopefully be acknowledged come award season.\n\nRush is a good film. More of a solid entry into the autobiographical sport genre, much like 42 earlier this year, the film lacks an intensity most great sport films have, which is the intensity of the sport itself. Some of the greatest sport movies ever made use the sport to elevate character progression, intense emotion or moments that audiences cheer for. There was never a rousing moment of triumph, pleasure or extreme emotion with our characters that took place on the racetrack. Unfortunately for the film, some of the best scenes happen on the streets of Italy, in the hospital, or in restaurants and furnace rooms where the characters grow and evolve; the racetrack is just a forum for winning.\n\nUnfortunately for the audience, between near-fatal crashes, personal lows and tragic endings, Rush never emotionally resonates with us. Lacking for a connection with Hunt and Lauda, Howard doesn't give the audience much time to connect with his drivers the way they do with their vehicles. \"Men love women, even more than that, men love cars!\". I don't think there could have been a more accurate way to describe the film and the world where testosterone, ego, and fuel, pumps the veins in the hearts of each racer.\n\nNight Film Reviews: 7/10 Stars"

I grew up in the 70's and it seemed like 1976 all over again. The fast cars and loud engines almost shake you in your seat and that alone makes for a good movie. The racetrack scenes showing the rain pouring down makes you feel something out of The Lord of the Rings. Now, the story line and driver rivalry seemed a bit average and not necessary entertaining. In fact it appears almost made up in parts and over exaggerated just to add some entertainment. But overall this is a typical racing flick from 1976 with updated technology for 2013."

It gave the feeling of seeing these cars race at hundreds of miles per hour plus you got a feel of what it was like from the driver point of view.\n\nSo the film is about a rivalry between 2 guys that first met at Formula 3 races. Then they move up to the big time, and are in a heated battle for the most points. Lauda is the more serious and trying to get points taken away for breaking rules. Hunt is the party boy whom is competitive and more lax. During the racing season, Lauda gets hurt and brings drama as this lets Hunt get back in the race for point leader. Lauda has already one the top spot before, so Hunt has real drive and risks his life to win.\n\nThere is also a little about each drivers' wife and how their personal relationships functioned.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: The acting isn't too great, but the racing scenes are. Plus Chris Hemsworth is very good looking in this. So if you like fast cars, check it out."

This was a year in which not everyone in fact was obsessed with the release of the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK. In the profoundly conservative world of Formula One, millions of TV viewers were increasingly preoccupied with an extraordinary duel developing between two drivers: the glamorous swashbuckler from Britain, James Hunt, and the icily correct Austrian Niki Lauda."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush is a biopic about the rivalry between F1 racers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their story is pretty much known as remarkable and their personal character can also be worth looking. By looking at the filmmaking, you'll see that it's an ambitious piece of cinema full of style and fascination beneath the lives of these people. However, it picks some mainstream choices in its character study. Well, there's no denying that you'll call Rush a very well made film. The direction propels the storytelling, making it wholly entertaining, while the performances made the less faster scenes a lot gripping. I think those merits alone would already make Rush a great movie.\n\nThe film contrasts between Hunt and Lauda by their traits and goals. Hunt is all brawn while Lauda is all wits. Though they both have the same obsession of winning mostly by their pride; one seeks for more fame and excessive pleasure, while the other tries to prove that he still got integrity even in the life as a star. The interesting part here is how these obsessions make them rise and fall, but that is the only thing where the character development leads to. The rest depends on the compelling performances filling the personalities and fortitude of these people. Chris Hemsworth did what he does best as a charming arrogant man, and it seems that's perfect enough for James Hunt. Daniel Br\u00fchl immediately steals the show, outweighing every acting around here. He's simply emotionally gripping as Niki Lauda.\n\nAbove all, it's all about the craft. Ron Howard brings plenty of fortitude and thrill through the dangerous racetracks, while makes the rest so terribly engrossing. The film is also magnificent in production with all the props, cars, cinematography, and stuff. But the real deal here is the style, showing consistent speed in its editing through the camera angles. These skills simply made the overall film thoroughly entertaining.\n\nRush can be worth rooting for in the end, it's a very well told story that embraces the speed of the cars without repelling anything, but when it slows down, it's still an interesting movie for exploring the characters, if only that part was less conventional, it would have been a lot stronger. But the strength is already kept strong by the filmmakers behind this film. It's just a marvelous experience that many would definitely find it engaging. It's easy enough to recommend it."

Personally it exceeded my expectations in every way, and the whole film is superbly made.\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock, you will know the outcome/major plot points going into the cinema, and even so, the film does a wonderful job conveying the drama and tension of F1 of that era. Ron Howard has crafted a great story of epic rivalry which transcends the sport in ways that few films have ever done before. For me it evoked the best racing moments, and it is one of the few times I will go and watch a film twice at the cinema.\n\nThe two main actors are very good in their roles, and Chris Hemsworth steals the show as James Hunt. He owns the part, and it was a real pleasure seeing him bring Hunt to the big screen. The rest of the cast were also great, and the understated role Lauda's wife played in the film added layers that added to the drama.\n\nIn the end this is a film that I will take great delight in rewatching, and I recommend it whole heartedly."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush is one of the best films of 2013, hands down. With phenomenal storytelling, prefect direction and near flawless acting, it submerses the audience into a the F-1 Racing world circa 1976. The film showcases the bitter rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, the most memorable of the sport. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl were near perfect in this film, due to the fact that the audience is meant to view these people as both protagonists. It delves into the morality of both characters, not showing one or the other as a villain or a hero, just regular and ordinary. With the help of Ron Howard's direction, this film elevates the intensity of this rivalry with getting riveting performances from the entire cast all around the board. However, the real shining star of this film is Daniel Br\u00fchl. Br\u00fchl gives the performance of his career in this film. And I fully expect an Oscar nomination for him this year.\n\nDespite being about racing, Rush's best scenes are rich in texture and performances, rather than visual effects. By far the best parts of the film were through the characters and that is what Howard intended. While the racing sequences are high octane scenes, the smaller parts are what really shine throughout the film, even if it ever gets to feel too long. Its interesting as hell and a very entertaining watch. Rush is one of the best films of 2013, delivering Oscar caliber performances along with impeccable writing and direction, it stands as a heavy handed Oscar contender."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rush\" is a formulaic piece that excels in almost every way other than its predictability. It's well acted, well filmed, and has great music to boot. If it wins an Oscar for something I'd expect it for the music first, then perhaps an acting nomination to Daniel Br\u00fchl (Niki Lauda) second.\n\nYou do not need to be a formula 1 racing fan to enjoy this movie. I have never watched an F1 race in my life, nor even seen an F1 movie before this one. What makes the movie interesting is not the sport, but the main characters and their relationship with each other.\n\nIt's a brilliantly acted rivalry between Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth). Both turn in A+ performances. By far the best performance I've yet seen from Hemsworth. He proved to me, with this movie, that he's more than just an action star. However he is outshone by Br\u00fchl. The film succeeds in showing both the tough exterior and the still tough but different inside personality of Lauda. That's a major accomplishment for both the director and the actor.\n\nWhat makes Rush worth watching isn't the suspense of what is going to happen next. It's perhaps one of the most formulaic sports movies I've ever seen. It succeeds in spite of that. It's the depiction of the main characters, their rude exchanges, and their underlying respect for each other, that makes it worth the 2 hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush This is a film review and there not any plot spoilers.\n\nI went to see this film and had no idea what to expect. I knew Ron Howard could direct a great film, and I knew Chris Hemsworth is perfect for the role of the god of thunder, but beyond that I had done little to prepare for this film besides watch the TV spots; I did not even watch a full trailer. I was amazed and taken aback by how much I enjoyed this film, it is a film that grabs you quickly and keeps you tied to it the entire run time.\n\nTo keep things spoiler free I will be very brief about the story, this film is just as much, if not more, about being a man as it is formula 1 racing. It follows two drivers as they try to figure out how to be successful men in the world, through wins, losses, women, marriage, drugs, anger, and gaining and losing control. This is what makes this film so engrossing, the film takes us deep into the lives of two drivers and focuses and explores so much more than just their racing.\n\nHowever, the racing in this film is some of the best I have seen depicted on camera. The cars are loud, very loud, and at times you think you can feel the heat off the engine, or the body bend under the pressure. The camera effortlessly switches from all angles during the race and it does it well to try and give you the full experience as if you were at the race.\n\nThe real bright spot of this film is the acting. All give astounding performances. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl present these men with full, nuanced, careful, and honest performances. It would have been very easy to let the style and tone of the film drift off the track with inflated and overacted performances but both men fire on all cylinders and hold tight lines the entire film. Olivia Wilde is smart and memorable with her screen time, and Christian McKay fills a very important role in the film and does so splendidly.\n\nThere is something very tangible about Rush, it is based on a true story, but it goes deeper than that. This film is an adrenaline rush in and of itself, but it is also very humanizing. This film is definitely not for the fast and furious crowd, but that's another reason that it is so great, it has fast cars and yet a story that is emotional and worth exploring. Add up a great script, good directing, and stellar acting and you get a film that drives just as fast and true as the cars you see on the screen.

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush - *** 1/2* Ron Howard's Rush dissects the 1970's Formula One rivalry between the brash Brit James Hunt and his complete opposite in the cold and calculating Niki Lauda. The film moves at a perfect pace, providing us with insights into both characters while never painting either of them as a villain or hero in the audience's eyes. The film's major success comes through in the development of it's two core characters, and the contrast Howard places between them as competitors.\n\nThe action sequences are incredibly tense and exciting, and yet they never take precedence over the film's central mission of developing the rivalry between these two great men. The driving sequences involve the audience to the point where we develop an understanding for the kind of utter danger these men put themselves in to live out their dreams, as Hunt says in the film of his car, \"It's really just a coffin on wheels.\"\n\nStrong performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl also help drive this thrilling piece of cinema along. Hemsworth certainly impressed me with his brash and overt Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl stole the show for me; his performance conveys the completely mathematical and emotionless nature of Niki Lauda to near perfection. Strong supporting performances from Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara as the men's respective lovers also add to the film's momentum.\n\nOverall Rush is a thrill ride from start to finish, never getting lost in itself and providing excellent character based action both on and off the track. In my opinion this is Ron Howard's best work to date (yes, including A Beautiful Mind!) and a film definitely worth catching in cinemas while you still can."

Niki is described as a sensible, reflexive person ; whereas James Hunt is shown as childish, self-centered and sometimes toxic for his entourage.\n\nMy only dislike is related to the direction of photography. The balance of colors, the composition, the choices of focal lengths, the vibration of the image to convey emotion (trembling hands, engine vibration, etc) ... I like none of those.\n\nBut the story and acting saves it all."

I had little idea what was going on. Someone crashes \"who is that?\" asks my Mrs, \"I've no idea\" I say. Oh, and one other thing that drove me to distraction was the totally invasive and somewhat condescending 'commentary' on every race - ugh! This is (another) of those films I am heartily glad I didn't part with any money to see. I don't know who would have done a better James Hunt but there must have been someone??? 10/10 for Nikki, 0/10 for everything else (Except the six-wheeler Tyrell - I loved seeing that!) Previous posters say \"See the film 'Grand Prix' instead,\" I agree, anyone want the DVD, only played once?"

Me and my ladyfriend were kids back then, and we spent those Sunday afternoons glued to the TV whenever there was a F1 race on, so this was a really nostalgic trip too - but the cameras are so much nearer to the cars here, you're inside the action and the angry engine sounds out of a theater PA system really make all the difference - there are moments of pure adrenaline bliss here. It's been a long, long time since I've watched any car race on TV but for my taste, they could have included even more race scenes, they were that good.\n\nAll the adrenaline can't save a movie if you don't care, but in \"Rush\", we do. Both leads are excellent; of course Br\u00fchl as Lauda has the meatier and more dramatic role and more screen time but Hemsworth did a great job, too. Supporting roles are also good, with special nods to Alexandra Maria Lara as Niki's wife Marlene. There's a 50 minute doc available on youtube about the Hunt/Lauda rivalry and the 76 championship where you can see a bit of real-life Marlene and she really nailed it. What I missed were a few more of the legendary 70s drivers, only Regazzoni has a speaking part, most others only get a few background seconds.\n\nI liked Hans Zimmer's music, sometimes he's too foreground for my taste but in \"Rush\", he keeps it subtle.\n\nThe real-life story gets a bit condensed for the screen and writer Morgan / director Howard often use a rather coarse brush to paint their characters, but that really doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Highly recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had zeroed in on Rush as one of the movies that I was going to watch on the big screen (the Ron Howard & F1 union factor), here in Dubai and was waiting for it eagerly. And boy it was the worth the wait. Rush is not your run-of-the-mill movie in the sporting drama bandwagon which caters only to F1 enthusiasts.\n\nF1 fan or not, the way Howard has showcased the legendary rivalry between F1 greats, Niki Lauda and James Hunt makes for compelling and intense viewing. The banter and the doses of humour interspersed throughout the flick form the crux of the \"foe-mance\" between Hunt and Lauda (played exquisitely by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl respectively) & are the high points of film. Howard is spot on with his depiction of the events surrounding this fabled rivalry. His portrayal of the 2 legends, with contrasting personalities who are poles apart and yet are driven by equal love for the sport and ambition makes the flick, an interesting and exhilarating ride. The movie is crisply edited and moves along at just the right pace for a biopic.\n\nApart from all this, in my opinion, ultimately what clinches it for Rush and catapults it into the \"bench mark\" shelf of movies; making it one of the great sporting drama movies of all time, are the parts just before the climax and the climax itself. The miraculous & awe-inspiring recovery of Lauda(after the life threatening crash in Nuremberg) culminating into the final race of the dramatic 1976 season in rain soaked Japan(with the stunning Mount Fuji in the backdrop) has been shot and executed \"jaw-droppingly\" well. It's a spectacle to say the least. Expect cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle to win a few accolades for his staggering work, as Howard's team on the whole excels in executing & pulling off breath-taking F1 set-pieces to perfection.\n\nIn Rush, we have a film which Ron Howard & his team have managed to steer just about correctly at every corner/chicane of movie making. The flick has almost everything, right from the movie score to the acting, working for it, like a well drilled F1 car. In the end what it all boils down to; the essence of Rush, the movie, lies in its two protagonists. It's thrilling, funny and unpredictable just like Hunt and meticulously filmed, is blunt but with touch of emotional and inspirational edge to it just like Lauda.\n\nFormula 1 buff or not Rush to the nearest movie theatre to catch this un-missable adrenaline edge of the seat ride."

        "review_detailed_main": "No motion picture in history has so accurately portrayed the anxiety, thrill, elation and perils of competitive motor racing as Ron Howard's excellent 'Rush'. A gripping drama based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One adversaries James Hunt and Niki Lauda that culminated in their history-making bout for the 1976 world championship title, it has the very rare honour of being a sports movie not just for fans of the sport itself, but a celebration of a universal need within every individual for purpose and achievement.\n\nThat need is exemplified in the two duelling, diametrically opposite individuals at the heart of the film. Hunt (played by \"Thor\" star Chris Hemsworth) is a British playboy who loves the game for the chance again and again to live life dangerously close to death, the epitome - if you will - of a stereotypical F1 driver who lives and drives recklessly and fearlessly. Lauda, on the other hand, is a methodical tactician, constantly assessing the odds and \"looking at the big picture\", careful and calculating where Hunt is careless and cavalier.\n\nTheir approach to the game isn't all that sets them apart; while Hunt is sexy and charismatic, Lauda is often terse and brusque. While Hunt hits the parties and downs the booze the night before and the night after every race, Lauda avoids these excesses, and cares nothing for hanging out with his team members to build camaraderie. The only thing they have in common is their family background, both racers hailing from distinguished families that did not support their racing dreams, a fact elaborated in greater detail in Hunt's case to illustrate the conservative Viennese upbringing that likely contributed to his chilly personality.\n\nNeophytes as we are to F1's history, that we are able to learn so much about Hunt and Lauda is credit to Peter Morgan's character-driven screenplay, which devotes an extraordinary amount of attention to fleshing out both personas and allowing his audience to draw out the obvious contrasts between them. This isn't a film where the only thing that matters is what happens on the race track; rather, Howard emphasises the fundamental differences between these two men, which makes their race on the track a battle not only for glory but one stemming from their divisive personal values and beliefs - and as we learn, the reason why either one eventually develops fierce mutual respect for the other.\n\nBut before we get to that turning point, Howard recounts in largely chronological fashion their beginnings as brash newcomers in Formula Three racing and their ascent into the big F1 league. The briskly paced setup that covers Lauda's strategic entry into the Ferrari team by his mechanical ingenuity, as well as Hunt's more rocky start under the eccentric Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay) and subsequently Team McClaren, uses these key events to ratchet the tension between Lauda and Hunt, building up of course towards the seminal 1976 F1 racing season where their acrimony reaches its climax.\n\nConfidently allowing the drama to take centrestage for the first half of the movie, Howard leaves much of the race action for the latter half of the movie as the 1976 season gets underway. The highlight of it all is of course the dramatic centrepiece at the Nurburgring track in Germany - also known as 'The Graveyard' - where Lauda will be trapped in his burning car for close to a minute and suffer third-degree burns to his head and lungs. Those who know the story will also remember that he will get back on the track an amazing 42 days later, and Howard spares no detail in showing his extraordinary tale of tenacity - including the agonizing medical procedure of vacuuming his lungs he had to endure.\n\nIt all pays off extraordinarily in an exceptionally thrilling and yet deeply poignant finish set around the Fuji Speedway amidst pelting rain. A quick search online will probably tell you what happened during that race, but we advise those who yet know the story to let Howard's film have the honour of taking you out on that breath-taking final race of the season that provides beautiful closure to the running theme of just what and how we choose our lives to be driven by. It is also by far one of the most emotionally intense cappers we have experienced this year, a perfect combination of Howard's masterful direction, Anthony Dod Mantle's expert cinematography (that uses compact digital cameras mounted within the cars to bring his viewer right into the heat of the action), and deft editing of hundreds of shots from various perspectives.\n\nAnd yet this remains through and through a story built on two fascinating characters, which Hemsworth and Bruhl nail with adroit precision. Best known for being 'Thor', Hemsworth brings impressive depth to a character that could easily have been cartoonish, balancing on a very thin fine line bravado and vulnerability to rise above caricature. German actor Bruhl shines in his first Hollywood role (he'll next be seen opposite Cumberbatch in the WikiLeaks drama 'The Fifth Estate'), and besides exuding determination and poise at every turn, he also brings a rough charm to his character.\n\nWith 'Rush', Howard once again asserts himself as a maestro of smart adult-oriented entertainment built on complex but always compelling real-life characters. It easily stands out as one of his best, and the same can be said of Morgan, their second collaboration since 'Frost/ Nixon' paying off in a truly amazing film that is gripping at every physical turn on the track and every dramatic turn off it. Combining larger-than-life characters with white-knuckle racing thrills, 'Rush' Is not just one of the best sports movies we have seen, but indeed one of the very best films that you'll see this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rush\" is definitely one of the best movies of the year and has many strong points to offer - even to those who aren't into motor sports at all. First of all, the acting is simply incredible. Chris Hemsworth performs the slowly dying kind of charming and charismatic pop stars among athletes that doesn't exist anymore in modern motor sports. He portrays a self-confident daredevil, playboy and sex symbol who seems superficial and unsympathetic at first sight but who turns out to be courageous and have more values than one might think. Behind his arrogant appearance is a breakable young man destined to live in the fast lane and die young. Many real persons from that time and especially the real Niki Lauda said that Chris Hemsworth acts and speaks exactly as the real James Hunt did which proves his incredible acting job. His antagonist is portrayed by Daniel Br\u00fchl who incarnates a young and motivated man who seems to be an arrogant and bourgeois nouveau riche at first sight but who turns out to be as breakable, courageous and determined as his concurrent. The two main characters are very different from each other but at the same time they have enough things in common to be at eye level during the most exciting Formula One season in history. I think that Daniel Br\u00fchl's acting is even better. He had to incarnate a real person that is still alive which is always tough. As a German he had to learn an Austrian accent to speak German and English in a credible way, he had to have the same gestures and he had to incarnate the same temperaments the real Niki Lauda. Thanks to a lot of details and time put into this acting job and many meetings with the real Niki Lauda, Daniel Br\u00fchl perfectly succeeded and delivers without the glimpse of a doubt the best acting performance of his career. The thing that impressed me the most was that the real Niki Lauda said that he thought of people being cruel and superficial when they have watched him with disgust or scare after his accident but when he watched this movie he had the same terrified reaction and finally understood why I all people had reacted that way so many years ago. His reaction proves how intense and real this movie is even though a few historical facts are of course exaggerated to put additional tension into this film. Next to the incredibly gifted two main actors who almost have the same screening time and are equally treated in depth even though the story is told by the film character Niki Lauda, one should not forget about a whole bunch of great supporting actors in this movie. There is simply no bad actor or actress in this film.\n\nAnother strong point of this movie is the way it mixes the incredible true events by using many original settings from museums or archive footage with well integrated cinematographic elements such as an atmospheric soundtrack, intense dialogues and very well done special effects that are not overloaded with cheap effects but that feel as real as the rest of the movie. The camera work is quite perfect as it has a balanced mixture of cinematographic and documentary shots once again.\n\nAnd then there is the story which is highly based on true events. You don't need to be a fan of motor sports to get into this film. The story is about the clash of two very unique and different characters who seem to be antagonists and the roughest kind of competitors at first sight but who turn out to be more similar to each other than they might think. This movie is about competition, sportsmanship and more than all the precious value of life. It's also about the ups and downs that come with success. It's a movie about family values, love and friendship but also about extreme loneliness and despair. Many people don't understand why motor sport athletes are risking their lives for this sport. This movie gives us the answer. This sport is a lifelong dream of both characters and they entirely owe the lives they are living to their successful career. At the end, the movie shows us two very different ways how to deal with the risks of this dangerous job and where to stop playing with fate. This opens an almost philosophical and quite profound perspective that makes this movie something more precious than a simple action film or drama. It inspires you to think of which path you would have chosen as anybody should be able to at least partially empathize with the characters.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this film to any movie fan. No matter if you are a fan of action movies, biopics, dramas or suspenseful movies, this flick has it all and even more for you and the incredible acting plus the detailed settings are the cherries on the cake. The movie even includes a few humorous scenes, erotic moments but also philosophical elements. It's hard to create a more complete movie than this one but at the same time, this film always feels consistent and never loses track of its clear guiding line. Right now, this movie is worth nine out of ten and time will tell us if this might even be worth the perfect rate. I think this might be the case and hope that the movie will win a few Academy Awards along with the superb crime drama \"Prisoners\". These two movies are definitely the best of the year until now and the year is almost over. If you were hesitating whether to watch this film or not, you should by now have made your decision to go to the cinemas as long as this film is still there. Needless to say that the great camera work and the impressive sound effects work even better in cinema than at home."

While I knew Chris Hemsworth would be outstanding, I was AMAZED by Daniel Bruhl! WOW. Both actors had fantastic chemistry and I totally believed they were lifelong racing brothers who had love/hate feelings for each other, leading towards boundless respect in the end.\n\nOn some level, this felt like a Love Story, a story of redemption, and a story of brotherhood and loyalty.\n\nI walked out of the theater feeling inspired.

During the 1976 season the rivalry hit its peak and the two found themselves neck and neck for the world championship. When Niki is involved in an horrific accident the two realize what they mean to each other. I was a little hesitant about watching this going in for a few reasons. I am not a racing fan nor am I a fan of racing movies. I wasn't a big fan of Days Of Thunder...so that is my disclaimer. As far as this movie goes it was better then I was expecting but I never really felt a connection with any of the people and when the accident happened it didn't really have any affect on me. Days Of Thunder did have more of a rivalry feel to it and played that up. This one focused more on each driver individually more then the racing rivalry. When you watch it you will know what I mean. Overall, the movie was better then I expected but was really missing something to cause the necessary emotions. I give this a B-."

        "review_detailed_main": "The rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt is one of the most iconic throughout the motor racing history, and in the history of the sports in general. Niki Lauda's comeback is probably the top10 unbelievable and inspirational comebacks of all times. The relationship between Hunt and Lauda was a little bit over-dramatized for the movie, but not too much. In real life, the two drivers were good friends and had immense respect towards each other, and the film, although antagonizing them with each other, manages to show how deeply these two guys respected each other. Chris Hemsworth does a brilliant job as James Hunt and Daniel Br\u00fchl is simply phenomenal as Niki Lauda. I think it was unfair that he didn't even get the nomination for the Academy Awards, and this snub might be the biggest embarrassment in the history of Ocars.\n\n'Rush' captures the essence and the period, and the dangers of racing perfectly. Film's fast pace makes the viewer feel excited like watching a real race. The movie jumps right into the story without spending too many extra minutes for introducing the characters. Yet nothing is left unsaid, and the viewers who are not particularly familiar with the history of Formula1 racing will be perfectly informed. The characters and story are set with minimal time, but with maximum intensity, thus leaving more room for the racing on (and off) the track.\n\nLeave it to Ron Howard if you want a historically accurate biographical movie on the epic scale. Racing fan or not, 'Rush' will not leave you untouched with its sleek visual style and inspiring story that races on with 200mph. Racing fan or not, you will like this movie, as it is as much about real people than about the racing.\n\nP.S. The first time I saw the film was in its initial run in 2013. Its impact was still present in 2019 when I watched it the second time. It is interesting how the person's values change over time - in '13 I liked Hunt because of his easygoing rebel attitude, but in'19 I sympathized more with Lauda and his straightforward attitude, concentration and dedication for work."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't particularly gravitate towards sports movies, primarily because I'm just not into sports but also because a lot of them are clich\u00e9-ridden underdog stories that have been done to death. Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try."

So, the story was promising (getting into deep dungeons of friendship/rivalry/antagonisms of main characters) but it ended up wandering around almost random scenes from their lives and ending ,as usual, just when it becomes interesting. Now something on the \"technical aspects of the craft\": Cast is very good and so are the performances (two main characters only), as well as editing.

        "review_detailed_main": "You know, I have never really cared that much for car racing in real life, and yet that does not keep me from finding Rush one of the most complete and satisfying films of 2013.\n\nThe thing about Rush is that it's not really a racing movie. While the film does follow the world of Formula-One racing, it is not what the movie is about. Where Rush really accelerates and manages to resonate, is in portraying the complicated love-hate rivalry between racecar drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the early 1970s.\n\nThis is a true story that is so fantastic that it almost seems as if it was fabricated, but the film never feels fake or Hollywoodified. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan go to great lengths to not make it the good guy vs. bad guy scenario. They present both the flaws and the things that made Hunt and Lauda great men of the sport. Hunt's a charming, easy to like playboy who is self-destructive, and Lauda is so calculating and abrasive he rarely shows emotion or vulnerability, and yet you've gotta love a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks. Featuring some of the most exciting cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle since he won the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, and some genuinely whip smart editing, you really get the feeling of being in this world, on the track with these titans of racing. What manages to evoke this feeling is Howard's documentary like approach to the material.\n\nRon Howard really is a chameleon of a director. He never makes the same movie twice, and there really is no other film in his filmography quite like this one. He sheds many of the genre conventions that you find in his other works for a stripped down, realistic approach. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall watching the ultimate racing doc that's all rock-and-roll. Then there's the rocking Seventies setting that's equal parts nostalgic and cool, by and large thanks to the surprisingly nuanced and of-the-times musical score from Hans Zimmer. However, there is also a heart to this movie that is both a testament to Howard's ability to shape smart characters and the performances of his actors. These two things combine to make these character's oddly likable, even when they aren't always the nicest of people.\n\nOverall, Rush is simply put, a phenomenal experience at the theater. It's a movie that can be fun, emotional, and thoughtful all in one. It paints the picture as to why we need rivalries in life. There has to be something pushing us to greatness, and very often a healthy rivalry is the only way to get there. Even if a Formula-One movie isn't your cup of tea, I implore you to at least give the film a chance as a character piece. Stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl compliment one another in their performances very much the same way that Hunt and Lauda did on the racetrack, and sometimes you don't need flowery words to express how much a performance, or in this case, two performances work. Rush is definitely a movie I will be revisiting in the future and is one that I will more than likely include, very proudly I might add, on my year end best list.\n\nI give Rush a 10 out of 10!"

I was wrong, the story is brilliantly told, and the movie captures perfectly a less PC, less rigid, less technical, more colourful, more risky and more exciting motor sport era. Hemsworth turns out to be a charismatic actor who brings a sense of the dangerous (reckless) energy that Hunt had as the last off the. 'Gentlemen amateurs'. Lauda heralded a new era and proved that although less reckless, he embodied courage in a different way. The rivalry was real and fuelled a great seasons racing. The movie really caught the era for me, the background captured perfectly in flashes of news, fashion, and a general looseness that is missing from our photoshopped era. Supporting actors are great, Olivia Wilde even looks like Suzy Hunt as I remember her... But the main thing is that the pace is like a race, and the movie drew me in with real drama, no mean feat given that I already knew who won! I don't understand some of the pedants who think their view of this history does how supersedes all others. For me this was real as it should be and dramatic as it could be. As for some prurient type complaining at seeing Hemsworths buttocks, go watch the latest Disney film, and leave this for the adults amongst us. Fantastic."

I am an avid fan of sports films, but this isn't really a sport, so Rush doesn't get any benefit of the doubt from me. That's not to say there's nothing good in this movie. The character work from Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that's what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Br\u00fchl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up. The fact that this was all based on real events made it that much more powerful, knowing that he had overcome so much in his life to be a success.\n\nJames Hunt (the man that Chris Hemsworth plays) is much less fascinating. He is simply a jerk that seems to care about no one. That's where Rush lost me. The one lame \"save the cat\" moment that they give Hunt is not nearly enough to make me like him. The end didn't click all that well, because I couldn't buy that one conversation and a single good deed could turn their rivalry into a friendship. I was afraid he was going to remain the protagonist for the entire film, and his tedious relationships would become an important plot point. Thankfully, later on the movie focused in on Lauda much more, and his intriguing marriage. I enjoyed aspects of Rush more than I expected, particularly the acting, but it never could get over the hump to be a movie I loved. Frankly, I think an ESPN documentary on the subject would be a bit more effective."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story takes place in the 70's, it revolves around the lives of two famous race car drivers, James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth) who loves to race and loves the fame that comes with it, and Nicki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl) who just loves to race, does not care about the fame. The two have a love and hate kind of thing going, that keeps there competitive going.\n\nExcellent film, that captures the look of the 70's perfectly. Director Ron Howard does it again, his direction is brilliant. Chris Hemsworth gives a good performance has James Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl as Nicki Lauda, showing there desire to race, and at times egos getting in the way. But both having the strong desire for greatness, I think that it was well captured on film."

His German counterpart, Daniel Bruhl, brought another breath of fresh air to our Canadian theaters. You could almost taste the tension between the opposing personalities \u2013 and it never failed to thrill!\n\nIn addition to great acting, the filming was absolutely breathtaking: you will literally be on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours. I would highly recommend this movie to sports fans and non-fans alike. There is a perfect mixture of sass and sport to make this movie a perfect date night flick!"

        "review_title": "The HUNT for the next great racing flick is over. Allow me to LAUDA merits of this great film of racing history.",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are no spoilers in this review of Rush, for the 1976 Grand Prix championship was settled long ago. That it was done in the most unexpected fashion under torrential conditions by the shadow of majestic Mount Fuji, in the legendary racing circuit of the same name, has perhaps made it all the more a hallowed story of Formula One history. Books have been written and documentary films have been made recounting the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda many times over. Even the tapes of the live broadcast still exist.\n\nA tricky thing, making a story interesting despite everyone already knowing how it all went down.\n\nYet, Ron Howard does just that. As expected, there are embellishments, so let's get the biggest one out of the way: Hunt and Lauda never met in that particular F3 race. It is something that has been pointed out when production photos were leaked revealing just that fictional encounter. Certainly not the first nor the worst type of creative license.\n\nSurprisingly, aspects of Hunt's personality are actually toned down. By all accounts, his sexual appetite was more of a compulsion, and his hard drug use and alcohol consumption more than recreational. He was renowned for enjoying all these to excess, even before having to nurse the pain of a broken marriage. His temper was described by Sir Sterling Moss as \"volatile\", with Hunt punching many a poor marshal who eagerly rushed to help Hunt after a shunt \u2013 an oft repeated rhyme for this was a regular occurrence throughout his career. Instead, Ron Howard relies yet again on re-imagining another encounter - his version of Hunt's aggression slightly more noble.\n\nDespite these, Hemsworth's Hunt is still pretty much like the real Hunt, from the pre-race nerves, the vomiting, right down to the witty, politically incorrect, off the cuff remarks. In all, the James Hunt of Rush is a highly sympathetic character, one with real fears and tangible feelings underneath his playboy persona.\n\nDaniel Bruhl's Lauda on the other hand, is on the verge of one-dimensionality. Throughout the film, the Lauda of Rush is too uptight, too much of a straight edge. While the real Niki Lauda's methodical and no-nonsense approach is renowned, Lauda is a respected figure then and now. His then wife, Marlene Lauda, said of the ever escalating competitiveness of F1 late in Niki's career, \"All the drivers are so serious, it's no longer fun. Niki is the only one who likes to smile and be friendly with the other drivers\" \u2013 a far cry from his on-screen depiction of an insufferable pedant.\n\nOnly the real Lauda's act of self-preservation truly hints of the film version's human side. A decision borne out of fear, Tyrrell driver Jody Scheckter, called the real Lauda's actions as true bravery. Lauda got out of his Ferrari, defied Il Commendatore, and did not make any excuses. He just could not finish that race and he owned up to that decision.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that for a motor racing film, Rush shows very little racing, with any long sequence only occurring about an hour into the film. Instead, races are abbreviated as quick flashes of blurred landscape and overused shaky in-car/on-car camera footage \u2013 likely added post-production. Devoid of wide angle shots and any form of continuity editing, it's hard not to call attention into the shakiness as a crutch to depict frantic excitement. With the availability of such stable cranes and booms mounted on various high speed chase cars (such as the ones seen during production!), I was hoping for Rush to break from the \"action equals shaky camera\" trend of Hollywood filmmaking. Show me real driving! Alas, we are treated to quick, jarring cuts. Inevitably, I could never quite tell where the hell they are in the iconic racetracks of F1's yesteryear, were it not for the captions. Save for Monaco (which only appears in Hunt's visualization) and Nurburgring, all the other racing sequences could have been shot in Brands Hatch for all I know.\n\nNonetheless, even though shot in digital format (Arri Alexa and Canon C300) I must commend the colour grading. The temptation must have been there to make it look orange and blue, or perhaps excessively filtered, like oh so many disgusting instagram photos. Instead, there is a subtle warmth to the whole film, as though it were shot in 1970's film stock.\n\nYet, I really only point out these minor annoyances of Rush's action driving sequences because I am such a big fan of Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966) \u2013 still to this day my benchmark for any racing flick. There have been many car related movies, few have been about racing, and all have failed because they pandered to the lowest common denominator of automobile fans. Because despite these embellishments, glossed over details, and current action filmmaking clich\u00e9s, Rush is a masterful work of storytelling. Foregoing long drawn out and realistic driving sequences, Rush's plot moves very fast indeed, all whilst largely staying true to the actual historical turn of events \u2013 Frankenheimer's Grand Prix was a notoriously slow burn. Nonetheless, perhaps in homage to Grand Prix, Rush also utilizes track announcers, reporters, and print headlines to advance the exposition (As an aside, I am unsure whether Simon Taylor plays Murray Walker or is he playing himself?).\n\nIf anything, the mere fact that there is a slick new racing movie out will leave motorsport fans and racers alike thankful. So used are these fans and racers to have their love, their passion, and their pastime being mangled and misrepresented, that anything close enough to the gritty realism of the sport is a very welcome and refreshing change indeed. For those of you who feared this will be Stallone's Driven, redux, then you need not worry. Go watch it! You won't be disappointed."

Well, this first sentence was only true before I went to watch Rush. I give you, that my two and only reasons to go and see this movie were the leads - Chris (think Thor)and Daniel (ah, Good Bye Lenin and 7 dias en La Habana, and boy I'm happy I did. I must say that my interest in F1 was quite superficial, and only in the 1990s I was somewhat caught by the sport when the statistically (and statistically he IS) the best driver of F1 ruled the track,and I've never really troubled myself with F1 history and all those discussions of who's the best and all, thus the story behind 1976's F1 championship was totally new to me. Getting back more closely to the movie, I'd say just this - in my opinion Rush is the best 2013 movie I've seen, Chris and Daniel did wonderful jobs, and if this movie won't get any nominations (think Oscars) I'll be very very surprised. And now I'm off to continue with some old F1 GPs videos and some documentaries as the movie's so great that I'm actually inspired to dig deeper into the story itself. 10 out of 10 and a huge +"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is recommended.\n\nGentlemen, start your engines! The need for speed is the mainstay in Ron Howard's cinematic ode to racing, Rush, a well crafted, if formulaic, Formula One racing car drama.  \n\nThe film tells the true story of two racing champions, British playboy James Hunt, and temperamental Austrian driver Niki Lauda, and centers on the on-going rivalry between the two drivers. Both are Type A personalities: ambitious, energetic, and competitive. And both are unlikeable characters, which throws the audience's sympathies askew from the onset.  They act predictably petty and selfish throughout the film with no real maturity or growth to speak of. There is no real surprises in the character's development, actions, or motivations in Peter Morgan's straightforward script. It also doesn't help that the dialog never builds any real conflict or resolution.\n\nYet what makes Rush so watchable are the purely technical aspects of the film. Howard knows how to set up his shots for maximum effect and he skillfully keeps the action sequences exciting and tense. The Formula One racing scenes are wonderful and quite exhilarating.  Particularly impressive is the rain-soaked Grand Prix racing sequence an expect blending of visual images. His biggest misstep is incorporating the real footage of Hunt and Lauda which seems a tad jarring in comparison.\n\nThe film boasts first-rate production values. The editing by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill is just terrific, as is the stunning photography by Anthony Dod Mantle.  Special mention also goes to the expert sound design, the strong makeup work, and a music score by Hans Zimmer which is never overdone or intrusive. The period art direction and costumes help to capture the 70's era with clever subtleties.\n\nAs long as Rush stays literally on the course, the film is highly entertaining. But whenever it detours into the realm of the human drama, the film is a bit of a bore. This is not the fault of the actors involved. Liam Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl bring the right degree of vanity and physically posturing to their conventional roles. Both actors make their stilted characters more believable. Manyl of the supporting characters are underwritten and rarely seem authentic. This is especially true with the female love interests played by Olivia Wilde and.Alexandra Maria Lara, fine actresses that aren't given enough to do.\n\nAlthough Rush may veer dangerously off trackage times, it does cross the finish line, just not in the winner's circle. GRADE: B\n\nANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

I watched the cultural Monday-Night Program on ORF2 (the ORF is the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation), when Niki Lauda, Daniel Br\u00fchl and Peter Morgan had been interviewed. Niki Nationale has given Br\u00fchl his sanctus.\n\nOn the same day, when Lauda crashed and burned in the Green Hell, in Vienna collapsed a famous bridge into the Danube. I was a five year old boy living in the suburbia of Vienna and honestly the bridge affected me more. The Death-Toll was one in Vienna, almost one in Germany. When Lauda realized that a priest was at his bed in the hospital, he mobilized all his mental power and came back from the valley of death. (AND the doctor said, Lauda survived because he was NON SMOKING - a fact, that young people should think about!)\n\nJames Hunt meant nothing to me, until the movie-project came into the headlines. I think Chris Hemsworth fits perfect in the role.\n\nRUSH is one of the best movies about racing and one of the best movies of the Year 2013.\n\nThank you Peter Morgan. Thank you Ron Howard."

There was too much romance and I didn't think Chris Hemsworth made a good James Hunt. We watched a recent documentary about the relationship between Lauda and Hunt that was much more interesting and I believe (having met them both personally) closer to the truth. It would have better with more original footage and covered the relationship with the team more at an engineering level. Having said that the intensity and 110% commitment from F1 drivers cam across very well and the dismissal of the risk was shown well. The scenes of Lauda's recovery were quite shocking as I am sure they really were. Still I give it 7 out of 10."

I did worry at how Daniel Bruhl would take his character in the first few moments but soon relaxed into his portrayal.\n\nThe cinematography of this film is noting short of stunning! As an attendee of many forms of racing, they capture the blood rushing adrenaline that accompanies the sport in the races and sometimes left me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. Not only that, but the angles on the racetrack that captured leaves blowing or other simple transitions throughout were absolutely breathtaking in their simplicity and design. Finally, the filtering and FX made me feel like I was watching my parent's old home movies at times. Spot on in transporting me back to a time before my age and making it feel so real.\n\nI do hope to see this film capture the hand during awards season. It wouldn't be a film I'd watch many times (because of the subject) but it is absolutely one of the best I've seen in a while.\n\nNotes: ~Fellow viewers (mostly female) reported they thought it was \"too long\". ~Some scenes may be too graphic for younger and sensitive audiences. Both gore and the lovely view of Chris Hemsworth's deliciously chiseled backside. ~Counting websites will take note on the number of times arsehole was said. It became comical! Also, nipples.

In fact were it not for a masterful performance by Daniel Br\u00fchl who really does capture some of the essence of Niki Lauda, I'd have probably scored the film a couple of points lower. I was hoping this would be a racing film that might finally outshine Grand Prix, instead, its really only slightly more watchable than Bobby Deerfield."

This peace of work is by all means unworthy of representing the lives of these famous names in F1. And the costly technical arrangements do not compensate for this unforgivable lack. What a waste of resources...! I am wondering why these talented actors and filmmakers got involved with this script in the first place. And I am also wondering why Nikki Lauda, the protagonist of the story, gave his blessing to the use of his name and his certainly impressive life story. A mystery to me. However, the bad monetary performance of the movie speaks for itself."

And I didn't think about it at the time it was Ron Howard directed.\n\nI'm glad I got around to give this movie a view. It was excellent!\n\nMuch more of a just \"racing movie\", much of a \"human interest\" type movie as well. Makes me wish back when I was a young lad I paid more attention to formula racing back in 1976'ish.\n\nThe bottom line is even if you are not a big fan of racing you will probably really appreciate this movie and love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It would be difficult for me to be less interested in racing, and I thought this film was terrific. It's fast paced, exciting, well-acted, informative and just good fun. What makes this movie is it's only nominally about racing--the interesting angle is the complex rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda (and I would actually recommend NOT reading up about these two before you see the film--there is a major spoiler at the end if, like me, you check into their biographies first). They liked each other, they hated each other, they were polar opposites in their approaches to just about everything--racing and life--and yet they absolutely needed each other. What an interesting character study that elevates this film over the typical Days of Thunder-type of action film.\n\nI'll give a cheer for Chris Hemsworth, who does a great job portraying James Hunt--Hemsworth is one of the best actors at playing the Good Time Charlie-type of character (which I would argue is much of his charm in the first Thor film, except Thor grows up. Hunt doesn't). Okay, I do love looking at CH, and he can wear that long hair and those 70s outfits any time . . . but he's a darn good actor, too.\n\nHow unfortunate this film didn't generate the popularity it deserves. I'd rate it one of the better films I've seen in the genre."

The script is well written with clever comedic moments and it's full of realistic dialogue. In short, I enjoyed every moment. Definitely a film worth watching even for those who do not watch Formula 1 or is at all familiar with the sport (like myself)."

The previous auto racing movies like Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights and Driven just don't capture the feel of what it's really like to be a professional auto driver. Part of it is probably since it's based on a true story and not a fictional story with overally sappy or comedic moments that are totally unbelievable in comparison. The race scenes are very intense and totally captures your imagination.\n\nI like Chris Hemsworth in the Thor role but he was way more to sink into as an actor in this role. Daniel Bruhl is great also as the other lead character, both should get serious Academy Award consideration."

My impression, however, is that there is surely some integral material that just didn't make the final cut (for whatever reasons). The most striking thought I had at the conclusion of this film is that it is almost entirely devoid of any character development. These characters are there, they're racing fools, and that's apparently enough motivation for all of the story's players. The story never really penetrates any real emotional depth. And that's okay, I don't want to complain because the movie is not the one I wanted to see nor is it the one I would have made. The lack of sympathy I had for the characters, however, kept me too disconnected from the Rush experience to recommend it with any fervor."

Their relationship is compelling viewer as they push each other forward to achieve their individual dreams at great personal sacrifice. Both Hemwsworth and Bruhl are outstanding in their individual roles. The footage and camera-work are compelling and the depiction of the 70s era will make you feel like you belong there. This is a movie that both men and women will enjoy (albeit for a very different reasons) and, despite the fact that I detest car racing, it will go down as one of my most favourite films of all time."

I thought; give it a try. I like F1 and car racing, but a movie should have contents and that was indeed my doubt about \"Rush\". This is NOT a \"Fast and Furious\" movie, either a \"15 minutes\" movie ( Robert de Niro ). This is NOT just a movie about F1 and looking at the laps the cars make. The F1, although present in the movie, is not the main subject. It is the rivalry between 2 pilots, Niki Lauda and James Hunt, which started from the moment they met through 1976, the year of the F1 accident. Their different ways of living, their work and social life. 2 completely different characters put on the screen by Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth. Both not that well known, but they both make a great role, they work fantastic good. It was not a moment boring, it was a pleasure to see Daniel and Chris doing their job and they do it very good !!! Niki Lauda is Austrian and German speaking. Daniel Bruhl talks English with a German accent and parts of the movie is originally spoken en German. This means that it is highly advisable to see this movie in original version and not dubbed.\n\nSo, it is really a different movie of the other \"racing movies\". We have special effects, we have a bit racing, but moreover : This is a movie about 2 pilots, their life, their target, their professional attitude. And the movie is nice to see for everyone, I think children of +12 included."

        "review_detailed_main": "RUSH\n\nI have been wanting to watch this movie ever since I saw the trailer. I missed it in the cinema, but now it has been released on DVD.\n\nThe movie is about a rivalry between two Formula One drivers. This rivalry wasn't like other rivalries... these guys really took it to the edge. They disliked each other as well as wanted to beat each other... but they respected each other.\n\nThe movie was very good. I am a big Formula One fan and have been for many years. I am not old enough to remember the Niki Lauda/James Hunt rivalry, but I have heard of it and seen video clips. Niki and James are both legends in their sport and will remain that way forever. Niki is still a presence at the track these days as he works as a consultant for the Mercedes team and can be seen at almost every race.\n\nThe action in the movie was very good and the racing scenes were very well put together. Ron Howard really is good at making a great action film.\n\nThe film stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both actors did a fantastic job and it is amazing how much Chris and Daniel actually look like James and Niki. It really is the perfect casting.\n\nThere are some scenes in the film that were a bit awkward to watch. When Niki had his accident he went through a really harsh time through his treatment. Some of which was really horrible to watch. Niki went through as really hard timer, yet he still got back in the car the same year to finish the season. That man is crazy! I have so much respect for him. He was very determined and focused for his passion.\n\nNiki was not a very likable person. He took his career very seriously and he didn't care who he had to walk over to get what he wanted. He didn't have many friends and he didn't care. He wanted to be world champion and that was all he focused on. Weirdly though, I really liked him. He was very blunt and said what he thought no matter who got upset. I like honesty in people and that is a very good thing in Nikis favour. James on the other hand was the complete opposite. He was a playboy. He liked women, drink and drugs. He was sometimes deemed dangerous in the car, but he had a talent and was very good at what he did. There were times through the film where I didn't really like James. I thought his attitude sucked and he wasn't a very nice man at times. In the end though I felt sorry for him. His life went off the rails a little bit and I thought he maybe deserved a little bit more help than he got from the people around him.\n\nAccording to Niki this film is very close to the truth, which is a very good to know. I hate the fact that most true stories are full of untrue parts.\n\nI don't really have anything bad to say about this film. You will enjoy this film if you do not like F1, but you will enjoy it more if you do. I don't think it is Rons best film, but it is up there with the best of his career.\n\nI will give this film 8 out of 10.\n\n\"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.\"\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not very keen on Formula 1, so the news of a biopic about the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt didn't strike a nerve. When the trailer for the movie appeared, I was even less eager to watch the actual movie since the trailer wasn't particularly good. Eventually, I did see Rush in a full theater on a Saturday night, and absolutely no one in the audience talked throughout the movie. It seemed that everyone, myself included, was amazed by the movie and enthralled by the story. Rush turned out for me to be one of this year's biggest surprise and, for now, one of the best movies of the year.\n\nRush follows two very different Formula 1 drivers. One is the charming British partyboy/playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and the other is the determined Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). As the voice over \u2013 from Lauda's point of view \u2013 early in the movie says, he's most famously known for two things \u2013 the first being his rivalry with James Hunt and the second being his nearly fatal accident in which his face got severely burned. The movie gives us a little backstory about those men, about their backgrounds, personas and family life, and then spends the remaining time depicting the events that happened in the 1976 Formula 1 season.\n\nThe best thing about Rush is that it doesn't have any major flaws \u2013 it's just a very good movie, as simple as that. Rush is a two men show: Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl make this movie, no other actors or characters other than them are really important to the story. The casting of Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl in their respective roles was genius, not only because they look like their real life counterparts, but they feel very natural in their roles and portray their characters with ease. Of course, one may argue that their roles weren't extremely difficult to play, but they do it so believably and smoothly that I think at least one of them may get an Academy Award nomination \u2013 if not even both of them. I do hope that this movie introduces Br\u00fchl to the mainstream audience some more, since he is a talented actor and it would be great to see him in more mainstream movies.\n\nAs for the plot of the movie movie itself, I was somewhat suspicious \u2013 can a rivalry between two sports figures be fascinating enough for a two-hour-long movie? Fortunately, I was once again taken by surprise. The story depicted in the movie was rather dramatic, inspiring and engaging \u2013 it was intriguing to watch two completely different men approach the same dangerous topic (or should I say problem?) of formula racing. So, yes, there is more than enough drama to fill the length of a two-hour movie. Interestingly, the only thing that's lacking in this sport biopic are the scenes of actual sport \u2013 there aren't much racing scenes. Those scenes are used selectively and to push drama forward, never to replace the actual drama. And when they were in the movie, you could see they were magnificently shot, with the just right amount of shaky cam. I would expect nothing less than technical perfection from an experienced director like Ron Howard. The soundtrack in the movie was also good \u2013 most of it was composed by the great Hans Zimmer. All in all, Rush is a truly excellent movie about an entertaining story and it features brilliant people who know how to do their job."

That two hour running time goes by in a blink of an eye and it's never boring or padded out with any long winded drama moments. I truly enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie was a little different in terms of story than I expected, because the promotional posters all have the Hunt character displayed prominently on them so I naturally assumed it was a tale mainly about him. This wasn't the case however, as I would say the film is actually more about Lauda than James Hunt. Both men are shown warts and all, and neither is put forward to be seen as better than the other. A fine feat really, and very well directed to deliver this position.\n\nI would certainly watch this movie again, and the film finishes leaving the viewer respecting both men for their achievements but with a tinge of sadness for James Hunt who seemed to burn out like a flare way too early in his life. Yes Rush is a rush indeed."

I like when I remember an actor from a role he played (ex. Thor) does something the opposite, something that you wouldn't expect at first. He acts like he lived through the seventies, he acts perfectly.\n\nOn the other hand this other guy Daniel Br\u00fchl managed to act as the complete opposite of Chris.\n\nIf this crew ever decides to make another F1 title, I'll wait eagerly to watch it.

You have mister hotshot himself points leader and ladies man playboy type the English man James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth). And aside from the hard life of drinking and partying and going to bed with beautiful women left and right he wins race after race around the globe all of a sudden James has a challenge and that's in the form of new driver the serious Austrian Niki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl in a great performance). These two rivals are different like daylight and dark their personal styles go like for one Niki is cool and calm and quiet and pretty boy James is never at a loss for attention. Yet the subplots of personal styles take a backdrop to the thrilling scenes of the heart pounding races the two have against each other on international tracks. This film really did a good job with it's recreation of telling the 1970's world of formula one racing which had a rivalry that not many people knew about. \"Rush\" is a film of personal connection and friendship proving that life is close and always a race on the track no matter what lap you finish in."

This work will definitely be counted in his scale on the positive side.\n\nChris Hemsworth's mean swing from Thor continues as the playboy-loose cannon James Hunt who finds himself the perfect foe in the always perfect-self centered-high on himself Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl).\n\nThe lead pair brings out all sorts of emotions, from the adrenaline pumping race to the heart melting hospital episode to the power of recovery. Everything has been scripted and played to the point of perfection. Bruhl's accent deserves special appreciation.\n\nWith a script that rolls both on and off the track exploring the love life which is affected by the rivalry on the race, this is definitely a front-runner for the Oscars next year.\n\nA must watch for all petrol Heads."

I was going to see it when it was released in theaters, but couldn't, which was a bummer.\n\nHowever, when I did get round to it, it made for one hell of a picture. I purposely didn't read up about the actual events that happened, because I wanted to go in without expectations. Well, I read an article on it in GQ, but that was a while ago, so whatever. I think it helped.\n\nThis really is a brilliant movie. The way it's all done was pretty much flawless. The intensity of the racing and drama really made you feel invested, as did the brilliant performances by all the cast. Hemsworth and Bruhl portray such a dynamic yet intriguing relationship, that when it comes to the races, you just can't decide who you want to win, but you want to see where this rivalry goes. It was good to see Stephen Mangan take a prominent supporting role, too. I've only see him in 'Episodes' and follow him on Twitter, so I hope the other stuff he's done is like this.\n\nThe style and direction also make this film so impressive. There are times when the camera literally doesn't stop moving, whether it be during a race scene or straight-forward dialogue scene, and you don't even notice it. It like you're on a constant ride. There are films where directors choose unconventional shots just to add diversity or for the sake of it, but not this one. Howard knew what he was doing. Kudos to you, man.\n\nIf I'm honest, it didn't blow my socks off, but I just can't flaw it. As far as biopics and dramas go, this is one of 2013's finest."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush is a biopic drama based on the real-life rivalry between the famous Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season. First and foremost, I'm not a Formula 1 fan as I find the sport uninteresting and I don't know much about the sport itself.But, I find myself drawn into this film.\n\nDifferent than many typical racing sports film found out there, Rush actually shows the clash between two distinctive, contrasting personalities, the passion that brought them into the sport and fears that come with it. James Hunt is a highly sociable British playboy who loves to live life dangerously close to death, have the willingness to do whatever it takes to win, a seemingly typical F1 driver. On the other hand, Niki Lauda is an eccentric, methodical, disciplined, and seemingly unsociable perfectionist, constantly assessing the odds and potential risks and outcome of things.\n\nWatching these two characters constantly pushing their limits to be the world's best racer and what drives them to win truly makes this a very engaging, entertaining, interesting drama to watch.With a great character-driven script by Peter Morgan, brilliant direction by Ron Howard, good acting performances by the two leads to provide impressive character depth and gripping, intense score composed by Han Zimmer (again), the film successfully showed both personas, allowing the audience to draw out the differences between these two men, in terms of personal values and beliefs and how they eventually develop mutual respect for the other by the end of the film.\n\nTechnically speaking, it seems like Lauda is the better driver as he knows the specifics, modification, requirements of a Formula 1 car compared to James, but James' bold and determined personality also shows that he's a good driver who certainly deserves respect.The racing scenes in the film was intense and beautifully filmed. The injuries sustained by Lauda during the Nurburging crash in 1976 looks about the same in real-life. It's definitely a compelling drama worth watching, not to be missed.\n\nRating: 8.5/10 \"When I saw it the first time I was impressed. There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively.\" -Niki Lauda (Carjam TV Interview, September, 2013) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/10/movie-review-rush.html"

        "review_detailed_main": "So, here's the thing, I'm a bit of a movie brat. If the film isn't rated at least a 7+ here, I'm probably not wasting my time on it. There are of course exceptions to that rule, a Luc Beson action film, Asian gangster films with Donnie Yen, anything with Liam Neesom and so forth. But for the most part, I'm very picky.\n\nI finally had a chance to watch Ron Howard's Rush. I'm actually watching it right now. I actually had to stop watching to the movie because I just needed to rate it RIGHT NOW. Maybe I should see a doctor about that...\n\nIrregardless(Puff Puff Pass reference), Seeing an 8+ rating, I already expected it to be a good. I would have to decide for myself if it was great, and I certainly didn't expect it to be near flawless. As a director, Ron Howard has a way of not only capturing the detailed reality of events whether real (Apollo 13) or fictional (Ransom) but to also show deep character development through dramatic events and vivid cinematography. Rush fits into all of those perfectly.\n\nFor any car/racing enthusiasts, this is as clear and realistic as a movie will get for some time, non of these fake Fast & Furious physics. For action buffs, the racing scenes rival the heart pumping fury of any Action film (maybe with the exception of The Raid, because that was craaazy!)\n\nFor fans of detail and story, the movie seems accurate (as quick as I can wiki stuff) and well sculpted. Using something grand like F1 racing as a blanket, Howard shows the many true events and outcomes close-up that changed the lives of both drivers while the world watched them race from a distance.\n\nOK, so I waited to finish the film before giving my final rating, and without giving any details away, I would say nothing I wrote above has changed. This is on par with any directors masterpiece. I would not rate this an absolute 10, but it is certainly well over a 9, and given that IMDb does not use decimals, and given the fact that you can clearly see the effort put into this film, I will round up to 10.\n\nCheers.\n\nTig in SF"

Perhaps true to form of the real James Hunt, world champion and a damn handsome man. However the true star of this film was undeniably Br\u00fchl, in my opinion.

Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl is a man with discipline, schedule and rules in his life and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt is wild, beasty and man with no freaking rule in his life. This rivalry doesn't have a single man coming out as a dominant winner instead there are ups and downs as far as this screenplay with fictional changes is concerned. From reality it is pretty much different of course for the sake of cinematic liberty but it still has some unnecessary dramatic portions in it. The use of adultery was completely rubbish because it took away all the dignity of Hunt's character causing majority of people losing excitement from one of the only two main characters of this film. Second mistake is skipping lots of important racing events and putting love and melodrama in those spaces. I don't see why Hunt's wife has to be shown in the climax scene when she was already done with him. Now the plus points, first is the pacing of the film, second is Entertaining quotient, third is Daniel Bruhl's amazing Performance and fourth is Ron Howard's convincing direction. In 2 hours Rush doesn't look boring at all but then it looked like in very much rush in last 15 minutes. Actually that portion needed more explanation and screenspace to have high end climax but unfortunately it goes away quickly like a blink. Overall, Rush is an impressive film and definitely a recommendable stuff but with few countable lapsus.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Hemsworth was carrying 50lbs of muscle in his upcoming role for Troy (a few months later) it was if they dragged a blonde bodybuilder onto the set to play Hunt.\n\nThe movie itself wasn't awful but it reminded me of a formula one adaptation of the fast and furious. Insert cheesy quote here, followed by a gear change here and finally a cut shot to the engine. Got it? Brilliant!\n\nIf you're a fan of formula one or realistic portrayals of historical characters give this movie a skip. If your a mindless idiot who likes the fast and furious, grab some cheetos and prepare to be entertained."

It's a study in the rivalry of polar opposites, hyper competitiveness, 70's excess and winning above everything.\n\nThere are few movies that have so many elements working well together. Sure there are a few reviewers who are self-described Formula 1 \"aficionados\" that lament the racing scenes. Not sure why; I found them riveting. But whatever.\n\nI'm more interested in Niki Lauda's views-\n\n\"This story was very accurately depicted....I wish James Hunt could have seen Rush because he would have enjoyed it.\"\n\nA true story told....truly. What a concept. Enjoy the ride. It's intoxicating."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one for me was the most awaited films of 2013. An F1 fan for more than a decade, the movie lived up to what the trailers had built up.\n\nHats off to Ron Howard and Peter Morgan (writer) to write and make a film about F1. F1 as a sport I believe has never captured the eye on Hollywood and that's a pity considering a fact that its a very popular sport worldwide.\n\nThe story set in 1970s when as James Hunt (played by a brilliant Chris Hemsworth) tells Olivia Wilde's character that a F1 car is a coffin on wheels. F1 today is a far safer sport than what was it in the 70s. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda was at its peak. They both came from similar backgrounds of rich parents who wanted them to choose normal career paths. They objected. But where Hunt was a playboy and risk taking driver, Lauda was a risk calculating restrained driver.\n\nBut the best part of the story is how they drew inspiration from each other to beat each other. Even the women with their small roles inspire the men to become better drivers.\n\nThe performances are brilliant. Both Bruhl and Hemsworth shine especially Hemsworth who is sad and lonely from inside in spite of all the attention around him. I would seriously urge the producers of the Bond Franchise to seriously look at Hemsworth to replace Craig in the future. And finally, the icing on the cake is the brilliant cinematography.\n\nI took a friend along who doesn't watch F1 and questioned me why do the drivers take such risks at the beginning. By the time the film ended, he understood the madness in the sport.\n\nRush is for F1 fans but a must watch to all those people who think its a stupid sport !! Hope like my friend they understand F1 at the end !!"

That is one thing - among others - that this film does remarkably well. You become truly invested in these characters and their ambitions and their rivalry.\n\nChris hemsworth gave an incredible performance and managed to break free off his role as Thor in this movie. Making me really believe he was James Hunt. However, Daniel Br\u00fchl really stole the show here with, in my opinion, an Oscar worthy performance. He got into the frame of mind of this real person and blew me away with his performance.\n\nAnother note to add is that I'm not a formula 1 fan at all. You don't need to be to watch this film because the rivalry may be in racing but that isn't whats important. Its the rivalry and the character development done so well by everyone taking part in this film.\n\nThis film glued my eyes to the screen throughout and there really wasn't a dull second. This is master performance from Chris Hemsworth and especially from Daniel Br\u00fchl and i would highly recommend this film is you haven't already seen it."

After all, this movie is based on real events which makes the movie even more interesting. I knew that of course because when I was a child Niki Lauda was a total superstar here in Germany. The rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt is a legendary tale of competitiveness and recklessness. Very action-packed and insightful. Daniel Br\u00fchl's and Chris Hemsworth's performances were really strong by the way."

It shows how two rivals need each other to push themselves, which keeps you interested throughout.\n\nThor or sorry Chris hemsworth puts in his best performance yet portraying, from what i have heard, James hunt excellently. Arrogance, wittiness, respect and determination described this performance, making Chris my new favorite actor.\n\nDaniel Brul was excellent, no more be said.\n\nAll in all, best movie of the year by far."

Apart from gangster flicks and war-dramas, high octane action sequences are not the norm for bio-pics. This one kicks up your adrenaline from frame one. Those race sequences are just amazing and lifelike and dialogs are sharp and succinct. Cinematography puts you in the driver seat and Bruhl as Lauda and Hemsworth as Hunt are chalk and cheese. Hemsworth's roguish, play boyish, devil may care attitude provides the perfect antithesis to Bruhl's composed, demure persona. Ron Howard has pulled all the right strings to make this movie an epic, just as the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. This is a must watch for any F1 fan.\n\nP.s:- I almost forgot Coimbatore is the hometown of the only F1 driver to represent India and that's whom we(me and Nithin Pbv) exactly ran into. Watching a movie on Formula 1 with Narain Karthikeyan himself is just the icing on the cake. Now beat that :P"

He has directed some great movies like a Beautiful Mind, Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, the Missing, Cinderella Man and one of my top 10 movies of all time Apollo 13.\n\nGreat story with great acting to back it up, especially the 2 leads. Chris Hemsworth in my eyes is shaping up to be a fine actor. He deserves to go far. I still remember him as Kim from Summer Bay and then as George Kirk in Star Trek.\n\nLoved, loved, loved the camera work. Flipping around showing multiple shots of the inner workings of the car and an inside look from the driver's seat and what's ahead of them. Great use of slow motion sequences and a terrific sound track. Some cool songs from the 70s. The intense rivalry and gradual feelings of respect these two men had for each other was entertaining to watch with each race building up to a satisfying conclusion. Of course I had heard of Niki Lauders near fatal accident and I knew how it all turned out, but I didn't care. It was just that much fun to watch.\n\nI will defiantly give this movie multiple viewings over the years. And will absolutely recommend this movie."

It's a curious and unanswerable question when one is to ask why Rush was so overlooked, but it's also not hard to see why the film was perhaps just merely forgotten about.\n\nRush is a film that from a production stand point would be graded in the highest order yet there is an element amiss in the film that stops it from being an emotional movie, a movie that transcends whatever scene it is set in and gets viewers to appreciate it on a whole different wave length. The sound editing, visual effects, stunts and Anthony Dod Mantle's at times ground breaking and stunning cinematography (after this effort and his work on films such as 127 Hours and Dredd 3D Mantle is quickly establishing himself as one of the best in the DOP game) in Rush are without question A grade efforts but Howard has somehow miss\u2013stepped when concentrating on the lives of these two different and amazingly driven men.\n\nIn one of his first lead roles outside of the Marvel universe Hemsworth as playboy James Hunt is a solid presence in the film but one can't help but feel it's pretty much Thor in a fast car and therefore not much of a stretch of his acting ability. Daniel Bruhl as the much more stoic and professional of the two racers Niki Lauda does a fine job of portraying a man that at times is extremely hard to care for and that's where the film becomes an enjoyable one not a classic. These two true life men lead undeniably interesting lives and the focus of the events in the film are at times edge of your set moments but to transcend a film to another level (and get those Oscar nominations) you need to have people that no matter how vile or arrogant they get they still draw your feelings out, and James and Niki sadly just don't have that.\n\nA never dull and visually impressive piece of movie entertainment Rush is another fine entry into the increasingly broad film catalogue of director Ron Howard who is one of the most consistent and interesting directors working today. Rush is also a film that could have been so much more but as it stands is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable night in with a movie, just don't expect to be thinking about it in the days following.\n\n3 and a half lung cleanouts out of 5\n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out -\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

It is like watching art.\n\nThe feelings, the hate, the fear and the urge to win, you could really feel it. And the music by Hans Zimmer, WOW! I was sitting in my seat with a big fat smile on my face when they started the cars on the Formel 1 track. I looked at my buddies beside me, they all smiled and just enjoyed it! We are a gang of old friends, we have all been driving on the track our self on N\u00fcrburgring. This movie was a journey. I would recommend everybody to go and watch this. I felt like it was over after 40 minutes. Finally a movie that gives you more than the trailer promise. Well worth the money and the time. I will also be owning this on Blu-Ray."

        "review_detailed_main": "RUSH (2013) A wonderful film about the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and their rise through the formula 1 motor racing circuit of the early 70s finalising in Lauda's near fatal crash and Hunt's title winning season of 1976. The principal story line is the contrasting personalities of Hunt and Lauda. One cold and clinical the other spontaneous and a showman, this applies to both on and off the track.\n\nLauda's crash is horrendous and is recreated painfully, likewise his recovery also. Hunt's hedonistic lifestyle is beautifully recreated in all its tabloid glory.\n\nGrowing up in the 70s so many of the racing drivers are still so fresh in my memory, the Fittapaldi's and the Schecters and that wonderful John Player Special car. I must have liked Grand Prix racing at some point. It is very tense, the actor who plays Lauda looks more like Lauda then he does himself.\n\nTo show how much Grand Prix racing was part of British culture and presumably on TV a lot at the time, a boy at school was bullied something rotten by being called Niki Lauda (and this was before the accident) I guess he must have rodent type features!\n\nUltimately the films has a sad endin, due to Hunt's early death and not from racing but his lifestyle like a lot of sporting stars of their day tarnishing their legend. A big plus point is the 70s glamour and the plethora of woman that chase the stars, a bit like premier league footballers it is so easy to loose focus when temptation is so easily available. A tense but cliched 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard(A Beautiful Mind) provides us a movie which is so engaging in which you wouldn't think about who-is-winning rather what-next-is-going-to- happen? Rush is a movie where your heart starts pumping each and every second the participants start racing.You move your head left and right not because you are driving but the races are so engaging, you just cannot stop yourself to do that. James Hunt,a playboy who loses his contract to the sponsors after losing the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP and then begs to MACLAREN(the only car which could beat Ferrari then) to give him a chance so that he could beat Niki Lauda. Niki Lauda who is more of a realistic kind of a guy is a businessman from Austria who has rejected to take forward his father's empire just because he only knew about F1 then and wanted to do something big.\n\nYes, the world knows them (James Hunt and Niki Lauda) as biggest rivals but as Niki Lauda once says \"He(James Hunt) was one of the few whom I liked. The only person I envied.\" This movie is not all about racing, It's about the life of two professionals who on the outside are opponents but deep down they care for each other. They respect each other.This is a movie where even if you are not a Formula One fan you'd love it because it has elements. Elements that make a movie thrilling,heart pumping and keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nChris Hemsworth(Thor) steals the show as a playboy and a racer but its Daniel Bruhl(Inglorious Basterds) who is the real show stellar in Rush. It's his Austrian accent and I-know-everything-about-cars attitude which makes him pleasing to the eyes. He is just excellent in the sequences where he suffers in the hospital after his accident.\n\nAdd to that Hans Zimmer(The Dark Knight,Inception,POTC) is there for the Background Score which just sets the mood exceptionally well and Anthony Dod Mantle(DoP) is also there without whom this movie wouldn't have made that impact as those camera angles and movemet did.\n\nRUSH which totally engaging and an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Rush to the nearest theater to watch this beauty."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush (2013) -\n\nAt the beginning of this film, as Niki Lauda narrates over the top of the scenes, it had a feel of 'Oceans 11' (2001) about it and there was something similar in the style and the set ups used later as well, so I expected it to be slick and clever.\n\nAs someone that has always tried to avoid watching motorsports, I had very little knowledge of James Hunt. I wasn't even around in the 1970's so I probably couldn't have picked him, or Lauda, from a line up, but as with a lot of Chris Hemsworth films that I've watched lately, I haven't seen much diversity from him and wasn't keen on his British 'Thor' (2011) impression. As much as he annoys me now though, I still don't understand why anyone would leave Chris (Hunt) for Richard Burton, especially with that non CGI'd butt, which was very cute.\n\nJames Bruhl (Lauda) was alright too, but also very much like his Marvel character, Baron Zemo.\n\nI personally preferred 'Le Mans '66' (2019), because there was too much machismo in this one. Their testosterone was almost flying across the screen. 'LM66' also seemed to be better acted and directed too, although this film did have a cracking supporting cast of actors. They didn't feel appropriately used however and because a lot of them were comedians from the small screen, there was an air of humour about the whole thing.\n\nThis one didn't grip me as much either. I'm not sure I felt the tension and I wasn't really behind either of the lead characters to win any of their races. Neither personality was shown favourably.\n\nAt least I wanted Christian Bale to do well as Ken Miles in 'LM66', despite his brusque character and his reputed off screen demeanour.\n\nThere were also some medical moments that I really didn't need to see. Anyone with squeamish tendencies would do well to avoid this one.\n\nAs a racing film, I'm sure that this would appeal to those that follow the sport and perhaps those that remember the events portrayed in particular and while it was all delivered well enough, it just didn't have that extra element that would have made it special for me. As a middle of the road biopic, the story didn't really have enough interest on its own. Maybe if I'd seen this film before 'LM66' I might have preferred it, but I don't think so. Perhaps it just didn't deliver the drama effectively enough for my tastes?\n\n606.02/1000."

The film, which promised thrilling races and gripping drama, instead offers viewers flat characters and a predictable plot.\n\nThe film's plot suffers from a lack of originality and depth.

Instead of delving into the emotional inner battles and aspirations of the characters, the viewer only gets a superficial understanding of their motivations.\n\nEven in the racing scenes, there's a lack of tension and adrenaline. The director failed to create an atmosphere of real danger and tension on the track. Instead, the races seem like a dull collection of shots devoid of dynamics and energy.\n\nThe acting also leaves much to be desired. While both main roles are performed competently, the characters remain flat and uninteresting. The lack of chemistry between the actors deprives the film of the necessary emotional depth.\n\nOverall, \"Rush\" is a missed opportunity. The film fails to satisfy in terms of character, plot, and leaves the viewer with a feeling of disappointment and wasted time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Howard, the master of biographical picture maker. As I know of him, he never failed to transform biographical stories into a movie. In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.\n\nThe races from the movie were shot awesomely with the old automobile models and sets around. It was a perfect direction utilizing this inspiring true story with two great actors. It won't only tells about races but also the inexplicable friendship between them, which is hard to predict as we are not they. As per my observation I did not detect any flaws, especially races were exceptionally shot, totally top- notch. From the fast pace story narration due to the fine editing to background score and visual effects, we must recognize the A1 quality of the production house.\n\nThis movie portrays about the 1976 Formula 1 season where two new comer drivers from Europe, James Hunt and Niki Lauda are considered the top rivalries to grab the world championship title. So their's stunning entry from lower class race to the big event, the clash between them were exhibited very well. Two equally great drivers with different mantras in their life as well implement in the race track was just mind blowing. The story was told from the perspective of both of them where narration frequently switches.\n\nInitially I was not favour to give it a shot. The reason behind it was the Chris Hemsworth, I am not a big fan of his performance. Most of his movies are commercially feel good kind ones so I was a bit hesitated to put my faith in this. And a couple of Ron Howard's last movies as well not like I expected but was just good. This movie completely reformed these two guys and redefined their's capability once again. Regretting for not saw it earlier, but feels good that I did not miss it after all. A highly recommended movie, which was one of the best sports movie from 2013 along with '42'.\n\n9.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.\"\n\nRon Howard is back on full gear after a couple of setbacks with The Dilemma and Angels and Demons. Rush is one of his best movies and he really does the title justice because you actually feel the rush of Formula 1 driving in this film. This is a great sports biopic that follows a lot of the well known sports clich\u00e9s, but it works nonetheless thanks to a superb story and some great characters. The difference with the sports formula here is that there is no clear villain as both characters are strong rivals who despite their differences are still likable and sympathetic. They are very different in their approach to racing, but the film doesn't seem to take sides or try to tell us which driver we have to cheer for. Howard's film is intense and exhilarating, one you will enjoy even if you're not a Formula 1 fan. If you have never heard of the real life rivalry during the 70's between drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt then you are in for a thrilling ride here because the story is really gripping and powerful. If you are familiar with the story it is still enjoyable because the racing scenes are gripping with some insane camera angles and some great editing while the two lead performances are strong. This is the second time that Academy Award nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan, collaborates with Ron Howard after Frost/Nixon, and once again they succeed in delivering a powerful biopic. This isn't Morgan's first screenplay related to sports either as he also wrote the script for The Damned United, one of my favorite sport movies of all time. These two should continue to work together because Rush is exciting and thrilling regardless whether or not you like Formula 1 racing.\n\nRon Howard takes us back to the 70's to relive the classic rivalry between two successful Formula 1 drivers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is a British playboy who is passionate about driving and will do what it takes to win each race without considering the risks, while Lauda is a meticulous, extremely disciplined and calculating cold blooded Austrian driver. Despite their opposite personalities, they both have one thing in common: winning. Their rivalry began during the early 70's when they were both facing each other in lower divisions, and it escalated when they both reached Formula 1. The climatic moment takes place during the 1976 championship where a series of spectacular events unfold including a near fatal accident by Lauda and a nail biting season finish. The risks were high in this high speed sport where the safety conditions we have today didn't exist then. The film however doesn't just focus on their rivalry on the tracks, it also follows their personal lives off the track giving the characters more depth. We get a glimpse into Hunt's reckless marriage with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), and Lauda's relationship with Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The rivalry between these two men may just be the extra push they need to become better drivers, but it can also lead to taking more risks in a deadly sport.\n\nRush was a pleasant surprise because it wasn't just another sport movie about two bitter rivals; it actually was a film about two rivals who brought the best out of each other and that is what made this biopic so much more interesting. It's that fierce competition between two talented drivers in a fast paced film that leaves you with a sense of rush and raises your pulse. Howard also does a great job at recreating the 70's and delivering some exciting racing scenes. Hemsworth proves he is more than muscles and Bruhl is just as exciting on screen. I wasn't surprised by Bruhl's performance because he had one small scene in Inglourious Basterds that really blew me away, but I really hadn't discovered this side of Chris Hemsworth who proved he has a career after Thor. Rush is such a dynamic and fun viewing experience, one you won't want to miss. The difference between these two lead characters and the way they play off each other is what ultimately drives this film to succeed. I can't think of any other racing movie that worked better than Rush, and I still haven't mentioned how exciting that final race scene played out in the rain with the slow-motion camera. It was breathtaking, give Rush a chance."

The visuals make you feel you are actually racing. You care about these characters through their all dilemmas and triumphs. I am exhausted after seeing it. And I have seen it 7 times. Go to U-Tube and look over videos which are 1 hour long regarding the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt. View the entire length and marvel at the authenticity of this movie; and notice how closely the real people resemble the actors in this movie.\n\nTake a date to this movie. How it is that anyone could criticize it in any technical or dramatic fashion is beyond me. Every scene is finely crafted. I am a professional photographer and I admire the direction and choices the screenwriter and director have made. Sure, there are those that want more racing track time, but this is a deeper story about friendship and rivalry. You must see it in your lifetime."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the theatrical trailer, it appears that Ron Howard's first directorial project since 2011 will appeal only to sports and Formula One fans. It is a pleasant surprise when this proves entirely untrue. Rush follows the intertwining on-track careers and personal lives of James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) - one a carefree playboy with great natural talent, the other a brilliant tactician willing to work his way to the top - throughout the 1970s, culminating in their battle for the 1976 world championship. The compelling narrative, centering on the drivers' clashing personalities and progression from bitter rivals to mutual admiration, would be an enthralling tale even without the dangerous thrills of Formula One.\n\nThe supporting cast all deliver strong performances (Lara is especially stunning as Lauda's ever-supportive wife), but the film belongs to Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl; thankfully their dynamic performances prove more than worthy of carrying the film. Hemsworth's Hunt wins the heart of racing sponsors, several ladies, and the audience through embodying the British superstar's wild ways, witty self-deprecation, and exuberant confidence. However, he keeps his portrayal from devolving into caricature by imbuing Hunt with a sense of loneliness underlying his charisma, perhaps an emotion he attempts to fill with the track's life-or-death thrills. Br\u00fchl, who met with Lauda several times to prepare for the role, effectively changes his accent and mannerisms to become the endlessly determined, brusque-to-the-point-of- offensive Austrian. Anyone familiar with the 1976 championship will know that Lauda's career takes a terrifying turn; Br\u00fchl keeps every ounce of characteristic blunt stubbornness whilst giving viewers glimpses of (understandable) mental distress. His nuanced performance may well be awards-worthy.\n\nWhile some of Howard's recent projects have not lived up to the greatness of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, and Frost/Nixon, Rush is arguably of their higher calibre. Howard's eye for cinematography and framing shots is particularly striking, notably in the harrowing hospital sequences and exquisite melding of archival footage at the end. He is aided by Peter Morgan's smart screenplay and Hans Zimmer's effective score; the former keeps the plot's pace moving briskly whilst the latter evokes both the excitement of 1970s Formula One and its lethal undercurrent.\n\nRush's greatest achievement is arguably its ability to make two deeply flawed protagonists incredibly sympathetic, involving viewers in their fierce competition and often equally tormented personal struggles. While the film centers around the ultimate contest, it is hard to take sides whilst wishing for both drivers to succeed."

Each character responds differently as they grapple with the peril of doing what they love. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but the true story of Niki Lauda and James Hunt, told with Howard's powerful realism and grit, was incredibly captivating. The racing scenes are beautifully filmed and framed with compelling character-driven storytelling. Be wanted, the R-rating results in some nudity and sex scenes, but if you are willing to fast forward or skip ahead, the rest of the film is worth it. I mean, Thor vs. Baron Zemo in race cars?

The movie basically chronicles the two racers lives right from when they were just petty F3 racers to when they competed together in the 1976 Grand Prix.\n\nThis movie is absolutely flawless. If I had to pick one flaw then, it would be the fact that James Hunt vomited before each race. I didn't see the point of doing that. The way Ron Howard, the director, has shot the races is surreal & otherworldly. You feel like you're racing at the track. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right till the end. I liked the fact that even though Hunt & Lauda were rivals on the track, they had immense respect for each other off it. The viewer has no idea as to who is going to win the Grand Prix. Hunt or Lauda. However, both characters are equally likable. So, it didn't bother me as to who's going to win, in the end. Chris Hemsworth is charming & suave as James Hunt. However, the highlight of the film is Daniel Bruhl. His performance as Niki Lauda is mind blowing. Bruhl had a tougher role to play & he absolutely nailed it. Olivia Wilde is great as Suzy Miller. Alexandra Maria Lara is brilliant as Marlene Lauda. Pierfrancesco Favino is impressive as Clay Regazzoni. The supporting characters are effective as well. Rush is a must watch. Go for it as soon as possible."

His work here is almost a shock whereas Daniel Bruhl as the Niki Lauda -- Hunt's deadly serious rival --gives the breakout performance of the year.\n\nI am not a racing fan at all but I love action. Ron Howard & his amazing team put you inside a Formula 1 race car as effectively as Alphonse Cuaron & company put you in space in \"Gravity\". The race scenes are far & away the best ever put on film & that's only half the movie.\n\nThe scenes off the race track are as equally effective due to the contrasts between Lauda & Hunt. Peter Morgan's screenplay gives you a deep understanding of these two rivals. They're intense competitors who have a grudging respect for each other despite their polar opposite personalities. I liked each of them for entirely different reasons. Hemsworth & Bruhl do a great job at capturing their charms & quirks.\n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous throughout. The editing never lets up while never beating you up.\n\nRon Howard has done great work in the past.

Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth are just about THE perfect cast they could have ever chosen to portray the two main characters in the movie.\n\nThe racing sequences keep you at the very edge of your seats. The sound of burning tires and the commentator's cries of \" Niki Lauda in the lead...and James Hunt gets in front...oh and again it's Lauda..\" are sure to get your adrenaline pumped up throughout the movie.\n\nThis year witnessed some truly memorable movies but in my opinion the movie of the year has to be RUSH. A truly must watch for racing and non racing fans alike\n\nP.S : I was not an F1 fan, but I just had to give this a 10/10 rating :)"

Ron Howard did an amazing job making sure there was just enough Formula 1 racing, sights and sounds mixed with fantastic cinematography and a storyline to keep everyone entertained. The action, the drama, the plot, the whole thing was well put together. This is a must see movie. Daniel Bruhl was an almost exact match of Niki Lauda. So exact, it was scary. And of course there Chris Hemsworth playing the flamboyant James Hunt. Well casted. I've been waiting for this movie to premier for almost two years. It was worth the wait. Can't wait to go see it again this Friday and will definitely buy it on Blu Ray."

        "review_detailed_main": "I rarely eulogise about big \u2013budget cinema nor do I exalt the virtues hyped-up films with big marketing budgets, I find them all too often under-cooked. Rush is certainly the exception to the rule.\n\nThe characters are fully formed, the plot is purposefully driven and the script is nicely punctuated with recurring humour and clearly developed acts that move the story forwards while retaining a sense of it's self.\n\nIf you don't know the story already, then you're in for a treat. If you do; then you've the opportunity to get the full visceral fly-on-the-wall experience of what was happening behind-the-scenes (artistic licence seems to be within a fair margin of error).\n\nRon Howard seems to flit between the sublime and the ridiculous, with Rush most definitely being the former rather than the latter.\n\nThe casting of Hemmsworth as Hunt was always going to cause ructions, but to my taste he manages to effortlessly embody everything about the racing \"superstar\"; from the 70s swagger to the clipped speech pattern Hemmsworth delivers a memorable and driven performance.\n\nThe real star of the show however is neither Howard or Hemmsworth, but the excellent Daniel Bruhl as Austrian racing legend Nikki Lauder. Having been an admirer of talents for a while, it was only a matter of time before the promise shown in Goodbye Lenin, the Edukators, Inglorious B's etc led to leading roles in major international productions. His performance in Rush is as measured as it is passionate and (admittedly helped by the story) it's Bruhl who comes out with the most credit.\n\nWith an admirable lack of profanity Ron Howard and counter-parts have skilfully delivered the best racing movie in many a long year.\n\nRush is a film made with enough craft to draw you in and entertain you, and far more than enough guile to keep you intrigued long after the credits have rolled."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush is a very well-made film about F1 racing that is not to be missed for any F1 fans and also highly recommended for everyone.\n\nThe film is based on a true story of the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruehl) and the famous near-fatal accident in 1976. It accurately depicts F1 racing in those days which was packed with thrills. Not just focusing on the race battle, it also captures the characters' details and presents their different ways of thinking interestingly.\n\nDaniel Bruehl is always my favorite, and this time he has done a great job playing Niki Lauda. The way he speaks (with accent), the way he acts, really resembles that Lauda I'd seen on German TV. He portrays the character really well that I hope he will get nominated for Oscar in Best Supporting Actor.\n\nOther than Bruehl, the film is also awesome in sound and cinematography. I loved the engine revving sound as well as the way they made the film in the 70's look, just like we were watching the real racing scenes.\n\nAt the end of the exciting racing scenes, the film shows us how the friendship comes out of the rivalry. How they have a true respect for each other, although they were battling to death in races. Fortunately, F1 safety nowadays has improved tremendously from that time, and Senna remains the last driver to die in race."

Above all, I loved Alexandra Maria Lara's character who has very few scenes in the movie, but that was well enough to mark a lasting impression in my heart. This movie shows how one's perspectives drives them to success or failure in their life. This is one of the few movies where one cannot simply take sides because there is no hero or villain in this movie; Just experience it on your own."

It really was amazing and I must admit I had a few tears but that was properly because I am just a big girl. Lol. I seriously recommend this film, its enjoyable for everyone. I think the fact it is based on a true story also makes it more interesting and I think that is partly why I enjoyed it so much, it is very factual to what really happened and the story of James and Niki's friendship is also really nicely executed. Peter Morgan did an amazing job writing the screenplay and I think Ron Howard did a great job directing the film and he executed it very well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the true story of one F1's greatest rivalries - between thrill-seeking British playboy James Hunt and the fiercely dedicated Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda - Ron Howard's latest is, as the title suggests, a cinematic adrenaline rush. We get a quick and dirty intro into both drivers before we're thrown headfirst into their respective F1 careers, and specifically, the 1976 season that saw their on-track feud boil down to the final event in Japan, where heavy rain and treacherous road conditions provided a dangerous finale. Howard barely stops for a breath in the two hours of Rush; whether it's the edge-of-your-seat races or the turbulent personal lives of our competitive duo on screen, the movie never stalls or bores. One of Hollywood's newest A-list members, Chris Hemsworth, proves he can do more than hunky action roles with a wonderful and surprisingly subtle portrayal of Hunt, however it is, without a shadow of a doubt, Bruhl who really impresses. The underrated German actor imbues his Lauda with multiple layers and a slippery charisma in a spectacular performance that, with any justice, will garner him attention come awards season. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score are expectedly first-rate, however a special mention must go out to the sound design team who have constructed a thundering and immersive aural experience that positions you squarely in the high-risk, high-octane environment whilst sending vibrations through your chest and getting your heart pumping at a million miles an hour. Don't steer away if you know nothing of the subject, this movie is accessible to anybody who loves their sporting biopics or great motion pictures in general."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Men love women. But more than that, men love Cars\".\n\nHear, Hear! Absolutely! Studies say men think about sex every 3 minutes. Hmm, but no doubts about the 2 minute gap. That's reserved for machines. Curves of metal, humming engines and the adrenaline.\n\nThis week at the movies, Ron Howard's 'Rush' pays tribute to the Man- Machine relationship and it doesn't get more intimate than this.\n\nRush is inspired by real life rivalry between Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Them ruled the tracks in the 70's and it was their riff that kept them ahead.\n\nThe film boasts of well written and performed characters. Hunt is a partying brat, a womanizer who believes in enjoying the life to the fullest. Niki Lauda on the other hand is a complete contrast. He's disciplined, knows his tech inside out and being the son of a businessman, knows the economics of the trade. One's a British and the other a German, even the accents are different. The only thing common between the two is the passion to drive, and unconditional love towards their machines.\n\nIts a simple story of these drivers trying to beat each other with their rivalry acting as the main catalyst. Look out for their interesting verbal conflicts for lighter moments.\n\nNow for the hero of the film. Cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle takes us to places where no one has ever been. Close ups of axle joints, acceleration pedals, exhausts of the engine breathing fire and screeching tires as the cars move at the speed of 170 mph are breathtaking. Especially the starting of the last race in Tokyo where the tracks are wet after rain, the first skid of the tires are shown in slow motion throwing water droplets away from its periphery. I mentioned intimacy, didn't I? All he does is use his experience of handling primitive digital cameras right from the days of Dogme95.\n\nNever has being seated in a cinema hall been so thrilling. Don't forget to put your seat belts on, you are in for a ride."

The visual effects were dynamic and the color Palette was beautiful. Cinematographer Anthony Dod shots were really engaging, especially those tight shots where both drivers drove close to the line of death. Great stuff.

Rush is not a racing movie but is still able to convey the feeling of Formula 1 and what it is about and what it means to its fans as good as the emotions and the personalities behind the characters, sugar coating nothing and showing them as real people not as characters in a movie.\n\nBr\u00fchl managed to transform into a second Niki Lauda, really getting the gestures and the voice and even the accent to match up with the real Niki Lauda.\n\nA must see for every motor sport fan and deserving a definite 10/10!"

I hadn't seen the trailer, I only knew that it was a film about F1 drivers, but I didn't know anything about the drivers or F1. From the first minutes of the film I was hooked. It's simply amazing.\n\nThe director, Ron Howard, tells this story with a nonlinear narrative, which gives the audience (or at least me) more of an excitement for the characters, I wanted to know what caused the rivalry between these two men. The cinematography is superb in my opinion. The setting is magnificent, the cars, the locations. He does a great job representing the era, shows its ups and downs.\n\nAs much as Ron Howard deserves a pat on the shoulder for the movie, the ones who made me feel sympathetic and excitement was the performance from the strong leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Chris Hemsworth showed his impeccable talent and passion for acting, with the strong performance of James Hunt, nominations should be lining up for him. Daniel Bruhl also gave a strong performance of Niki Lauda, a unsociable rat (as said in the film).\n\nYou don't have to be a great F1 fan to favor this film, as it isn't only a film about cars, but human nature, hatred, and love. The whole film is magnificent, the beginning, middle and ending. It's thrilling car scenes and magnificent directing and acting give the film such emotion and excitement that you feel as if only half an hour has past when the film finishes.\n\nA must watch film!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering the unfortunately many poorly executed attempts at making racing inspired movies, my expectations of 'Rush' weren't all too high when I pressed the 'Play'-button on my DVD-player's remote control.\n\nI'm not familiar with Ron Howard's oeuvre, and with Chris Hemsworth being the only name on the cast that actually rang any bells, expectations from that side weren't very high either. I'm not saying that Hemsworth is a bad actor, but the movies I've seen him play in, weren't exactly my cup of tea.\n\nHowever, only a few minutes after the opening credits things started feeling right, very right. The movie, which tells the story of the legendary rivalry between F1 half-gods James Hunt and Niki Lauda, lends itself perfectly for a highly entertaining and interesting movie. Everything that Rush is. In terms of historical correctness there are a few things that aren't 100% correct, but these are minor and very few in numbers, but after all, this is a movie, not a documentary.\n\nThe scenery is excellent, and features a very high attention to detail, especially concerning the race tracks and their respective environments. Also the cars used in the movie are spot on in terms of historical correctness, as well is the information concerning the actual races that took place back then. The director makes great use of historical footage from back then, such as television and radio broadcasts.\n\nThe acting performances are superb, with special credit to both Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl, but also Alexandra Maria Lara gives stunning performance, especially when it comes to the emotional expressions that are probably spot on in terms of how a spouse of an actual race driver feels when he once again risks life and limb in pursuit of victory. The other actors and actresses showed great professionalism as well, and helped carry the movie to it's high quality status.\n\nAlso the camera work is excellent. Nothing overly fancy or exaggerated bling bling, as I initially feared would be the case. On the contrary even, the director makes use of fairly standard filming techniques, but all catch the spirit of the movie, the characters and the actual races spot on. About the races : they are truly excellent, and brought to image in a way respectful to the day and age they took place in. The intensity of the duels is transmitted towards the viewer without the loss of even a single drop of sweat of the drivers faces. If I would have any complaint at all about the racing scenes in the movie then it is that there are too few of them, but then again, that's probably just the racing enthusiast and car nut inside of me that's speaking. For the movie itself the mix between high-action driving scenes and the more dramatic ones is near perfect, they support the depiction of the actual plot, which is the rivalry between two highly talented and competitive men in just the right amount.\n\nFor those that aren't into cars or motor sports and that think this movie is nothing for them because of it's racing theme, don't fool yourselves. This is a great movie about the drama of two men in pursuit of their ultimate personal goal, and the effect this has on their respective surroundings. But it is also an excellent movie about mutual respect, braveness and chivalry as well as it is a respectful tribute to one of the most legendary pages in F1 history.\n\nMy expectations were quite low before I started watching this movie, but they very quickly turned out to be totally mistaken. This is a truly great movie, and very well worth two hours of your life. Apart from that, as a car enthusiast, I am truly pleased to finally see a movie again that honors the love people like us have for these machines and the sport of racing them. It clearly shows that this movie was made by people who share this love and respect.\n\nWatch it, I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\n9/10"

And I must say that despite never having watched a F1 race, I found this movie extremely entertaining! After walking out of the cinema I immediately went and bought every F1 racing game I could and become obsessed with F1, researching drivers, cars and tracks, that is what this movie did to me. Bruhl and Hemsworth looked near identical to their real life counterparts and their mannerisms resemble the duo perfectly. Ron Howard rarely disappoints and this movie is no exception. Ron presents both of these larger than life men and gave them an equal playing field. You will undoubtedly find yourself rooting for one or the other throughout, supporting their every move, then somehow have your opinion switched. The race scenes are shot incredibly and deeply immerse you in the race to the point where you almost feel every turn, giving you a taste of the real danger racers put themselves in every time they put on the helmet."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush-I am sure this is one of the most anticipated movie of the year for so many like me.Yes,I was expecting this movie when I heard about the movie plot.\n\nNow coming to the movie,this movie is about the legendary rival between the greats of F1 racing,Nikki Lauda,the Austrian and James Hunt,the English.Their rivalry was well celebrated by the medias of 70's.their rivalry was very special.This movie peeps into the actual relation between the great drivers ever produced in F1 racing due to their extremes in character.Both Lauda and James were from the top families in their respective countries.But both of them were not provided help by their families to realize their biggest dream-to be the world champion of the speed.So they came into the arena by their own terms..In terms of character,Lauda was professional,a sharp automobile engineer and a man who cared about personal relations.He always calculated what he was going to achieve through his deeds.He even said that he could afford a 20 % risk in terms of risk he could afford in racing circuits.He loved a woman and married her lately and always wanted to be her.In short,Lauda made his decisions on behalf of his brains.But James Hunt on the other side was extremely different.He was a playboy to describe him in short.He had women all over his life.He enjoyed his life.He enjoyed his success and was desperate in his loses.He always cared for him.thus,even his married life was a nightmare.James Hunt was a man who followed his heart rather than brains.\n\nTheir rivalry started during their F3 circuit when a dangerous move from Hunt made Lauda be on the losing side.This continued to the F1 circuit where Lauda became the world champion in the first year.this made James Hunt angry and decided to win the next season.But that season was followed up by winnings for Lauda at start.Can James Hunt bounce back and realize his dream?Sorry.this is not the rest of the story.The story is much more deep than we think.Rather than their rivalry they had a strong bond between them which was known only to them.They might be enemies.But they couldn't afford anyone between them.Thus it was a celebrated rivalry that medias brought to us.But the movie speaks more of their personal relations.Even when one had a bad time,the other felt bad on that and they tried to compliment each other in their own way.There was no much element of surprise in this movie if we watch the movie after reading what had happened.But the way the actors enacted it,it was amazing at least for me.\n\nNow with the crew,with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (Goodbye Lenin) as Nikki Lauda,the characters were in right hands.Nothing to speak about the ace director Ron Howard(A beautiful Mind,Cinderella man,Da Vinci Code etc) to be the captain of the ship with Hans Zimmer's music was the anchorman.The crew was amazing .This movie didn't give me a single minute of boredom while watching.Watch the movie full.Hope many of you like it.Since,this movie was up to my hopes,I rate it as a 9/10!!\n\nmore reviews www.movieholicviews.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all can I say that I'm not a massive fan of formula 1. The good thing about Fast is that you really don't need to know much about he sport to enjoy it. The film is all about the rivalry between two men that are both talented, but with totally different personalities. In the case of Rush the two men in question are James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their rivalry is similar too many others in formula one history. It is the classic battle between the racer who lives on the edge and the driver who accumulates points by not taking risks to ensure finishing in every race. The personalities of Hunt and Lauda reflect their driving styles. Their rivalry is bitter and personal and the film focuses on the world championship in the 1976 season.\n\nThe film is gripping and emotional. It is edge of the seats stuff. I for one wouldn't be surprised to see a few nominations in the awards season."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I have to accept that I am not an F1 fan. So I am completely ignorant about the history of this sports and the famous rivalries associated. What I liked about \"Rush\" was the movie can convey its subject to those who doesn't really need to be F1 fans. The film is about the famous rivalry between 2 F1 stars, James Hunt & Nicki Lauda. Now more than their achievements on the track, it was about how their rivalry commenced and what may be the factors that led to the rivalry.\n\nRon Howard is quite aware about the subject he was going to handle and the possibilities to become a stereotyped sports drama comprising of phoenix rise, great fall etc etc, if not handled smartly. As mentioned earlier, I have no idea about the rivalry so whatever I understood is what I got from the movie. Ron and writer Peter Morgan initial conveys their background (both hailing from wealthy families with different ambitions) and the cultural differences. Also we can see how their attitude towards their life results in their positives and negatives and how the outcome plays during some of the important points of their life. The common feature in both the characters is the extreme self confidence.A balancing act was well performed by Ron and his writer Peter and thus kept the audience away from an absolute clich\u00e9d sports drama. I will not claim that the movie was flawless but chances are rare for you to get disengaged from the experience due to boredom. This is the strength of the presentation by Ron Howard and it is simply terrific by the fact that its a real life rivalry. Also he didn't opt for a docu-fiction style and used possible cinematic liberties without affecting the realism of the subject. Now there is a particular scene where Hunt punches a journalist which I found a bit \"filmy\". I cannot confirm whether it happened in reality (since the character sketch of James make it possible) but currently I like to see it as one of the cinematic liberties. After all its based on an \"incredible\" real life story as credited. A major highlight of the movie along with the performances from the lead cast are the well choreographed pulsating F1 races especially the German Grand Prix & Japanese Grand Prix. Some brilliant dialogues between James & Nicki towards the end conveyed the rivalry with a silent mutual respect between them.\n\nI may not have seen many of Chri Hemworth's performances but from what I saw, I rate this as Chris's best performance till date. He literally lived as James Hunt. But the actor who got a more meatier character, more one-liners and overshadowed Chris at places was Daniel Br\u00fchl as Niki Lauda. Alexandra Maria Lara (as Marlene Knaus) portrayed the role of Nicki's supportive wife while Olivia Wilde portrayed Suzy Miller (James's wife).\n\nBut the biggest highlight is the score of Hans Zimmer. I just have no words to describe that score and I am sure those who watched this experience will surely notice the score. Anthony Dod Mantle's used a color tone to suit 70s and he along with Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing delivered a terrific job with the race sequences. Just like the F1 races, the movie moves at a breakneck pace. The make up and costume department justified their presence by providing the 70s look to all the characters while the production designing team came up with a similar effort by providing us the feel of 70s.\n\nOverall, the movie was a terrific experience as if you are in an F1 race. This will surely engage you even if you are not an F1 fan or follower with its theme and the emotions associated with it."

I did not know of this story which surprises me, although I was only 11 when this was happening, I knew of the hero's of golf, tennis, and many race drivers, not your main stream sports, but never heard of these guys. I'm really surprised. This is Ron Howard at his best. Chris Hemsworth does a fantastic job as James Hunt. I hardly can believe he is the same actor that plays Thor. Since I knew nothing of the real men, I purposely avoided looking up details so watching the movie was very suspenseful. Worth your time and then some. Daniel Br\u00fchl also does an amazing job as Niki Lauda. You have to give it to these guys. Great job."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I think about who this film would target for its audience I think of males who like watching Formula 1. But I am a girl who now and then watched F1 with her dad and isn't amazingly interested in it and know very little of the history of F1. I never knew who Lauda and Hunt were. Yet here I find myself, blown away and feeling this is one of the best films of the year.\n\nThis film was so exciting to watch, it was if you were there in the crowd, in the driving seat, in the pits. The pace was incredible and perfectly timed. The cinematography was beautiful, enhancing the thrill of the race. In the Japanese race I literally was holding my breath till the end, it was like watching the race live, incredible feeling watching it. Editing was fantastic, directing was fantastic. Whole thing was fantastic.\n\nActing wise, for me, Hemsworth's best film to date. He was fantastic in this. He captured, what appeared to me as a conflicted driver who was like a horse chomping at the bit, ready to fly forward at tremendous speeds. In films such as Thor he is restricted, Thor doesn't really express much emotion, much personality (love Thor 1&2 btw, not criticising the film or Thor as a character). But as James Hunt he came into his own, a masterpiece of acting. In regards to Bruhl, phenomenal too. Brilliantly captured Lauda's reserved personality, the way he's strict with himself and his limits, but hold his passion for the race and the car. Together they managed to make the bond between the two racers exciting and you felt like you were there with them, feeling their emotions towards one another. Especially when Lauda came back from hospital.\n\nOne thing I think they could have done with this film is added a bit more original footage, especially in the racing scenes. Would have been fantastic to have seen some of it integrated with the crisp film work. I did like the ending, seeing the original film, but more would have been very welcome.\n\nLast point, WHY THE HELL HAS THIS NOT BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN Oscar, MORE GOLDEN GLOBES AND MORE AWARDS?! This is a damn fantastic film which I feel has been very underrated in its coverage. Plan to see this? Then what are you waiting for, it's bloody amazing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a truly surprising film which ended up one of the best ones of the decade. The film greatly juxtaposes 2 different views of heroism and keeps the viewer guessing which main character has it right only to leave the final decision open to interpretation. The viewer is left to think about his preferences and life goals and the results of the decisions leading to those endpoints. There are very few movies that actually accomplish this kind of depth and self-reflecting. On the surface you have truly great cinematography about automotive sports in their glory days when tobacco advertising was permitted and athletes were relatable. This movie is a true gem and it's rating suffers only because it's set in non- relatable non-American setting."

        "review_title": "Do You Feel That Rush?!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Wow, I never knew I'd be so engrossed in a film about racecars. The main reason behind that compliment is because the film delves into so much more than the sport itself, and that's essentially what makes a great sports movie and is why most of them basically suck, in my opinion. Rush, like Moneyball before it, fully concentrates on the drive (no pun intended) and soul behind the individuals who choose to take on such risky endeavors or sports in general. The picture overwhelmingly benefits from excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl especially. Whereas James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) plays the stereotypical jock (ladies man, bad boy), Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) starts out as more of an underdog, at least, in terms of his social life. As he witnesses the environment James proudly surrounds himself with, that jealousy and bitterness can be clearly sighted in Niki's eyes. Thus, he gets down and dirty from the business side of things, and this leads to a momentous, highly personal rivalry where both persistently overpower the other with their own set of methods. As a result, the audience witnesses pure complexity and depth within these two characters with their own special backstories and circumstances; the film wisely takes the time to build each character's traits and personality up in order to create a much more satisfying ultimate showdown- the one element that always heightens the tension and popularity of a rivalry in sports: one where the opponents have fully- developed personas and distinctive characteristics.\n\nWhat only follows is the classic and brutal form of competition as the two racers threateningly eye each other before engaging in their next intense race. On this note, I just want to immensely praise the race sequences throughout the film, perfectly capturing the sheer adrenaline and danger of the lives these daredevils settle for. As the menacingly enormous tires of those cars loudly speed right by the camera, you immediately know you're in for the thrill of your life, meaning if you never receive the opportunity to experience such an event, this film will surely suffice. It is undoubtedly touching when the participants of these races suit up and equip those sizable helmets while knowing full well that their lives hang in the balance and their lives would mean nothing without raising the stakes.\n\nWith that, the spectacular sound design considerably services these scenes with the thunderous rev of that engine and the sound of the aggressive pouring rain. Few sports movies (racing ones specifically) are able to pull off this downright level of excitement for the moviegoers are all invited to experience and participate in an incredibly immersive ride (again, no pun intended). As the adventurers race for the finish line, stoic and epically dramatic music (by the consistently-brilliant Hans Zimmer) kicks in, and as your eardrums sense the pleasure of the violins and percussion's presence, you look on to an equally grandiose occasion. Rush terrifically balances character development and characterization with these more exhilarating and athletically passionate sections. In fact, the pace is amazing since it never even felt like two hours had passed me by. You're glued to the screen from beginning to end, and there's not one segment that feels unnecessary or uneventful, and I'd go so far as to say that it's one of the best paced films of the last few years.\n\nIn addition, the cinematography of the film is utterly breathtaking and beautiful, showcasing various weather conditions with the motivation of winning continuing and a display of power and vulnerability all at once as the characters resume their imposing nature. Last but not least, it's a gripping and powerful story, fueled by exceptional writing, in which two men commence a rivalry that would go on to involve numerous predicaments. I immediately identified with Niki (though ruthless in his rude behavior at first) as the underdog who feels defenseless but will go through whatever unconventional path it takes to furiously destroy his foe (who's a good man- don't be mistaken for a second- which avoids the clich\u00e9s that usually infest sports movies).\n\nWith that said, since the film was a sports movie at the end of the day, it still happened to lightly follow that similar structure most sports films incorporate, which creates a tad bit of predictability with its execution. Another element I just couldn't tolerate was the portrayal of the film's female characters. I did not find any of them likable at all. Most of them only \"hooked up\" with the protagonists because of their fame and money, and it wouldn't be a detriment to the film if it was intentional but it seemingly wasn't. For instance, Olivia Wilde is befuddled when she learns that James Hunt isn't that big of a deal. \"Oh, you mean I'm not going to be sleeping with the biggest racecar star I thought he was?!\" They were repulsive- however, Niki's \"soul mate\" was a lot more tolerable even though the relationship didn't begin at the highest of notes. In sum, Rush is now absolutely on my list for Best Picture nominees. Damn, since the fall's start, that's been three fantastic films in a row (Don Jon, Prisoners, and Rush). This season will be quite competitive indeed."

Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, racing rivals in the '70s were both phenomenal. In most pictures, with two leading characters, there will usually be one everyone likes and one they don't. Not in this film. Both are captivating and likable. Amazing talent in this picture. Even those viewers not totally into auto racing will enjoy this one because in addition to spectacular racing history and scenes, this one has a great story. I've got to admit there were a few agonizing moments where I was unable to watch, but I wouldn't have been able to tear myself away from this movie until the end for anything. This one is a winner!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This based upon a true story\n\nWe go back to the 1970s and see an intense rivalry between two Formula One (F1) racers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is an aggressive driver likes the spotlight, is a womanizer, and puts his life on the line in every race. Lauda is the more conservative driver, calculating, plays the percentages, shuns the spotlight.\n\nRivalries. We like them and if two that we like are at the top of the profession we want them to be friends. Were Hunt and Lauda friends? Jack and Arnie are friends, Roy and Gene were friends, and Chrissy and Martina are friends. Connors and McEnroe respect each other but are not friends\u0085.. yet. In this movie we don't know who to root for. We tend to side with Hunt, until we see Lauda and Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) picked up on the highway by extreme fans of Lauda. These scenes are pure gold. Now we like Hunt and Lauda equally. See?\n\nThis movie centers on the 1976 race for the Formula 1 Championship. Hunt wins, Lauda wins and Lauda has the edge in points. In the final race,in Japan under severe rainy conditions, for the Championship Lauda retires (this word is used when a driver leaves the race for reasons under his control) from the race and it is up to Hunt to come in at least in 3rd place to claim the championship from Lauda who is ahead on points. Will he do it?\n\nThe acting and dialogues are spot on and one would think that Hunt and Lauda disliked each other, but we see glimpses of friendship too. Their views on how to race are like night and day and neither one will change.\n\nThe racing shots are fantastic with superb editing and heart-pounding music. This is a very exciting racing movie and you cannot take your eyes away. However, this is also a study in personalities and who will win out? Hunt? Lauda? Anyone? No one?\n\nI am not a fan of F1 racing, but I am a fan of movies that show F1 racing like this one. Kudos to Director, Ron Howard, who did a fantastic and amazing job.\n\nAnd, now the answer: yes, Hunt and Lauda were friends, not real close but each wanted something the other had. In their early racing years they roomed together for about a year (Hey, I looked it up on Wikipedia). After Hunt dies at age 45 of a heart attack, Lauda says at the end of the movie that Hunt was the only one he envied. Lauda currently works for Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team.\n\nBoth James Hunt and Niki Lauda are in the F1 Hall of Fame (I looked that up too). (9/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: Yes mostly in the beginning. Nudity: Yes, briefly in the beginning. Language: Yes, at times."

I was worried at first that this would be another typical macho sport-racing film, but I am glad that I was proved wrong, the story of the rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda had my eyes glued to the screen.\n\nTo me, the movie is perfect all around, some might complain of the pace, but to me I didn't see it as a problem. This film is directed by the amazing Ron Howard, and this will go down as one of his best films right up there with Apollo 13 and Beautiful Mind. With him on the journey is Anthony Dod Mantle who gives the film beautiful visuals with the perfect light, Peter Morgan gives us grade A writing, and Hans Zimmer gives us a masterful yet subtle score that comes in at all the right moments.\n\nThe acting is nothing to complain about either, Chris Hemsworth gives us a character that we can both love and loathe, Daniel Bruhl gives the best performance as the tragic Nikki Lauda who is also the narrator of the film, he also gives us a performance that is both likable and unlikable. The scenes with his wife were amazingly well acted which leads me to the supporting female characters, the wives of Lauda and Hunt played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara. Both are beautiful eye candy and both add their talents amazingly to the film.\n\nWatch out for this to be a favorite around awards season, it has the capability to be nominated in a handful of categories (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor for Daniel Bruhl, Cinematography, Score, Editing, and Sound Categories). The Academy has always loved Ron Howard and I feel that they will nominate this amazing film, and in my opinion it deserves every nomination, it is that good!\n\nMy grade for Rush: A"

I was stationed in Germany 8 years during my military career, stationed in the Eifel and Sembach, and got hooked on F1 racing and going to Spa, N\u00fcrburgring, Hockenheimring, and then the Le Mans Endurance race a couple years. I'm still hooked but have now added the sports car series, prototypes and a couple others - not roundy rounds.\n\nI was at the track when the Lauda crash occurred. The films coverage of this event following the crash were a little short but pretty close to what I recall.\n\nAs soon as this comes out on DVD, I'll own a copy. I've seen all the greats, Le Mans, Driven, Grand Prix and numerous others.\n\nRon Howard and his crew smashed this one out of the park.\n\nI can't recommend this great film highly enough."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I'll just say I'm not a huge F1 guy. I very rarely watch it and when I do it's solely because there is nothing better on. I had only heard of Niki Lauda in passing without paying that much attention to it but this film really blew me away.\n\nThe film centres around the two rivals Niki Lauda and James Hunt through the 1970s as they both became famous and known for their intense rivalry for the world championship. This is not usually my type of film, I like suspense thrillers usually involving crime or mystery of some kind. However, the story in this is done so well and you can't help but become engrossed in the lives of the characters. I like the fact that no one is really painted as a bad guy in this film but I couldn't help siding with Lauda throughout most of the film, whereas a friend who saw it with me came down firmly on Hunt's side. I think praise must be given to the developers for this as they ensure that the viewer is always able to empathise with one of the two lead characters be it the fun loving playboy James Hunt or the calculating professional Niki Lauda. This ensures interest is sustained throughout.\n\nThe other characters are pretty much left on the sidelines but I never really noticed as the film is solely about the lives of Lauda and Hunt and how they influence each other. I do think the film ended rather abruptly but it certainly prompted me to research around the film a little and any film that can make me want to know more after it has finished must be good in my book.\n\nThe directing from Ron Howard was fast and exciting it really helped to create a tense atmosphere during the race scenes but unfortunately made some of the slower scenes feel a little rushed.\n\nOverall, it's hard for me to point out from a cold critical perspective what it is about the film which makes it so good, especially seeing as I have no real interest in the subject matter. However, Rush was a really good film and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good rivalry with fantastic characters which drive the story. You don't have to be a fan of racing as the race scenes only really seek to build up the tension and tend not to get technical. So sit back and enjoy the Rush you'll get from watching this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Excellent film, based on a true story about the rivalry between two Formula 1 drivers in the '70s. Clever way to get fast cars and things blowing up into a film without it being gratuitous. The two men call each other \"asshole,\" and they're both well justified, but as the film goes on and the excitement and stress builds, we see flashes of the good human sides of both and it's hard to decide who to root for more.\n\nIt's not often that I can sit through an entire film and be so involved at all times that I forget about time passing and never once want it to be over already, but this one achieved it. I'm not a racing fan, so I had very little background or context, but it all made perfect sense as it unrolled, and now I know a lot more about Formula 1 racing and World Championships.\n\nA couple of short scenes of injuries were hard to watch."

The period of 1966 to 1983 was the greatest period in the history of the sport and 1976 one of its best years. So I went into the theater with another formula 1 friend. Both of us expected to be pointing our inaccuracies throughout the movie. Instead we left the theater thinking this is a great film and a true tribute to Hunt and Lauda and formula 1 in the 1970s. Yes, there were a few inaccurate moments (Hunt and Lauda actually liked each, but its more fun to make them insult each other whenever they meet), but that did not detract from the overall excellence of the movie and the fabulous photography. I'm going to see this movie again. . . . and again. By the way, you don't have to be a racing enthusiast to enjoy it; its simply a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush features great acting, atmosphere and music, and I would say it could be a strong Oscar/BAFTA contender. It's among the best films I've seen for some time (among the few films that I have really enjoyed).\n\nThe film captures the atmosphere of the 1970s and things like the weather conditions on the track, really well, without resorting to gimmicks or 3D effects. It's a revelation to see how dangerous conditions on the track actually are if you are not that interested in car racing. It will also appeal to women (I'm one) as well as men, since the action on the race track and 'car speak' are not too dominant.\n\nThe performances by the two male leads are sterling, and it is a nice touch to see the real Hunt and Lauda towards the end of the film. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a broader range than just fantasy films, and Daniel Br\u00fchl is excellent as Lauda. The acting by the supporting cast is otherwise good throughout, but \u2013 rightly in my view \u2013 the film focuses on the two key personalities of Hunt and Lauda."

        "review_detailed_main": "Biographical sports drama Rush tracks the strictly competitive rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s.\n\nEven before you've arrived at the starting line, there may be understandable scepticism on whether Rush is really a race you wish to run with. However, like Moneyball (2011) before it, I was pleasantly surprised at how investing a story about a sport I know nothing about and care nothing for could be. Cars are useless without people to drive them. Rush is a vehicle painted with a core theme of the professional and personal consequences of fierce rivalry, between it two primary passengers. Formula One racing is just the fuel to push the vehicle to its eventual destination.\n\nIt is a story worth telling, both for those who were spectating during the 1970s, and for those like myself who are still taking driving lessons and didn't know the names Niki Lauda or James Hunt until this film existed. Behind Ron Howard's careful direction and sensitivity to the story, Rush invites its audience to witness the depth of competitiveness that Lauda and Hunt travelled through. Its expertly crafted pace, detail and tone complement the (f)actual events also, with Niki Lauda even expressing his positive reaction to the film's look and accuracy.\n\nDespite a 123 minute run, your legs feel motionless. Rush is a timeless tale in two senses: 1. Its great display of the triumphs and pitfalls that competitiveness can have are accessible and applicable throughout history, throughout the modern world, and probably will be throughout the future 2. The film is so engrossing that not once did I question how much time had passed nor how close we were to the end. Rush has enough continuous momentum to take us to the end of the journey without exhausting emissions, as we cruise through seamlessly to the finish line\n\nWith its fantastic editing and storytelling techniques to push the story along without making it feel, dare I say...Rushed, Rush masterfully places its two protagonists in lanes so far apart that only their egos are able to fill the empty space. Like Batman and The Joker, Hunt and Lauda are represented as polar opposites whom were almost destined to become competitors, as it is only their mutual rivalry that fuels their motivation to win. Without one competing with such passion, the other wouldn't have the passion to compete at all.\n\nThe story is only complemented further by the enthralling performances of Daniel Br\u00fchl (Lauda) and Chris Hemsworth (Hunt), in addition to Olivia Wilde's brief yet brilliant supporting role. Rush's arrival at the finish line is as smooth as the ride that Ron Howard takes us along throughout. Thrilling, investing, interesting and well-made flawlessness, is about all one could request of a biopic that centres around such sensitive source-material. Rush is exciting, frightening but most of all the right thing to catch up to in theatres as its release seems to be on its final laps around UK tracks, so rush to see it. Oh dear I wrote it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Thoroughly enjoyed \"Rush.\" Ron Howard creates an energetic, compelling, and highly detailed world, and populates it with equally vivid real-life characters. I'm a film and motorsports geek, but rarely do the film and motorsports worlds intersect to produce anything good. \"Rush\" is, happily, the exception to the rule.\n\nThe film avoids all the tired old \"racing movie\" pitfalls: the nearly-irresistible force dragging producers and directors toward the action movie genre, the romanticized homage to historical figures living and dead, the dumbed-down \"good guy vs. bad guy\" duel, ad nauseam. Instead, Howard knocks us back into our seats with an intimate, visceral impression of the the speed and danger of 1970s Formula One racing. He captures the essence of motorsport, that melding of the human will with the brute force of the machine, like no one else ever has. And he also shows the unavoidable, painful truth. That the technology of speed has always advanced more rapidly than the science of safety.\n\nSo Howard creates a nearly perfect movie universe for Rush. But that's only the director's 3rd most important task. The two most important tasks are hiring the right actors, then getting the best possible performances out of those actors. I think Hemsworth and Bruhl are excellent choices. The former has the charisma needed to portray Hunt, the latter the intensity needed to play Lauda. And Bruhl absolutely nails Lauda's accent.\n\nBut if there is a weakness to Howard's work in Rush, it is that he sometimes doesn't get maximum performances out of his actors. Occasionally, simply hiring the right actors is enough and much of the production just falls into place. Other times, the director needs to work his or her voodoo to get actors to cry, laugh, and achieve peak performance. Several of the film's scenes fell flat emotionally (especially the ski trip argument scene and subsequent restaurant scene.) They could have been big acting moments, they could have added more depth to the film, but it just didn't happen. It felt like Howard either told the actors to pull it back a little to keep the film \"lighter\" or simply didn't feel like expending a lot of energy shooting alternate takes.\n\nI doubt the lack of a big acting moment will have even the slightest effect on the film's box office, but it's just about the only thing preventing me from giving the film 10 stars. I enjoyed the film on many levels, and I think there's something for everyone to love about the film. And yes, I expect Rush to get a best picture Oscar nomination."

And it is. It is a battle of wits, a conflict of psychology, a juxtaposition of philosophies and a contradiction of professional ethics.\n\nChris Hemsworth, who himself has done a good job portraying James Hunt, may be the poster boy for the movie, but the movie undoubtedly belongs to Daniel Br\u00fchl.\n\nA stunning performance that deserves a standing applause, Br\u00fchl's portrayal of the eccentric sociopath, Niki Lauda is just outstanding. Never once, not in one scene, can you catch a glimpse of him falling out of character. It is an impeccable performance that definitely deserves a consideration at the Academy Awards.\n\nA must watch movie from 2013. A delightful saga of a legendary rivalry."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chris Hemsworth pulls in an immense and startling performance as the womanising \"party guy\" James Hunt. This is due to both the actors and characters changes and versatility during the film as he doesn't stay as this fun loving hot head but easily adapts to show a deeper and somewhat subtle version of the character. It is this sort of flexibility within the role that gives Hemsworth his edge and keeps you gripped to the screen during the intense scenes on and off the track.\n\nHemsworths performance is easily matched by that of Daniel Br\u00fchls as the rule abiding and overly serious Niki Lauda. Br\u00fchl performance may seem a bit dull compared to the liveliness of Hemsworths take on Hunt, but this just adds to the authenticity and the chemistry that occurs between these two polar opposites.\n\nDespite this film revolving around the rivalry between these two characters, it is the great chemistry during their conflicts that keep this going and this is realised at the end when Lauda states that Hunt \"is one of the few drivers he liked, and even fewer he respected\". Ron Howard has a great knack for taking a subject that may seem dull such as an interview (Frost/Nixon) and making it seem incredibly intriguing. This applies greatly to Rush as it is a real fast & furious film that pulls no stops in being daring or taking it slow round the corners.\n\nThis brings me to my really only criticism; it is very long winded. I say this in the same sense that a film like Django Unchained feels long, but still keeps you engaged and ready for anything the film throws at you. Rush is exactly like this as it does move slowly, but it doesn't matter as you are too intrigued in this startling story to bother about the time going by.\n\nVisually, this film is spectacular. By this I don't mean that there are startling graphics and visual effects, but the cinematography and directorial style is top notch. Ron Howard had for some reason decided to put a golden yellow haze over most of the film, which gives an authentic feel to the film similar to the likes of Frost/Nixon or Argo.\n\nIn the end Rush is an exhilarating thrill ride that keeps you enticed, even during the parts that seem slow. Visually the film is brilliant and there are stellar performance from both the lead and supporting actors and actresses."

        "review_detailed_main": "Audiences love to watch two sports people at the top of their game battling out man to man, do or die on the sports field or track. If the two combatants have gone past friendly rivalry to mortal enemies or each representing the others nemesis, then so much the better for TV ratings.\n\nFormula 1 (F1) in 1976, when do or die could be taken quite literally. Driver safety was a low priority, cars were raw, everyone was learning and there was still room for a hard drinking, eccentric, drug dabbling, womanising, playboy with talent to make his mark.\n\nEnter stage left, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) with an upper class English accent, skill to burn and a complete distaste for playing by the rules, working hard and respecting any form of authority.\n\nContrast this larger than life character with Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), an Austrian with an abrupt manner, almost no diplomatic skills and personifying everything Hunt was not.\n\nThe two rivals fight small time battles in Formula 3 before Lauda buys his way into the fledgling \"March\" team as the second driver. Promptly overseeing the rebuild of his car, Lauda's real skill lay in setting up the car to be faster and better before he even started the race.\n\nMeanwhile Hunt eventually stumbles into F1 under the \"Hesketh\" team, all champagne and aristocratic privilege, completely at odds with the more corporate F1 scene.\n\nThe pair race and the trackside enmity starts to build as the drivers jockey for position on and off the track, they eventually move to their respective premier race teams of Ferrari (Lauda) and McLaren (Hunt). The two drivers acting as polar opposites in their approach to their chosen vocation, lifestyles and attitudes.\n\nAs most viewers with a passing interest in Motorsport will know, there is a serious accident followed by an astonishing recovery and then a climactic 1976 world champion clinching race in Japan.\n\nDirector Ron Howard is a highly professional film maker and it shows here, the film is as meticulously tooled as the cars on display. The period setting is excellent, the on track speed is arguably the most exciting race footage ever shown. The sound and sensation of raw power waiting to be unleashed, the use of close ups and engine components, all add to perception of speed and nerve tingling raw danger. Tyres shimmying and scrabbling for grip on the tarmac on the start grid, drivers desperate to win or die trying.\n\nThe film is helped by a solid turn from Hemsworth, clearly having a blast portraying someone doing just that, having the time of his life. Bruhl gets the more difficult role and nails a portrayal that could have been unsympathetic in the wrong hands. The actor managing to find and show the intrinsic humanity and professionalism that lay below a rough, uncompromising exterior.\n\nHunt died in 1993 aged only 45 of a heart attack, ending a colourful, eccentric and unconventional life. In retrospect a world away from the current professional, in bed early, hit the gym and then eat well sportsmen and women, who tend to dominate the professional sports world. Out of place then and probably unemployable if transplanted to 2013.\n\nThere is little to fault here, however the female characters do not get much to do. Olivia Wilde as James Hunt's \"on a whim\" first wife Suzy Miller, married apparently to settle him down. That's a fail right there. Miller is all big hats and tantrums, presumably not realising that marrying a womanizing, hard drinking F1 driver might have some ups and downs. Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda, gets to look worried, long suffering and downcast but with not much else to work with.\n\nOverall as good as it gets, taking great subject matter, adding some touching scenes, state of the art (but not seen) effects and teasing out some great performances, what more could you want.\n\nSummary\n\nAccessible, sexy, dangerous and with lashings of 1970's glamour, there is much to enjoy with solid acting and superb racing sequences anyone can enjoy.\n\nExcellent, go watch it."

The two actors made the characters very believable and come to life just as one expected them. the pace was very gripping (pun intended!) and all of the supporting cast were excellent.

The two lead actors did their job perfectly, you can really see the time they invested to be perfect replicas of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. This is probably the most accurate movie inspired by real people, there is almost no Hollywood in this movie, and that is a good thing. I like that they didn't use only English, so you could hear actors speaking German and Italian. And a word about the music, Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job, his music fulfills the movie.

I could have given this 10/10 but only movie I have given 10/10 on IMDb was INCEPTION and I cannot give any other movie 10/10 cause I just like dicaprio .. and I might change the rating of RUSH to 10/10 if dicaprio will win an Oscar later ... :P ALTHOUGH this movie has nothing to do with dicaprio .. :D\n\nTHIS MOVIE touched me so badly and in this phase of ma life when I am desperate to catch motivational and inspirational examples of the people who devote themselves wholeheartedly to their careers and then comes the result which gets imprinted on the face of the world ! HANS ZIMMER made this movie experience very emotional and I almost cried :P NOTHING BEST THAN THIS MOVIE I HAVE WATCHED IN LAST THREE YEARS AT LEAST .. and undoubtedly one the best and classic movies in my life and what more than that its based on a true story of two formula one legends one of which is still alive. Either HANS ZIMMER (for OST) or Daniel Bruhl (Niki Lauda)SHOULD win an Oscar at least .. THE MOVIE ITSELF DESERVES a huge applaud and if this movie is not winning any sort of Oscar then I might stop watching movies ... cause then I will confirm that is a great unbalance in Oscar nominations and winnings .. since dicaprio has not won any Oscar so far as well ... bulll shhiiitt :P and yeah if this movie is still running in cinemas near you you better watch it cause its only meant for cinema experience the effects and music .. THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I WONT DOWNLOAD and will probably buy a ORIGINAL BLU RAY print from market for the first time in my life cause this one deserves it ! thats another thing that most of the torrents are blocked in UK anyways :P"

Also you can sense the decades from the vintage quality and colors. But most important you can feel the power of the cars as if you were right there on the race track and your heart literally stops a few times during the 120 minutes just to start beating fast again!! You'll end up understanding how this two amazing drivers gained each and everybody's respect and admiration both on each particular lifestyle! Very exciting, by far the best movie I've seen in a long time! Absolutely recommend to watch it especially if you're a F1 fan like me! You'll want to watch it again and again!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rush\" mini-review\n\n\"Rush\" is a compelling look into a relationship between two formula-one drivers, Austrian Niki Lauda and Britain James Hunt. At first blush, \"Rush\" appears to be like any other sports movie, this time about car racing. However, it's also about perseverance and about what's important in life beyond the race track.\n\nAnthony Dod Mantle's (28 Days Later, Slum Dog Millionaire) cinematography is top notch. During the movie, we see the cars from every angle, inside and out. The audience feels like they are part of the race. I will go on record right now giving Mantle the Oscar for best cinematography.\n\nNearly as spectacular is the sound in the film. We feel and hear the roar of the formula one cars without loosing a word of dialog. The complicated blend of multiple engines, pit crews speaking, fan reactions and other ambient noises as well as the sound track makes this a challenging mix. The sound mixing is also Oscar worthy as is perennial nominee Han Zimmer's sound track. Unlike some movie composers, most notably John Williams, Zimmer can go full bore, but he knows when to pull back and let the scenes play out in near silence.\n\nPoster boy Chris Hemsworth portrays playboy racer James Hunt like a pro, but it is Daniel Bruhl as the serious, workman-like Niki Lauda that truly shines in a more challenging roll.\n\nDirector Ron Howard, along with Peter Morgan's script, help us care about the flawed main characters. That is no simple accomplishment. The ending of the movie is bitter sweet as the real-life drivers play out their roles, the playboy and the technician, to the end.\n\nRating: Pay Full Price\n\nPeace, Tex Shelters"

I am glade to see Chris Hemsworth in a non superhero movie i almost forgot how good he is as an actor. Daniel Br\u00fchl nailed it as Nikki Louda he truly steals the show. the dynamic of the two actors is the core of the movie they have an amazing chemistry they are opposite in their methods, personality and skills but have a mutual respect to each other both want to be the best also and the racing scene are really good again i am not an F-1 fan but it seem they know what they are doing and it felt accurate to the actual race in short i was glade i got to watch it, it lived up to the hype"

While the movie \"only\" depicted the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, in real life they were good friends. Both characters, James and Niki, were developed very thoroughly throughout the story. From the beginning, James and Niki operate on opposite sides of the spectrum. James want to risk everything he lives for to get the thrill of winning and compete in the race, while Niki competes to preserve life and enjoy the smallest of things. The movie in all of its glory resulted in men whose views on life are totally different and radical compete for the win of the century."

The cinematography is one of the best I've seen in the past year. Even though I had very little expectations from Chris Hemsworth, I was expecting a bomb from Ron Howard. And he's absolutely delivered it. Rush will imply you towards the death defying sports for better. The movie will raise your adrenaline levels, please your eyes with its visuals and bound to captivate your moods with its amazing script; that too without a rush."

        "review_detailed_main": "The full personalities of F1 racing drivers were never really revealed back in the 1970s. It was all about the vicarious thrills of speeding of the cars, crashes, shunts and the chequered flag. We saw the drivers spraying large bottles of champagne around, but we did not get to care what they were really like or much about the technique of racing. So the full enormity of Nicki Lauda's quick recovery from his burns to getting back into the driver's seat did not get properly examined at the time. Ron Howard's film redresses this by revealing the brilliant mind of Lauda, his crises, his struggles and his professionalism. It also, of course, shows the swashbuckling bravado of James Hunt and the glamour he brought to F1. The only criticism I would make was the film's budget could have been used to better bring alive some of the exotic locations, such as the final 1976 race off next to Mount Fuji, which heavily relies on computer graphics."

Hunt and Lauda I knew a bit about and realised they are just as different as George Best and Mary Whitehouse. That's really the whole basis of the film... the human contrast and yet sneaky respect between the two players.\n\nHunt was the legend and Lauda a cold but excellent role model. By the end of the film you want to vote for Lauda but James Hunt played with charm and charisma by Chris Hemsworth inches across the line. Daniel Bruhl plays his part superbly. The racing is a bonus. Great direction from Ron Howard and almost a parable?"

        "review_detailed_main": "POSITIVES:\n\n1) Everything about the portrayal of the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is absolute gold dust to me. Hemsworth and Bruhl both give brilliant performances, the writing of both characters is extremely well done and I absolutely loved every interaction between the two 2) I think the racing scenes are truly some of the best ever put to film. You really feel like you are in the car with the drivers, especially when the film gives you first person perspective where you can actually see through the visors of the drivers; but even when it is in third person perspective it is still completely gripping 3) The film is a great technical achievement. The score, editing, cinematography, costume design etc etc are all superb, so credit needs to go to the whole crew that worked on this film\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n1) Because of the fact that the Hunt and Lauda rivalry is the focal point of the film and is done so well, I did think that basically every supporting character felt sidelined and one dimensional. We don't really any character depth from any character other than Hunt and Lauda, which is a bit of a shame, especially given the complete lack of any strong female representation 2) I'm not sure if this is just because I'm British myself, but I did feel like the writing of Hunt wasn't quite as three dimensional as that of Lauda. I think his character is portrayed very well when it comes to his attitude towards racing, being very hotheaded and risk taking which makes him the antithesis of Lauda's approach. However, his friends at Hesketh are all so painfully stereotypically British and I thought seeing him just constantly drinking, smoking and sleeping around got a bit repetitive."

Daniel Br\u00fchl did a very good role and he manged to makes us hates his character but at the end maybe loves him and feel proud of him. The Sounds are amazing and i mean all the sounds.. effects the mixing and surly the music score that only to know that Hans Zimmer is the composer behind it is enough to find it brilliant"

This movie is the Days Of Thunder of Formula One and the modern movie era.\n\nThe rivalry is there, the love, the tragedy, and most of all, the moving compassion that nearly anyone can find themselves in. This movie is a must watch, or a must have. An instant classic, not only involving two of the best drivers in any race sport, but also covering the most renown and loved race sport ever.

Because the best part of this movie is the character to character clashes. The way they show that clash at the end of the conversation, where they don't understand what each other is saying and they try to impose their values and ideas on the other person. I thought that this clash was symbolic of the whole film. And even though they don't understand each other, it's a story of their friendship, and I thought it's a pure masterpiece that goes beyond the framework of a biopic."

Wisley choosing not to completely pick a side and instead spends an almost equal amount of time with Hunt and Lauda, giving them both of them a character arc that's unique to each of them.\n\nChris Hemsworth has a brash overconfidence that's hard to resist and Daniel Br\u00fchl has that same cockiness in his own way to create a nice contrast. Hemsworth is all about the passion and danger of the sport whereas Br\u00fchl is obsessed with understanding everything from a methodical perspective.\n\nRon Howard's direction is designed to make the film as straightforward as possible in the most enjoyable way. It's clean, it's glamorous and there's plenty of thrilling racing crammed into the less than 2 hour run time. Hans Zimmer goes for broke with a score that's always epic no matter what's on screen, which really works in such a straightforward crowd pleaser."

After all, he is main source of it. But one should be allowed to ask: What is it that makes Ron Howard's films so on the edge? Why is just he making so good movies?\n\nI can't answer that question. But I am sitting on the sidelines watching, expecting more. Looking forward to the next great Ron Howard adventure.\n\nNow, I have to say something about the technical side of the film. I like the camera angles. I like the vibrating strand of grass vibrating while the F1-cars are swooping past them. It really made me believe.\n\nThe make-up of Daniel Br\u00fchl in the role as Niki Lauda is superb. Really superb. At least for those of us old enough to remember Lauda in the late 70's.\n\nSomething else? The scene from the hospital where the medical staff are vacuuming Lauda's lungs, almost made me puke. It feels so real, that I could almost feel that pipe going down my throat.\n\nWell worth a 9'er."

This only shows how incredibly Rush handled it's characters and their motives. The cinematography used by Ron Howard throughout this movie was top notch, I felt immersed in every scene. There were many emotional aspects of this movie that I also liked, which connected me to the characters a lot more.

With a masterful script, fantastic acting, a very captivating score by Hans Zimmer, and great direction by Ron Howard(who is apparently a big F1 fan. Who knew?), \"Rush\" delivers in every facet a good movie should.\n\n\"Rush\", based on real events, takes place during the 1970's, centering around two up and coming Formula racers by the names of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Lauda and Hunt serve as the protagonists of the film(or protagonist/antagonist, depending on how you wish to look at it), with the story revolving around their lives starting in the lowly F3 racing circuit all the way to their legendary 1976 F1 season showdown and beyond. What makes this story so compelling is the relationships and forces that occur between Lauda and Hunt. Both are vehement enemies on the track, but it's quite obvious that they hold a mutual respect for one another. The competition that unfolds between the two rivals over the course of the film is part of what makes \"Rush\" shine; both racer's desire to win is fueled by the success of the other. I came into this movie knowing almost nothing about F1 racing, yet I found myself completely enthralled in the details of the sport, and what made both Lauda and Hunt incredibly successful during their careers. Ron Howard truly did a fantastic job keeping me captivated despite my ignorance of the sport coming into the film.\n\nWhile the script and direction of this film is indeed very good, the acting is even better. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl are simply stunning as James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and are a big part of why this film succeeds. Both actors nail their respective characters, delivering truly life-like recreations of who these people were. After watching the movie, I looked up several videos and interviews with both Lauda and Hunt and was completely awestruck at how accurate they were portrayed. Daniel Br\u00fchl was especially convincing as Niki Lauda. You must also give a great deal of credit to the casting crew and makeup crew for picking and crafting such perfect actors for the job. At the end of the film you will see a few clips of Lauda and Hunt from the 70's, and the resemblance between them and the actors who played them is pretty astounding. The supporting cast is also good to very good, with some very well known names such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer. Overall, the acting in this film is simply top notch.\n\nWith a witty script supported by some truly inspirational acting and directing, \"Rush\" delivers an intense, realistic experience of the 1970's F1 racing world. While the actual race scenes only account for a portion of the film, they are immensely exciting and only add to the overall experience of this character driven movie. You don't have to be an F1 fan to enjoy \"Rush\", and you may even find yourself interested in the sport after watching it. Whatever your interests might be for seeing this movie, don't let the subject material sway your decision. If you do, you may just miss out on one of the best movie's made this decade.\n\nFor a truly encapsulating and resonating experience, I give \"Rush\" a rare 9/10."

I was wrong, because this movie was much more.\n\nI expect that non-car fans would enjoy this movie as well. It is not that focused around the race car driving and technical stuff, but much more around the clash between two opposite types of persons. and how they cope with their rivalry, life risks and pressure surrounding their personal life.\n\nThe visuals where beautiful, with views of beautiful locations, moving cylinders and facial close-ups perfectly mixed, and the soundtrack was great without being too present.\n\nI highly recommend this film for people with sports and car interests,but also for people who like great camera work and cinematography. I wouldn't really expect it to draw a massive female audience, but again, its mainly a dramatic plot circulated around the races, so its not exactly a fast and furious type of film. ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Great movie and I feel F vs F stole a lot of Ron's style. Like F vs F it's not like any corny race movie from the 60s. You really get the feel of what it takes to make it in the race business and even more how difficult it is to even see what is in front of you. This metaphor also branches out in several places in the movie. Even if you are not into Race movies you will enjoy all the location shots over several continents and visiting classic racing venues like the Nurburgring. It's also the first Ron Howard film where I didn't see Clint somewhere in the movie. I am sure he is there somewhere. Please Enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "'RUSH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nDirector Ron Howard's critically acclaimed sports drama about the 1976 Formula One season rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Chris Hemsworth (of 'THOR' fame) and Daniel Bruhl star as the two champion drivers. Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay and he's well known for writing critically acclaimed award winning historical dramas, usually centering around the relationship between two people (like 'THE LAST KING OF Scotland', 'THE QUEEN' and another Ron Howard directed film 'FROST/NIXON'). This is another great example of the kind of storytelling Morgan is great at and Howard does an amazing job bringing it to life as well!\n\nThe film traces Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda's (Bruhl) rivalry back to their first meeting at a 1970 Formula Three race in England. Hunt won that battle but Lauda then went on to 'buy his way in' to Formula One racing by taking out a loan and joining the Scuderia Ferrari team in 1975. Hunt's underdog team Hesketh Racing also entered the Formula One season that year but couldn't find sponsors and was forced to drop out after just that season (which Lauda won). Hunt then entered the 1976 competition as part of McLaren's team and (with a much better automobile to operate) became strong competition for Lauda that year. The film chronicles their obsessive rivalry and their lives off the track (Hunt being a wild 'lady's man' and Lauda being a calculated nerd). It also focuses on their relationships with two women (played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara).\n\nI knew little about the sport (at that time, or any really) and hadn't heard about Hunt or Lauda or their rivalry (prior to seeing the film) but I was still glued to the screen and totally involved. I could really relate to the passion and drive of both characters (I find myself ideally wanting to be more like Hunt but could understand both men). For me the movie was very moving in that way. Hemsworth has mostly just been known as an action movie star up to this point but this film finally gives him the chance to show off his acting abilities for a change (which are impressive). Bruhl is equally amazing in his role (probably more so) and totally becomes Niki Lauda. I can't say how accurate the film is but I do know the real Lauda loved it (Hunt passed away years ago) and said \"There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively\". I think Morgan's script really made the film work but also Howard's directing. Howard is well respected by critics and audiences alike but some cinephiles (that think they're smarter than everyone else) like to call him a hack; 'a director that just tries to make commercial friendly Oscar bait'. I disagree. I think sometimes his lesser films come off that way but he's definitely put a lot of heart and talent into making a lot of great films as well (and this is one of them). The cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is gorgeous and the score music (by Hans Zimmer) is beautiful and breathtakingly moving as well (some of the best I've heard in any film all year). It's a film not to be missed!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4"

Director Ron Howard chose two actors who, not only resemble their real life counterparts, but also embody their characters and the drive (no pun intended) to be the best. The dual narrative followed each of the drivers as they overcame struggles and challenges along their journey, which worked perfectly for this film. Lauda and Hunt both viewed the world, risk and racing completely differently, which ultimately gave me two very different possible ways that I could look at life, either as if I will die tomorrow or with cost-benefit analysis, acting logically.\n\nPrior to watching this film, I knew absolutely nothing of the Formula One rivalry or the tragic crash that very nearly ended the career of Lauda. This made the film much more exciting as I was never sure what the outcome of the races would be or who would die and when and left me on the edge of my seat for the whole two hours. I would highly recommend this film to any one who, like me, enjoys biographical films.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A true story of chalk-and-cheese Formula One drivers \u2013 one hot-headed, the other coolly calculating \u2013 locked together in a life-and-death rivalry may well seem familiar to UK filmmakers. Yet Asif Kapadia's brilliantly dramatic documentary Senna remains largely unseen by mainstream audiences in America, where it was also scandalously overlooked at the Oscars (here, it won two prestigious Baftas).\n\nRush Production year: 2013 Country: Rest of the world Cert (UK): 15 Runtime: 123 mins Directors: Ron Howard Cast: Alexandra Maria Lara, Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde More on this film To fill that gap, we now have Rush, Ron Howard's multiplex-friendly account of the friction-filled relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, which eerily echoes the tensions teased out between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in Kapadia's groundbreaking work. Well oiled, excitingly noisy and machine-tooled for maximum popcorn appeal, Howard's roaring drama depicts men risking life and limb in insanely dangerous circumstances, although the film itself prefers to play it safe in order to court the widest possible crowd.\n\nScripted by Peter Morgan, whose stage play Frost/Nixon formed the basis of Howard's previous real-life 70s grudge match, Rush paints its dueling antagonists with the most baldly oppositional black-and-white brush strokes. While Hunt is a handsome playboy with a champagne lifestyle and shagadelic reputation (his badge bears the legend \"Sex: Breakfast of Champions\"), Lauda is a \"rat-faced\" systems analyst who goes to bed early after sweating over the mathematical permutations of success.\n\nAs the former, Chris Hemsworth appears on occasion to be channeling the spirit of Austin Powers, a Merrie English swinger for whom naughty NHS nurses in stockings provide more than first aid, while saucy stewardesses offer obliging membership to the mile-high club at the drop of a polo-neck sweater. Toning down his performance only marginally from that of his hammer-swinging thunder god turn in Thor, the Australian Hemsworth is ready for action on and off the track, although his posh- school British accent sometimes slides like slick-tyred wheels on a rainy racetrack.\n\nBut it's Daniel Br\u00fchl as the rigidly locked-down Lauda who is arguably the more interesting of the two; while Hunt's boyish enthusiasms are all on the surface, the enigmatic Austrian's driving forces are more elusive, causing us to wonder about his true motives. Like his eternal adversary, he is a son of wealth rebelling against a privileged past, the common bond that joins this odd couple. But whereas Hunt wears his passions on his sleeve (or, more often, his underpants), Lauda's demons are somewhat internalized, leaving Br\u00fchl to wrestle with an emotionally distant character, something he manages with aplomb.\n\nJuxtaposing the world views of its yin and yang heroes, Morgan's script treads a fine line between intrigue and overstatement. At its best, this makes for much entertainingly abrasive drama as the rivals' love-hate relationship provokes sparky interaction at pre-race meetings (another flag wave to Senna) and social gatherings alike. Yet such clear-cut divisions can also become an obstacle, with credibility stalling somewhat as simplification wrests control of the narrative steering wheel. It doesn't help that Austin Powers' Basil Exposition himself seems occasionally to be in the commentary box, providing the aural equivalent of subtitles for the hard of thinking.\n\nBut Howard has always been a die-hard populist, whether serving up the sparkling romantic fantasy of Splash or delving into the murky waters of psychosis in A Beautiful Mind. With such notable exceptions as the dismal The Da Vinci Code and the painfully unfunny The Dilemma, his back catalogue bears testament to his ability to blend solid thematic meat with easily digestible fluff. As such, Rush (which cost a modest $50m) may prove to be a hit with American audiences for whom the subject matter is still something of a foreign country.\n\nSignificantly, Rush also marks a return to Howard's roots, which are firmly grounded in cinematic dreams of cars. Having starred in American Graffiti, with its nostalgic evocations of drive-ins and hot rods, Howard made his directorial feature debut, in 1977, with Grand Theft Auto, a motorized romantic caper publicized with a cartoon pile-up poster proudly brandishing the tag line: \"See the greatest cars in the world destroyed!\" \u2013 a promise on which Rush makes good. There are comparisons, too, with Apollo 13, another 70s-set true story about men in all too flimsy machines traveling at speeds that are likely to cause them to burn up and worse. Despite the fact that (most) audiences knew how that particular adventure would end, Howard did a brilliant job of keeping the crackling tension alive by concentrating on the relations between the astronauts, his dexterity with both the mechanics of action cinema and the nuances of dialogue paying dramatic dividends. It's a winning combination that is once again to the fore in Rush.\n\nMuch credit goes to the ace team of cinematic mechanics whom Howard has assembled to fine-tune his vehicle \u2013 from Anthony Dod Mantle's typically deft and probing camera-work, always finding the unexpected perspective, to the collective efforts of the sound department, whose crunchy gear changes and booming engine throbs put the audience right there in the driver's seat. Visually, the film has an access-all-areas pass to every nook and cranny of the cars, but it's the pulsing baseline of that soundtrack that provides the dramatic chassis of the race sequences. Solid supporting performances add to the appeal, with Alexandra Maria Lara and Olivia Wilde making the most of their twin \"muse\" roles, while Christian McKay reminds us that we have seen too little of him since his breakthrough role in Me and Orson Welles.\n\nBright, brash and unashamedly formulaic, this is thrillingly accessible fare, aiming more for the straight lines of the home stretch than the tricky curves of those treacherous corners, with Howard keeping one eye always on the grandstand."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the racing circuit of the 1970s, drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauder were the fiercest of rivals and represented the sport's partition between glamour and science. Hunt was born in 1947 in London and Lauder was born in 1949 in Austria. Yet both men had similar economic and personal backgrounds. Hunt's father was a successful stockbroker and Lauder was from a family of businessmen. Their families were unsupportive of their decision to shun their wealthy heritage in favour of becoming racing car drivers. Hunt at one point considered being a doctor. 1976 is remembered to be one of the most dramatic years in the Grand Prix's history and by that point they had developed polar reputations for themselves. Hunt was a drinker, took drugs, vomited before every race and is said to have slept with over five thousand women. Alternately, Lauder was characterised as \"cold, hard logic\" and a technical expert on driving. He became a major advocator for driver safety in the sport.\n\nIn Ron Howard's fictional account of this rivalry, Hunt and Lauder are played with great lucidness by Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) and Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds). We come to understand the mindsets of both men and ironically how they complimented each other. As Hunt Chris Hemsworth brims with high charisma, cockiness, wit and arrogance. He doesn't care about others but uses them for a fleeting moment of joy or pleasure. In his first scene, he walks into a hospital bleeding with a bandage on his stomach and seduces the nurse. The danger of racing fuels this juvenile spontaneity because 'the closeness to death' reminds him of his own personal vitality and celebrity appeal to women. Peter Morgan's screenplay adopts a structure similar to Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, where sex and sport have a synonymous relationship. For Hunt, both are a moment of passion, instinct and adrenaline and sometimes inspire each other. In one sequence Hunt seduces an air hostess onboard a plane and the scene is juxtaposed against a revitalised and energised racing performance. Outside of racing and sex, Hunt is bored and directionless. His brief marriage to Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) is a disaster because he can't handle a structured life. Ron Howard's camera makes deliberate note of the image of a bird trapped in a cage. It's an image representative of both characters because even Miller takes up with the actor Richard Burton to escape her life with Hunt.\n\nComparatively, Lauder doesn't believe in popularity, partying or even friends. He is a lone wolf because it allows him to structure and discipline his life primarily around racing. Not only is Lauder unpopular with the other racers in the film, he is an outsider to his own racing team, an Austrian who is part of a major Italian racing company in Ferrari. He believes that 'happiness is the enemy' because when you are happy you suddenly have something to lose. His strength though comes in the form of his scientific approach to racing and his logic. He orders the material on his racing car to be changed so it runs faster and manoeuvres his way around contracts to improve his own standing with the team. Typifying his character, Hunt calls him a rat but Lauder reminds him that as disliked as they are rats are also very cunning creatures. The accident that left Lauder horribly burnt and scared on top of his head is a frightening story and powerfully handled because of the uncompromised staging. He returned to racing just six weeks later, wearing a special protective cap under his helmet to hide his burnt flesh. The physical pain is viewed in graphic detail but we also see a determination in Lauder that achieves obsessive tendencies. While having his lungs pumped, the point of view shots of the TV showing Hunt celebrating injects Lauder with unflinching tenacity and competitiveness.\n\nIf there is any disappointment with the film it is that the female partners of both men, including Lauder's eventual wife Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), aren't given proper character arcs but are moral ciphers for their domestic issues or marginalised to the sidelines. The majority of the film's energy is spent on the racing scenes, which are an exhilarating from inside the cockpit, with cameras attached to the helmets of the actors, or over the top of the race through overhead shots. Occasionally, it is not always clear which driver is which. Pay attention to the colour of the racing cars. The most terrifying sequence in the film is when they race in terrible conditions during a downpour in Japan, forcing Lauder to reconsider his ideal that he has nothing to lose. The atmosphere in the racing scenes is heightened by an intensely desaturated colour scheme. The palettes are gritty and dark, focussing the sole primary colour red onto the racing car. This shows nothing exists outside of racing for these two men. The film is about their relationship and rivalry but also the way other people can teach us about ourselves. What they see in each other places a mirror onto themselves, reminding them of their own personal strengths. It breathes a small degree of respect between these two competitors. Hunt died at just forty-five but Lauder is still alive. He has said that he approves of the film because of its truthfulness. I haven't watched Formula One racing before but by the end I found it difficult to look away. It has the rare privilege of combining exciting Hollywood spectacle with two intimate and fascinating characters."

        "review_title": "RUSH Was a Surprise Gem for this Non-Race Fan",
        "review_detailed_main": "I will always appreciate a movie that can generate my interest in something that I previously couldn't care less about. In the case of RUSH, that something is racing. Specifically, Formula-1 racing. RUSH is another in a long line of films based on actual events to come out in 2013 and it ranks right up there with the best of them. It receives bonus points for the fact that those involved in the original events claim RUSH to actually be pretty accurate in its details, with a little creative liberty taken by the filmmakers to jazz it up a bit. It's the story of a rivalry that captured international attention in the 1976 Formula-1 racing season. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) are very different men and both of them are incredibly talented drivers. The movie begins as the two struggle to make their mark on the Formula-3 circuit and follows their rise into the spotlight of Formula-1 in the pursuit of the world championship. As the two battle neck-and-neck for position, their rivalry fuels them to push harder and faster until a disastrous moment changes both their lives and professional relationship. RUSH has become my favorite film from director Ron Howard (note: I've never seen APOLLO 13 so that could change. I know, blasphemy.) and is probably one of my top favorite movies from the year. It succeeded at both making racing interesting to a non-fan while crafting two incredibly interesting characters who are competing for polar opposite reasons.\n\nFor starters, I'm one of those anti-NASCAR sorts who can't be bothered to watch a bunch of people \"drive in circles\" for hours on end. For me to willfully watch a movie about the sport of racing (and, yes, I'm aware there's a difference between NASCAR and Formula-1 racing), it took a healthy batch of glowing positive reviews. And RUSH received heaps of praise when it hit. When combined with Chris Hemsworth's rising stardom thanks to his role as Thor in the Marvel cinematic universe (of which I'm a fan), it was enough to get my attention and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. RUSH is a blast, from the edge-of-your-seat racing segments to the back-and-forth trash talk between two talented professionals on opposite sides of the coin. Hunt is a daredevil. He drives for the thrill of the ride and revels in how close he comes to death with each event. He's in it for the glory. Lauda is a meticulous man. He uses a keen business sense in conjunction with his racing skill to master his craft. He's in it for the respect. The two ideologies bumping heads is what powers RUSH and keeps the audience invested. As cool as the racing segments are, they're nothing compared to the moments with the racers themselves. As I understand, a lot of the racing was done in camera with a minimal amount of CG to enhance the visuals. It helps, as the Formula-1 races and fast and brutal and CG cars would've dulled any sense of danger. And the movie isn't shy about showing the downsides to the Formula-1 lifestyle. Racers died in the sport (at least two a year at the time, if the movie is to be believed) and the excitement of the race circuit is intercut with the occasional accident to remind the viewer of the stakes.\n\nChris Hemsworth and, especially, Daniel Br\u00fchl should've received more attention for their performances here. There was a lot of praise when the movie debuted but it had fizzled before awards season hit. Chris Hemsworth is commendable but Hunt isn't exactly a character that strikes me as outside his wheelhouse. Hunt is boisterous and often drunk; he's a daredevil with a mean party streak and Hemsworth fills the role perfectly. He's your typical jock in most regards but he's got the added bonus of obsession of staring death in the face. But he's not a total jerk and we see a welcome change in him in the final third of the movie following the disaster at N\u00fcrburgring. Br\u00fchl has the meatier role here in Niki Lauda. His performance is mesmerizing whenever he's on screen. He's such a peculiar man. Born in Austria, Lauda is abrasively candid, unafraid to call out Hunt for his dangerous race habits or tell the owner of Ferrari that his newest racer is a pile of garbage. His no-holds-barred nature and the fact that he bought his way into Formula-1 with personal loans earn him some enemies and ultimately contributes to his near fatal accident. Hemsworth may have the star power and top billing in the film but this is definitely Br\u00fchl's film in the end. Regardless, Howard does a fantastic job of balancing each character in the film, giving us the film from both perspectives. There's no hero and villain here. Just two men with a drive to be world champions."

I was socked how GREAT it was!\n\nHe simply nailed it! I don't know how he did it, he found actors looking almost identical with the real persons (Lauda, his wife, Hunt, his wife, etc), but also the actors played SUPER GOOD their roles!\n\nAll the screenplay was very good, the dialogues, the power of each scene (and not talking about the racing ones).\n\nAnd it's a drama, not just a racing film. Actually portraits these two legendary drivers of F1. \"Niki\" Lauda was always my favorite, but I haven't really study his personalily. After this film, I searched a lot and because the amazing performance of Daniel (playing \"Niki\"), I understood more the legendary Lauda (as PERSON, as CHARACTER).\n\nGreat movie; seriously, one of the best drama films I've watched."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush covers the world championship in Formula One racing in the 1970s when two drivers dominated the sport: James Hunt of England driving a McLauren and Niki Lauda, an Austrian who drove for Ferrari. The two men had a lot in common. They were fortunate sons of wealthy families. They were obsessed with winning. While Hunt was a playboy, he was willing to die on the race track to gain a split-second advantage over his competition. Lauda spoke of cutting risk, which he could quantify, but he accepted the risk of tragic consequences of piloting race cars at insane speeds.\n\nIf you like auto racing, you will love this story. The story contrasts how Lauda and Hunt were different. Lauda was a serious person who never worried about people liking him. He called everyone an \"asshole.\" He was extremely frank and lacked any form of tact. Hunt was handsome, fun- loving, drunk and utterly charming. The desire to be better than the other man drove them to excel.\n\nWhere once they really didn't like each other, they become more than rivals.\n\nWonderful film. See it."

There is hair rising, spine tingling excitement from the race scenes it's like actually being there to experience the races.\n\nWith some people you just can't fight and win, you just can't blame your lucky stars, u just can't compete with all the power in the world; some people are just born to do what they do, some people are just Great!"

If you're a motorsport fan it's a must watch, but the drama of this true story coupled with incredible cinematography and great acting make this the sort of movie that should appeal to everybody."

In a way, I think the director Ron Howard targeted the movie for viewers like myself as the movie didn't have the typical \"Based on a true story\" title at the beginning. Only the real pictures at the end was what caused me to think 'could this be true story?' and look it up to my surprise once again that such dramatic story is in fact true.\n\nAgain, as I was not aware this was true story, mid way through the movie, I thought, 'wow, this is very well written drama'. This was completely opposite of modern day Formula 1 races and certainly unlike any Hollywood movies these days. Ending was completely unpredictable.\n\nAttention to detail was amazing. All the criticisms about shameful racing movies like Days of Thunder and Driven were well addressed. Crashes were so well reproduced that I thought the crashes in the movie were from actual footage.\n\nBut then again, core of any movie should be about story telling. And there's no one better to tell such drama than Ron Howard. I don't give out perfect score often and this is only my second movie to be rated 10 stars on IMDb.com"

This was Daniel Brole(?)'s movie. I added a question mark because I still don't know his name after watching the trailer, the movie and consequently obsessing over the information surrounding the actual events. It's either Brole or Brule and it has an accent.\n\nI'm still on the trailer, there's more to be said. It was one of the best trailers in recent history, simply due to the fact that it didn't give the entire movie away. If I hadn't seen the trailer before watching the movie, I don't think I would have had the same experience. Not only did it not spoil the movie, it prepared me for some obscure historical event from the bottom of the bag being massacred into a motion picture.\n\nwow incoherent rambling review much? such amaze so wow.

There are some amazing movies that you'd never want to watch again, I'll see in five or ten years if this one is one of them. I've watched National Lampoon's Senior Trip (Jeremy Renner's first role) at least a dozen times, but it's a pretty terrible movie.\n\nRush is good rush is great it was my favourite movie this year it kinda played out like an Ayn rand novel and I wonder if Niki Lauda was into her at all, since he seems.... kinda fricked (WHY CAN'T I USE PROFANITY IN MY REVIEW, THAT'S INSANE IT'S 2013 GET YOUR STUPID STUFF TOGETHER GUYS.

A lot of stuff is CGI enchanced, mostly you don't notice it, but a couple of times you could notice they are in front of a bluescreen instead of in a car. They also used real cars and most of the racing shots look very real. Hans Zimmer provides a very functional score that doesn't draw to much attention to itself. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would certainly recommend it to any car enthusiast or F1 fan but I won't put it in my 2013 top 5 film list. Like a lot of movies about sports and rivalry therein it feels like it follows a certain formula and unfolds in a very straightforward way.

Thankfully, that's not the case. This adrenaline fuelled drama is a high octane power house with great acting, writing and directing which manages to make a boring sport interesting. It tells the real life story of the rivalry between car racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both are different characters and neither are especially likable, but they're both well rounded and excellent played. Chris Hemsworth, a promising actor who really is choosing his films well, is very good as Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl is even better as Lauda, and his performance might be the best individual element of the film. Rush is another drama film, and there are many points which feel somewhat predictable and generic, so it has detours, but otherwise it's first gear straight to the Oscars.... who decided to completely ignore it. Typical.\n\nThe only other Ron Howard film I've seen is half of Backdraft, so I was sceptical but his direction and editing are astonishing. The race sequences are exhilarating and make you feel like you're in the car with the drivers. Most of the dialogue feels genuine and it keeps you compelled throughout. It apparently employs some artistic license with the real events but not enough to make it feel like total nonsense (It's no Braveheart). Rush is a thrilling and moving drama which is a superior sports movie and if Gravity isn't a British movie than quite possibly the best British film of 2013. This is predictable at times which makes it a four star movie but it's a high four stars. Despite the predictability you can't always tell what's going to happen and by the end Rush is surprisingly moving. The character rivalry and development are what make the movie so compelling, not the race sequences. Hemsworth and Bruhl should have received Oscar nominations for their performances.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rush. Based on real story of rivalry between two F1 drivers of 70s, dashing James Hunt played by 'Thor' fame Chris Hemsworth and clinical Niki Lauda played by incredible Daniel Br\u00fchl.\n\nLike a F1 race, Rush is also a racy drive with lots of bends in the story testing the lead characters' spirit and temperament. Both lead characters are so well developed and well played that they leave an indelible mark on your minds. Director Ron Howard masterly organizes a wonderful show of technical finesse, sharp dialogues, uncluttered screenplay and cinematic thrill of F1 racing. The love-hate-respect relationship between James and Niki is electric and every now and then you feel the adrenaline rush that they are feeling.\n\nThere is hardly any dull moment and emotional conflicts revolving around the love lives of both the racers is handled with a light hand so that you are never distracted from the main plot. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Rush. This is one of the best sports movies in recent times and will surely get a cult status in future. Rush for this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Great semi-bio pic set during the golden age of Formula One racing. The bragadocious Brit vs the straight lacsdyGerman in a classic tale of rivals that ultimately after battling for years and cheating death realize they are more alike than different. A great story about how sports and celebrity can bring out the best and worst in people. Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth give great performances under the direction of Ron Howard. Also great score by Hans Zimmer."

        "review_detailed_main": "This moved at a pace similar to motor racing, hardly pausing for breath. Sometimes you hear contrived dialogue in films of this type but here the dialogue was delivered as fast as the action on the screen. No long monologues here.\n\nThe two leads had to carry the film...and did. Showing rivalry without it being too bitter or really getting nasty and ultimately having utmost respect for each other. Out of the two I thought Hemsworth was probably the better, nailing the British accent especially that which has a plum in its mouth. The supporting cast did not really have a lot to to other than look concerned as they raced or whoop or otherwise when race over.\n\nMotor racing scenes will not disappoint the motor racing fans amongst you...with plenty of noise and pulsing music to go with it.\n\nWas a bit worried of someone as long in the tooth as Ron Howard directing; thought a young jazzy/visionary director would stamp himself all over this one, but no Howard directed with gusto and at pace.\n\nSo yeah, jump into the driving seat on this one for a couple of hours as it is based on a good, true story with the rivals being two totally opposite characters."

The cast is excellent, they portrayed these interesting people brilliantly.\n\nThe races are superbly directed, charged with adrenaline and speed, tense and interesting and make the film really great.\n\nFast cars, beautiful women, adrenaline, interesting and fun characters, all this makes an interesting and above all fun movie that gets better with each viewing. Unforgettable."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw an ad for this film in the cinema foyer and I thought to myself that the man in the racing car looked like Niki Lauda. I had no idea who the good looking blonde driver was meant to be though. Maybe that comes into it. Anyway, turns out the ad was for a fact based dramatisation of actual Formula 1 racing car drivers...so, Daniel Br\u00fchl already has some credit in the bank for his portrayal of the multi-time world champion Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda. This movie got a good review on \"At the movies\" so that also made me more inclined to watch it. However, seeing Australian Chris Hemsworth as the \"other\" driver (James Hunt) in the clip for the movie on that TV show made me think that his English accent seemed quite contrived...sort of a clipped, aristocratic accent...I'm thinking ball park Prince Philip territory here! In any case, this wasn't so marked to me in the movie proper, so it wasn't a negative for me.\n\nEspecially early on, this movie has a sort of comic book feel to the proceedings...or perhaps \"Boy's own adventure\" is another way of saying this...perhaps a bit of a 1970s English movie feel to the movie as well...or swinging 1960s style. In other words, it seems pitched more as entertainment than gritty, realistic drama. Personally I found the racing in the movie lacked much detail, insight and intensity, but on occasion the racing presented was all those things...as when Niki Lauda weaves between F1 cars after coming back from the hospital.\n\nWhere the movie does hold great interest and drama is in the factual information presented to the audience via on screen text...i.e. who won a certain race or what the season leaderboard looks like. It's this aspect which makes the movie engrossing when the actual driving scenes don't. You're made aware of where Hunt stands in relation to Lauda in their fight for the F1 crown.\n\nAlso fascinating is the insight into the business of racing at this time in the sport's history. You see what Hunt and Lauda were doing before they made it into the big league of racing...their time in Formula 4 (I think it was \"4\").\n\nWatching the movie, it occurred to me that it quite easily have been all about Niki Lauda and his journey. I can't say that I could have associated the name \"James Hunt\" with the phrase \"champion F1 driver\" but the movie is very informative in making a case for that proposition and justifies its approach of making the theme of this movie the rivalry between these two disparate drivers.\n\nIn creating an approach based on rivalry it also occurred to me that perhaps the movie fabricated the interactions between these two drivers. On screen, they appear to be in each other's pocket most of the time and I really couldn't believe it was like that in reality. However, at the end of the movie there was some archival footage of Hunt and Lauda chatting to each other at a racetrack, which makes me wonder if there is more truth in this movie than I thought.\n\nThat being said, there were many times when my credulity did not come easily. For instance, did Hunt really give that reporter an answer like to that to what the reporter asked Lauda at a press conference? Did that actually happen? Did Lauda really watch that on TV when he was receiving treatment? They had televisions in those rooms? Really? Those scenes make for good drama and narrative motivation, but still, I was wondering where truth ended and fiction began. To a lesser extent, I found it hard that Lauda accept the premise of the barbs Hunt would throw at him pre-race at times...surely, if that happened, Lauda would just ignore such a prat, right? If all this stuff happened though, than it is a terrific representation of the duality of Hunt's relationship to Lauda.\n\nOverall, this movie is like a philosophical representation of two competing life philosophies...in the form of two extreme, polar opposite personalities. No doubt the middle ground between them would be the ideal in life...perhaps. It would be lovely to think that Hunt and Lauda did have their conversation at Lauda's jet inside the hangar as depicted in the movie. I also liked in that scene how Lauda puts into words something that I was thinking about Hunt's status. Whilst unsure of the actuality of the scene, I also liked how Hunt proffered some home truths to Lauda when the latter unsuccessfully tried to have a race cancelled due to rain.\n\nPerhaps it was in \"At the movies\" where director Ron Howard admitted having doubts as to whether Chris Hemsworth had the acting chops to pull off this performance. I found Chris performance engaging but he also has a couple of scenes where he gives good reaction shots to the dramas he faces...he really 'inhabits that moment' so to speak.\n\n\"Rush\" has a climactic race between Hunt and Lauda at the end of the movie. Initially I thought Lauda's action implied something, but on reflection I found it a cagey move perhaps worth the gamble, even if the movie posits an entirely different motive for his action.\n\nJust in passing, I'll note that Niki Lauda did get referenced in a song by The Music Men on the audience performance segment of the TV show \"Hey hey it's Saturday\". Seeing this movie, it does now seem cruel in retrospect.\n\nAs mentioned in my opening paragraph, even though I am only slightly aware of F1 history and even less of James Hunt as a player in it, this movie does a sterling job of rectifying that situation."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oscars is a long way away, but this movie will be remembered for a long time.\n\nFirst of all, I didn't know too much about the back story of this rivalry, however people need to understand this is a movie, the idea is not to follow the exact real life event, but to throw in a few new ideas.\n\nThis movie was really great, the trailer did not exactly deliver, meaning, lets just put it this way, when I booked ticket to see this movie I brought my pillow and pajamas just in case. Now enough with the silly jokes and puns, the movie progresses through with the introduction of Stephen Hunt with Niki Lauda appearing later on to rival him, severe tension arises between them along with their romantics events then slowly but surely the movie builds up to a ultimate series of events which begin crash down on us, I did say i'd stop with the puns right?\n\nAnyway I have to applaud the way the movie is compiled and how the ending is shown. Without spoiling anything I have to give credit to Peter Morgan/Ron Howard for their superb avoidance of portraying a jolly, joyful and friendly ending, instead they showed a mutual understanding between Hunt and Lauda, in which after doing my research was pretty accurate to what occurred in real life.\n\nOverall great movie, and yes, as the Summary Title says I can assure you an Oscar or two will be dealt out here, possibly Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth will have a rivalry of their own for an Oscar? Time will tell."

The acting by Chris Hemsworth is top notch and the supporting cast clearly did their homework for the roles they played. The camera work and the editing makes you feel like you are racing with the drivers.\n\nI was unaware of the story of Niki Lauder and James Hunt but after watching the film, I was interested in learning more about these dare devils and their lives building up to the very last race. watching real races online and reading about the drivers has made more interested in race car driving and made me aware of how dangerous these professionals have it.\n\nI recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates top acting, directing and overall filmmaking.\n\n5 stars."

And the seventies never looked so good! The relationship between the two men, Hunt & Lauda, is fascinating. Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda in particular is great - his drive, intelligence & unlikable character funnily enough endeared him to me! I knew little of the story before watching, my only experience of Formula 1 racing is of a background noise at home in the late nineties on a Sunday afternoon. But what a story this was. Lauda's accident and his reappearance at the track six weeks later is pretty unbelievable. A crazy sport, but the rush you feel from watching this movie, you'll get it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally. Just when I thought that this year had been without a single highlight with respect to Hollywood (co)productions in general, I had the pleasure of watching this little marvel.\n\nThe story is fast paced, well thought of and does not paint its characters entirely in black or in white, like we are used to from other \"blockbusters\". The effects are great, but without bludgeoning viewers to death with unlikely and unconvincing CGI. The movie lasts about two hours, but it's one of the few instances where I wouldn't even have minded a 2h30 or 3h production, had it included more details about the drivers' lives, their competitors and some more background. It was a gripping mix that left nothing to be desired.\n\nBut the most impressive part of it all was the acting of the two main characters (Hunt & Lauda):\n\nTruthfully, I would not have expected such an impeccable characterization work from Chris Hemsworth, who is generally known for solid, but certainly not for overwhelming performances (e.g. Thor, Star Trek). His work here is admirable, translating Hunt's playboy on the one hand and his insecure side on the other hand to perfection.\n\nHowever, it was Daniel Br\u00fchl's brilliant performance as Niki Lauda that put everything else into perspective. Having met Niki Lauda personally and, as an Austrian myself, having seen him interact many times on T.V. and on the radio, Br\u00fchl just nailed it with flying colors. The resemblance not only concerning Lauda's appearance, but most of all with regard to his mannerisms is almost frightening. Br\u00fchl, as a German, had to learn to talk with an Austrian accent in English AND in German, including Niki Lauds's very specific and rather odd pronunciations. Needless to say he mastered everything flawlessly. Heck, if he ever chose to stop acting, he could start a career as a Lauda imitator. To summarize it, his whole act was extremely convincing, the interactions with everybody else appeared genuine and most of all his enemy/friend chemistry with Chris Hemsworth was brilliant.\n\nI'd like to see one more competition between these two: Br\u00fchl & Hemsworth should be nominated, Br\u00fchl should win this competition and get the Oscar.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad to see that not all hope is lost for cinematic productions and that some movies still focus on their stories and their characters instead of regurgitating the embarrassing tripe that we've been served as \"blockbusters\" this year (e.g. World War Z, Elysium, Oblivion & many more)."
