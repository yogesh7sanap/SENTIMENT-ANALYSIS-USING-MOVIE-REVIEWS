        "review_detailed_main": "Over a decade before his movie career exploded and eight years before even Pumping Iron, Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in this cheapie B comedy playing the Greek demigod Hercules, who has been banned from Olympus by Zeus. Schwarzenegger can barely speak a line of coherent English at this point (the film is probably more commonly seen with his performance dubbed, but his original voice is available nowadays). Funny thing is, he's by far the best actor in the picture. Everyone else is just cringe-inducingly awful. The movie as a whole might have actually been watchable, if it weren't for the painfully stereotypical Jew performance by Arnold Stang, who dominates much of it. The film has Schwarzenegger (dubbed Arnold Strong) doing Schwarzenegger-ish activities like weightlifting, throwing cars around and getting into various fights. What would you do if you ran into a 22 year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger and he was annoying you? Start a fight? Well, if you're in this movie, that's what you do. It happens like ten times."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a very bad film--there's no denying this. Imagine having a young Arnold Schwarzenegger (whose command of English was MUCH worse than when he did his movies in the 1980s) playing a Greek god who comes to New York for a few laughs! Now the concept COULD have actually worked--if the leading man hadn't been barely cognizant of the English language. And, had the writers not been chimpanzees, the story could have been turned into a cute little tongue-in-cheek tale. But, in the end, through total incompetence, it's a dreadful movie. BUT, for people who like watching stupid films and laughing at them, then they are in for a treat with HERCULES IN NEW YORK!\n\nThe film begins in a very minimalistic Mount Olympian headquarters for the gods. Including the cost of the pillars, I think the set was created for about $47.50. Well, in this sketchy looking layout, the gods are all standing around when Hercules announces he's bored and wants to go back to Earth. Zeus forbids him and they argue. Ultimately, Zeus tosses him out of the sky onto the earth and from here on Hercules has a lot of adventures. For the most part, Schwarzenegger plays the role like he's a lovable moron...goofy and looking a bit like Jethro Bodine when he first went to the big city! Among the exciting(?) adventures he has are various wrasslin' matches, fighting an escaped bear (a guy in one of the worst bear suits I've ever seen) and hanging out with Arnold Stang--a man who has somehow learned to talk entirely through his nose. I'd tell you more about the story, but really don't think it's all that important. Suffice to say, Jethro runs around New York (often with no shirt) and gets into wacky trouble.\n\nAs far as the research for the writers goes, I think they'd have been better off if they'd read a few comic books or asked the average high school student for advice. When it comes to knowing even the basic information about the Greek gods, they often got is completely wrong--mixing Greek and Roman names for the gods again and again (for example, Juno, Venus and Hercules are Roman names and Zeus and Nemesis are Greek) as well as having little understanding (or care) about the gods themselves (Mercury was NOT Hercules' brother, Pluto was NOT the Devil nor did he live in Hell, etc., etc.). In addition, at the end of the film, Samson (from the Old Testament) and Atlas (whose job it is to hold the Earth) come to the rescue!\n\nThere are also two versions of this film. Traditionally, the version most have seen has a dubbed voice for Arnold, as he's occasionally barely comprehensible. But, this is also really silly as the voice is very robotic and obviously not his. This is the case with the version posted on IMDb (though, oddly, this version also lacks music and many basic sound effects). For those wanting to see and hear Arnold, the DVD has the original restored voice--but won't give you the option to hear either one. Additionally, at the end, when he talks to Stang from the radio, it's NOT Arnold's voice but that of the robot-dude.\n\nOverall, the film was a shoddy and silly mess. But there was a certain goofiness that make it fun to watch despite its many, many obvious shortcomings. Not a good film at all, but fun to watch if you need a laugh."

Arnold also fights a group of sailors with a plank and throws them in the sea, the sound effects and horrible choreography in that scene is hilarious. I've got the version of this movie with Arnies real voice, and just hearing that makes this movie worth getting. But Arnold is not the worst actor in this movie, his partner, Arnold Stang is much worse.

The fact that anybody invested as much as a nickel in a script that one monkey working for one hour could easily have done better is what really blows my mind. The premise is painfully stupid, and the execution of it is as heavy-handed and amateurish as anything you're likely to see. Most porn movies are produced with more consideration for plot.\n\nI recommend \"Hercules in New York\" to anyone who likes to go to the dentist or enjoys a hard punch in the nose.

There can't have been much budget so don't be looking for visual effects or a tangy script - nope, none of that, just the future Governor of California looking almost cherubic in his spray-on shorts demonstrating the truthful nature of the American dream.

        "review_detailed_main": "As a child, I have seen movies that really grab the viewer's attention and have lovable characters that make a lasting impression. Children's movies like Gumby: The Movie (1995), Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000), and Space Jam (1996) all have the things a child could ask for. As for Hercules in New York, the film definitely made a lasting impression but on the weird side of things. Sponsored by the Tooniversal Company, this piece of cinema is fun to watch for nostalgia purposes only.\n\nThis is Arnold Schwarzenegger's first film debut as the man who is part god, and part human. The story starts off when he is up in Olympus where he wants to be sent down to Earth because he is tired of hanging around with the Gods. So he argues with his father Zeus, who gets so livid that he sends him down to New York. Wait a minute, Zeus didn't want Hercules mingling with humans, so why was he sent down to New York in the first place? Why was there even an argument? Whatever.\n\nAlong with Schwarzenegger is Arnold Stang, who plays a character called Pretzie, a wimpy man who carries a basket of pretzels in the first part of the film that he's seen. From there, he no longer holds a bag of pretzels, what a surprise. I will say, the actors picked for the roles of each character were picked accurately, but I'm not saying their acting is good. Stang plays as good wimpy character, and is funny to see his eyes bulge. Even Schwarzenegger is good as Hercules, but that's because of his physique and I assume that's really all he needed. That is one of the nostalgic points in this movie; Schwarzenegger's muscles. It's amazing to see how big he really was in the 70s. The other part that is nostalgic about this film is to see what SOME of New York looked like back then, but that's about all the viewer will get.\n\nWhat makes this movie so awkward are how the scenes are done. There are moments where Hercules is supposed to be doing something extraordinary. Instead what he does looks cheaply done and the sound effects don't help. Hercules knocks (more like love-taps) a man into a bay, and the splashing water makes it sound like a pebble was tossed. What? Who would have thought these brutes were made of confetti? There's even a scene where Hercules fights a bear. Yes a bear, and it doesn't even look like a bear. The viewer will be able to tell that this is not a bear, but a person inside a bear suit. To make matters worse, Hercules attacks the bear by slapping it; yes slapping it. Schwarzenegger slapping? It's really ridiculous to see The Terminator (1984) beat up a bear so poorly.\n\nAs for the damsel in distress, Deborah Loomis, I have never heard so much screaming, almost as much as Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman (2002), if not more. My ears were ringing after hearing her. She even faints in once scene, and it didn't even look real. As for the music, which was composed by John Balamos, is not a whole lot better. I can't even tell what kind of instrument is used but it's not an orchestra I'll say that much. A lot of the music is the same and it sounds really corny. I'm really surprised Schwarzenegger has become such a box office hit by starting from this movie. This film obviously did not get him famous but if he had not auditioned for the role, we may not have any of the Terminator movies or Total Recall (1990), whatever. When the film finished, I was barely entertained and shocked to how bad the film was compared to its trailer. What shocks me even more is that the director of this film is still making movies today!\n\nHercules in New York is a very silly kid's movie that may not even entertain the smallest of ages. Much of the scenes in this film are stupid and the only thing that may catch the viewer's attention is Arnold Schwarzenegger's bulging biceps."

Because it is. \"So why oh why have you given it a score of three as opposed to a score of one or two?\" you might ask. Well, the reason is that it is the most unintentionally hilarious movie that I have ever seen. It is listed as being an \"Action/Comedy/Fantasy\" which would lead one to believe that it is meant to be funny. I saw the version in which the mighty Arnold speaks for himself in his customary Austrian brogue. I have not seen the dubbed version so I don't know how much of the comedic value the movie loses based on Schwarzenegger and his dialogue being the funniest part of the movie.\n\nIt's the parts that are supposed to be serious that are the really funny bits of this movie. Such as Arnold regularly proclaiming (with an even thicker Austrian accent due to him not yet mastering the English language) \"I am Hercules\". Having a weightlifting contest with Arnold Stang and pushing over N.Y taxis.\n\nI'm a huge Schwarzenegger fan. I always have been. But the irony is that in the late-1980's he felt the need to display \"range\" as an actor by trying to branch out from his heavy-hitting actioners into comedy with movies such as \"Twins\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\" but the fact of the matter is that Arnold for all his trying was at his funniest right back at the start of his movie career.\n\nIf you are a fan of Arnold and love his inimitable manner of delivering lines. You need to see this. Ignore the non-existent plot and acting and just roll along on the river of cheese in a film that is so bad it is hilarious.\n\nThree is a low score, yes. But when you consider that this movie should have a score of one you know that those additional points are on comedic merit alone."

The directing, acting, special effects.. mein gott! The acting is so bad, that it makes you squirm in your seat. Arnold is trying soo hard to remember his lines, that most of the time it shows on his face.

        "review_detailed_main": "With today the day Maria Shriver officially files for divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger (serves him right too since he betrayed her by cheating on her with the maid and had a baby with her, to boot!), I thought I'd watch the former Governator's first movie that he made way back in 1969-Hercules in New York. I saw two versions: the first that I watched on Hulu had no music score and Arnold's voice was badly dubbed by another though compared to his real one, you could hear each word clearly and the second one I saw on YouTube which had his accented voice not always easy to understand (which made his confused mix-up on \"bucks\" and \"dough\" with \"bucs\" and \"doe\" not as funny) though it had a good Greek-like score. The rating for the first version is above while the other take gets a 4 from me. Arnold is credited as Arnold Strong since, I guess, his co-star happens to be Arnold Stang. Stang is such a one-of-a-kind presence that he brightens most scenes he's in. The only other player I recognized was James Karen who I knew from Poltergeist as well from a guest spot on \"The Golden Girls\". By the way, when Stang died in December '09, I couldn't help but think of his other roles like the voice of Herman the mouse in those Herman and Katnip cartoons, his role as Frank Sinatra's friend in The Man with the Golden Arm, and his recent roles in \"The Cosby Show\" and Dennis the Menace. Oh, and while I knew one player couldn't be John Candy since this guy was much older but Abe Holiday on that dock sure looked like him. So on that note, Hercules in New York is interesting for the early role of Mr. Schwarzenegger, not to mention his thick accent, and not much else though one can't completely hate a movie where Hercules fights an obviously bear-suited man. P.S. It was disappointing to hear that dubbed actor again instead of Arnold on the radio at the end of the second version especially since it was much softer this time around."

It is.\n\nThe version they currently have streaming on Amazon Prime (it's April 2020, one month into the global quarantine) is the version that was otherwise unavailable throughout history. It is the version with the original audio with Arnold's voice. Now, I don't want to have to watch this movie again, but I at least need to see some of the version with the voice dubs at some point - all of the 10/10 reviews I've seen are of people being stoked about how bad the voiceovers are. I feel like I've missed out.\n\nThat aside, this movie fully sucks. I found it quite endearing for the first 20-30 minutes. It was quirky and cute, and fun to see Arnold give his acting debut, but after 30 minutes... there's almost no cohesive story at all, and the co-star ARNOLD STANG as PRETZY THE PRETZEL GUY, who is in almost every scene, is UNBEARABLE. He's like a cartoon version of Woody Allen who tries to be funny but isn't, ever. There are a couple standout scenes, like when Hercules fights \"a bear\" in Central Park, LOL.... but, The last hour is VERY difficult to enjoy. It just meanders and even Arnold can't save it. I guess I understand why Arnold wouldn't allow this movie to be played on broadcast television, ever."

I once heard that the makers of the movie had dubbed over Arnie's voice because his English was so utterly crap at the time, but I was pleasantly surprised when I bought the DVD because there was an option on whether you wanted Arnie's voice or the dubbed one. So if you haven't seen this one and you plan to see it on DVD, YOU MUST CHOOSE ARNIE'S VOICE!

Hitler might have intended to make the world a better place, I don't think his intentions matter when you judge him. This is simply one of the most hilarious movies you'll ever see, it's filled with absurd scenes. And it's acted out to perfection. The combination of Arnie, and Pretzie, it's just magic. Pretzie overacts as badly as you can imagine, Arnie doesn't act and he does that as badly as you can imagine. But those aren't the only noteworthy performances in this movie. Check out the refinement of the screaming girl, in the infamous bear-attack scene. There are just so many little things in this movie, little details in every single aspect of this movie, that make this so extremely funny and entertaining. It just ignores even the most basic of things needed for a good movie, and it is exactly that, what makes this so good. Watch this movie, you won't be able to say that it is average, that's for sure. I've seen this movie 2 times, and I still regularly think about it. I would buy the DVD without a second thought if I would encounter it."

Overall, it's good fun and if you go into it not expecting too much, you'll emerge at the end having had a pleasant if not unforgettable experience."

Even though it was funny beyond words it is still a very very bad movie, everything in it, there is now faint sign of hope for any of those people who participated in it. The funny thing about that is, that history proved that wrong, Arnold actually turned out to be an extraordinary actor with a successful career. See thats surprising when you watch this movie! And back to that god forbidden bear scene. I must say that from the moment I saw the bear I cried with laughter. I really can't see how anyone, anyone of any time can be so thickheaded that they actually make such a costume, and even worse uses it for the movie. And well there is a lot of other unbelievable details in this movie, in fact the entire movie is a huge surprise, I mean Zeus' thunderbolts are actually made of steel bars normally used for supporting concrete structures, and it is obvious if you look at them. Well I could go on with these, excuse me, hopeless and stupid details ( as well as the entire main plot )but I guess there is nothing more to say, a very very bad movie beyond words. I encourage ANYONE with my heart and soul to watch it. Better laughs are rarely found, and besides it is a suitable tribute to Arnold to watch this one from start to finish, a never forgotten movie in history, and it really sucks! Though it is indeed supreme if you need one and a half hours of cheep laughs i rate it 1 because it is technically the worst movie i have seen. 1/10"

It's night, but no, actually, it's day most of the time, they just forgot to shoot some parts of it, so it's day, and Hercules has to save a precious young lady from a wild bear that escaped from the zoo...the only problem is that the thing never looks like a real bear. It is just so bad, it's no funny at all. A clumsy man -probably forgot to dig the holes for the eyes in the material- wearing brown pajamas and pretending to be a bear is attacking Mr. World...Great.

Production values never rise above porno level (Zeus' kingdom consists of nothing more than a plastic throne and a couple of drapes, filmed in a public park!), and the sound quality fluctuates from shot to shot (you can hear traffic somewhere beyond the aforementioned 'magic' kingdom!!). On top of the meandering plot and rotten visual effects (get a load of the 'rampaging grizzly', actually a guy in flea-bitten bear suit!), the movie is further handicapped by Schwarzenegger's dreadful performance - he's fine while showing off his torso, but his flat monotone delivery is in sharp contrast to some talented supporting players, including well-known character actors James Karen and Richard Herd (what were they thinking?). If nothing else, however, the movie provides an opportunity for viewers to feast their eyes on Schwarzenegger's magnificent body, which he displays at every opportunity. Oh, and look out for the scene in which he steers a horse-drawn carriage down the middle of Times Square, an iconic image which transcends the rough material in which it's featured. Directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman.\n\nNB. In an alternate version of the film, Arnie is dubbed with god-like hamminess by an uncredited voice artist; reports suggest the movie is even funnier this way!"

Aubrey Wisberg should have done the world a favor and stayed out of the filmmakingbusiness. The story is simply stupid and gives no meaning what so ever.

The movie has not mythological accuracy , neither expectation historical ; however , showing up here and there some Greek Gods , such as : Zeus , Nemesis , Juno , Venus , Mercury, Atlas and Pluto .There're 300 pounds of stupid , being a lighthearted fun in which Hercules appears in Manhattan and he beheaves likes a geek fish out of water and eventually becomes a professional wrestling superstar . Arnold's original classic with a lots of fights , muscles , and several silly scenes. He plays a comic role that allowed him to develop his humorous talent while showing off his prodigious muscles. Stunningly cheap special effects like the shots and close-ups of a giant bear that's a man suited struggling against H\u00e9rcules . Despite its appealing nature to the general public, the film failed to arouse much interest , but today it is considered a cult movie due to being Arnold's debut film. A few years earlier , some hunk men played this hero in great number of movies and was randomly assigned the identity of H\u00e9rcules , Goliath or Samsom for US version . As Arnold Schwarzenegger took the role from his American weightlifting companions , such as : Dan Vadis who played Hercules the invincible (1964) , Triumph of Hercules (1964) ; Brad Harris who acted in Samson against Hercules (1961) , La furia d i Ercole (1962) , Hercules (1983) ; Mark Forest who performed : La vendetta di Ercoles (1960) ; Peter Lupus or Rock Stevens in Ercole contro i tiranni di Babilonia (1964) ; Reg Park, who had previously played Hercules in the Haunted World (1961), and Hercules the Avenger (1965) , Gordon Scott in Ercole contro i tiranni di Babilonia (1964) , Hercules and the pricess of Troy (1965) and , of course , Steve Reeves in Hercules (1958) , it is followed by Hercules unchained (1959) . So Reeves paved the way for other pumped-up acting hopefuls as Ed Fury, Mark Forest, Reg Park and others to seek their fame and fortune in Italy as feature-length Samson, Ursus or Colossus, and nobody, came close to topping Steve in popularity ; however , the giant Arnold Swarzenegger stayed in the US where he got big hit . This lumbering motion picture was lousily directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman. And subsequently , reissued track was restored . This Hercules in New York(1970) film also titled Hercules goes Bananas at 75 minutes and Hercules , the movie at 82 m. Is listed among the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Awards . Only for Arnold fans as an inept but irresistible opportunity to watch a a newcomer actor to be followed much success."

Hercules is tired of laying around in Greece all the time speaking German and takes a trip to New York. A guy that vaguely looks like Woody Allen takes him under his wings and they get into oh so lighthearted adventures. To be frank I expected more ass-kicking from Ahnuld. He barely ever gets into fights and when he does he really just pushes the bad guys around a little, probably because the production values are low and they couldn't get those cool sound effects you get after punches(that go \"doosh\" and stuff). To give you an idea of the massive thought put into this movie,the script called for a bear and the director had a brilliant idea, putting some hobo in a bear suit bought from some guy's trunk. Luckily our hero Hercules is on the spot real quick to not punch the,ah well I'm in a good mood,bear. Meanwhile the not so pretty love interest is screaming her lungs out dead afraid of this short, skinny bear that has been standing on two legs for ages. Another action scene breaks out when Hercules joins a contest that should determine who the strongest man in the world is. And of all the ways that can pop up in your head, they go for the very lame idea of just lifting three different weights. I was at least expecting some wrestling or so but no, just lifting stupid weights. And if his opponent can lift 1000 pounds, why the hell did it already take the guy so much effort to lift 500? All these comical misadventures (there's more,but I can't work up the courage) are constantly interrupted by scenes of Zeus sitting in the director's back yard, I mean uhm, Greece.

        "review_detailed_main": "Screwball comedy Hercules in New York sees a 22-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger (billed here as Arnold Strong) making his screen debut as demigod Hercules, who visits Earth against the wishes of his father Zeus. Falling from the sky into the sea, Hercules is picked up by a ship travelling to New York, where he meets friendly pretzel salesman Pretzie (played by Arnold Stang, the voice of Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat), falls in love with professor's daughter Helen (Deborah Loomis), enters a strongman competition against bodybuilder Monstro (Tony Carroll), and upsets local mobsters in the process.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's screen debut is shoddy nonsense that will test the patience of all but the most dedicated Arnie fan. The star's thick Austrian accent renders his dialogue laughable, the movie's intentional humour falls flat, and the plot is a meandering mess that feels like it was thrown together on the fly. Production values are incredibly low, most notably in the scenes set on the supposedly tranquil paradise of Mount Olympus (actually filmed in Central Park), where the props are cheap and nasty and the action is frequently interrupted by the sound of New York traffic and car horns.\n\nThat said, Hercules in New York is almost worth seeing just for the hilarious sight of the future governor of California wrestling a grizzly bear (actually a man in a very unconvincing moth-eaten bear costume).\n\nAlso look out for a guy who looks a lot like John Candy (the jury is still out on whether the bloke in question is actually the portly Canadian comedian in an uncredited role, but I wouldn't have blamed Candy one bit for not owning up if it was him)."

However this is not one. Arnold himself would agree. But as a young 22 year old Austrian Bodybuilder's first film it's not his fault at the time he couldn't even speak full English.\n\nAs a comedy this film is hilarious I just played a little bit of the film for my friend and he fell to the ground laughing at the part where Arnie flys past the plane window. The editing is terrible sound keeps changing per frame (As a film student I would get failed for such sloppiness), the lines are cheesy but funny in an unintentional way and that bear fight.\n\nI guess the reason I find it so funny is it reminds me of the half assed films me and my friends have done bored when nobody can act and lines seem stupid.\n\nI urge you to watch this film at least once big Arn has come along way."

        "review_detailed_main": "With sets about as convincing as an F-grade porn production, acting so wooden you could easily pass it off as construction material and a soundtrack so ear-splittingly awful that it'll likely make you scream in agony, Hercules in New York is definitely a classic in the \"so bad it's good\" category. I'm giving it 2 stars on a \"real\" grade scale because of its camp appeal, but that doesn't mean it's not an entirely enjoyable film.\n\nThis is Arnold Schwarzenegger's first screen role, and you can really tell: his delivery is stiff as a frozen tree, his expression more dead than a zombie that's had its head removed, and his English is nearly incomprehensible gibberish that will make you laugh at every turn (\"I am tired of ze zame old zings!\").\n\nEverything else in this movie goes wrong too in about a 100,000 ways: for example, the gods are supposed to be Greek, but they often refer to their comrades by their Roman names, which were invented centuries after ancient Greece's prime. The effects are a riot: Look out especially for Zeus' \"lightning bolts\" and the unforgettable bear fight scene where Ahnuld fights some poor guy in a bear suit.\n\nEven the sound isn't right: you'll hear cars humming in the background during scenes that are supposed to be set on Mount Olympus and the dialogue is occasionally out of sync. But the crowning achievement of this film's awfulness has to be the soundtrack, which is basically one song playing during every important scene over and over and over again. Despite being completely hammered during watching this film, I still wanted to launch the DVD into outer space.\n\nRecommendation: In all seriousness, this film is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. But it is a marathon of laughs if you get hammered with your friends and pop this camp turkey in. Just remember what I said about the soundtrack."

I know it's Arnie's first movie, but he is awful. There is not one scene where there is any hint at a successful acting career in his future.\n\nSince the US production company went bankrupt, the movie was never released in theatres.\n\nIn his Autobiography Total Recall, Arnie recalls how he was thrilled to be paid $1,000 a week for his work on the movie, and best of all, he sent a photograph home to his parents saying \"You see? I told you this was going to work. I came to America, won Mr. Universe, and now I'm in the movies.\"\n\n3/10"

Hercules in New York was his first movie, at 22 he looks so young. But physically he looks incredible. This is a perfect opportunity to see him at this stage in his life, he frequently removes his top showing off his massive physique, plus of course plenty of muscle flexing. I know that this film got dubbed but thankfully my DVD actually has Arnie's real voice. He was nicknamed the Austrian Oak and acting doesn't come any more wooden than his performance here! His very thick Austrian accent is occasionally difficult to understand but I wouldn't have it any other way. Pairing up with Arnold Stang Herecules is a straight up comedy, silly and very cheap looking, but funny too. Shot entirely in New York the numerous scenes of the Gods and Goddesses on Mt. Olympus features the background sound of motor vehicles, very funny! Arnie versus the bear (man in bad suit) is one of the so bad it's funny scenes. I've seen most of Arnie's movies, The Terminator being my all time favourite movie, but this was my first time viewing Hercules. It is without question a bad movie but it has plenty of laughs and for fans of Arnie such as myself then it makes interesting viewing."

The actors playing the gods have no idea of the characters they are trying to play; I would have thought the Olympians to have kept up with the times. The music is also lousy and the plot is quite ridiculous as it goes no where. It merely circles Hercules confusion and disenchantment with modern civilization. Lets face it, Vanna White in \"Goddess of Love\" looks like Emmy material compared to this."

Anyway, the \"Greek god in modern NYC\" plot had comic potential to be sure but, despite the scarce felicities (Hercules is insulted on seeing an impostor posing as himself in a fictional sword-and-sandal flick playing in a movie theater), it is generally hopelessly squandered by the sheer amateurishness of it all.

Let me assure you it is on that list for a reason. It is not a good movie, or even an adequate movie. Here are the only reasons I can recall that would make it worth watching. Aarnold Swarzenager stars in it, but they dub his voice to make him sound American, which is especially awesome since he's Hurcules who would have been Greek. Also this movie had a gorilla in it who was VERY VERY clearly just a man in a gorilla suit... that was fairly awesome. Anyway, those are pretty much the high points of the movie.

Just as financial firms regularly turn losses into gains by multiplying their balance sheets by -1, this film uses awfulness as a deus ex machina to capture the profound depths of our mortal fallibility. Pretzie is the ultimate everyman, selling pretzels by the water and figuring out ways to nickel and dime everyone and pocket the loose book every now and then. But he gets into trouble and has moments of revelation and regret. Hercules' simplicity and god-like physique, as well as Monstro the Magnificent's lopsided hair cut, symbolize the yin and yang of life and death, bigness and smallness, truth and the GOP.\n\nThe frequent unfocusing of the shot shows that mankind's mind is frequently unfocused and Arnold's partially literate accent represents the garbled marbles we often use to express the inner desires of our hearts. On a daily basis we are tempted by god-like greatness but frequently fall short of the world's expectations for our bulbous necks and mountainous pecs. Hubris is a 1000lb barbell and it kills. So we are frail, so we must crawl.\n\nDon't be a long shot plunger. We can not temporize the mighty Zeus. This film must be cherished."

I detected the lameness of writing in about 30 seconds into the movie, at the beginning of the show, a short story line was put forth and it seemed to be written in a 3rd grade class. And it went downhill from there. The acting is over dramatic, and has the emotion of a chalk board. I have made more fun of this movie showing others how bad it is than to seriously contemplate actually watching it to the end. I would only recommended it to Collectors who must have every film with Arnold Strong (Swartzenegger) in their library."

To begin with it really freaked me out - seeing a young Arnie competing with an athlete at the discus, javelin and long jump. It didn't surprise me that Arnie outperformed him but it was really weird when he said he was from Greece! I had no idea what I was watching but now I know what it was and I've read all these other reviews I can't wait to see whole thing - especially the bear fight! I would recommend this to others just on the basis of my first five minutes enjoyment, thankfully I saw the version with Arnie's real voice which was wooden as usual ... Conan this was not but Hercules was a great start."

There's some fun action designed to showcase Herc's superhuman strength (and Schwarzenegger's physique obviously) intermixed with vision of Zeus (Graves who bares more than a passing resemblance to Frank Thring who could've also been perfect for the part) lamenting the plight of his son whose been permitted to visit earth after he complains about the sedentary lifestyle on Olympus.\n\nThe clean & jerk contest with Mr World Tony Carroll was a highlight for me, building some semblance of tension as the mighty Herc tries to elevate an impressive half-tonne of steel in a televised strong-man event as greedy gangsters watch on eager to convert Herc's incredible strength into an ongoing racket.\n\nFamiliar supporting cast features James Karen and Richard Herd in early career roles, whilst attractive theatre actress Tanny McDonald is effective playing the sarcastic Juno, adorning the throne at Zeus' right arm, intermittently dropping disapproving remarks about Herc of whom she is spiteful.\n\nLight, fun entertainment which I've seen alternately with Arnold's natural voice and with the painful dubbing, suffice to say neither is a masterpiece, although I personally found the undubbed version less irritating."

The comedy is dismal but the real laughs come from the sheer ineptitude of the film in every regard. The best bits are without doubt the wrestling match with a bear in the park, the costume is so poor that it looks like the bears head is in danger of coming off as Arnie gets stuck into it. I also loved the loud traffic in the background on mount Olympus and the underworld. I was weeping with laughter as Zeus made declarations about the peace and quiet of Olympus while someone in the background was blasting their car horn. Definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen but hilarious from start to finish. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned the entirely random flying rabbi at the end!"

If there is ANY benifit in this rediculous flick, is that you may get a great laugh out of it, and may even want the DVD so you get a good laugh with your friends.\n\nThis movie was done when Arnie was current in the world record book as the \"most perfectly developed man in human history\". (Quote: Guiness book of records)\n\nI gave it 1/10. But I would be tempted to give it more if you are turned on by sentimental starting points and/or movies for now famous movie stars"

I have to hand it to Arnold he took this awful experience and turned it into one of the most inspiring stories in all of Hollywood. Not that he will win any awards, but he at least makes movies I love to watch. Not to mention that he makes a pretty good living doing them. You've come along way Arnold, a true all-American story."

Here, I'll mention a few things that I especially noticed as bad:\n\nIn the fight at the wharf, you clearly see that the people who get pushed into the water stops at the edge, and then jumps into the water themselves. I guess they just found some workers at a ship nearby and offered them a dime each to take part in this scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis flick is only suitable for die hard-fans of muscle-flexing and bad German accents.

Gangs of New York has to be the worst film ever created. If you want to waste three hours of your life when you could be painting a black wall black again, then watching it dry, watch Gangs of New York.\n\nHercules in New York is a comedy, and should be viewed as such. If you've bought it for a couple of quid/bucks/yen/euros, and you've got a bunch of stoner friends round for a sesh on the pipe, tell them that this is a comedy, and they'll believe you. I found it hilarious. It taught me nothing about film, but its complete and utter shite-ness generated more laughs than a night at a comedy club - so in some respects, it is genius.

I'm not a fan of \"bad movies\", but I'd seen clips of this on television and it looked like an interesting debut for Arnie.\n\nThe clips I'd seen were dubbed by some American actor, which looks ridiculous now that Arnie has become so established. However the DVD only had the original Schwarzenegger soundtrack, which proved to be just as ridiculous. People complain about Arnold's accent now? It was so thick in this film, backed up with terrible acting (made his performance in \"Commando\" look Oscar-worthy), it's no wonder he was dubbed. You can barely understand a thing he says. As terrible as this is though, it's one of the main reasons to see this.\n\nThe concept of the film is ridiculous, it perhaps could've worked if it didn't take itself so seriously (ironically, it wouldn't have been as funny though). The thing that really disturbs me is that human beings conjured up this film, adult human beings. They wrote it, it was approved, people agreed to have a part in it, it was directed, it was shot, it was acted, it was edited, it was released, and people actually watched it.\n\nI only watched it once in its entirety, and that took a few sittings (despite its short length). It is mostly a very tedious experience. Thankfully there are some stand-out scenes that are absolutely (and unintentionally) hilarious. The bear wrestling scene for instance, it was like something from a Monty Python sketch. I found scenes like this were actually worth re-visiting, and the only reason anyone would want to keep this in their collection. I later sold it though, it just had no place on my shelf.\n\nOf course this film would be so much easier to dismiss (probably less ridiculous, and even more tedious), if it weren't for Arnie. It is the fact that he has since been cemented as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and this is where he started. Although he'd already established himself as a body builder at this point, he continued to win more contests, became a huge international movie star, is now the governor of California, and might even be President one day, all with a thick Austrian accent. Looking at \"Hercules in New York\" is a reminder, there's hope for us yet. 2/10"

The only thing that boosted this film for me was the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it. But to add insult they didn't even use Arnie's voice. This film just isn't worth the time of day, it should have been burnt the moment it was maid. Fancy not using Arnie's voice, what a disgrace!"

I watched it on recommendation recently and it had me stitches. There's so much to laugh at and so many hilariously stupid sequences that this is required and essential viewing for anyone. Regardless of whether the comedy is intentional or not, it's one of the most entertaining films ever.\n\np.s If you thought Arnie was bad in the 80's and 90's you should see him here. He's clearly trying his hardest, but he's so bad it makes you wonder if it's deliberate. I've seen slabs of concrete with better acting skills than this."

His amazed facial expressions during the scene where Hercules throws the discus and then the javelin are moving and touching. I love when that man opens his mouth in astonishment. It is too bad that he did not make any more substantial films, most likely because he was just fed up with stardom. Pretzi is a film character that will live on throughout the ages and Arnold would not have the fame that he does today without the amazing portrayal of Pretzi by the true Arnie, Arnold Stang."

How she became an actress is beyond me. Anyway if you want 90 minutes of unadulterated crap that will make you cry with laughter then check out Hercules in new york!"

I cant imagine why they dubbed Arnolds voice. I understood everything that he said in the movie. So funny movie! This is Arnolds mark in his career, I dontt mean Conan and Terminator, I mean this was ARNIES FIRST MOVIE EVER!If you are Arnie you just must see it!

Hercules in New York -- aka Hercules Goes Bananas -- is a classic! I don't understand how those who, like me, fall off their chair laughing can give this movie only one or two stars. A flick with this entertainment value should get a high rating, not a low one. I mean, do you not want to share the joy it brings with others? For me this one ranks up there with Plan 9 from Outer Space and Manos Hands of Fate as the best worst movie ever made. Ahnold should feel honored, and he has such a great sense of humor, I doubt he really wants to burn the copies -- I'm sure he showed it to his kids, and it will be passed on to his grandkids and great grandkids. Same with you. Wouldn't you like to see your grandkids's faces -- let's say, as teens, so they can be in on the joke -- when you show them one of your \"favorite movies\"? Not Apocalypse Now or Sleepless in Seattle, but Hercules Goes Bananas!\n\nOK, let's start with Ahnold. Yes, I think his is his first real dramatic movie, and I use \"dramatic\" only technically. I mean, this is pre-Conan, and you know what a wonderful actor he was in that. Then there's the voice dubbing. Now, in my copy, the voice has nothing to do with Arnold. (I know others insist it's his.) I hope your copy has this voice, because to hear it coming out of Ahnold's mouth is very, very moving. Then, there's the soundtrack. Bazuki music! What can I say? Then, there's Arnold Stang. Arnold Stang??? Stang was one of the more serviceable comic supporting actors of his day, which by the time he made this was long past. But never mind...to cast Stang as the sidekick reveals to me that the producers really didn't mean to make a serious movie. It's like casting Woody Allen for the part and making him play it straight. The result is beyond bizarre.\n\nWhat you do, if you're still young enough to have fun being silly, is to find a Friday night or Saturday afternoon and invite you best friends and have brewskies and weed and watch as this thing unfold.\n\nBy the way, I took off a point because, after all, it is terrible."

I won\u00b4t go into detail about the plot, but I can reveal that this was truly a masterpiece. It tells the classic story about a man who goes on a quest to find himself and to be reunited with his true love, and on his way he has to overcome various obstacles to reach his goal. What more can you possibly ask for?\n\nIf your a fan of movies made that are made by people who truly believe in their work, if your an Arnold enthusiast, if you were touched by Titanic, if you love action scenes where the film makers have used the forward button to create the effect of a car driving fast - then this movie will be guaranteed a top spot on your personal top ten!\n\nIn other words if your a b-movie fanatic, do not miss this movie!"

People in Germany must cry because of laughing when watching the movie and especially listening to Schwarzenegger's English with Austrian pronunciation.

First, you hear on the police report that the bear is a \"grizzly,\" one of the largest and most aggressive bears in the US. When the camera pans over the cage where the bear was held, the sign distinctly says \"black bear,\" a much tamer species. Then we actually see the bear. Or, at least I think we do. It looks more like a small ape with a bear's head. Probably because it's a guy in a really horrible bear suit. Ah-nuld proceeds to lay the smack-down. Hilarious scene. And then there is Hercules' sidekick, a Jewish guy named Arnold Stang, and the most stereotypical Jewish character ever. It's terrible, but ironically funny. What's even more strange is that the director and the producer were both presumably Jewish, and yet they wrote in a ridiculously stereotypical Jew.\n\nThis movie jumps into my number one spot of \"Movies that are so bad they are great,\" leaping over \"The Scorpion King.\""

Arnold\n\nfilms are like marmite, you either love them, or hate them, and it doesn't matter what you feel about it, it's always because the films are crap. obviously this isn't enjoyable because of how great a film it actually is, it's because of how bad it is. so, if that kind of thing has the potential to make you laugh, then you will definitely be entertained with this one. but if you simply do not find Arnold like bad films funny, and only like film that are actually good, then you'll be terribly disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "o you know why Arnold is flexing? Because this is the first ever film starring the then- aspiring bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact, this is the only thing that he is doing the right way in the whole movie-flexing.arnold is flexing\n\nArnold's debut motion picture is a raw and hilarious representation of the young version of one of the most successful men in the world.\n\nSchwarzenegger's evident lack of on- screen experience make this movie looks more like a documentary on bodybuilding.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nThe plot:\n\nTaking place back in 1970 when Arnold is still an adolescent, the movie tells us the story of the powerful gods of Olympus- the home of the Greek Gods.\n\nThe plot centers more on the life of Zeus and mostly on his son Hercules (guess from the first time, which Austrian oak took the role).\n\nThe young Hercules is spending his glorious but boring adolescence in Olympus- a kingdom far above the clouds among his divine family. One day he decides to disobey his father's will and escapes to earth.\n\nThere, he is starting to explore things he has never experienced before- he falls in the trap of love and he struggles to become an undisputed bodybuilding champion.\n\nThe cast:\n\nWhat cast?! Only Arnold is important here. He is also the only known name in the production.\n\nIn fact, by the time, he was only a young bodybuilder who was trying to make his way to the Hollywood top, just like many other aspiring actors with a certain amount of self-esteem.\n\nThis is a Funny Action Movie because:\n\nLike previously noticed, this is the first Arnold movie ever! He is so inexperienced in acting that you risk to have shortness of breath from laughter while watching the young Austrian desperately trying to be an actor.\n\nOriginally, Schwarzenegger's voice was dubbed because he barely spoke English at the time. Later, however, when the DVD version was released, his own voice was included in the movie.\n\nIt won't be far from truth to state that once the DVD version of the film was released, it gained international success. It is just my personal opinion here but I believe that it is due to the fact that then, for the first time, the world heard Arnold's legendary and ridiculous Austrian accent. And that changed everything.\n\nThe plot is so primitive, the directing so poor and the acting so bad that it hurts. The whole movie is a complete nonsense from the beginning to the very end.\n\nIt is like someone decided on Tuesday to make a movie and on Wednesday it was all wrapped up and ready to be on screen.\n\nThe cast is disturbingly inappropriate and the acting is pathetic.\n\nBut wait!\n\nIsn't it exactly what we are looking for? That's right. That is the whole idea of it.\n\nIt is a sick fun and be sure that it is enjoyable. Arnold's accent is terribly hilarious and God forbid, don't watch this movie dubbed!\n\nJust experience Arnold crying out like a five year old retarded child \"I am Hercules\" a thousand times or \"No man is superior to Hercules\". The accent, combined with his funny face moves can easily make you go into spasms of laughter.\n\nMake sure that you don't miss the part at the beginning of the movie when he complains to his mighty father Zeus that he is \"tired of the zame old zings, the same old facezz\".\n\nAt this time, you won't be sure if by the end of the movie Hercules will become bodybuilding champion but somehow you feel that he will definitely win the \"who got the most ridiculous accent\" competition.\n\nThe funniest part is when Hercules is walking on the street along with his hot date and spots a bodybuilding competition poster with some tough man on the cover.\n\nHe immediately goes angry and jealous. With the blink of an eye, he tears up his tight t-shirt and starts flexing his giant muscles in order to prove to his girlfriend that his is the God of the gym. He moves like a wounded panda. It is truly spectacular to observe.\n\nAnother great scene is the scene with the bear. The extraordinary muscular Schwarzenegger takes his girl on a romantic carriage ride. All of a sudden, a bear comes out of nowhere and stands in front of the carriage roaring loud and menacing the lives of the couple in love.\n\nWhat do you think happens?\n\nArnold jumps off the carriage and starts a spectacular one on one fight with the bear. I won't put spoilers here. I would just mention that the animal activists might get angry.\n\nDuring the whole movie Arnold's expressionless gaze and stiff acting are combined with the boring and inappropriate soundtrack, dramatically dull actors and poor directing. The dialogue is also very, very bad.\n\nConclusion:\n\nNot only this is a must-see movie but if you ask me, it even should be included in your bucket list right after the \"parachute diving\" check off.\n\nSeriously, this gem perfectly serves its purpose-to distract you, to make you feel good and to make you laugh no matter if you are an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan or not.\n\nwww. funny action movies.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I first heard about this movie when it was reviewed on Cinematic Excrement, an online show that I enjoy very much. Then one day, I was walking down the aisles of Walgreens when I saw this in their DVD selection. I had no money at the time, so I didn't get it. Then, in May, I was walking down the aisles of Walgreens, but this time, I had four bucks to kill! So instead of blowing it on candy, I blew it on this movie, and it was a four bucks worth blowing. This film is very enjoyably bad. Arnold's acting is very wooden, and I always make fun of the way he says \"Hercules\". The budget looks very TV movie-Esq. I love Zeus, even though he looks like he really doesn't want to be in this movie. I love how the fight scenes are barely fight scenes, they're either pushing or tossing. The editing is very bad, as well, mainly the scene where Hercules is showing off his \"mad\" Olympic-like skills. We see him jump, then people with wide-opened mouths, and then Arnold land.\n\nIt's a shame that this movie isn't celebrated like the way I do. It should be worshiped for how bad it is, like Plan 9 or Manos. I say, whenever there's a new movie about Herc coming on TV or to theaters, forget that and pop in this flick!"

I find them rather annoying, and I wonder what society has come to when a man with the all-around ineptitude of Schwarzenegger gains the demigodhood moviegoers have known him for. \"Hercules in New York\" is an exception. Not because it's a good movie--it's definitely horrible. But it does have an unintended laughter quality that redeems it.\n\nIt's common knowledge that this is Ah-nold's first movie. Fresh off his bodybuilding days but pre-steroid abuse (you can tell these things by looking at him), he is Hercules, half-mortal and half-god son of Zeus, king of the Olympian gods. Well, kinda. There's a crapload of stuff taken from other myths as well. Anyway, Hercules has lived on Mt. Olympus for thousands of years, and is bored. So against Zeus' wishes, he goes down to Earth to have some fun.\n\nBy now, you gotta be thinking, \"what a stupid plot.\" True. The acting is also mostly, but totally, bad. There's also really bad dialog. And the action scenes look like a the writer based them off a playing session two children had with action figures.\n\nBut that's the charm. You'll laugh throughout the movie, particularly young Arnold's miserable attempts at acting. It's the kind of movie that you'll laugh at, make fun of, and have a howling good time watching. Particularly when Arnold is driving a chariot and wrestling an obviously fake bear that moves like a gorilla.\n\n\"'Hercules in New York' is the touching tale of an Austrian bodybuilder who thinks he is a Greek demigod. he doesn't fit in, but a little bad dialog and flexing of his body gain him instant adulation.\"\n\nYeah, that's the kind of bashing you might give this movie.\n\nSo go get a bag of popcorn, a bag of popcorn, and enjoy this movie. Hey, you should; it spawned a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Agh..."

It's cheesy, it's poorly directed, it's sometimes difficult to keep up with what's going on and the \"Action\" scenes look like they were Choreographed by a six year old.
