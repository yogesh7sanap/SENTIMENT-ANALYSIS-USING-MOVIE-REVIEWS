        "review_detailed_main": "2 things: Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. Two of the finest people in their craft when join hands, you can expect nothing short of a BLOCKBUSTER, in every sense of the word. Saw this movie first day, first show and might I add the occupancy of the theater was about 60% for a 10:00 am show. That speaks for itself about the enthusiasm that people had about the movie. The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir's best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don't think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt's. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"

Amir Khan's acting is brilliant as always. Whoever wrote this story had given it much thought on the basic idea as it was thought provoking and tries to shatter the root of evil in our religious society.\n\nBut the upper layers of the story were like any other Indian movie, with same emotional drama in awkward places, a love story, an evil guy who gets ridiculed, etc. Thus the movie couldn't get too deep. It couldn't deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn't feel bored. Songs are right on spot and creates a good mood.\n\nThe movie also makes you realize how colorful, beautiful yet complex Indian society is. If you liked the movie Oh my god! then I am sure you would like this too. Worth a watch anyway."

But anyways, despite knowing the plot I still went to see the movie, that too First day first show. The moment I saw the plot becoming real within the first 10 minutes, I was skeptical whether I will like this movie. But to my surprise Aamir Khan blew me away with his incomparable acting skills and cuteness of the character. He will make you feel as if you are looking at a child who has been introduced in the world for the first time but has a consciousnesses. The main subject of the movie or so to say the \"Strong Message\", has been adapted by many movies before but PK stands far out from any of them. This movie will make you laugh but also make you cry. My year definitely ended with such a present from Rajkumar Hirani."

Not only Aamir, but Anushka Sharma and Sanjay Dutt did a very good job of their character which I think no one could have done.

As a lover for good cinema I am in my strong opinion that this film has no outstanding acting, direction or story which will allow it to be the top film (250) of all time. The story of this film is mediocre with nothing exceptional in it. The worst part of this film is the direction. Comparing to Rajkumar Hirani's other film, this film is poorly directed and i blame him alone for this bad review."

        "review_title": "A slickly written part two of OH MY GOD with more focus on entertainment, coming just at the right time talking about the right things with some routine flaws.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Revealing the gist in the first line itself (with a purpose), yes PK is a slickly written, engaging film once again talking about that Supreme Power post OH MY GOD (2012), focusing more on providing entertainment and less on the emotional depth required by the important subject honestly. No, the film is not in the same league of Raj Kumar Hirani's earlier three brilliant films to be straight. But since it talks about the right things at the right time in a rare comical tone making the much needed impression, I would like you all to watch it before reading the review as a must.\n\nThe first half of the film is full of many enjoyable sequences that at once remind you of few famous jokes read at the social networks, like remember that picture of sleepers having a lock keeping them together so that they don't get stolen in front of a temple or few enlightening jokes mixing two or more Gods together. Beginning with a very amateurish kind of love relationship developing overnight between Anushka and Sushant, it never gives you a dull moment before intermission with Aamir Khan speaking in a different hilarious tone, making brilliant face expressions, raising many thoughtful doubts on the existence of GOD.\n\nHowever the same cannot be said about its second half as here we go the same clich\u00e9d way with nothing novel as per the concept is concerned, having a completely predictable love angle thrown in (with the alien) thankfully not given too much footage in the narration. The last hour keeps reminding you of OH MY GOD with many similar settings and then the end offering few well-written twists and turns (involving the letter) brings smiles on your faces and tears in the eyes too as always expected from a Raj Kumar Hirani climax unconditionally. But overall, despite having that emotional end with another surprising cameo of a big star and all fixed ingredients of a Hirani film, PK is not able to give you that huge creative satisfaction, experienced in Hirani's earlier three films creating a big chemical locha in your hearts while walking out of the theaters.\n\nIn the performances section, no doubt, Aamir plays his part extremely well making the best use of his odd ears. He simply excels as the alien and doesn't let you think about the flaws throughout the film leading from the front. Carrying the film all alone Aamir gets some fine support from Anushka Sharma, who once again proves her effortless mastery in playing such lively characters. Sushant Singh Rajput impresses in his few scenes, whereas Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani are not given any great roles to play quite surprisingly. Particularly it was really disappointing to see Boman Irani doing such an unimportant role after playing the lifeline of all three Hirani films till date, enacting three unique characters considered as benchmarks in the field of acting. Moreover here we have Parikshit Sahni once again doing the similar role of a father as seen in Hirani's previous movies along with Ram Sethi (Pyarelal) making a lovable cameo too.\n\nMusic remains another weaker section of PK as I couldn't remember even one song while walking out of the theater. And that certainly wasn't the case in any of Hirani's earlier films. Yes both the lyricists and the singers have done their job very well but it was the melody I couldn't find in most of the songs in the soundtrack putting it honestly. To pick out a few its \"Chaar Kadam\" and \"Bhagwan\" sounding fine while watching the film, mainly due to their fabulous rendition by the talented singers. Adding to the comparatively weaker departments, this time neither the cinematography nor the background score was able to make some major contribution in the film quit unexpectedly.\n\nComing to the major disappointment I felt while watching PK, first of all I wasn't really expecting a part two of OH MY GOD offering all seen before kind of sequences and dialogues. In fact this really puts me in doubts that whether Hirani had this idea of using the concept of GOD in his film before the release of OMG or developed it after that film getting some clear inspirations from its famous scenes. Having said that PK still has one big edge over OMG when it maintains the dignity of the concept of GOD as it is and doesn't interfere in its existence dragging him down to the earth giving it any commercial form.\n\nAdding to my disappointments, no doubt PK is a slickly written, well edited film with only few dragging moments in the second half. Still I cannot rate it above any of the three Hirani films seen earlier as it does lack that novel punch and falters in many sequences making it a forceful attempt (in its dialogues too) put together."

In OMG , you can't think of some one better than Paresh sir, in PK any one could have acted better than AK. Music is OK, as there are far less songs in the movie than the entire album. Cheap vulgarity was not needed in the otherwise clean movie. Why AK and directors are hell bent on such road-side vulgarity is beyond comprehension. Comedy scenes are good and fits well in the story line. The starting of the movie is terrific and I should say out of the world.\n\nWe expected a lot from talented director like Raju Hirani who gave us Munna Bhai series. But he failed miserably this time.\n\nImprovement areas ----------------\n\nPK can fetch whats going on in your mind by touching you. Imagine PK cant touch anyone for more than few seconds, and to understand Indian culture, he touches people of different languages, culture etc. He gets his mind messed up, and start speaking mixture of languages while talking.\n\nMovie talks only about GOD.

There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation because of the small star cast and low marketing."

It's rare to see a film that bounces between humor & sentiment so seamlessly .aamir khan has done many challenging roles in his career but #Pk is beyond imagination!!!Aamir khan acting is just beyond imagination his career best performance !!!! \u202a#PK\u202c he'll make u laugh, cry, amuse, provoke.. all at the same time!!You experience the whole gamut of emotions, and end up saluting the makers. First time as a \u202a#critic\u202c I feel some films are better experienced as a \u202a#discussion\u202c rather than as a critical analysis and #PK is among them. Writer director \u202a#RajuHirani\u202c like every time presents a new thought. His strength as filmmaker is his honesty, his intention n his simplicity. \u202a#AamirKhan\u202c has done many challenging roles in his career but #Pk is beyond imagination. His performance has to be experienced!The efforts taken by Raju Hirani to raise fundamental questions bout human belief system requires loads of courage n extensive research #PK. The uniqueness of Raju Hirani lies in making a pertinent point on the social fabric of the country n yes ensure relentless entertainment. Hirani touches our heart and mind at the same time. Yet again. Raju Hirani, you short little genius !!. Anushka Sharma springs a refreshing surprise.She shines brilliantly as an actress. Sushant Singh Rajput is extremely endearing in a cameo while Sanjay Dutt is all heart...The fat barber will emerge as a Rock star soon. If you're looking for a rare experience of emotion packed message n quality entertainment then #PK won't disappoint you.Enjoy Its truly your best performance till date!!! This movie couldn't have been better timed seeing the 'change' our country is going through. Entire movie hall went gaga over it. \u202a#PKaaya\u202c What a fantastic movie.. you're really done a superb work.. what a performance. Wonderful. #AamirKhan great, \u202a#AnushkaSharma\u202c adorable. Still singing \"Love is a Waste of Time.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "When we hear Aamir Khan working on a movie from Rajkumar Hirani, we expect something original, something unique. But this was a letdown. I failed to understand how Hirani spent 5 years after '3 Idiots' to write a script propping itself up shamelessly on the theme of 'Oh my God'. Not unexpectedly, the religion chosen to convey disdain for religious practice is, of course, the most docile one. It was a laugh-riot, no doubt when the protagonist reaches Earth and is stumped by the idiosyncratic religious practices. Aamir Khan did well but in some scenes labored & exerted more than required. Anushka Sharma was peppy and posh. However the subplot involving her romance with a gentleman (Sushant Rajput) was a sort of a distraction. Really the director was not sure of the strength of the main storyline and had to introduce such subplots. Also we should note that glaring mis-cast: Parikshit Sahni looked grandpa to Anushkha, not her father! Equally surprising was the under- utilization of Boman Irani.\n\nAlso noteworthy was a sudden introduction without rhyme or reason of a lecture on sex and condoms. Agreed that a condom sponsor may have insisted on this, but this is not something I expect of Aamir. The whole audience was decidedly squirming. And what about the dancing cars? Is this become the standard operating procedure in India? Pretty gross and utterly unnecessary.\n\nA let down even for an ardent follower of Aamir. Amen!"

At this point I had never heard of Aamir Khan nor was I up to date on who's who in the zoo in Bollywood, (even though I had seen Slumdog Millionaire--what a film) nor had I had any intention of seeing a foreign film-- let alone a foreign film called PK. I asked myself, \"what is this?\" So, I read the description of the film, and a description never gives away much of the film, but I said I have to see this one, I don't understand what its about nor is it in my language, but I have to see it--perfect, this is the film I want to see--lets take a chance tonight. I really didn't want to go see mainstream film (that would be the first thing in theaters that's playing)--how boring. So, I decided to go see this film. I believe that night I was the only non-Indian present inside the theater. Let me tell you, I was meant to be there that night. It was a divine appointment. It was as if GOD Himself said to me, \"I love you--it's going to be alright\". The more I watched, the more I laughed and cried. It was all in subtitles, but this film was a BIG BLESSING for my life that night, and continues to be. This film became very personal for me. Everything that was discussed, everything that was addressed, I just felt in my heart to be true. BIG important questions asked in this film. I was out of my comfort zone, and I was loving every second of it. To the crew that thought, wrote, and made this film--I applaud you. Thank you for being a part of my life that night, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of yours. This is a very elemental, yet extremely profound film. BRAVO."

Some of the controversial scenes are 1)\" Aamir khan putting gods sticker on his face and comparing with saving walls from p*ssing. 2) Continuously ridiculing stone worshiping by cracking joke like battery is down in God, How much cost of this God. One more scene where Aamir fought with a man which was in God shankar get up. These were all in regard to controversies now question is whether this film delivers? The answer is a big NO. This movie neither entertaining nor has any social message. I think director made this movie controversial deliberately so that film can be successful There is no logic in the Movie. If you go by acting Aamir scored a big zero, Anishka is OK, only good part is Saurabh shukla.\n\nSome of the goofs of the Movie(which this movie is fulled of but i am naming only few): 1)Anushka(Hindu) girl loves Sushant (Pakistani Muslim man) and decided to marry in church. 2)Aamir an alien falls in love with a human(anushka). 3) Anushka and sushant broke up while reading a letter which they thought sent by the other(Now thats i call a stupidity). More stupidity its Alien Aamir who got to know after reading Anishka mind with touch but wait a minute how Aamir got to know who has written the letter and how sarfaraz was innocent. he can only read Anushka mind not sarfaraz. Thats director left it on the public."

History shows us that people were killed by talking about religion but Rajkumar Hiriani raised the same issue in real mature manner. PK showed the world that religion is not a property of people, instead it belongs to everyone. PK also taught me that best human being would be the one who serves humanity and not the one who is religious. Although the main story is somewhat similar to OMG, (Oh My God), it approaches the subject differently. Romance between Amir and Anushka did not add anything to the story. The development of the story was little slow but it never got boring. The songs were intelligently made, especially love is a waste of time was the best. I really appreciate the way Mr. Hiriani approached the subject. This movie shows that how to forget all the differences between us and live like human beings on this planet that we call home. Comparing this movie with 3 idiots would not be fair as they both are totally different movies, with different audience. I really enjoyed watching this movie. Definitely worth watching."

No God ever instructed to worship only him/her in any religious scribe. No God has ever written about themselves, it Humans who create story & write about god. The holy books of all these religions were not written by their respective gods.\n\nHow did the early man come up with the idea of God? It has evolved over time...that seemed to focus more on the philosophical aspects of god. Life is Motion towards Knowledge & God is Complete Positive energy which one gets following the Past Knowledge, symbolization of our inner strength, morality, character & motivation for more creativity to follow...Fear & uncertainty of life is a basic instinct. It is present in every animal's mind. To overcome this fear we seek positive thoughts & reference, which is Knowledge (God). This positive reference (\"God\") is present in every culture, Evolution, and time period.\n\nToday, we don't know what dark matter and dark energy are, we don't know why there is a matter- antimatter imbalance, and we don't know how the combination of matter, dark matter, and dark energy keeps the universe from collapsing on itself or the objects inside to fly off in different directions, and this vitality of the universe is attributed to the Brahman or Tat (simply means \"that\"). The Vedas go to a great length trying to explain this, but leave many portions as questions, for the future learners to investigate. However, it does say that the end result is beyond the comprehension of the human mind...the most important thing is that it explicitly encourages only and only scientific inquiry to gain knowledge. It is the human interest and fascination with paradoxes that fuel both science and magical thinking, how can things be as we know they are one day, and the next day with new technology, be something else? The pursuit of God is the pursuit of meaning, the pursuit of Knowledge is the pursuit of truth.\n\nExample: The concept of God is introduced to children's mind so that they think that there is someone to control and punish them. Every parent tries to increase their child's confidence in writing exams by telling that God may help them in it if they study well. The concept of God may help one to become a better man and lead a peaceful life. This is the Psychological concept of God and plays a significant role in most people's life."

The second half was really disappointing to the point that you stop trusting the protagonists because at certain moments, the logic is forced upon you and the conversations are suddenly dragged out of context so that they could lead you to the logic that director wants to convey.\n\nIt seemed as if the second half was directed by some other director who puts in typical bollywood style drama, logic, and emotions that is hard to connect with.\n\nThis was Aamir Khan's best ever performance and all the other actors did a great job too.\n\nPeople who are religious or superstitious or who don't think much are going to enjoy the movie because the questions raised by PK in the movie would seem witty and eye-opener to them, but it would be boring for those who observe, think and those who are atheists."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's something that you usually experience after watching an Aamir Khan Film - You always have a smile on your face after you have experienced it.\n\nThe second minute into the movie, and you know that something's out of the box in the movie. After around 10 minutes, you start realizing why Aamir Khan is such a versatile and gifted artist. As soon as he comes on the screen, you get attached to his role. He single handedly carries the entire first half of the movie on his shoulders. Such amazing is his screen presence that you would hardly notice any other character in the movie's first half. Having said that, all the other actors in the movie have played their role amazingly, especially Saurabh Shukla. The innocence and cuteness of both Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma will make you feel very good. The film has some naturally funny scenes that have been implemented amazingly. At one moment there is an emotional scene, and the very next moment there's comedy. Though its not an out and out comedy, but its got enough humor to keep your laughing bones tickling, especially one long comical sequence when PK visits different holy places. The second half is also quite good, maybe I thought the last 15 minutes or so were a bit extended although it was there for conveying a different message. And thats the reason why I went with 9. Overall, Aamir Khan is a treat to watch and it might perhaps be his best ever performance. Anushka, Sushant, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla have played their roles equally well (Saurabh Shukla deserves a special mention).\n\nHaving said that you cant take away the credit from one of the country's finest director - Rajkumar Hirani. The direction is superlative and each shot has been executed amazingly. He has proved why he is the king of humor. The scenes switch from extremely emotional to comical with such an ease. Both Raju and Abhijat Joshi have spent considerable time in imagining each and every scene. They have written an almost perfect script. Thumbs up to both of them. Raju, you are a true master.\n\nThe music is situational and carries on with the film. You'll surely appreciate the music after watching the movie. The song 'Love is a Waste of Time' has been continuously humming in my mind since I've come out of the theater.\n\nSo Guys, go to the theaters nearby and experience the movie. The movie has some strong messages, and some smaller messages as well. Its been a long time a masterpiece had arrived in bollywood."

A high expectation and eagerness to see Aamir in a new avatar. Coming to the movie So Aamir has done very well to his role, he will make you laugh and make you cry, a very childish and innocent guy who is trapped in the Earth and cannot go home. Where as Anushka has also done pretty well with small hair. Some comedy scenes and laughing moments in the movie, it will also make you very emotional sometime. Sanjay Dutt's role was cut short and Booman Irani role was also not used very much. After seeing the movie it seemed to me a combo of Oh My God. The plot started with a Alien lost his device to making a statement at the end that Muslims don't cheat people. The Social message is exceptionally well shown in the movie. Aamir has been shown eating lots of Paan in the movie but it has nothing to do with him as it shown in the movie trailer. Expected this movie to be a Materpeice but i got a bit disappointed. Found so many Errors and mistakes in the movie. I am not criticizing the movie, You will find yourself find it when you watch it. Thou it was worth watching PK."

With lots of moments in the movie are true and acceptable to common man it seemed like a dig at one particular religion. PK does well in entertaining the crowd with a dig at a middleman-to-god business but taking a slightly derogatory tone to overall reverence for the almighty. While devotion to one god or religion is a very personal matter and when there is a fear or lack of hope misdirected and unwanted middleman may crop up - the whole devotion to god and acts to reach the god may be disputed. PK fails to address this in totality. Good effort but seems misdirected. Aamir has helped the movie or killed it - that's it really."

Throughout the film, it seems to focus on the point about religious beliefs and their impacts on people. It explores this theme throughout the entire movie. Though I don't have a problem with exploring the theme of religion, I felt it could have explored more themes that would have contrasted the alien's way of life to ours and asked other more profound questions about our world.\n\nAs the story progresses, the protagonist seems to fall for the lead actress, a sweet and heartfelt story with a sad undertone that ended the movie on a positive note in my book.\n\nOverall, the movie was not very comedic but showed an interesting perspective, \"When humans say they love chicken and fish, they don't mean they love those animals. They mean they love eating them.\" But I wish it could have explored other themes of human society."

But now a days we are concentrating more to protect religion. Surely if God created this whole universe then He has got enough power to protect himself. We don't need to quarrel or don't need to bomb people in the name of God. Instead if we help each other to solve problems and sufferings, we surely can create a better world for us and for coming generations. There is no sign in a newborn baby which can surely indicate he/she is a Hindu,Muslim or Christian. First we are all human beings then we shall think about religion. Rajkumar Hirani is one of the best directors and he delivered the message in a very unique artistic way that every Indian will love to watch this. Songs are good,Amir Khan was equally good in the character of PK, Anushka looked sexy and bubbly. I just liked her smile and energy. All over the movie was more than satisfactory. A must watch."

Aamir Khan obviously delivers one of the best all time performances and Anushka sharma , Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Dutt and all others just add to it.\n\nCons: The film doesn't have much heavy weight dialogues which may become memorable and iconic and at some parts, it appears to repeat Oh My God."

PK has everything in it Drama, emotion as well as a inspirational message. It appeals emotionally.\n\nStar casting has been done aptly in the movie. I would say thumbs up to Raj kumar hirani's movie making skills. Movie equivalent or rather say better than 3 idiots.\n\n10/10 From my side"

He has proved again the successful hero to be bridge between class and crowd. This movie will definitely attract huge mass in theater along with class. Aamir starer movie is a good satire to our traditional disbelief along with good flavor of romance.. Some lines and scenes that has touched me are -\n\n1. Love if was such, holding the hand, you would know the feelings going on in the heart of yours love, you would find million of way to make him/her happy.. (Scene - Aamir knows Anuskha's secret after holding her hand)\n\n2. Believe the god who created us, not the god whom we created. (Scene- during the climax scene \"Ek Sawal aur\")\n\n3. Love and romance are limited to inside room closing the door but war and violence are open in the public. (last dialouge)\n\n4. A person's image has also no value unless money comes (Scene- Aamir trying to make exchange with Gandhi photo)\n\n5. Ultimately truth will disappear no matter what is your effort. (Scene- Aamir lying he doesnot love Anushka )\n\nand a funny line just for fun-\n\n6. OH god, girls are really dangerous, even Alien had to cry for a girl\n\nI strongly recommend all people to watch this class movie.. After 3 idiots, Bollywood has finally delivered a movie for class and crowd together"

        "review_detailed_main": "What I Love about PK: We are all in search of god, but no one does it the way PK does. He would make you laugh but also melt your heart and finally steal it away. Aamir Khan is the best thing about PK (I think Bollywood too!!). With the innocence and curiosity of a little child enters PK into this big bad world ('Gola' as he refers to it in the movie). In his search for God, to get his stuff back from him, PK takes us through the journey of emotions, blind beliefs, superstitions and truth. PK delivers a terrific performance and his Bhojpuri accent is like cherry on cake. He holds on to it beautifully during the entire movie and never for even a moment gets out of his character. With the kind of perfectionist Aamir is, you will not come home watching an Aamir Khan movie, rather you would be back home after meeting PK.\n\nRajkumar Hirani is another shining star of the movie. He is one of the rare Bollywood directors, who actually can create magic on- screen. And in this movie he actually proves it. I love the execution of the Climax. The way the truth is revealed to the characters inside the film, similarly it is revealed to us. It makes you think, how a mind is conditioned to see only what it knows or believes and conveniently avoids justified logic and the other side of the truth. It's comes across like Pure Magic! So little that we get to see Sanjay Dutt these days, that the little guest appearance that he did as 'Bharon singh' also exhilarated me. He sure was well placed in the story and a delight to watch. What I thought was Average: With a rating of 4.5, there is hardly anything to write in this section. However, the music although sweet to your ears is not very memorable one. With 'chaar kadam' being the only song that I would play in repeat mode in my car, the rest of them are good enough, just when you are watching them in the movie. However a special mention to 'bhagwan hai kaha'. Sonu nigam strikes gold again. This song in the movie made me cry the most! Anushka was good but not great. I think she has a lot of scope of improvisation. Also something peculiarly unusual with her lips does not get unnoticed in the movie as well!\n\nWhat I did not like: We all fondly remember 'Virus' from 3 idiots and 'Dr Asthana' from Munnabhai MBBS. Sadly when I came home after watching the film, I could not even recall name of Boman Irani's character. Mr Irani is a great actor and he can even make regular roles memorable ones. He wasn't offered much to deliver in this one. Maybe he was just like a lucky Mascot to Hirani's movies. That is the only thing I did not like in PK.\n\nTake home message: If you are a Bollywood fan or a Hollywood fan or a movie fan in general, don't dare to miss PK. One of Aamir Khan's finest performance and undoubtedly the best movie of 2014. Also it might just change the perception of the way one seeks God!"

Go Aamir! PK is certainly nothing you have ever seen before. Keeping in mind that suspense is a key element here I will not disclose any spoilers.\n\nWhen a heartbroken Jagat Janini (Anushka Sharma) returns to India from Bruges, she meets the unusual PK (Aamir Khan) and tags along with him on his journey. She is a journalist who is trying to find a story worth telling but what she finds in PK is much more than a story but a dear friend who is stuck in a problem that she will help him solve.\n\nPK is a satire on God and Godmen and also on certain simplistic ways of living that we put up with and when a stranger called PK questions these beliefs and ideas, the lives of Jagat Janini and all around her are about the film"

I seriously doubt that. Lagaan and 3 Idiots are miles ahead in terms of his performance.\n\nThe movie boasts of some really good scenes. And yes, I enjoyed it in parts.

Throughout the movie you shall laugh - cry and at times clap out of the genius that is depicted. Might Remind you of OMG a bit but is exceptionally well written, filmed and Enacted. AAMIR may have his Magnum Opus. Other characters too made their mark. A must watch for anyone who is taking wild guesses at individuals and stereotypes.

Our hero has lost his only means to return home and is told during his search for it to \"ask god\" for assistance. But which god? There are so many, and so many different ways to worship them. Can they all lead to the same answer or all they all a sham? During his quest he meets Jaggu, a reporter for a local news station. They develop strong friendship which leads to making them both complete once again.\n\nThe last Indian culture based movie that I saw was Slumdog Millionaire. This is nothing like that at all. PK is funny, sad, prophetic, and will even bring a tear to your eye. I didn't expect to see the musical and dance sequences as part of this story, and they were all just fantastic.\n\nThis is one the most enjoyable movies that I've seen recently. See it today!"

It was a refreshing and welcoming change to usual Bollywood cinema, and a path I think more filmmakers should consider venturing on. I did not expect Indian cinema to focus on concepts of religion and faith to this degree, but I have nothing but positive opinions of the manner in which this film was made.\n\nThis film is funny, heart warming and eye opening. PK's naivety and innocence is a strong attempt in restoring faith in humanity more than ever. It questions the man made boundaries of religion and faith and leaves the viewers wondering about humanity, religion and other aspects touched upon in the film. Although the film is filled with humorous moment, the deeper significance is as bold as ever. I loved this film for Aamir's acting and the concepts it experimented with. Actually, all the major roles were quite well performed. With the humor and distinct Bolly-ness of the film, it caters to the audience that looks for a good laugh and at the same time the film also caters to those looking for substance and meaning. I would definitely consider it to be a bold move in Indian cinema, one that sets the bar very high. My top 5 films of the year for sure!"

But majorly PK's script deals with it from totally different perspective and the message comes out even more clearly in a very simple statement \u2013 'Watch out for wrong numbers!!'\n\nPK also brushed through the issue of Indian stigma on Sex. But I would encourage the readers to NOT leave their Kids at home because of this. Take them along. It's much much less vulgar than the Item numbers coming on your television set.\n\nOverall the movie has lot many laughing sequences, dancing car as one\u0085 hilarious!! Second half is quite serious and at a point it gets too heavy that few of us may start losing interest. Well thanks to the underlying message and the Acting (spl. Aamir Khan), you are continuously kept attached.\n\nFinally, I would say it's a 'Good Movie' definitely a must watch with Family \u2013 4 out of 5."

It is nice to see an acclaimed director and actor doing social satire, but I felt if they had done it in more subtle way, it would have been better. Story goes on monotonously attacking religious rituals and god men. It could be relevant. But there are other movies in bollywood and regional cinema which done a better job. The director took very mature efforts to express his social views in previous attempts. He made us to reflect upon our health care system in 'Munna bhai MBBS' and educational system in '3 idiots'. As we watch the film we realize this time his target is some religious practices. Everything is okay, but it is very peripheral and rather biased. What is the need for sub plots with Muslim character from Pakistan? Come on man, if you want to express concerns of 'Islamophobia' let me remind that India has a larger Muslim population and he very well could have been from India. I feel it was simply included to appease viewers from Pakistan. Music and back ground score is mediocre. The film may have actors with caliber, but this film is not their best. I don't find anything exceptional in Amir khan's portrayal of alien. I am surprised to see so many praises expressed for this movie made and acted by some talented people.But it is sad that people give in to hero worshiping, when the movie itself talks against irrational worship."

A movie expected to be a super hit much before its release because of Aamir Khan's presence and Raju Hirani's direction.\n\nPK, to me, doesn't fall in a good movie category. Its just an OK film. Its nowhere close to be the best works of either Aamir or Raju Hirani. Both can do better films than this one.\n\nThe story of the movie is quite pathetic. The plot is kind of stupid and immediately leads the viewer to feeling as to what a wrong decision to watch the movie.\n\nThe social message given by PK has recently been conveyed by OMG Oh My God movie in a much better fashion.\n\nAudiences are just appreciating the movie for Aamir's presence and acting. Aamir has acted much better before. He looks like a cheap imitation of Tom Hanks from Forrest Gump."

Aamir will steal your heart. there's a surprise at end and a great message. Anushka at her career best. Amir is always best. completely new and fresh story. heavy topics like religion, terrorism, astrology, aliens, etc are discussed in a light and beautiful way. First half was better than second one as it goes a bit slow. Songs are amazing and so is the background score. Do watch it for a change from regular movies and fake action stunts! its new, funny, lovable and well directed film. dialogues are a bit \"conphyujing\" but sooner you will get it all. so, tookur tookur hi dekhna \"p.k\"."

If you don't have all the answers, please enjoy the show. Raj Kumar Hirani has written a marvelous script after 3Idiots.Amir Khan and Boman Irani has played a solid role along with Sourav Sukla and Anuska. Script is so interesting that you could not attend you mobile calls in theater. An innocent comedy will won your heart from the soul. Above all you got a message like Amir Khan's movie 'wrong number' which means 'Raise your voice against all wrong steps are taken by the system'."

Our directors should learn from Raju Hirani. He is just a genius. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. A film like PK can never be made again in Hindi Film Industry because the content and emotions are just awesome. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. I just want Aamir khan to act in Raju Hirani movies.\n\nMy rating - \"An exceptional masterpiece\""

After all, they are the expectations of bollywood that it may survive the quality cinema, and movies like this decreases the difference between movies for the class and movies for the mass. Quality entertainment, yes you have it.\n\nWell enough of chit chat, The movie: As it is expected, Amir steals the show, at the end, you are supposed to have sympathy with PK what I really felt, there was not much but supportive role from Anushka what she gave, the script somehow tries not to involve into any trouble somewhere feels not to involve too much, but it relieves the intellectual that they see what they expected to see. Although movie has several spots where it loses the pace, but for the requirement, it is required to get the best recipe. If you ask me \"Could it get any better ? \" My answer is an unfortunate yes, but then, the better will be quite negligible..\n\nIt's basically a satire on Indian subcontinental society and yes it is a work of master that will mark with the time pass by...."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fail to understand why this movie has got such amazing ratings and rave reviews. The movie is a one time watch. Compared to the other movies coming out in Bollywood, yes this is better but definitely not the best of 2014 nor is it Hirani's best baby.\n\nP.K. has a message which has more and less been delivered in the past by OMG: Oh my God! and the latter did it more effectively hands down. Drawing comparisons with OMG is obvious as both share a common subject. While the execution was way better in OMG, the star power is clearly helping P.K. rake in more moolah. The cheap marketing tactics of Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Aamir Khan ( increasing the charges from every theater screening it just a day before the release) have only helped in making it one of the top 10 grossers ever in the history of Bollywood.\n\nComing back to the review, pluses first,\n\n1. Star cast 2. Performances 3. Subject 4. Humour\n\nThe movie has its moments, specially as far as the humour quotient is concerned. A few scenes are genuinely very funny while others at least make you smile. The emotional scenes are decent but fail to leave an impression (not the kind you would discuss once you are out of the theater). The message is good nevertheless and makes you feel that more such cinema is required.\n\nComing to the cons, direction is average and like mentioned earlier is flawed by the snail pace at which the movie rolls. Many scenes seem stretched. What did the editor do? The songs were never needed in this movie and the fact that none is good only adds to your woes.The sluggish pace of the movie hits a new high towards the climax which is dumb and hilarious.\n\nPerformances wise, of course Aamir Khan is great as usual. I personally loved Sanjay Dutt in a brief but important role. It was good to see him on screen and putting in an honest effort. Anushka Sharma, except for her lip-job-gone-horribly-wrong upper lip, does very well and looks pretty. Saurabh Shukla is impressive as the god man. Boman Irani and Balraaj Sahni are frankly wasted and don't get anything significant.\n\nOverall it makes for a decent one time watch first for the subject and then for the performances put in by the actors. While I am still bedazzled by the over the top positive review, I only hope the audience is not just enjoying the humour and walking back home. It would make much more sense if they learn a thing or two and apply it to their lives. Yes, then this movie would deserve at least a 9 if not a perfect 10. Go watch it with less expectations, you might just like it more."

Sushant singh was okay ( i don't know why but never really liked him).The only reason I'm giving it a nine is because of those extra 10-15 min (could have been edited) 1hr into the movie , 2nd half was perfect. I love movies having background scores and well it had them and they were good though it seemed they were taken from somewhere.No overdoing with songs(there were 3 i believe),great job by Sonu nigam....

At times, it feels like a documentary on preaching the irrelevance of (some) religious beliefs and how religious gods and gurus dupe ordinary people.\n\nHowever this is played in a very funny and satirical manner and Aamir's superb acting promises never a dull moment in the movie. He forces us to shed all preconceived notions and look at it all from a blank slate. Anushka's acting in the movie is also quite good and she plays the sweet but rebellious girl part quite well.\n\n**** SPOILER ALERT below *****\n\nThe beginning and end of the movie felt like ET, however I was a bit disappointed - only for the first 5 minutes though - that they could not come up with a more non human looking representation of ET. Instead, it turns out later that Aamir's wide eyed look, his funny airplane like gait and child-like attitude will be more than sufficient."

K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart. Also it is a Hindi Film where people are actually talking about the quality of the film rather then the box-office numbers. In my opinion Go for it. It's the Worth the time."

From the first trailer , I have been lying to myself that how awful the movie might end up.

I always said that Aamir khan needed a great script to back his performance up. BUT for me this Performance is a Top notch higher from any of his best works. I think Shahid Kapur just lost his Filmfare Award for the best actor.\n\nWhat can be said about Anushka Sharma, a breezy performance . She nails the character. Sushant Singh Rajput - BOSS!! this guy has a Great future. Sanjay Dutt - Magnificent. Mr irani and Shukla sir are fab their roles.\n\nThe Direction is Top Notch. The Story is WOW!!!!! I wouldn't talk about it much.\n\nThe Music is good. The technical department has done a great Job\n\nI don't wanna spoil this movie much. I went in as a hater and i came out a Happy person.\n\nI'm pretty sure People will this Movie more than 3 idiots .\n\n10/10 A Master Piece by the Team and Mind that Bought you 3 Idiots\n\np.S - SRK choose Happy New Year over this!!!!"

        "review_title": "PK\u0085. - Bas Theek Hai",
        "review_detailed_main": "First things first, PK is a 'very good' movie, eminently watchable for the following reasons:\n\n\u0095 Very simple message delivered in a  way that a 10 year - 70 year old would understand\n\n\u0095 Has a very universal appeal, excellently blended in a light hearted satire, so craftily that Raju Hirani can be crowned the master of this genre\n\n\u0095 Is so much more meaningful than Devgan kicking cars in air, and Salman mouthing Pandeyji lines and Yo Yo singing vodka\n\n\u0095 Is still an acceptable relief for an eagerly awaited movie, much more than a Doom 3 or a Happy New Year\n\nBut is that good enough to be \"great cinema\". I vehemently deny, for these fundamental problems with PK:\n\n1. Performance by lead actors: Much has been talked about this being Aamir's best, method acting, vocabulary learning and all. I thought the performance was good, but hardly anything to compare with much more accomplished and lesser popular actors. I am not even talking Nasir, Balraj Sahni, Dilip Kumar, Nawazuddin. You want 'real' looking performances, go watch any 20 mins of GOW. If you don't know what is GOW, then\u0085.google it :). As for method acting and diction, just google what Ben Kingsley did for Gandhi, or what Daniel Day Lewis does for every movie he acts, or how Pankaj Kapoor a sworn teetotaler did a top drunkards role in Matru, and what Aamir did will look like final year exam of junior acting school.. that's it. Unfortunately the only other serious actor in the movie Saurabh Shukla is such a caricature, he must have done this only for his paycheck..\n\n1. Lopsided debate on religion: By choosing to base the debate with Tapasvi, a  one color character, the director / story writers kind of made it a high school debate competition level discussion. There was no thought process on why so much of this 'religious buffoonery' exists, what extent is 'truly required' in today's times. The risk from such  debate is, it gets whistles in shows but cannot trigger any intellectual discussion - I doubt it intended to. It was as if the whole system has 1000 wrongs and not even 1 right, and an alien who is completely oblivious to our world's compulsions, complexities, stresses can point answers to it.  \n\n1. Tries to pack too much: Good looking people check, media indulgences check, popular jokes check, cross border love check, love story-uniting etc check, terrorist bomb blast check. Great cinema sticks to it's theme and doesn't need love story threads, converged in a stomach- achingly funny climax. Phone call, live, around the globe, discussing personal problems, which has hardly anything to do with the serious theme, sobbing viewers on the Veer-Zara uniting.. Why\u0085Raju, you delivered a masterstroke by making Gandhi current for a whole generation, that was genius. Take a bow for that. But alien showing way of life, was addressed by the Roshans in a series for mentally challenged viewers. Bettering that is not good enough for your calibre. Single theme movie for the 10-70 age bracket, try watching 'Miracle on 34th Street', the best message and movie about Christmas - made in 1947, I bet you will be shocked how relevant it will look to you today.\n\n1.  Very Straight Characters: All characters are one color, like a school play. Bad, good. No complexities in characters. Kind of similar to those college stage skits, which end up with some nice theme and a few sobbing front rows.  Fundamental flaw there - PK himself confesses he comes from a land where everybody is simple and can read each other's minds. So no lies, no cheating, no deceit, no sin, no bad, no charity, no evil, no nothing.. dear friend, human beings live on this 'gray' not 'black and white' planet where all these realities exist and in abundance. Religion has nothing to do with their existence. How do you know if these complex humans don't need 'any' amount of ritualism/rules. This alien learnt lying and cheating in his short stint, these humans have 5000 years of recorded history to learn non-sense from.Yes the masses won't understand a Garam Hawa, or Satyakam (a masterpiece that deserves much more praise than it got), but do we have to be dished out this simple straight good-bad people talk in the name of 'best movie' of the year.. No please\u0085\n\n1. Too much of 'Go Watch It': This bothered me so much, that I woke up early on a day when I have a sick off, and keying this :). There were quite a few movies in 2014 that could beat PK black and blue in 'cinematic' value fist fight. Dedh Ishqiya's performances will beat the entire cast of PK - did you know Arshad Warsi  was born and brought up in Mumbai and Maharashtra. See his Bhopali commentary before you go gaga over the bhojpuri skills of the lead here. Or watch Irrfan's work for Paansingh Tomar - if you want to be wowed with method acting. Haider - delivered a poignant message, with complex characters, and a few of haunting, haunting scenes, that will shake you up (Please do not watch  pirated print of this gem, theater or HQ prints on large screen only). Tongue in cheek message about jingoism - Total Siyappa did an OK job, and so did Filmistaan. Am yet to watch Citylight, Kya Dilli Kya Lahore, and Bhopal, but am sure the box-office collections of all of them put together will not make the first week of 'go watch it' PK.\n\nPlease watch PK - passable, good, family movie. But 8.8 on IMDb and 86% on Rotten Tomatoes.. Mediocrity rules I guess, when it comes to popular cinema."

The IMDb rating of 4 and above is fake. I would not give it even a star. They ignore the harsh reality in this world. Which is? Muslims and fanatic Islamists butchering people all over the world. This movie shows Hindus in a very negative way. There are thousands of fake Muslims peers and babas in India plying their trade. Why? Because India is a democracy. This anti-Indian movie needs to be banned and the actors need to be sent on a one way trip to the country that funded this movie....Pakistan. Looks like they will fit in fine with the fanatics over there who blindly hate hindus and anyones not Muslim. Muslims have a thousand year history of barbarism and treason in the country. Starting as sporadic invaders, Muslims slowly usurped entire lands, kingdoms and wealth. The destroyed over million of temples and built mosques over them. Trouble with the educated Muslim clean shaven jihadist is they don't talk publicly about their views but they are deep rooted to the jihadist ideology and can go any extent to support the violent causes as prescribed in the Islam. Looks like this movie was funded by Mullahs. AVOID!!!"

A top film.. One the greatest movies of all time.. A complete package all in one.. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch PK instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives pk to the winning post."

And as for Aamir, well..he is \"he\", speechless! Still retained his charm and cuteness. The story? Well...that I can't tell you! Go out and see it for yourself! Laughable, but with a strong message. It'll surely reach the masses. Also embedded in the story-line is the strong message of true love, which everyone will surely connect to. Aamir Khan sounded even more cute with his bhojpuri accent, and the famous \"battery-rechargva\" dance! Overall, I'll definitely give it a 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "PK : Simple But Content. Meaningfully Funny\n\n\"Belief is the ignition switch that gets you off the launching pad.\" - Demos Waitley\n\nPK is a simple story of an alien, which falls on the earth, sorry, on our India. May be, the simplest alien story ever told. An extra-terrestrial being visits our Earth, but loses the transporter remote of his space ship. Its journey to find the remote forms the crux of the movie, which throws light on the present spiritual scenario of our country, in a compelling and sarcastic manner.\n\nBelief is the force which drives humans to take certain decisions. A hope or belief in anything could make wonders. But the same belief in something 'wrong', welcomes disasters. The fruit of our life depends on what we decide to believe and what we don't. PK successfully questions this 'belief factor', which is being made a medium of business by spiritual leaders and Babas. It raises serious questions regarding the differentiation of religions among humans and the need for that differentiation. It also highlights some points regarding certain rituals and the way human belief is being exploited in the name of God.\n\nDiscussing the 'most-discussed topic' i.e, about the existence of God is a complex matter. But Rajkumar Hirani's compelling narrative style explains this complex topic in a much simpler and funny way.. Scripting was perfect, but it reminded 'Oh My God' at certain instants, may be a mere chance of coincidence. Making was simple with comic and feel good moments. But it is an Aamir Khan show in all aspects. His own mannerisms make the character of Mr.PK, close to heart and memorable. This is what we call breaking free of stereo roles. His expressions were novel and antics were funny. Anushka Sharma too did a neat job, supported by Boman Irani, extended cameo roles of Sushanth Singh Rajput and Sanjay Dutt. Saurabh Shukla also rendered appreciable performance as Babaji\n\nThe movie excelled in its technical side too. Cinematography was perfect, offered a good feel to the movie. Certain frames by CK Muraleedharan were new and gave a fresh feel. Music gave the film another feel, theme was good but songs could have been better. Editing by Hirani was crisp without any lag in between. Movie had a rich feel, Visual Effects were also of top class.\n\nOverall, Hirani's PK is a thought provoking film, presented in an entertaining way.\n\nMy Rating: 4/5 Don't miss this alien Wait for a special guest appearance in post-climax.\n\nYours Truly\u0085.Sooraj"

How can a movie talk about the problematic of religion in a fun, romantic and clean way? PK is the answer. Religion isn't never an easy subject. But is it religion a problem? No! At least it shouldn't be. And this movie clearly show's it in a very sweet, funny but honest way. Starting with what could be a sci-fi premise, PK tells a story of an outsider, a romance and a huge problem so many people face. But if you're wondering if there's going to be a sci-fi movie, let me clear that. No! Although it has a premise, it's not about that. So if you expect aliens and star wars, this isn't the movie. Still it has a lot of music, dances and funny moments and makes us reflect on a serious issue with our heart. There's a beautiful message in there, that all humans should get and I don't think it's from another planet! So of course I will recommend it! At some point of your life, please, take about two hours and enjoy this movie. It's not going to be hard to spend that time, it will make you laugh and show you something, so it's completely worth it in my opinion."

If all money go instead of religious establishment if it was to go for social well being of our fellow man would transform our society, This important question has been raise in this film.Please see it and think about it Most Indian films have weakness in storyline, particularly ending.

Second half and specifically last 30 minutes are extremely boring and stretched. There is a useless online live TV debate between a Godman and an ET which lasts more than 15 minutes. If it were not for Aamir Khan, no one would have gone to watch this movie.\n\nDo yourself a favor - Just post a fake post on facebook that you are watching this with your friends and feel happy about the likes and comments you get.

Religion is something of an ideology rather than a physical mark! But almost entire second half was revolved around this question and was bent on defending Muslims on this ground. It deserves 0 stars but I am forced to give 1 star.\n\nThis movie also reminds me of 3 idiots in the sense that the first half was excellent while the second half was filled with utter nonsense like making delivery of pregnant woman at home using batteries and TV instructions! Amir Khan looks like he is losing the grip over his movies. His recent movies have been totally disappointing"

PK is curious about the way humans dress, as aliens have no clothing concept. When PK realizes that people dress differently according to the work they do and the environment in which they live, and that in itself men and women dress differently, it's not just a matter of dressing up, but an interesting reminder of the subtleties that man has in dressing.\n\nWhile enjoying, the main reason why a group of viewers label PK as anti-religious and atheist is only because of some doubts and questions that PK raises about the various religious concepts and rituals of human beings.\n\nSome audiences have accused the director of using Hindu deities and rituals for satire.\n\nThere is one thing these people need to understand. The film progresses through PK's views and observations. There is no doubt that the majority of the religions and cults of the country of India where PK arrives are associated with Hindutva. PK only underscores the fact that religions that try to know the same God in many ways are polluted by human intervention. PK himself says that everyone is a creation of God.\n\nIt is clear from this that PK is not an atheist. God has no role to play in fostering sectarianism among human beings. When PK says that God does not send anyone to earth after labeling a religion, it is not a word of anti-religion but a borrowing of the word of the true God, who values humanity.\n\nPK is a film that is sure a good rave reviews due to the novelty of the presentation, the performance of Aamir Khan and the excellent direction of Rajkumar Hirani."

        "review_detailed_main": "P. K., an Indian film released in 2014 and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, starring Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma in the lead roles, is a satirical, romantic, philosophical, and provocative comedy that humorously and deeply addresses the theme of religion.\n\nThe film tells the story of an alien named P. K. who lands in the Indian desert and has his medallion/remote control stolen, which he needs to return home. Desperate, he realizes that only God can help him find his belongings. His innocence, naivety, and naive questions lead him to navigate through the various religions present in India (mainly Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and Sikhism), highlighting the absurdities, contradictions, and deceptions of these beliefs.\n\nP. K. Is a character who is devoid of prejudices and sees the world with innocent eyes, allowing the film to highlight the absurdity of certain religious practices that may seem natural to those who practice them. The film uses humor to gently mock the habits and customs of each religion, but it also addresses deeper philosophical questions, questioning the distorted teachings for personal gain by some preachers.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film is Aamir Khan's performance as P. K. He perfectly embodies the character of the innocent alien and brings an emotional dimension to his interpretation. His presence on screen is captivating, and he manages to communicate a lot with his facial expressions and body language.\n\nPK is also a courageous film in the Indian context, a country where religion holds an important place in society. The film denounces religious practices without offending believers, thanks to the use of humor and P. K.'s candid perspective. It raises important questions about gullibility, greed, and the exploitation of fear and ignorance of people in the name of religion, while offering deep reflection on the search for God and true spirituality.\n\nThe film also addresses themes such as love, friendship, and self-discovery, through the relationship between P. K. and the journalist played by Anushka Sharma. Their journey in discovering the truth and questioning their personal beliefs adds an emotional dimension to the film.\n\nUpon its release in 2014, P. K. became the highest-grossing film in the history of Bollywood, surpassing all box office records. However, since then, other films have surpassed its success, and as of March 2023, it was ranked eighth among the highest-grossing films in India.\n\nDespite its commercial success, P. K. has also sparked controversies and protests from certain religious groups in India. Complaints have been filed and calls for boycott and censorship of the film have been launched by Hindu organizations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which accused the film of hurting their religious sentiments. However, the Supreme Court of India rejected the demand for a ban on the film, stating that it should not waste its time on such baseless arguments.\n\nWould such a film be possible in Tunisia? Obviously not, as some people would not be able to conceive of mocking religious practices, especially those related to Islam. And of course, the preachers who speak in the name of God would certainly not appreciate being exposed. They would cry sacrilege and heresy to have such a film banned.\n\nWhile the film mocks religious practices, especially those who call themselves \"Men of God,\" at no point does it question the existence of a God. I actually appreciated this quote, spoken by PK to a preacher: \"Which God should I believe? You all say that, it's only one God. I say, no... there are two gods. One is the one who created us all. The other one is the one created by people like you. We know nothing about the God who made us all. But the God people like you made is exactly like you... liar, pretend to act, giving false promises, meeting rich people sooner, letting the poor neglected, happy when get praised... People are afraid to even say a word. My right number is very simple, the God who created us all, put faith in Him. And the God like you created, the duplicate God, destroy it\"."

One of its notable strengths is its fearless critique of religious dogma and societal norms, challenging us to question the unquestionable. While some may argue that the film's comedy overshadows its message, the music elevates it, striking the perfect balance between humor and introspection. The cinematography beautifully captures the vibrant chaos of India and the charming quirks of its characters. \"P.

In this movie, PK is an Alien who visits earth to understand about its 'intelligent' inhabitants, but the very first lesson is a Painful one when the remote control of his spaceship is stolen. Another sad part is when an Indian Hindu woman Jaggu falls in love with Pakistani Muslim man Sarfaraz. Her father disapproves because of his religion and his guru Tapasvi Ji predicts that Sarfaraz will betray her. She asks him to marry her anyways but at the church, she receives a Dear John note telling her not to call him. Heart broken, she returns to New Delhi and becomes a tabloid reporter. One day on the subway, she encounters PK passing out flyers looking for God. He has the craziest tale to tell.\n\nA superb movie asking all us all to take care of humanity rather than just religion. Because humanity is the religion we must care about before anything else. Once again, Aamir Khan (actor) takes away all the limelight and Cool to see Shushant Singh Rajput act beautifully.\n\nAnushka sharma pokes fun when she runs after Amir Khan as Pk in the movie. She has done a very beautiful work as a journalist. The movie clearly portrays all your Doubts about God's existence,Which God to Believe.!! Though the cocept of movie have been copied from 2012 movie \"oh my god\". A must watch. If not for fun then for the content it presents. The ambiguity of our societies and the unexplained norms or barriers are explicitly shown to generate evolutionary thoughts. Definitely 8 stars."

They don't want to die.\n\nMy only problem is when they say its a movie on social cause.Don't they know 1 billion people have following the religion are the happiest among the world, they never kill anyone.

Her father disapproves of his religion and his guru Tapasvi Ji predicts that Sarfaraz will betray her. She asks him to marry her anyways but at the church, she receives a Dear John note telling her not to call him. Heart broken, she returns to New Delhi and becomes a tabloid reporter. One day on the subway, she encounters PK passing out flyers looking for God. He has the craziest tale to tell.\n\nAamir Khan looks a bit like Rowan Atkinson. His comedic parentage runs along the Buster Keaton line. His muscular physique probably helps in his body humor. He's got a fun wackiness despite the intense weird face. The plot is surprisingly deep and the religious concepts are interesting. This is both hilarious and heartwarming. I do wonder if it would be better to not reveal his alien nature until much later. The audience should be dismissive like Jaggu at the beginning. The anniversary dinner is the perfect turning place with that reveal. Before that, his stories should be Jaggu shaking her head in disbelief. As for the ending, I would prefer to have crows and him not returning. The batteries don't make sense if he's coming back anyways. This is great."

        "review_detailed_main": "What to say about a film that has Aamir and Raju hirani? Sheer magic ? Yes,this time as well sheer magic has been created on screen by the two of the greatest artistes India has ever produced. I hope and wish Raju hirani to always cast aamir in all his directorial ventures as nobody can come close to do justice as Aamir has been doing in the last two of Raju's masterpieces. The movie is full of comical moments in a sensible,smart and at the same time, tight script and screenplay. Apart from the mesmerizing Aamir all the actors acted commendably well, music is apt for a movie like this which is taut in scripting and such a high voltage comical drama.There are too many messages given in here,but it doesn't feel like, forced upon the audience or too much of over the top religious and moral preaching as such. In fact the most important scenes are these many only,in which these indirect references of our over dependence on the temples,churches,mosques and their priests respectively, pointing out to make the spectator feel enriched with newly found confidence in oneself and the society as a whole. This is not over done or over the top in any manner as such. The only negative for me is the lips of Anushka sharma. All her scenes are dominated by her unnatural lips,in spite of her doing full justice to her part.I don't know why Raju and Vinod casted her for this role which can be done equally if now better by so many other talented actresses like Kangna ranaut and Vaani kapoor. Good job otherwise by Raju,Aamir and Vinod.Keep up the good work. I have not missed a single movie of Raju in the theater and never will. All should see this at the earliest to feel the best experience of cinema viewing in a times like this of trashier and crappier movies of Indian film industry. Once again BRAAAVO.......

        "review_title": "PK travels his journey, and invites you to go on yours",
        "review_detailed_main": "PK is a film that has up till now, been long anticipated by the Indian and Indo-phile public. The creative marriage of director Rajkumar Hirani and seasoned actor Aamir Khan has already given birth to the prodigious '3 Idiots,' and audiences are curious to whether their newest child is equally as gifted. With artisans as quality-oriented about their work as this pair is, one expects to see something beyond the average. Upon seeing the movie, the audience can expect that it is certainly no average movie; it proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable and provocative experience, that invites - rather than commands - you to discover a deeper meaning for yourself in its resolution.\n\nThe story is about a strange man on a strange quest that seems totally sane to him, yet that cannot but seem delirious to nearly everyone else (hence his name 'Peekay' or 'drunkard'). His frantic manner and child-like ignorance results in humorous and baffling episodes which give him deeper insight into the working of the world, and he generally polarizes: people either warm up to him, or chase him away (the latter provides much of the comic relief in the movie). Yet he remarkably manages to transform almost every person he meets; he himself, however, has an untainted aloofness that invites any curious soul to investigate him further. A few take the bait, and find themselves learning as much about their own selves as they do about their quirky new friend. Soon PK's journey, which started out a very personal one, becomes quite impersonal and then interpersonal as he invites not only his new friends, but also society itself into the provocative workings of his mind and ultimately, his heart - and challenges them to go into their own.\n\nAamir Khan is, unsurprisingly, at his top form here. While the other actors give great performances, it is clearly Khan's that really gives the film it's life force. His genius is his ability to deliver a performance so nuanced, and with so much carefully crafted flavor and subtetly, yet that never loses it's organic and natural feeling. The character of PK is outwardly stiff and rigid as reflective of his strange origin, and yet when he needs to be can be so captivatingly expressive that you can feel every nuance of his feeling, and you can almost think the unpredictable thoughts as he cranks them out in his mind. Part of PK's appeal is that you expect him to be offbeat, which on the surface he very much is, yet he amazes you with a sane humanity that bursts forth as spontaneous insight from his bewildering mind. If you can keep up with him, he takes you along for the ride: his charisma is electric, unstoppable in a way that doesn't hint that he'll run you over, but that invites you to run along with him (if you don't mind others staring at you).\n\nJaggu, played zestfully by Anushka Sharma, does just that. She is a wonderfully composite girl: as fresh-faced as the girl-next-door, yet as independent as a woman who yearns to play life by her own rules. She is drawn to PK because like him, she is lost. The complexity of her romantic life with a humble lover (endearingly acted by Sushant Singh Rajput) proves to become a pivotal part of her and PK's personal and collective understanding. Jaggu's real-world charm and practicality provides a wonderful counterbalance to PK's otherworldly insight; the two are often played off each other, and a delightfully intimate friendship is born.\n\nThe other characters round out a respectable cast. Sanjay Dutt as the well-dressed Bhairon Singh is another colorful character who does well to offer his own unique perspective on PK. Saurabh Shukhla as the morally ambiguous guru is quite convincing; Boman Irani, as Jaggu's reluctant boss proves instrumental in helping PK on his journey. A sweet character is Sushant Singh Rajput's Sarfaraz, Jaggu's humble lover whose story with her could well be its own movie - it is a shame that he doesn't get as much screen time as he could have.\n\nThe beauty of this film is that, like most great movies, it works on many levels. When it's funny and lighthearted, it keeps you laughing for long stretches of time; when it's emotional or serious, it really gets you to pause. A lot of times, the humor itself is woven into making serious points, in a way that bespeaks the great talent of this director and his writers. The film tackles subject matter that could easily offend (religion) with an innocence that commands insight. The PK writers have woven a charmingly unique story that respects, not dumbs-down, the intelligence of the Indian (or any) viewer.\n\nOverall, PK the movie is a lot like PK the character: Strangely alarming, yet innocently inviting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The few shallow plot elements are smoothed by a very cleverly written script. Visually, PK is a marvel. Clearly, Hirani and his cinematographers spared no expense when composing the visual tone; there is not a drab sari, dhoti, turban, or uniform to be found. Like he did in '3 Idiots,' Hirani has proved that he has a real knack for taking everyday elements of life and creating a story so intriguing that any viewer can appreciate it at their own level, and perhaps a higher one if they accept the invitation. This is not your average masala flick; this is a thought-provoking reflection on society, wrapped in a charming story of a man trying to find his way. When and if PK finds his way home, you can be sure that the audience will have worked out mentally and emotionally if they are ready at that point to join him. The beauty is that Hirani and Khan never force you to choose, but allow your own acceptance to unfold at its own pace, as all great films do."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's like a birthday party that makes you laugh and cry and takes your breath away with the beauty of the production and you get to take home a crucial message about life as a return gift.\n\nI would tend to agree with another reviewer that it is Aamir's best movie so far. And that's a very high accolade indeed. It is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. Proud of Bollywood for having given birth to something so witty, intellectually pleasing, thought provoking and slickly made. Anushka Sharma delivered yet another sparkling performance. She's a true delight to watch, as is Aamir.\n\nThe movie did have a few chewy parts. I suspect those were left in to adapt the movie to the taste of the larger Indian audience as an insurance against box office failure, so I wouldn't hold that against the director. I can now better understand a friend's sentiments when he expressed the urge to \"like\" his own positive comments on FB about the film. A creation so good does evoke that kind of joy.\n\nCoincidentally I just started reading \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. Though I've read only the first few pages so far, I believe that bits of the movie were inspired by this book. The story is similar to that of OMG: Oh My God! but outclasses that one by light years.\n\nThis movie deserves a 12 star rating on a 10 star scale."

I haven't felt that he overacted 0.00000001% anywhere in this movie.\n\nSalute to Rajkumar Hirani, to present us something unforgettable."

Stopping short of making the movie against religion, the director has used wonderfully crafted 'happy-go-lucky' character against the ever-increasing Godmen and Godwomen in India. Of late, in the Indian social scenarios many news have been mushrooming about the miscreants who pretend as 'mediators' to the omnipotent. Aamir Khan has, predictably, has carried the film. The Bhojpuri accent has given a slightly light-hearted twist but doesn't distract from the crux. Some side-plots, however, seemed pointless: notably, Sanjay Dutt and the 'informer'. I'd say, this is a must watch title."

Still it was effortlessly put together, making every viewer stunned.\n\nInterestingly I also found big connections between the philosophical elements of the movie and the philosophy of the \u00dcbermensch by Friedrich Nietzche. P.K, played by Aamir Khan, had almost all the aspect and characteristics of Nietzsche's \u00dcbermensch: the curiosity, the childlike character, the (clean) view of the world, no morals, no man- made religion etc.\n\nThis and all the other elements like the the funny scenes, the cute love scenes, the sad letting go scenes, the pure love of P.K, better said everything, made this one of the best, if not the best, Bollywood movie I have ever seen. Hats of to the whole crew of the movie!!"

PK was a full-fledged entertainment mocking at the fraudulent religious believers and hypocrites who fool people in the name of God. Hats off to the director for the daring attempt. PK throws surprise with every scene and is sure to be lauded for its daring story. Screenplay looses the steam in the later half and probably romantic track between Anushka Sharma and Sushant Singh Rajput could have been avoided. Music is good along with crispy dialogues. Cinematography is wonderful. Aamir Khan is the soul of the film. He carries the role of PK as if it has been tailor-made for him. Anushka Sharma is brilliant and Sanjay Dutt does decent job in special appearance.\n\nOverall . PK is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated for its wonderful message. Excellent 4/5"

According to me, 3 idiots was the magnum opus of hirani, so, reaching to that point was a rather difficult task, but P.K. still engages us effectively. There are times when we just laugh constantly and funny punches keep coming one after the other. No worries in the acting department as Amir has handled everything perfectly. Anushka looks cute, as always and has done her part well. Sanjay Dutt is quite a surprise. His presence on the film marked sure laughter. Songs are okay, but their placement in the movie is what that matters, which is good. P.K. is a must watch because movies like this are rare in Indian cinema which handles such a sensitive topic(in India) so effectively adding a pinch of humor as well."

Dialogues are amazing. It is now proved that rajkumar hirani is bollywood's best director ever. Story is unique.\n\nActing: best performance of aamir ever. No one other than Aamir could have done this role. His expression were just amazing. Anushka was brilliant. Best acting of her career and this movie will surely boost her career. Sushant Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Boman and Shukla did justice to their short roles. Music: If you see just as a album it is average but when we watch it in this movie you definitely say amazing. All songs are choreographed amazingly. Especially the battery recharge dance. Director: Every scene was perfectly directed. It was not as good as 3 idiots because first of all 3 idiots was for youth and students life was portrayed so being a student i liked it more. If i rank hirani's movies it will be: 1. 3 idiots 2. Munna bhai 3. P.k 4. Lage raho munna bhai\n\nIn the end i would just say you to watch this movie in cinemas and find out the hidden message in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Excellent Movie right from the word go. Though the movie might seem similar to OMG, the way the message was conveyed was absolutely different. I thought PK was more personable and a thought provoking movie. You have to appreciate this movie especially when you have thousands of god men (regardless of religion) in India fooling and cheating innocent people. Recently there was this incident where a supposed god-man hugs women so as to cure their illness, and people from villages just blindly believe him and go to him. This has to stop, people should know these are thugs who have no sense of morals. And a movie like PK addresses just this. Apart from the message, I must especially appreciate Amir Khan for his exceptional handwork he put into this movie. Anushka Sharma too, I loved her. Be open-minded and enjoy this movie."

Returning after celebrating the colossal success of 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan take you to the another journey of introspection amid all the cinematic fun.\n\nRaju picks the sensitive issue of faith and religion. As usual, his hero is an outsider, actually he is alien to earth this time. Using his quick wit and with the help of master act of Aamir Khan, he creates a series of funny and though provoking scenes asking you if your faith is in God who created humans or God who was created by humans. There is terrific first half, a post interval portion with the 'been there done that\" feeling and a heart wrenching climax which sums up the things on a high note.\n\nAnushka Shrama, Sushant Singh Rajput, Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla provide good support but movie belongs to Aamir Khan who never misses a beat while playing this difficult alien act. This is not the best of Raju's lot but it is much better than so many other offerings of Bollywood.\n\nI am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for PK. This one is brave, funny, thought provoking and pure Rajkumar Hirani brand fun so have faith and watch PK."

Direction and scripting is so good that you can not point out what mistakes are there. It might not be a perfect film but it is a much better film.

The plot is fast with bits of humor especially in the first half and some drama in the second. The child like curiosity of the actor makes us realize the dumb society which believes in superstitions. Anushka Sharma fulfilled her role too. Great background music and songs makes it all the more special. This movie with a strong social message hopes to bring some positive changes in the mindset of the society and guides the people to become aware of their surroundings. Major credits goes to the director for directing such an different movie after a long time."

Although the story is based a round an alien, who is trying to make his way back home, religious satire is the main contribution made by this movie. However with out his remote Control, which is essential for him to call his spaceship to pick him up, PK cannot leave earth. As his remote control was stolen straight after his arrival, he is desperate to get it back. Once he realizes that his chance are practically non existent to find his remote control, he choose to learn from the humans to seek help from god. But which one is the right one Hindu, Christian, Muslim or Sikhs god ? I found the idea to address human greed and religious hypocrisy very refreshing, however with the exception of Aamir Khan the acting was mostly abysmal throughout the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "An alien struggles to accustom to human tradition while searching for his stolen remote.\n\nPK- a movie in making for close to five years has overwhelmingly satisfied all its expectations. Gems like these are rare and whether or not it is considered Oscar-worthy, the movie should be preserved as a case study for future film makers.\n\nJust like his production house's logo (puppet show), Raj Kumar Hirani's films are simple in theme yet very attractive by means of its presentation. He has a magical lens that peers into the Indian Diaspora and tears down its misbeliefs elegantly, no matter how high it is held. It wouldn't be an overstatement when I say, \" he is one of the very few in the business who consistently satisfies both producers and (global) audience.\"\n\nHope was seeded in me during the movie. Every time a religious belief was opposed there was claps and whistles from all around the screen, a clear sign that the general population is becoming increasingly logical rather than being superstitial. With several close-up shots (especially in the Belgium episode), Anushka's pout was hard to miss. Don't be surprised if she wins the Best Pout Award.\n\nFrom a broader perspective it's not just an alien who would struggle in this world. For the sake of argument, imagine bringing back one of the early humans to the present world. He would face the same dilemma that Aamir does in this movie. Clearly it's our evolution (with plenty of revolutions in it) that is to be blamed (or praised).\n\nDespite being a sci-fi \"based\" movie with love and emotion it is humour that persists till the end. Be it the dancing cars that act as Aamir's ATM cum wardrobe, his search for God, the slipper that he steals when his own are missing, his questions to god-men, all of them no matter how serious an issue, are presented in a humorous enjoyable way. But irrespective of how much the movie takes upon god-men it doesn't hurt the basic ideology of religion.\n\nVarious modulations of accha (\"Good\"), I love Chicken, Anushka'a analogy of PK with child are worth mentioning among many such beautiful lines.\n\nBut tell us Aamir, why did you settle for an outdated transistor radio when there were plenty of other cool devices.\n\nAAA: Despite being a U-rated movie, three A's ruled the movie. Aamir, Alien, Atheism. Enough said.\n\nPS: A surprise cameo awaits you at the end."

It has some funny scenes, some daring ones and some floppy scenes as well. If you are looking for an amazing movie thats gonna give you a new perspective in life, this is not that. This movie, however, would be a good pick for a cozy boring Sunday. It needs to be said that, there exists better movies, namely- 3 Idiots (another movie by Amir Khan) is beautifully done, has fantastic message and the execution of the movie centrally focuses on the theme rather than many different things. This movie is not worth 9/10 in IMDb which is the rating as of now."

This year I am 18. In short, I have grown up watching Rajkumar Hirani films. And every film he directs, he has a new story to tell. A new message to deliver. Gives a new reason to make us smile.\n\nAs a space-ship lands in the desert in Rajasthan, P.K (Aamir Khan) is unaware of this new world. As destined to be, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets P.K who is in search of something. (Watch the film to know). And rest of the proceedings form the story. No doubt, P.K is Rajkumar Hirani's most accomplished work but it also deals with a prominent issue that resides in our society.\n\nI must say the story is indeed very difficult to present it in a form of media. But Rajkumar Hirani has presented it in a very entertaining way. This proves this guy can do the impossible. His trade-mark can be seen all over the motion. If Munnabhai had 'Jadoo Ki Jhappi & Gandhigiri.', 3 Idiots had 'Aal Izz Well.' P.K has 'Wrong Number.' You will understand this when you watch the film.\n\nDialogues are witty and humorous. One Line is like 'Jo Darr gaya, Woh Mandir Gaya'. WOW! Those aren't the cheesy dialogues normally a bollywood film has. The emotional scenes will surely bring tears to your eyes.\n\nComing to the performances, P.K is Aamir Khan's best film till date. He has done total justice to the character and I don't think that anybody else could have matched him up. He has done Wonders! Don't miss the debate scene in the 2nd half which is sure to bring tears. Anushka Sharma as Jaggu is phenomenal. As P.K's only friend she never brought a dull moment in the film. Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla, Sushant Singh Rajput are great in their parts. Don't miss Ranbir Kapoor's cameo.\n\nMusic by Shantanu Moitra is good. Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu is my pick of the lot because the song made me silent.\n\nOn the whole, P.K is an eye-opener. It is a film that is not be watched only for entertainment but also for re-checking your lifestyle, changing the vision towards the society. Thank you Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan, Abhijat Joshi and the entire team for such a lovely film. Discover love. Discover Life. Discover GOD! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nP.S:- Pop out your ears. Open your eyes wide. Be P.K! Watch it Now. It is URGENT!"

The first half was forgettable and the second was only slightly better.The concept was good but lacked the proper execution which caused the movie to drag on and on,which doesn't happen much in RH(raju hirani). The songs were passable and there were a few funny moments and i could see why some people might enjoy the movie. But all in all I expected a much better movie from Raju Hirani and Aamir Khan(especially after Dhoom 3)\n\nTo sum up ,a watchable film if you have the time ,but coming from a 15 year old like me ,you'll have a much better time watching the last hobbit movie."

Pk walks the thin line between the controversial and the safe, to deliver a brilliant religion vs. ignorance story. Aamir Khan perfectly portrays the innocent bhojpuri-speaking alien pk, and undoubtedly steals the show. Pk is light hearted and funny at the beginning, but becomes more and more intriguing and serious towards the end, while proving its point loud and clear at the end. Only someone like Rajkumar Hirani could convey such an important message effortlessly amidst a good story and a normal backdrop. Pk features good performances and great dialogue sprinkled throughout the film, which ensure that the movie stays with you long after the end.\n\nVerdict: pk has potential to be a modern classic, joining the past works of the director, like 3 idiots. Aamir Khan renews faith in good bollywood mainstream cinema with a daredevil effort to try a potentially scandalous story. Pk is a delight for both casual moviegoers and hardcore movie fans."

The argumentative parts of the film are scripted with great care and effort and shows off in the dialogues. The twist , as we call has added tremendous value to the whole experience of PK and that is why i call the screenplay as the best component in the film.\n\nWith respect to message , yes , the director / writer stands apart. His ability to convey the message with a grasping yet thoughtful narration should not only be commended by awarded. The complicated issue of religion has been handled with great care but with some slips here and there i would say. But , the writer has made me think and thats what matters ; he wins.\n\nOverall , a cult movie by RKH and a once in a lifetime performance by Aamir Khan. Go watch it!!! Should be watched!!!"

PK tries to open our mind, remind, and teach us how to look at religion difference, it indirectly teaches us how to respond towards diversity, and how to love someone. it simply teaches us a lot and you definitely can relate to this. I wish there are more people watching this movie, this is obviously inspiring yet still has much comedy so you won't be bored of it. I've been a fan of Aamir Khan since 3 Idiots and have been worshiped his act, which actually much more better in PK. He could depict a perfect weirdo with a miraculously innocent gestures and full-of- questions eyes I obviously don't have any complain against this movie. However, there were some adult jokes which might be not really appealing for children, like the viewing of condom box, and \"dancing car\", but I think it's still in an appropriate level, just make sure you are there to guide your children through this epic inspiring movie."

A heavy theme I would say because it involves religion but yet it was presented in a basic manner. It calls ourselves to think deep on the issue of the role of religion and God in your life.What actually matters most? These are the questions raised and subtly poke our conscience to act. Of all the humour, fantastic plot, interesting theme and magnificently well acted upon by Aamir Khan and the rest of the actors, this film is hugely entertaining and has set the benchmark of other Indian films to break.

I genuinely appreciate Rajkumar Hirani for unlocking countless locked doors of the vast number of minds and also by openly supporting numerous sets of world-views. I must say he hit all the \"right numbers\" when it came to the most sensitive topics that are flagrantly masking most of the humanity. This brilliant piece of eye-popping fiction made me realize that my world-view is not an adversary to his perspective on life, but in fact, it is immensely analogous to his thoughts conveyed throughout this movie. Of course, Aamir Khan, being a perfectionist that he is, has shone humbleness on his fans, family and friends by his genius role, \"PK\" in the movie. The idealist also awarded Bollywood with a spectacular display of hope that the fandom does not require the myriad absurd and unrealistic action films. I am appalled with the social issues addressed in the movie such as the facade of \"holy\" people trying to justify their needs of saving their gods, as well as their disciples. The fascist gurus annihilate sacred and bona fide relationship between gods and theirs worshippers. That being only one of the many social issues debated in the film; this is a must-watch film for it will bring you one step closer to your enlightenment."

Amir was previously famous for making movies which were the most realistic (with respect to other Bollywood movies), but D3 was a disgrace and now PK is downright dumb and disrespectful and fake.

If you are correlating it with reality then surely aliens cannot be ruled out from having a systematic and complete language for communication because it is the pillar of any highly developed civilization. So I would say science background viewers may find it a little obscure. Emotion is the USP of this movie as always pioneered by our bollywood. I wont get surprised if most of you watch it twice or thrice.

If someone should have a right to write something, in my opinion, that would be RKH. His splendid and charismatic movies are always fun prolific but they do convey a mind-boggling message to the civilization.\n\nComing back to this movie, Aamir's performance is a delight to watch, as usual. The cuteness he carries along with him, in this movie, will make you think that indeed, Bollywood has not lost his charm on domestic and international level. Actually, his tendency of acting reminds me of Tom Hanks (An actor with versatile varieties). PK will not leave you for a minute, Aamir's \"eye popping out\" act will not let you blink, even for a second. A movie blessed with Emotions, Drama, Comedy, Anushka/Boman/Sushant/Saurabh's protean acting is nothing but perfection under Mr Perfectionist.\n\nI hope, Raju and Aamir continue these stupendous adventures together, forever, so that there is a reason to buy a worthy ticket for a worthy movie. This movie is for all and mark my words, you won't get disappointed.\n\nAnd a suggestion for the novices, want to learn acting, please join Aamir Khan's school of perfection.\n\n\"Re Bhaaya!

I will not divulge any key details regarding the plot that you probably don't know already, so you can read on if you have not had the pleasure of seeing it yet. Aamir Khan has done an outstanding job completely molding himself into character, while Anuskha Sharma fully justifies her casting as well. The supporting cast, which include Hirani favorites like Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt are fantastic as well. The plot develops swiftly throughout the movie, with clever humor and original writing. While P.K. does share a common theme with the Paresh Rawal starrer Oh My God, it's story is completely different and it brings a fresh perspective on a very controversial and fascinating subject. Cinema such as this must be rewarded in a year where Aamir Khan's counterparts have delivered nonsensical products like Happy New Year and Kick, P.K. is a breathe of fresh air. Don't miss it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"PK\" is yet another amazing movie from Aamir Khan, an Indian actor and producer (and sometimes director) who brought the world such amazing films as \"Lagaan\", \"Three Idiots\", \"Like Stars on Earth\" and \"Dangal\". Such a track record is hard to equal...let alone beat. Now I am not saying it's his best...but it's awfully good.\n\nThe story begins with PK (Khan) arriving on Earth from his enormous space ship. However, there are two problems. First, he's naked as folks from his planet don't understand nor need clothing. Second, some jerk sees him and steals his amulet from around his neck...and that amulet has a device on it that allows him to communicate with his people. And, without it, he's stuck on Earth.\n\nThe scene abruptly switches to Belgium* where Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets and falls in love with Sarfraz. This is a HUGE problem when she discovers that he's not only a Pakistani but Muslim....and she's an Indian Hindu. Now if you don't know how this is a problem, animosity between these countries and religions have resulted in many thousnads (or more) deaths since these republics were founded in 1947. This would be akin to a Jewish Israeli falling in love with a Palestinian! Not surprisingly, her family is aghast and the 'holy man' who the family looks to for guidance (Sanjay Dutt) warns that the man will betray her. And, only the next day, when she is to marry him, it appears as if this is exactly what has happened.\n\nThe scene then abruptly switches to India. Jaggu now works for a TV news type program and hopes to get better stories than the fluff she's doing now. And, when she meets PK, she is intrigued by how weird he is...and how he just doesn't seem normal. But she also comes to like him....even when she thinks he might just be insane. Why? Well, he insists he's from another planet!\n\nThe rest of the film is about religion. It seems that when PK was stuck here, he saw that humans prayed to God for help...so he decides to ask God to help him find his amulet. But WHICH God?! After all, he notices that each religion claims that they alone speak for God...and this cannot possibly be. And, despite trying all the various major religions, his amulet is still missing. This leads him to a realization...that the leaders of these religions don't realize they aren't talking to God but are mistaken....and Jaggu decides to put him on TV to talk about this...causing an unexpected sensation. What's next? See the film.\n\nThe ecumenical story like isn't all that surprising, as this has been a passion of Aamir Khan in other films and real life. I am sure it will offend some....and it certainly did in India (some clerics tried to have the movie banned). But apparently it hit the right note with viewers, as it became the most popular film in Indian history up to that time**!\n\nSo is it any good? Absolutely. But for me the best parts were not the comedic parts with Aamir Khan looking and acting goofy. The best, by far, was his questioning religion AND Jaggu's busted relationship...both of which could make up an entire movie in and of themselves. A tad uneven but one of the better Bollywood pictures.\n\n*I found it funny that practically everyone in Belgium seems to speak Hindi...the locals AND the Pakistani boyfriend (they speak Urdu, not Hindi).\n\n**Since this time, another Khan film, \"Dangal\", has surpassed \"PK\" as the #1 box office film in Indian history."

Not a single thing stands out as extraordinary.\n\nPK asks some sensitive questions. It's innocent. The movie didn't try to give away the answers. It's up to you if you wanna find the answers. And the film never made fun of any religion. It just made fun of the businesses that take advantage of people's weakness towards religion. The questions PK asks are not genius. Religious speakers pitch these questions at each other every day.\n\nI'll never understand the appeal of \"Hindi film songs\". They give me headaches. I mean you are moving up in the film industry. You are adding sex scenes. But you can't get rid of these unnecessary musicals!\n\nAnd another thing that has been bothering me, how come everyone's so pale? I mean it's India. Where are the Brown people. the majority, People who looks like me!\n\nFinal verdict: 6.4/10. A poor film. But an entertaining comedy. I hardly say \"It's funny\" about comedies these days. But PK is truly hilarious. That's why I'm rounding up my rating to a 7 out of 10."

Amir khan is the best actor in the , if you need proof, then watch PK. here Amir khan is from a planet where he has mysterious power. he learns local language by holding the hand of a woman for 6 long hours. after that he asks valid questions to religion system,where a widow wears white DRESS,but a Christian lady wears white DRESS during marriage. a Christian lady wears black DRESS when her husband dies,but a Muslim woman wears black DRESS forever. here people believe in cheaters who work as agents of god.PK reflects the effects of misunderstanding and after that in the end there is a successful love story, heart touching love story between a Indian girl and a Muslim boy. I will give 10 out of 10 to this movie."

Hats off to raju hirani for handling such a delicate topic so sweetly and charmingly. Every scene , every question that PK asks forced me to think about the hypocrisy of religion. And yet it never raises question over God and his existence. Even though it targets religion as many will feel I don't think it stops there.it asks question to the society. How no1 offers pk food when he is hungry but as soon as he wears a police dress every1 comes running forward to try and please him. How fear is instilled in our minds to exploit us and many more. U have to watch it to understand . I have cut a point only because the music is not so good though it blends with the story to an extent and reinforces the charm of the protagonist. It's an awesome movie by the best director I know by far. Do watch it but with an open mind and try and challenge some of your hypocrisies too."

It was a relief for me to see an artistic form of a deep layer of children inside all of us exposed and a dialogue between innocence and ignorance that has been shown in a very realistic way. As much as I believe that religions serve as a great source of support to cover limitations of our brain capabilities to fully understand every thing, I believe more in weaknesses of majority of religions follower to include their own selfish interests and market it by painting it with holiness of religions. So, I consider this film as an eye opener of new generations to see irony that has been practiced since the beginning of religions' history."

If religion is the head of this society then they took a hammer and beat it till it went absolutely senseless(as if it isn't already). But the real trick was : everything was coated with an impeccable brand of humor. I laughed more than the last time. And finally it actually gives you choices : to laugh or to think or both. But i guess the first one is always the better way to enjoy the movie if you are going to \"entertain\" yourself! Throw away all reviews(internet, newspapers, magazines etc etc), rumors regarding copy paste and stuff like that and go watch it. Yes there are some clich\u00e9, yes there are some plot holes, you may not want to agree with what the movie says, or the way it shows what it shows, but trust me, one thing this movie delivers, and does so very well.

For one because it is the basic instinct of our nature, to clarify our conscience, by solving/overcoming/removing our curiosity. And secondly it is a question that is seeded in every healthy mind. PK. A story of a man who has a clear conscience, pure in every sense like a new born baby. What if this innocence is left on its own to search for the One, or to search for the fact that there is no One, as often we find the unexpected on the path we choose to avoid them. PK is a dervaish, he is actually not questioning rather he is saying the words we avoid to say, and he does that to shake our conscience to make us conscious. He preaches simplicity, harmony and fairness because the message is Man is pure, and chaste in his most obsolete and basic nature. Pk is a pure human, it would have been so strange to present him like this, so in alternate he is portrayed as an ALIEN. Our most basic nature is now Alien to us. No matter what Religion you follow, what your beliefs are, don't forget being Human. And all religions preach the same thing \"clear your conscience and you would find Him\". Don't go searching for him, just be simple and He will show Himself to you in things you have been seeing all your life."

Honestly, I had more expectations from Aamir - Hirani movie so that is the reason I would not give it a 8 star. Also it doesn't have any memorable songs or scenes. One week later and I almost forgot the movie. Aamir - Hirani please make an innocent movie next time like you used to do (like Three Idiots) Good luck!"

Didn't get bored with this movie. he 1st half was full of pace and some memorable scenes. 2nd half started off a little slowly with a couple of stretched scenes (that had no need of). But it again picked up pace and headed towards the Climax with lots more drama, laughter and excitement. For me, it's one of the Best executed films i have seen recently. Enjoyed the full time. Sunshat & Boman were good in their respective small roles. PK is a Trademark Rajkumar Hirani Film written all over it with Laughter, Emotions, Drama & an important Message."

Though the central theme have been covered a lot in Bollywood movies lately, but the such an elegant plot and depiction could only be expected from the duo of director-producer Raj Kumar Hirani and actor Aamir Khan. One may find little loop holes in the story-telling, but it would all be insignificant in the face of the perfect cast and the plot which has well hit the intended motive. It is perfectly nice family cinema complete with fun, emotions, allegory and above all a good concluding scene which I often miss in many movies. On the whole the movie would definitely turn out to be, if nothing else, entertaining enough to be worth the tie spent on it."

In PK, these two names synonymous with movies with quality as their trademark symbol come together for the second time in their successful career.\n\nPK is a beautifully crafted movie that is totally a different one in terms of story line and with solid performance from Aamir Khan to back it, the film hits the right chord among the audience. Rajkumar Hirani comes up with another film that has fun and entertainment but at the same time try to pass a strong message to the society.\n\nJust briefing about the story which i will try my best to ensure that nothing is revealed to act as spoiler. PK ( Aamir Khan) lands up in our world in a desert in Rajasthan and gradually becomes part of our daily life. But he questions the belief and custom we follow in the name of religion, God and human Gods. The rest i am leaving it to you to watch and see for yourself on big screen. The first half concentrates on fun element while the latter half takes a small u turn and gets into a serious mode retaining the fun part.\n\nThe treatment especially towards the end has definitely shades of the Munnabhai series where the protagonist tries to prove his point to the public but in no way it is a copy or inspired versions of those films. As said, the plot is something unique in its own way that makes a connection with the viewers right from the word go. Rajkumar Hirani on the direction side has done his part and his vision and what he wanted to convey is there on screen crystal clear. His trademark style of narrating a story of victory for goodness and passing good messages to the people is visible in PK as well.\n\nOn screen, Aamir Khan is the perfect cast as PK. This character is definitely one of his best in his career and PK the movie is driven largely by the sheer screen presence of AK, the actor. He speaks in Bhojpuri language and the dialogue delivery by the actor was too good evoking laughter in us. Anushka Sharma as Jaggu supported Aamir Khan and complimented him in the film's overall perspective. Sushant Singh Rajput in a brief role as Sarfraz was impressive and the same goes for Sanjay Dutt. Boman Irani and Pareekshit Sahni who are the regulars in RKH movies is also part of the cast. Technically the film stands out with good cinematography and smooth cuts. Background score and songs were also good and jelled well with the film.\n\nSo overall, PK doesn't disappoint and offer a pleasing movie experience with good doses of spoofs, comedy and sentiments. He came and he conquer our hearts and make us think. Yes PK from Rajkumar Hirani with Aamir Khan for me is a must watch film and my personal rating is eight out of ten. Enjoy the fun ride and be ready for a little surprise in the end."

The story has a love story adjusted in a jammed script in order to give a twist to the ending which is totally uncalled for. A finely crafted film is about all the characters doing their bit to make that blend perfect and not just the lead actor taking all the burden. The satirical content is nice but there is something always missing throughout the film and for me this is not Aamir's best."

It brings together everything Hirani's films are about, with on screen excellence by all involved. I'm not sure whether PK will escalate to the same levels as 3 Idiots did, but it won't be far behind that is for sure.\n\nPK heavily relies on Aaamir, and there is no way you can imagine anyone else in this role - It is one of those films simply made for an Aamir Khan. Every single scene in the film is interesting. Not at any point will you think the film is slow or you're lost. From the very start where PK enters, to the interval to the final scene - you're simply laughing non stop with endless emotions to go alongside it. There are a few flawed scenes however which is why I didn't give it a perfect 10 score. Also the condom scene and the 'dancing car' scenes are a little cringe and quite awkward to watch if you're watching with family.\n\nPerformance wise Aamir Khan is at his supreme best and this will be considered up there with his best work ever. His bhojpuri dialogues, his silly mannerisms, his naivety and simpleness are all portrayed on screen with such ease. Anushka Sharma is outstanding in her role as Jaggat Janani and you really do find it difficult to think who else could have done the role as well as she did. To stand so tall in every scene with a powerhouse like Aamir - a lot of credit has to go to her! Sushant is effective in his short role. Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt are two who could have had meatier roles, but then again the film didn't require it. Saurabh Shukla is first rate! All the performances in the film leave their mark, which is something we have become used to with a Raju Hirani film!\n\nThe music of the film certainly adds to it, and it's a typical Hirani album. My favorites are Bhagwan hai kaha hai tu and Chaar Kadam.\n\nOverall PK is a super hit film. One of those films which you can watch over and over again. Watch it for the simple facts that it is a Raju Hirani film. If you're an Aamir fan - you're in for a delight. If you're not - watch it for an outstanding performance!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After PK was released, many right wing organizations and some others wanted the movie to be banned. That curiously took me to the movie in Jan this year and after comfortably sitting through it, the only questioned which popped in my mind was..What was all the fuss about?\n\nAnyways, personally I was disappointed with the film when compared to all of Hirandani's earlier works.\n\nHirandani takes on a serious subject of religion and tries to turn it upside down through the eyes of PK an alien. It seems very inspired of the Hindi film 'Oh My God' which I felt was brilliant. PK does have its moments especially in the 1st half and beginning of the 2nd half, but towards the end, the movie drags and the comedy disappears.\n\nUnlike all his earlier works, the climax her is a disappointment because comedy dries up and the message is lost in translation. Also, an unnecessary Indo Pak angle is pushed into which doesn't hold. Suddenly from PK's story, it becomes the story of two other characters.\n\nPK is not a bad film. Its actually a good film and like OMG asks some important questions about are belief in God and religion.\n\nAamir Khan is superb as PK and again proves that he is one of India's finest actor. It was a huge relief to see him laugh and make us laugh considering the fact that his previous outing Dhoom 3 where he was always moaning.\n\nAnushka is OK and holds herself against Aamir. The rest of the cast doing a commendable job starting from Rajput to Shukla and Irani.\n\nAs I said earlier, its a decent watch though I feel that 3 Idiots was the best."

Ranbir Kapoor in the end scene was a pleasant surprise. the tracks and background music may not seem that soothing but fit perfectly in the movie and carry forward the narration. overall, the movie makes for a decent watch especially our very own Bhojpuri PK .."

Hats off to Aamir Khan, this is one of his best performances. The film has conveyed a good message as we belong to humanity rather than any specific religion... This movie reminded me of OMG movie, though P.K. has presented this concept in a different way.. This movie is worth watching. They have tried to smoothen India-Pak relationship too.

However, we should not let religious differences get between love, work, or friendship nor should we blindly allow religion to solve all of our problems. This movie combines this message with great acting, emotion, and humor that even targets adults. I would definitely see this movie more than once, and I think it is much better than 3 idiots. Everyone does a great job, from Aamir Khan's eccentric and simple minded personality, to Anushka Sharma's lively character, to Boman Irani as a comic relief. The promos may seem a little odd, but trust me, after watching this movie you will understand why it is so great. Also take into account, this is a movie directed by an Indian(hindu), and a majority of the actors are hindu(except Aamir Khan). This should not matter at all, but if anyone says this is an anti-hindu or anti-Indian movie, this should prove other wise. It is a movie that targets all religious extremists and shows that we are, in the end, all human beings."

        "review_detailed_main": "One line is enough to summarize how two and half hours were (Well) spent. Trying not to spoil the movie's best kept secrets, the movie revolves around an amusing character who is far away from the civilization in which we live and he literally finds himself in an alien world. PK learns how to live with the limited knowledge of his surroundings and wins hearts with his honesty and childlike curiosity. PK relies on his learning quite literally and his actions are to the T which is not the way we live and hence at times he pulls a laughing riot and at some makes you question on your belief system. He shakes the ethos of many who are blind follower of the lines they have been asked to walk without taking any rational out of them and thus subjected to wrath of those who are blindfolded with their faith system. He unknowingly provokes questions which are seldom asked due to fear of backlash and gets people answer them in their discomfort.\n\nAmir Khan minus PK stands for nothing. This movie belongs to him, there may be many characters but not sure why their story was not well constructed or may be PK was such an overwhelming character that while he was on screen you couldn't notice anyone else and that's the magic of Amir's class. My biggest let down was Bomen's no show. He was always one of the best written characters in Raju Hirani's movie but unfortunately he finds no bravo moment this time. For me he was completely wasted. Anushka was more or less similar to her chirpy image which she portraits in every other movie of hers. Other than her changed look I didn't quite find anything new with her this time as well.\n\nWhile the movie was highly anticipated and was definitely top notch acting by Amir Khan for sure but I felt let down by the script which wasn't crisp and heavily relied on the spontaneity of protagonist. Parallels are to be drawn between PK and OMG and if I have to go by content and freshness then OMG is the winner. The analogy of being antagonist has been well played by Paresh Rawal and hence I wonder why Raju Hirani who is a class apart director went ahead with such lose content by his standard.\n\nThe movie tries to weave multiple issues like Indo-Pak, terrorism, Godmen, idol worshiping, religion in general and fail to capitalize on any except taking a dig over Godmen and their fake illumine. I surely don't find any content being objectionable for which outcry has been raised on net. Creative freedom is required for directors to objectify their view point and that was done with sincerity without any planned intention to hurt anyone's feeling. In totality I was tad disappointed with this one at the end."

I am not usually a big fan of Indian movies, but Amir Khan can do and have done better than this...\n\nMaybe all these religious problems in the film makes this movie work if you are Indian, but this \"wrong number\" crap that the movies keeps repeating just seems like such a juvenile idea. Do people really believe this stuff and as soon as someone says \"wrong number\" and points out that some gurus prophecy didn't come true the universe suddenly becomes clear to them? What is this movie trying to say? Even after seeing this movie I don't know.

Even if I did not go to church this Holy Thursday, the realizations I made and the blessings I received were enough. Sure, there were a lot of concepts on the verge of being cringe-y but they never showed a hint of hesitation and embarrassment. What anyone could feel was the immense level of mastery each had to observe to make all the elements- directing, photography, writing, music, dance, acting- work perfectly. Everything was on point, to say the least.\n\nAs a Catholic in a highly conservative country, this hit too close to home. I practice my faith like most people do but I wouldn't say I'm as devout as others. All the questions PK raised and practices confronted were valid. And I think about them ever since I was young. I felt seen that this has already transcended as an extension of my principles. The real challenge for me now is to keep on calling or else I would never know if it's the correct or wrong number at all. It wouldn't hurt as well to call out the propagators of hatred now that the world is getting more discriminatory and violent by the day. It's awful but it gives me hope that this kind of art exists for everyone to reflect upon. It might be a film today but who knows it might be the universal practice tomorrow- or in the near future. I can only pray or anticipate the next alien landing."

PK is a about a mysterious man who is innocent and extremely lovable to the audience. These kind of quality films were lacking for about two years.. Last such film was Barfi. Anushka Sharma surprisingly does a good job.. Sushant Singh's limited role was good. Boman Irani, Sanjay Dutt and Saurabh Shukla were as usual terrific. But the show stealer was our very dear PK. He has now proved that he is not parallel to the other two Khans, but definitely way above them. This will make you laugh, will make you love PK and will make you cry. This film is a must watch for all quality cinema lovers and for those who lived Kick and Happy New Year, you guys stay away from this movie. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A sort of adult E.T. mixed with a little romantic comedy and a lot of religion mockery, PK barrels along with broad humor, excellent acting, and an unlikely but enjoyable story.\n\nIn PK, a bug-eyed, floppy-eared Aamir Khan comes to earth and has him phone-home device stolen. After a few people tell him only God can help him get home, the alien develops a transactional concept of human religion, and is continually perplexed by his difficulties in getting one of our wold's many Gods he woos to help him out.\n\nWhile God lets him down, a curious reporter (Anushka Sharma) recovering from heartache comes up with an odd way to help, which involves creating a media war between the alien and a religious leader.\n\nThe moral of the movie is pretty much, organized religion sucks. Religion is portrayed (and I'm on the filmmaker's side here) as a film- flam that at best takes your money and at worst results in terrorism and war.\n\nThere are some logic issues here. I'll admit, I'm not Indian, but I think it's at least as religious as America, and if a news station created a platform for an agnostic rabble-rouser here it would not go well for them. But as I say, I don't know much of anything about India, so perhaps they are more open to debate than my local Christians.\n\nI'm also not convinced an alien would leap to this particular set of unlikely conclusions, but then, there's no real guarantee aliens would have much intelligence outside of the technological kind.\n\nThis is a very funny and occasionally touching movie with Khan weird and funny and Sharma perky and lovable. It also has some excellent songs, most notably Love is a Waste of Time, which is the first Indian song I ever found myself humming after the movie ended.\n\nIf you want to see a silly, anti-(organized)religion movie, this is an excellent choice."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not a huge fan of Indian films but this one was a lot of fun. An alien lands on earth and loses his communication device. He doesnt know what to do and when he asks folks for help they tell him to pray to god. So he spends the entire movie looking for god. He joins every religion and follows all their customs to talk to god but he still couldn't get his communicator back. As he was about to give up he meets a reporter who realizes he is telling the truth so she tries to help him. He has a real weird view on life on earth so she uses that to push a story about the alien who was challenging the religious leaders because he felt that their connection to god was hijacked by a prankster. So he tries to help the priests by exposing the pranksters illogical suggestions. Its pretty funny and pokes fun of a lot of religious practices that really are hilarious to watch though at the same time, its sad to think that anyone believes in them in the 21st century. There are a few music pieces in this and they were also fun and not very distracting from the comedy.\n\nAll that said, I gave it an 8 because it is not flawless. A lot of the arguments made are actually pretty well known so there was nothing new except the funny mimes and the aliens behavior. The real issue is the plot hole that materialized towards the end. It could have been handled in a much smarter way but still, this is a comedy so it really shouldnt be taken so seriously hence my high grade.\n\nIf you dont usually watch foreign subtitled movies, this is a great one to start with... you are missing a lot of great stuff if you dont."

A true masterpiece by all means; and lastly.. Sanjay Dutt's role is really an emotional one.. Aamir Khan is as always awesome! Anushka Sharma is sensational, and Sushant Singh Rajput looks charming in his character!!! The spaceship (as well as the theory on Aliens), is sorta COOOOL!! These kind of films with a merry atmosphere, these days, have become rare. Therefore, P.K. surely deserves an Oscar!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Although the film has few flaws in its story-telling, PK is more than watchable because of its great comic moments and for taking up a subject, Religion, which for a long time in its history, bollywood had decided to steer clear of. And there are good reasons for it. Movies which have religion as its subject matter always tend to be controversial. We are seeing the same thing with PK with many suits being filed which thankfully the courts have dismissed quickly.\n\nIn a year where we have had a very short supply of quality movies, PK will come as a breath of fresh air. Just like his first three films, Rajkumar Hirani again takes up a socially relevant subject and laces it with humor and idiosyncratic situations. We would find many of Hirani's trademarks in this movie. The central character who is a misfit who gets mocked at the beginning before winning everyone's hearts one by one and ends up being the agent of change. The main antagonist is not an evil person but one who has misguided beliefs. The film is a combination of laughing-out loud moments and some tear-jerking moments.\n\nWhereas the comic moments are as laughable as was the case with Munnabhai and 3 Idiots, it is the emotional moments where it comes up short. And the major reason is that the movie doesn't devote enough time in fleshing out the relationships between the characters. Case in point, Anushka and Sushant's romance and break- up and also Anushka's relationship with his father. Also, except for Aamir and Anushka's characters, most of the supporting characters don't have much to do which is highly unfortunate for a cast with talents like Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla and Sanjay Dutt. Another flaw is that the first half involves too many songs which breaks the flow of the story and the second half tends to get preachy at times and the ending seemed to be a bit melodramatic just like 3 Idiots.\n\nAamir Khan's PK is the heart and soul of this movie and he comes up with arguably one of his best performance of his career alongside his performances in Lagaan, Rang De Basanti, 3 Idiots etc. Expect him to win many best actor awards in this award season although he wouldn't be attending those award functions. Anushka Sharma plays a bubbly character and she is more than efficient in this role. Sanjay Dutt is wonderful in his brief screen role. Saurabh Shukla is watchable. Boman Irani is wasted in a role who has very little to do. The writing team of 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi, comes up with another socially relevant script and their work is top-notch although it isn't as water-tight as their previous work. The music by Shantanu Moitra is pretty good although the songs aren't as memorable as 3 Idiots. My picks are Bhagwan Kaha Hai Tu, Chaar Kadam and the PK theme.\n\nPK is not a movie which will please everyone. In fact, many will get offended due to its anti-religious views (A good example are the protests ranging in Gujarat accusing the movie of hurting Hindu sentiments). My advice to these people is not to misinterpret the message in the film. Just like the similar themed Paresh Rawal- starrer Oh My God, this movie is not telling us to stop having faith in God but it is questioning whether the medium by which we try to communicate with God is right or not. I recommend all of you to watch this movie at- least once. Whether you like it or not, you will not be able to erase this movie from your memory for a good time. And how many recent bollywood films linger in your memory even for a moment after you have finished watching it?"

We follow PK on his quest to recover his stolen intergalactic transmitter which leads up to addressing the issues of religious superstition and fanaticism. The concept is very similar to Oh My God, but the execution is a blast! The pacing is quite fast, and the gags keep on coming continuously until they are interrupted by a song every once in a while. The movie avoids any sort of melodrama, but the plot takes a little comfort in coincidences. There are tons of surprises, and laugh out loud (fart-jerking) moments. The performances are outstanding... Aamir is extraordinary and Anushka shows a lot of energy. Sushant is charming and Saurabh Shukla is amazing. Also, Boman and Sanjay are pretty good in this movie. This movie has flaws, but one must ignore them because if someone keeps dwelling on plot holes, they will surely be missing out on entertainment at a grand scale The climax of this movie is twisted and seems a little forced, but i didn't give a damn because i was having a great time!

Right from Munnabhai MBBS through to 3 Idiots, I feel that Bollywood had discovered a Director that could create the perfect feel good factor in a film. And rather than the actor, the script and the director were always the stars of the show. However, having watched P.K. I strongly feel that if you remove Aamir Khan from the equation, then the film loses its charm. The character P.K. has been overpowered by the star Aamir Khan, which is a first for a RKH film (sorry for the very Asian abbreviation!).\n\nFurthermore, I also feel that, maybe even the director and writer may admit as much, not every possibility or scenario has been exhausted whilst constructing the screenplay and for some reason the film as a whole seems incomplete as a product. Certain parts of the film appear stretched and the narrative becomes very patchy; despite the usual voice over by one of the prominent characters. Perhaps my expectations were just too high or I have come to expect a higher standard given the names that were connected with P.K. Whilst I will not say that I'm disappointed with the film, on the whole it could have been better. I have therefore marked the film 6 out of 10, but pushed it to 7 for the performance of Aamir Khan."

This movie joins the league of senseless projects that are shown to be successful because of their 'projected' box office numbers. The major revenue from Indians abroad is simply because they just like a couple hours of desi talk and song for a change, which they go in believing it will be senseless anyways. Indian audiences' strong buying power and lack of available alternatives make their sole trip to the cineplex ring the cash counter.\n\nAny silly act cannot be called entertainment.

And the Hirani/Chopra duo flawlessly depict the very same in a rugged Indian context. The nude scene of Aamir Khan (an integral part of the movie) and many more such scenes bear testimony to the real theme of the movie, which has been assiduously wrapped in a commercial blanket by the auteur RK Hirani. As a human being ages, his/her mental condition and understanding of the society/world at large undergoes numerous phenomenological changes, most fundamentally from compliance to cognizance and finally to deeper consciousness. This is what RK Hirani/VV Chopra portray in this movie, scene after brilliant scene. Now, a bit on the actors. A well chosen cast, appreciable screenplay and soothing music coupled with the \"P\"erfectionist \"K\"Han (I have a lingering doubt if the movie title actually alluded to Aamir's sobriquet) make for a kill. PK is a brave movie, a social satire and a call to change. India has seen numerous reformers from the Buddha, Nanak, Kabir, Shankardeva, Veerashaivas, to the modern day Dayanand Saraswati, Ishwar C Vidyasagar, Pandit Nehru, Gandhi , Ambedkar , Goparaju Ramachandra Rao, Jyotibha Phule, Ram Manohar Lohia et al. And each pro-changer has been humiliated, abused and villainized in his time by the no-changer conservative orthodoxy(though later they have tried appropriating the very legacy of these great men, once their greatness gets accepted by all and sundry). What we are witnessing today, the criticism of PK and the cynical attitude towards its message, is the old phenomena (the one I mentioned in the previous sentence) being played out over and over again. All it indicates is that PK is on its way to become a cult-classic, very much like \"2001-A space odyssey\" and \"The Seventh Seal\" et al.\n\nA simple question to those complaining of PK being \"anti-Hindu\" . The current government of India and your PM swear by hindutva. So, what exactly is stopping them from banning PK?"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a country of Vedas and religious tolerance, our society has evolved from a God worshiping nation to a God fearing nation. We have politicized God, commercialized God, incentivized God and sensationalized God (dedicated 24X7 channels for each variation of God). Bhagwaan.. Hai kaha re tuuuuu!!! Ee Khudu hai kaha re tu!! PK is not a movie with a social message. It's more of a retrospective question about our stand on God. Its not preaching a solution, but just nudging us to see if we are really on a right path. And who better to do this, than Raju Hirani and Aamir Khan. +ve points: - Brilliant script and narration. For me, the first hero of the movie is Raju Hirani. The guy has scripted it (of course along with Abhijat Joshi), directed it, produced it and edited it!! With just 4 movies, he has carved out his own genre of movies. Watching his movies is like reading an RK Narayan novel. It gives you that warmth feeling of simplicity. - Aamir Khan!! Goes to show how much a methodical actor can elevate a movie. Watch out for his expressions in the Bhagwaan song and the scenes following it. His childish expressions are so convincing that his buff body looks out of context! - Excellent supporting cast including Sanjay Dutt, Sushant Singh, Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani - Bold marketing strategy of not revealing the plot details during pre-release. It's the old school of keeping the suspense of the movie, but it adds a dimension to the movie. -ve points - The romance angle between Aamir and Anushka seems forced. Their relationship could have been kept platonic with just the last scene in place. - The conclusion to Anushka's relationship seems cheesy. - The final encounter between Tapasviji and PK must have been more stronger. My rating Story - 1 Screenplay - 0.75 - Second half is not as balanced as the first Acting - 1 Other departments - 1. Music is very contextual and adds to the narration Overall package - 1 Total - 4.75/5 PS: Please please please make the sequel of PK with AK and RK in the lead!!! We need such a confluence of talent!!!"

This time, his simple humor and exotic characters couldn't hold together what he tries to portray in the film.\n\nWhile he does put forth a very relevant issue in our decorated but flawed Indian Culture, he relies on making the majority of audience happy by giving them a few laughs first and then get straight to controlling them by presenting the reality behind their mindset. This worked brilliantly well for lage raho and 3 idiots because the medium of comedy was well suited to the characters of munnabhai and rancho. Here there was no real need to stick to the same technique, like I said, he did get a good laughs but people unknowingly laughed to dark humor if you see the film and carefully observe the scenes in the first half of the main lead. Hirani chases humor with this story which is not comic in nature unlike his previous two where it came naturally and ends up getting distracted at times. It is difficult to get absorbed by the plot which is not multi-dimensional and relies on techniques used in previous two films. There would have been immense scope had Hirani didn't make himself constrained by need to please everyone with simple humor and a relevant topic in the society. He could have been more influential with a more darker approach to the story with strong emotions against the main character.\n\nThere are positives to the films in the name of Aamir, it can't get better than this. He delivers again, this time without Hirani, he still shines brighter than the film put together.\n\nIn numbers, 2/5 for Hirani and 4/5 for Aamir and Co..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is better than many films of 2014, and even many other films of the last decade. Rajkumar Hirani proves again that he can make only good movies. He teams up with Vinod Chopra, Abhijat Joshi & Amir Khan, and made pk after 3 idiots. 3 idiots was a cult movie. This film is also fabulous, but, as per my concern, not better than the previous. This film reminds us Akshay Kumar-Paresh Rawal starrer OMG!Oh My God. But I must say that pk is better. The story, screenplay, dialogues, acting, songs, music, direction, locations- everything is too good. What to say about Amir Khan, he is damn good as pk, an alien. It is very difficult to act like him with fully open eyes, & even without blinking. Anushka Sharma looks so pretty. It was her best performance at all. Sanjay Dutt, Saurabh Shukla, Shushant Singh Rajput & Boman Irani - all the actors performed really well. Music is outstanding. Nanga-Punga dost, Tharki Chokro, Love is waste of time & Bhagvan - all these songs are written beautifully and composed brilliantly. Music composer is Shantanu Moitra and Ajay-Atul & lyricist is Swanand Kirkire. Rajkumar Hirani is baap of all directors in this decade. He can engage public with social message and very unique and laugh out laugh comedy. I laughed so much during the film. And I became emotional in the climax. Totally emotional and very touchy climax, even unpredictable, I'm sure many of you may have tears in their eyes in the climax. Abhijat Joshi & Rajkumar Hirani's extraordinary story, concept & dialogues make the film a worth watch at any cost. Whatever the price of the theater is, you can definitely spend the money on it. This is probably the last big release of this year, so go for it. And pk dekhne jaana par, pk nahi jaana."

I felt Raju Hirani completed script little too soon. You will love Aamir for his hard work for this character. Anushka has also done good job with her character \"Jaggu\". Sushant looks simple in his small appearance. I would say this movie should be watched for Aamir and Raju Hirani. Go and enjoy this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK so I had hopes watching this one.\n\nFinally got a chance to watch this. I will be honest, its a brave move to try and fit all these different things inside a 3 hours span. Different things being the varied set of emotions that make you feel happy, sad, sentimental, all in just one movie. Raju Hirani did this with 3 Idiots and he did it flawlessly. That movie was a perfect blend of all emotions and worked incredibly well in terms of entertainment and the message being passed.\n\nUnfortunately, PK is a good attempt that falls flat trying that. You have a complicated story arch of Aamir's character and how he realizes things that he does and the social message he wants to pass. With all this you now have Anushka's story arch which starts off good but suddenly is given a full stop, only to conveniently resume when the movie requires it later. I strongly think that movies like 3 Idiots and 'especially' Oh My God far surpass PK because they were successful in delivering the message they aim for. The topic picked by PK, the commercialization of religions and how one should follow true religion is way way more clear and effective in OMG. The good thing I loved about this movie though is the way Aamir's character learns the different religious rituals performed all over India by different religious sects. The way his character is written is pretty unique just the way his character was in 3 Idiots. The twist by the end is good as well but I sincerely think either Anushka's love story should have been completely dropped or should have been given more screen time.\n\nIn the end, the movie tries to be a jack of all trades but fails a wee bit. Not as mesmerizing as OMG but its a worth watching movie for sure. And since the way Aamir explains how religions are being followed wrongly is more down to earth and in simpler language, I think it will be understood well by the rural parts of India as well, which is where this problem lies anyways.\n\nCongratulations on being the highest grossing Bollywood movie ever."

Just a mix of different scripts, roles, and comedy scenes.\n\nOverall - Average or below.\n\nUnless you have extra money and time to spent - Don't go PK."

        "review_detailed_main": "As Bollywood's slapstick brigade laughed its way to the bank in a year that saw extremes in cinema, one remembers only the handful that stood against the tide and provided some freshness with genuine storytelling. In a last among them, a stranger finds himself in an awkwardly complex land with subjective attitudes to cultural philosophies that simply do not make sense to him. Yes, he is an alien (But not of the Jadoo variety). Because only an alien can actually look at things objectively on a gola where questioning age-old systems means sacrilege. He is critical of the general norm and challenges the religion managers with child-like questions whose answers might send tremors across the general cultural beliefs. Rajkumar Hirani isn't new to breaking the stereotype and changing perceptions. With 'Munnabhai' and 'Rancho' having influenced a generation in their own way, he now faced the challenge of accusing religious leaders of connecting people to a 'wrong number' with God. He had to often ridicule common practices, rattle faith and yet remain inoffensive to each religion in a country that boasts of its diversity. Hirani's genius solution was to have an alien look at this from a child- like perspective and question our common sense and conscience. Optimistically, the result will alter the way a billion people waste gold, money, milk and sundry products in age old superstitions that are commanded by the fear of uncertainty. Pessimistically, these billion will simply erupt in guffaws provoked by PK's outrageous learning process while munching on their expensive popcorn.\n\nPK's (Aamir Khan) only means of returning home was stolen from him the moment he arrived in the remoteness of Rajasthan. Barely learning mankind's basic ways in perhaps the most hilarious ways in recent memory, he encounters Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who fails to understand this unique character but indirectly helps him learn bhojpuri. Now, with language as his effective tool, PK travels to Delhi in search of the thief who stole his device. Through various sources, he is recommended to follow the path of God, who would offer a solution to his problem. This is when PK is confronted with several Gods among diverse religions that sometimes have the opposite principles. Through rigorous devotion to his cause of searching for the one who could help him, PK realizes that God wasn't answering because of the wrong connection with his devotees. Aided in his quest to change people's views about God by a TV journalist, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma), he dares to correct the iconic servant of God, Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla). What ensues in Rajkumar Hirani's well written script is a delicate walk along the line of pragmatism and self belief.\n\nThis is most certainly among Aamir Khan's best films. With his wide open eyes and flappy ears, he is constantly observing and learning to adapt to a strange land. His child- like viewpoint of life around him on the gola is portrayed convincingly along with his frustrations, confusions and deliberations. His objective view of things we do on a day-to-day basis in a subjective manner is what prompts the best dialogues, performances and comedy in the film. The dialogues of course, are funnier because of him speaking in bhojpuri. Anushka Sharma uses her charm to complement Aamir Khan's eccentric character and while she naturally enjoys his comedy, she guards her recent heartbreak from an episode in Belgium. Her energy is consistent throughout and that is perhaps her strength as an actress. Sushant Singh Rajput impresses in his brief role while Boman Irani is outstanding as the media mogul who is keen to avenge the trishul attack on him. Parikshit Sahni's depiction of a stubborn religious follower is quite a treat from one of the most under-rated supporting actors. Bhairon Singh's brevity on screen was definitely inadequate and we realize how well Sanjay Dutt complements Hirani's form of storytelling in any character. Saurabh Shukla's Tapasvi Maharaj is the manipulative hypocrite whose ego and lies reflect much of what is wrong with religion now. He is excellent in the debate scene with PK where his demeanor even sets doubts in our minds about the outcome.\n\nMusic by Ajay-Atul and Shantanu Moitra is reminiscent of Hirani's previous films. Refreshing and catchy with smooth melodies such as chaar kadam which has Shaan at his best. Waste of time is catchy enough to linger in our minds with its happy theme.\n\nRajkumar Hirani isn't out the change the world. But he is certainly enabling us to. PK only speaks his mind and looks at the world like a child but his struggle with making sense of the world is what we relate to. PK's questioning of the cultural norms and religious bigotries doesn't aim for sacrilege. It instead enables us to pursue what we believe in purely, without any influencing factors. The disbelief of the alien's existence quickly gets discarded by the script's intention to use him as a manifestation of an outsider, cutting through the layers of complexities we have surrounded our cultures with. Then there's the adroitly crafted Sarfaraz-Jaggu love story that seems like an odd deviation for a while, till it so heart-warmingly falls into the satire. There's so much beauty in PK and none of it relates to scenery, actor's bodies, slapstick comedy and over-acting. It's all in the writing and dialogues where it makes so much sense. This is an intelligently made film that took Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra 5 years to make (along with other projects) and the effort is completely justified when the audience nods with PK in appreciation of his views and rolls out of their seats while laughing at the brilliantly executed barber scene. PK and his friend are going to be one alien duo we will eagerly be waiting to welcome on to our gola."

        "review_detailed_main": "'PK' is a fresh, enjoyable, whip-smart satire on organized religion and its various side-effects. The movie is from the same Director-Actor (Rajkumar Hirani-Aamir Khan) duo which gave us the lovable '3 Idiots'; though this film lacks the depth and emotional impact of '3 Idiots', it asks far more serious questions about various beliefs and the discrimination resulting from it.\n\nThe acting by everyone involved is commendable, especially Aamir who is the heart and soul of the film. It does have the regular Hirani ingredients: social commentary, Boman Irani, colourful cinematography and hummable music, and like his prior films, these things work in his favour.\n\nThe characters could have been developed a little better, and a little more plot to the story could have done wonders for the film. But overall, it's quite an ambitious and courageous film in a country that takes religion far too seriously. The idea of making an alien the central character was a masterstroke; the way he looks at things with child-like curiosity and amazement is quite amusing and contemplative: same kind of people divided by the presence of various Gods and their own separate rules, the way people blindly follow anyone who claims to have a connection with God and throw logic to the side, the stereotypes we associate with various communities, the amount we give to religious institutions rather than charities or the needy, etc. It also has a small but interesting element of love; \"If you love someone truly, set them free.\"\n\nAs a film, it may not appear so great, but as a social satire, it is something the country was in dire need of. Hope more people watch it and get a clearer view of the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "Waited so long and watched it at last. Last three movies of Rajkumar Hirani was blast. So the expectation for PK was huge. But sorry to say the movie has failed to fulfill it. There is Rajkumar Hirani style of making a movie commercially stable at the same time giving it an inspirational motive to change the society. The main idea of this movie was good though in some extent it coincides with the story of \"Oh My God\". Giving the story a Sci- Fi background was different but to me a practical background would have been much more appreciated. As a Rajkumar Hirani movie usually do, it attracts you to the story just at the beginning but this movie lacked this quality. As the story goes forward the vibe of a Hirani film came into picture. Thought the ending would be great as the story was constantly being better. But the ending was no better than the beginning. For the last 30 mins it was so hard for me to keep the concentration. I would say it was too much filmy. If we let some things slide the making was good. Liked the cinematography. Now the acting. Aamir Khan was good as expected. But Anushka Sharma looked as ugly as possible with her new horrible lip-job. So, it was a let down. Wish next movie of Rajkumar Hirani wont be like this."

It doesn't deserve this rating, and it is biased only by the fact so many Indian people have rated it with ridiculous scores.\n\nThis is a minor, hyped, boring B movie. The interesting aspects are only the trivial aspects of it. For example is interesting to notice that Indian movies cast old actors with plastic surgery and lifting. Is interesting to see the mannerism adopted to shoot most of it, still the laughable music and story won't let you enjoy it as a story, but only as a display of cultural differences and desperate attempts at producing something that mocks the western world cinema."

Best story teller of Bollywood! Only hope of people with good taste in movies when movies like Action Jackson are released every other Friday!\n\nNow About the movie - (No Spoiler) This movie does not matches in Quality with Raju's previous films but screenplay is not even a little bit weak... The movie has flaws but that can be overlooked easily by the Breathtaking Screenplay, Over the top story telling and stunning performances by Actors! And the social message is very strong, thanks a lot Raju for making movie on this issue! Nobody would have given a damn if your storytelling wouldn't have been this much good! Being a Indian We must Go and watch PK to motivate Hirani So He will make such movies again in future and make us feel Happy!"

PK is combination of everything, comedy, suspense, religious agnosticism, love, emotions, breakups, broken hearts, religious wrong believes, villains(Hindu Baba) and a helplessness of an alien that everybody of us has faced when we move from one city to another, one country to another...........!!

Very meticulously presented piece of art so don't try to judge it with a narrow mindset.Flow and transitions in the movie are quiet natural and do enough to keep you with it. Anuskha Sharma delivers a decent performance, but Aamir steals the show as he does it in most cases. Although some topics raised are quiet similar to the ones in OMG but the movie is totally different. You can either agree or disagree, but you cannot avoid it. Its not totally flawless, the story telling could have been more effective.But Overall its a movie worth watching if you agree with the topics it raises."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half is entertaining, filled with laughter, not slapstick, but genuine comedy arose from awkward situations (not actions). As the story moves forward it becomes messy; it starts as the story of Pk and the concept of religion and god through his eyes, this part is brilliantly written, then, at one point, it becomes confusing if it's about his life, commentary on god or jaggu's personal life, etc. There are two love stories, one is important to the story, other plays a spoilsport.\n\nSome of the arguments by Pk are taken from Oh My God (2012). Like when Pk files F. I. R against god, and his analogy that a father (god alike) will never his son to the Himalayas to fulfill his demands, the scene where he makes a temple out of a stone and people calling out fake Sadhu's after his interview, but with an additional phrase- \"wrong number\". In a way, it doesn't have its own arguments in the theory of god.\n\nOne thing it brilliantly does is highlighting some of the holes in modern theories of religion, some facts that everybody knows but keeps ignoring.\n\nEnd of the review.\n\nUnpopular opinion: Aamir Khan played an alien here. We don't know how aliens behave. In the first half, he didn't show human-like expressions and kept a 'confused' look throughout. In the second half, the story gets dramatic, and he displays emotions like humans. Although he received praise for his performance, he was weak, especially in last few scenes. But that's mainly because of the way the character was written. I sincerely believe his performance in the film is overrated."

For the director who gave 2 of the masterpiece in Munnabhai and an excellent 3 idiots, I could not connect with its main protagonist as I did in earlier of his films. Yes Amir does his share of acting but every time he questions God, it reminded me of Paresh Rawal from Oh! My God, so the movie did not left any impact but instead it refreshed my memory of OMG. Remember those last scenes from both Munnabhai series, my heart still races when I see those scenes now, but PK did not left any of those types of impact. And that last scene where PK and that guru argue about God and Anushka goes on to call her long lost love around the world on national television, the film deviates from its point and that kind of ending is just unacceptable. Had I seen PK before OMG, 3 idiots and Munnabhai, it would have been a classic but for now its just a movie that is neither bad nor good."

The movie is not an attack on any Religion, it is an attack on Mankind as it exists today. It highlights the wrongdoings by the so called godmen and makes an attempt to showcase them to the world. The points raised were good but could have hurt sentiments of some groups of people. Though there are some unpredictable scenes which make the audience uncomfortable.

While the plot may have loops, it's questions surrounding religion, morality and religious discrimination cover up for it . Without going into too much detail, I would urge you to try to watch this movie. This movie would make you question morality, and the baffling holy war this world has gone into. Who's to blame? Though the answers may vary from creed to creed, the answer would be of the same essence. Is one creed really to be blamed? r do we all share a part of the blame?

It's a decent albeit overrated film which has a few great ideas but it suffers from some typical Bollywood song and dance tropes which frankly tire me. Aamir Khan's alien who is a logical being learns the ways of the Earth the hard way and realizes that only God can help him get back to his home planet. There are some hilarious scenes when PK mixes the religious practices and offends everybody but this segment is over an hour and a half long and should have been cut by half at least to make the film tighter and more focused. Also for a superior alien specimen PK sure isn't smart, if logic doesn't work with God 1, why will it work with God 2? Well PK realizes this by the time he reaches dumb religious practice no. 43 with God 7 or 8. I was screaming at the screen I GET IT HIRANI lets move the god damn (pun!) story forward. The song and dance sequences are boring and forced, movie would have conveyed it's message better without them. Other major gripe I had was that PK was trying so hard to be logical and then it suddenly became illogical. When did the motivation become from going back to home planet to saving the human race from god men? Why care about \"the wrong number\" or anything at all on this planet other than securing your communication device? This ladies and gentlemen is called a bad script. PK is interested in god as long as he is rewarded but then he chooses to expose the god man as a fake/dhongi so that people awaken to the fraud but why does PK care to do this? It's never explained. Aamir, Anushka and Saurabh Shukla are good in their roles but why is Boman Irani so likable in all his roles, it's impossible to hate this man.\n\nOther major issue I had with this film was the bad romance which was laughable and the twist was dumb. Which teenager wrote this? Hindi films have such high quality romance and this was pathetic, even lately The Lunch Box's forbidden fruit love between two mature older people was so complex and handled with great care PK was just downright dumb in the romance department. Overall I would say PK has a very strong social message but there are abundant issues present in the film which doesn't make it the best Bollywood has to offer, there are much better Hindi movies than PK, Ugly (the last Hindi film I watched) and Haider both released this year and both miles ahead of PK of course they didn't spend crores on marketing thus they probably didn't get as much coverage as PK."

        "review_detailed_main": "The subject of God and Religion is very debatable. When questions are raised over common religious practices it may often hurt many who have unchangeable belief on their own religion and blind faith over religious gurus. PK is such a movie which tries to enlighten one to go beyond a religious boundary in the form of comical laughter. In 2012, a film \"OMG \u2013 Oh My God!\" was based on the similar topic. However, PK excels OMG in all forms. Consider yourself as PK, who has come as visitor on this earth with no previous religious knowledge and the concept of God, and observe various religious practices, to appease God and Gurus out of fear. The idea is not new. Democritus, in the fifth century B.C. said, \"The ancients seeing what happens in the sky, for example, thunder and lightning and thunderbolts and conjunctions of the stars and eclipses of the Sun and Moon were afraid, believing gods to be the cause of these.\" Bertrand Russell in his article \"Why I am Not a Christian?\" supports the same idea. However, PK demonstrates all these ancient theories in a very humorous way, which might impact and awaken new enlightened generation. The message that no Priests or Gurus are to be worshiped, which is already a well established part of Brahmo religion, is again well dramatized by Rajkumar Hirani, the film director. The underlying fact that there exists no difference in Human beings to all religions is brilliantly proved in the film. But, the question remains unanswered: How do you change your fundamental religion belief after watching this film?"

Hats off to Aamir Khan, the innocence , the expressions was amazing. The whole star cast did an excellent job in each of their roles. It reflects how foolish we are sometimes in believing things just out of fear. The movie brought up lot of thoughts in our minds and gave huge insight in the little things v valued. A movie worth watching in the Bollywood industry, requesting everyone young or old to go watch. Me and my husband were satisfied and content.The songs kept rolling in our heads all day and some of the scenes are worth watching repeatedly. Thanks for this beautiful experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "A NOVICE CANNOT CALL IT A SCI-FI FILM An alien representing a race far more advanced than humans capable of inter-galactic travel,inquisitive and wealthy enough to embark on the study of life on other planets sends its representative, who happens to be an absolute idiot.\n\nThe idiot is stark-naked, but wears a weird looking contraption tied to his neck by a weak golden chain no self-respecting thief would think twice to snatch. If the contraption is gone, the alien is as good as dead.\n\nHe looks exactly like a human being with a recently acquired six-pack. (AK in case you have not guessed), but is instructed by the controllers back home not to blink. AK makes an effort to do that and nearly succeeds.\n\nThe alien can learn any language by holding the hands of a female for six hours without a break. He succeeds in doing that and learns Bhojpuri from a prostitute in Rajasthan. He learns all the terms cultural, religious and the rest. He can speak fluently, the nuances and all, but lacks the common sense to understand the concept of give and take.\n\nWe did not expect a Jules Verne or an Asimov, but as science fiction movies go, Hollywood, and all ollywoods with B,T,K,M..., this is the bottom rung.\n\nALL ABOUT HUMOUR Almost all the situations that were designed to satiate your hunger for humour, are either inspired from hackneyed themes or blatantly copied.\n\nIf you really want to laugh, read OSHO jokes on religion,or watch OH MY GOD and the like.\n\nIN A NUTSHELL Raj Kumar Hirani, did dish out two reasonably good movies earlier. He thinks rehashing all the elements from his popular movies is a sure way to success. The 2 wheeler, the helmet, the long-drawn out kiss,familiar music bits, the talk-shows and all.You see Parikshat Sahni, you guess all his sequences together with the dialogues.\n\nThe film, far from being original, lacks consistency of the main character. He steals money from a beggar, disobeys civic laws, knows to cheat and lie, and has a ready source for his fancy dresses-- innumerable rollicking cars wherein the couples remove all their clothes before they get down to business. He is a puritan, cheat, innocent, prophet-like,diplomatic,liar,and a buffoon rolled into one.\n\nTHE MESSAGE:Can any one please tell me?\n\nI regret spending three hours(including the interval time) watching this much-hyped movie. Saurabh Shukla is a miscast in the role of Tapaswi.The character itself is ill-conceived, neither funny nor villainous.His assistants printout the comments about him from FB and Twitter and present him the files daily.\n\nI still give the film 6 for few saving graces like Anushka, the obvious efforts of Amir Khan, some good scenes in roads of Belgium where the roads are all for your self, some good shots in the desert of Rajasthan.\n\n4 out of my 6 go to the beautiful dance duet(thankfully no song) from the lead pair.Well-conceived, well-orchestrated, and well-shot."

This satire goes a little overboard.\n\nAs far as the cast is concerned, Aamir Khan's acting is absolutely brilliant, other actors have also played their part really well too.\n\nAll that said, it's definitely a one time watch, especially so if you're an Aamir Khan fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "You can't question religion. You can't ask for logical explanations when it comes to one's faith. We are not supposed to do that. We are not taught to do that. You have to be either an alien or an escapee from the nearest mental asylum. PK (played by the calculative risk-taker & a game-changer in many cases Aamir Khan) is one such rare genus. His level of indulgence with our worldly Gods is absolutely 'out of this world'. His child-like innocence can bombard questions of all kind without giving you much time to think and react. He can also make you thunderstruck with his logical demonstrations about things you never bothered or rather apprehended to ask about. No doubt, he looks like a distant and conscientiously more intuitive cousin to Fungshuk Wangdu of 3 IDIOTS.\n\n'PK' is another gem of Rajkumar Hirani's school of film-making where success can also be formulated by assimilating an unfussy entertainment of dramatic but simple nature & a 'never gets preachy' social message weaved in good humor and honest emotions. So when PK- the untainted innocent soul discovers people buying goods of their needs simply by exchanging a piece of paper with an old man's picture (our very own 'father of the nation) printed on it, he starts collecting every single poster & newspaper- cutting carrying his image. Next, we are made realize how we only respect the 'financial' worth and not the 'moral' values the man lived his life for.\n\n'PK' also dares to question your blind- faith on forged Godmen from all religions. It's high time we turn to humanity as our primary religious conviction rather than wasting our hard- money and the gifted wisdom to differentiate right from wrong on someone else's phony tactics. As PK says in the film, the God who created us is very different from the ones we created. And the prayers we make through these age-old practices are nothing more than a 'wrong number' call.\n\nThe biggest strength of 'PK' is that it talks less and speaks more. There is hardly a scene where you don't get thrashed by one or other social issues or expected human behavioral flaws in us; in a very subtle, explicable, logical and entertaining manner. The Bhojpuri texture to the lingo adds to it fervently and freely. It is one of the most sugary languages spoken across country; still very misinterpreted and wrongly portrayed and performed for Bollywood films. 'PK' also doesn't do it flawlessly but certainly the respect is there. For a change, I am not offended this time!\n\nHirani and Abhijat Joshi's taut and an almost flawless screenplay gives you ample hilarious as well as heartwarming moments. Anushka Sharma impresses with her sparkling presence very well translated into a lovely & lively character on screen. Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani are efficiently likable. Sushant Singh Rajput is charming and plays it cool, though is only for a shorter role. And who wouldn't agree? The leading man leads like no one does better. Aamir is known to reinvent his acting abilities as well as the commercial cinema in India. This one takes his efforts to the next level. He gives us a multicolored paan-chewing character you will take home immediately.\n\nAnd if could give you more about the film, I would be writing it hours in row. There is so much to cheer-so much to cherish; you wouldn't mind it going twice in its first week. I am ready for the evening show. Till then; my only reaction to the film is if Bollywood is meant to follow the latest formula for recreating similar box-office success, are we going to see many more 'PK's in coming years? I am sure, the answer is negative. PK is outstanding & it doesn't come to us too often!"

        "review_detailed_main": "5 years back 3 Idiots had become highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time. And it deserved it being a really wonderful film. I know Box Office numbers are not a measure of how good a movie is but it surely indicates the taste of people. In the last few years Box Office Record in India have been continuously broken by one film after another generating immense hype. But this hype was generated by nothing but the Film-star name attached with film or cashing in with dumb sequels of good movies. May it be the the silly Chennai Express or absurd Kick, lame Krrish 3 or abomination of Dhoom 3, none of these stupid Blockbusters deserved such hype. It almost made me lose faith in Bollywood and the number of Bollywood movies I watched started dropping. But then I saw PK and saw it smashing the records of all those films. This movie convinced me Bollywood can still give box office hits which are actually worth the money.\n\nWell enough with box office collection talk.Director and Writer Rajkumar Hirani has always delivered be it Munnabhai or 3 Idiots. His movies apart from being absolutely hilarious also have a nice social message. PK is another such gem. The story follows the adventures of an unknown guy going only by initials PK (Aamir Khan), he asks innocent questions and is very curious about the world around him. I wont spoil anything as I want you to get surprised by this thrilling ride. Aamir Khan has given his best performance till date and proves that he is not called Mr.Perfectionist for no good reason. His expression, emotions and induction of innocence into the character of PK is mesmerizing. You instantly fall in love PK and his antics. Another such performance comes to mind is Ranbir Kapoor as Barfi, such heart-winning performances and characters. Anushka Sharma also is excellent as a journalist. Sanjay Dutt,Boman Irani and Sushant Singh Rajput were a delight to watch despite having relatively smaller roles. But the main engine of train Aamir Khan, just cant stop praising him. Definitely best performance of the year followed closely by Shahid Kapoor in 'Haider'.\n\nThe first half was like a refreshing breeze filled with comic and laugh-out-loud moments. And its not slapstick and lame comedy, but a smart and innovative funny script. The language of Bhojpuri is also used which has its own zing.Towards the middle the movie takes up on religious issues like 'Oh My God'. There is also lot of protest and boycotting going on as the film supposedly hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Its really sad to see people forgetting morality and humanity, which is the core message the film tries to deliver. We are all humans first and no one should forget that. The film looses steam in second becoming a bit repetitive and takes a bit too serious tone and the shift isn't much gradual. But the ending is excellent and has a surprising cameo by one of my favorite actors. The music and songs are very pleasant and they suit the atmosphere perfectly. One of the songs 'Bhagwan Kahan Hai Tu' was beautifully shot and was really heart-touching. The movie isn't perfect but its positives get brilliantly highlighted.\n\nIn the end, I would like to thank Rajkumar Hirani for giving us this wonderful treat and Aamir Khan for his heart-touching performance. PK is not Hirani's best but its a welcome film into big money grossing films of Bollywood where most films have the least substance. Watch it now people, because its worth the money.\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]"

This system goes into war to protect itself and currently its extreme forms have been the cause of terrorism.\n\nA major aspect expressed was that we are a minute planet in the universe of billions of galaxies and to fight to protect God is immature as one who is so vast - the creator of universe does not need any protection. Mankind has been fighting of its own shallow ideals about sprituality in name of religion.\n\nOne of the best acting, directing and screenplay from Indian cinema with deep underlying message about our place in the universe and the purpose of religion. We do not need an imaginary God, we need each other. We need hope and it does not need to be based on fairy tales, but on spiritual values that enforce humanism."

It makes us look at our world in a different way, live in a simple way, not sophisticated. Aamir Khan was spectacular and perfect for the role!! No one could've done it better than him. The amount of dedication and handwork in his acting is just impeccable and appreciable. Anushka and Sushant was also brilliant. Saurab Shukla's acting was different this time. Overall, it was a brilliant film having good social messages and portrayed in a different and a spectacular way."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the Munnabhai movies and 3 Idiots, it is natural to have mammoth expectations from a Rajkumar Hirani. A movie that hits you hard, delivers a strong message and makes the public question some age old conventions and beliefs, that's what his past movies had (some of them in bits and pieces, others in spades). PK though, is the strongest of his efforts on that front.\n\nPK is about Aamir's character (named PK by the public) arriving from a distant planet on earth on a research mission only to have his \"remote control\" stolen. This remote, is the sole means by which he can summon the spaceship that brought him here to get him back. Without the remote, he is essentially stuck on earth. He slowly starts learning the nuances of earthly culture and language and gradually moves closer towards finding the remote. He also realizes from the public that it is God alone who can help him find it. In the process, he ends up questioning and challenging the religious belief system that India has built involving multiple religions, each with their own set of traditions.\n\nThat last part is what hits you hard about PK. The fact that there is only one God, the true God, the one who created us all unlike the many Gods that exist and are worshiped on a daily basis is something worth taking home. Also, by this time, I wouldn't call PK being an alien a spoiler since this is very much clear from the start of the film itself (and in fact, is something that the screenwriter Abhijat Joshi has heavily hinted at in a Plot Summary written by him on IMDb).\n\nAamir is spot on with his portrayal of PK and one almost feels that he's back in form after the disastrous (but still financially successful) Dhoom: 3. His performance is again going to be a talking point for months to come and perhaps, may even land him the Filmfare yet again. The others complement Aamir well enough especially Anushka, who, despite having considerably fewer films under her belt almost feels like a seasoned performer by now.\n\nBut the laurels all go to Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi for the wonderful script and direction; the script has so much material it moves at a break necking speed, never quite running out of events or situations. The crisp editing allows them to pack in a lot of stuff without it taking way too much time. The romance could have been toned down a bit as it was the only part that felt a bit unnecessary but in the end, that is a minor quirk in an otherwise outstanding effort. Shooting in real locations in Delhi such as the Red Fort and even a metro station lends an authenticity to the film that sets can simply not achieve. The music is strictly functional though and unlike the \"Give Me Some Sunshine\" song in Hirani's 3 Idiots, such a hard hitting number is missing.\n\nFor a country like India with an over-surge of religions, languages and traditions that sometimes border on meaninglessness, PK as a movie is an eye-opener. Sure it has its cheesy moments and it may not exactly be a \"complex\" piece of art in the league of Terrence Mallick or Christopher Nolan movies. But in an industry like Bollywood which is plagued with commercial no-brainers from one Khan after another, PK is not only a strong film, it is a laudable effort. I'd recommend every Indian to watch this film at least once and wake up from the nonsense that is being served in the name of religion to truly realizing what God is all about.\n\nOverall Score: 8.0 / 10"

Although the promotions never confirmed the role of Aamir in the movie, I was somewhat convinced by the trailer and the actions that he would most probably portray the character of an alien. Being a loyal Aamir Khan fan I cannot ditch his movie no matter how poor or great the trailer or the actions seem. But after the movie I felt like it's just another mind-blowing Aamir Khan magic that you would never forget for the rest of your life.\n\nThe movie has an amazing storyline, well-developed script and screenplay, outstanding performance by both Aamir and Anushka and also some fun catchy songs that match well to the various stages in the movie. I would say its not only a must watch for true Aamir fans, I would rather say its a must watch for all movie lovers of any country or industry. Once again, Raju Hirani incorporated his magic and made this movie very special."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked this movie as long as it wanted me to like it. In the beginning we are introduced to an unnamed alien who has come to earth to see what life on the planet is like. But then his remote gets stolen and he has to learnt to adapt to the lifestyle of humans.\n\nHe is very confused about the way humans live. He can't understand the purpose behind clothes, money, language, gestures and finally, religion. And that's where I have a problem with this movie. Don't get me wrong. I'm not gonna talk those \"why is only one religion being talked about\" arguments. Rather my problem is why is religion being given so much emphasis? If I were to make this movie, I'd focus more on the people's lifestyle, which is exactly what the movie was going with and occasionally tries coming back to (like the condom scene).\n\nThe songs, the acting, the colour palette, everything about the visual and audio was fantastic. The scene in which Jaggu wants to come out of jail made me pause the video so that I could laugh properly. The problems come up in the second half, where the sense of humour suddenly finishes and it starts turning more dramatic. The serious scenes don't hit the same way as the comedy scenes do. After all, we are watching a movie about an alien adjusting to earth's lifestyle. It should have a lot more humour than a grim, gritty feeling.\n\nIt was fun to watch, but I don't see myself watching this ever again. I know it won't be as funny on seeing the second time. And that's why I'd only recommend it to you if you aren't the \"religion good\" type and can actually see a movie with an open mind, because nowadays a lot of negativity is being spread about this movie."

An absolute masterpiece made to perfection - an edge of your seat thrill ride which doesn't rely on over the top silly action but manages to play with emotions. In every scene almost the entire cast makes you forget that it is a film - Aamir Khan steals the show Anushka Sharma steals the show Sanjay Dutt Steals the show Boman Irani....... all gave ocsar worthy performances in their roles.\n\nIt would be brutally unfair if PK doesn't land at least 8 Oscar & golden globe nominations! I went to the cinema with a blank canvas & didn't know a thing about it I am glad I went to theatre with an open mind & took it in as it came. Let me put it this way the trailers, posters & all the publicity don't do it any justice & its best enjoyed without any prior knowledge. Believe me it will take you by surprise.\n\nI am a really hard to please breed when it comes to movies & there are not many movies that have made me break sweat. Scorcese, Fincher, Nolan, Kubrick, Tarantino to name a few are some of my favourite film-makers, you get the idea of breaking sweat whilst watching some of their incredible productions. To mention PK even in the same paragraph with some of those names may make some people disagree. However, I believe it only does justice to this masterpiece to put it up there with some of those filmmaker's past achievements.\n\nBetter than a solid 10/10 - do yourselves a favour watch it asap. Ignore those silly comments about PK having offended religious freaks who don't have a clue what was the true essence of the film. Enjoy!"

I recommend it to viewers who would like a light funny stories with serious message within. Some may not see the deepness of the story but others will.

It carries a good social message and I too don't support blind belief on Godman. Only one theme I didn't like in this film which is the melodramatic portrayal of love story between a Pakistani and an Indian.\n\nWatch this film for Amir khan, Anushka Sharma and the underlying theme that this film carries which is superstitions in Hinduism and also in every major religion."

        "review_title": "An entertaining but flawed film carried superbly by Aamir Khan",
        "review_detailed_main": "Although the film has few flaws in its story-telling, PK is more than watchable because of its great comic moments and for taking up a subject, Religion, which for a long time in its history, bollywood had decided to steer clear of. And there are good reasons for it. Movies which have religion as its subject matter always tend to be controversial. We are seeing the same thing with PK with many suits being filed which thankfully the courts have dismissed quickly.\n\nIn a year where we have had a very short supply of quality movies, PK will come as a breath of fresh air. Just like his first three films, Rajkumar Hirani again takes up a socially relevant subject and laces it with humor and idiosyncratic situations. We would find many of Hirani's trademarks in this movie. The central character who is a misfit who gets mocked at the beginning before winning everyone's hearts one by one and ends up being the agent of change. The main antagonist is not an evil person but one who has misguided beliefs. The film is a combination of laughing-out loud moments and some tear-jerking moments.\n\nWhereas the comic moments are as laughable as was the case with Munnabhai and 3 Idiots, it is the emotional moments where it comes up short. And the major reason is that the movie doesn't devote enough time in fleshing out the relationships between the characters. Case in point, Anushka and Sushant's romance and break- up and also Anushka's relationship with his father. Also, except for Aamir and Anushka's characters, most of the supporting characters don't have much to do which is highly unfortunate for a cast with talents like Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla and Sanjay Dutt. Another flaw is that the first half involves too many songs which breaks the flow of the story and the second half tends to get preachy at times and the ending seemed to be a bit melodramatic just like 3 Idiots.\n\nAamir Khan's PK is the heart and soul of this movie and he comes up with arguably one of his best performance of his career alongside his performances in Lagaan, Rang De Basanti, 3 Idiots etc. Expect him to win many best actor awards in this award season although he wouldn't be attending those award functions. Anushka Sharma plays a bubbly character and she is more than efficient in this role. Sanjay Dutt is wonderful in his brief screen role. Saurabh Shukla is watchable. Boman Irani is wasted in a role who has very little to do. The writing team of 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi, comes up with another socially relevant script and their work is top-notch although it isn't as water-tight as their previous work. The music by Shantanu Moitra is pretty good although the songs aren't as memorable as 3 Idiots. My picks are Bhagwan Kaha Hai Tu, Chaar Kadam and the PK theme.\n\nPK is not a movie which will please everyone. In fact, many will get offended due to its anti-religious views (A good example are the protests ranging in Gujarat accusing the movie of hurting Hindu sentiments). My advice to these people is not to misinterpret the message in the film. Just like the similar themed Paresh Rawal- starrer Oh My God, this movie is not telling us to stop having faith in God but it is questioning whether the medium by which we try to communicate with God is right or not. I recommend all of you to watch this movie at-least once. Whether you like it or not, you will not be able to erase this movie from your memory for a good time. And how many recent bollywood films linger in your memory even for a moment after you have finished watching it?"

        "review_detailed_main": "We keep seeing this man's brilliant movies,PK is the another one and arguably PK is the best film of Aamir's career.\n\nA third person view is often far more objective than what you and I may have. Which is why there are bodies that can provide judgments, objectively, on matters we could end up complicating otherwise. Somewhat like a viewer, who can be brutally honest about the drawbacks in a film. Objectivity is probably what Hirani and his co-writer Abhijat Joshi sought to explore when they started developing the concept of this film. Hence the character of PK, one with an 'out of the world' viewpoint, literally.\n\nPK, the film is not quite unique in its inception, sharing space with a very compelling Oh My God (2012),directed by Umesh Shukla. PK, the characters, lands on earth with an intention to understand it. God turns into his subject. And in process of him understanding the power that made us all, he pokes at faulty notions that are developed and protected by us.\n\nLike his first two films, Hirani's PK is driven by a character and the way he functions. The most delightful part of the film hence is easily the protagonist. The story is about PK's pursuit of God to hear his request. Much like Kanji Lalji Mehta of OMG, who is told that it is only God who could answer his plea.\n\nThe screenplay is woven to provide PK and his actions credibility. The first half is dedicated to establish his plight while the second half moves towards a resolution. Clearly the resolution proved tougher. PK has a brilliantly written first half, making it an absolutely delightful ride till the intermission. It makes you laugh and at some point it could even make the tender hearts cry! It entertains certainly. The second half is when things get loose, and you start drawing comparisons with OMG, which easily had a stronger second half. PK slacks as it moves towards the end, in contrast with Hirani's last three films. Nonetheless it ends on a perfect note; one which should leave smile on the viewer.\n\nProviding PK the biggest boost is lead actor Aamir Khan, in probably one of his finest efforts. With wide open eyes that never blink, Aamir is at his best. Anushka Sharma is perfectly cast. Sanjay Dutt, Sushant Singh Rajput add their bits. There is also Parikshit Sahni playing the disapproving father reminds of his 3 Idiots acts, and Saurabh Shukla playing the fraud God-man takes us back to his Batuk Maharaj act in Lage Raho Munnabhai. Not to forget the usual suspect Boman Irani, this time in a perfectly positive role!\n\nThe deficit in the screenplay aside, the director in Hirani shines again. Every other department of filmmaking is top notch. Even the songs, which did not quite impress as an independent album, blends perfectly well into the film. It is a film that has the Hirani stamp all over it - an entertainer with a message. And of course it too has tremendous repeat value.\n\nplease don't miss this one!"

Crisp storyline, flawless direction and amazing performances make PK one-of-its kind, not unlike Hera-Pheri. Truly, Aamir is a perfectionist and Anuskha has loads of talent.\n\nThe movie has a simple story line about humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. It shows the world from the eyes of a stranger, an Alien \"Aamir Khan\" this time, who asks questions that no one has asked before. Who seeks reasons for the way society has set its ways over thousand of years. The childlike curiosity of PK, supported by beautiful and smart Anushka Sharma transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others alike.\n\nGo and do watch PK! Laugh out loud and take away some simple truths of life, we often overlook in our daily lives."

Music blends well with the themes. Performances are brilliant.\n\nAamir, in one of his toughest roles so far, manages to carry the film on his shoulders. Anushka lends able support to the proceedings. Sushant impresses in a cameo. Sanjay, Boman and Saurabh are equally good in their respective roles.\n\nQueen, Haider and now, PK - all three very important movies this year and arguably among the best of 2014."

Then after 2 weeks, I got a chance to watch this movie by myself and right to decide what IMDb rating it deserves from me. It didn't disappoint me despite of the fact that I'd bulk of expectations from this movie. It made me laugh in the first half. It made me think in the second half. In the collection of last few minutes, there was just usual bollywood drama that was little disappointment. But the acting Amair Khan, somebody give him Oscar. It was amazing, fabulous and overall awesome. Direction of Rajkumar Hirani was properly executed. Anushka Sharma's new look was not really good but that didn't interfere with her acting. And Saurav Shukla (Tapsvi) looked totally hilarious in the movie. Overall a good experience."

The film has been kept tightly under wraps in India, with viewers wondering if the titular character \u2014 bug-eyed and goofy, with prosthetic-ally enhanced ears \u2014 was autistic, otherworldly or even God himself.\n\nThat mystery is dispelled in the first scene, when a glowing spaceship deposits him in the middle of the Rajasthani desert as part of his alien race's research project.\n\nEarthlings, of course, have no idea what to make of him, and quickly dub him PK (\"pee Kay\" means \"after drinking,\" or \"tipsy\").\n\nWhen PK's one chance to return home is sabotaged, he is forced to undertake an odyssey that will direct him through the minefield of human relationships \u2014 and especially through the inexplicable rituals of religion. In one moving montage, PK joins crowds of nearly every major faith in India, from Jainism to Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism and Islam (only Buddhists get a pass, it seems).\n\nI thought it was well filmed, very intense, and was a great film for character study. You love both characters and sympathize for PK. The acting was great as usual for Amir Khan Films.What can i say? History will judge us all..."

The film makes you laugh a lot especially in the first half, which is its main strength. There is never a dull moment in the film as it is thoroughly entertaining. Aamir Khan made a pretty believable Alien.\n\nThe social commentary the film offers is both insightful and something to ponder upon. Although the questions asked in the film aren't unique but been has been asked many times before. You are required to suspend disbelief that Aamir is the first guy living in India to ask these questions which were asked before by Paresh Rawal in the film Oh My God.\n\nThe execution is well done which makes this not so original film(its a mix of K-Pax and OMG) quite entertaining. Although I do think it could have had a better written climax.\n\nA solid 7/10"

It is actually good to have faith in GOD but doing business in the name of God is ridiculous.\n\nThe fact is this business is increasing in India. People are donating more to temples rather than using that money on a better cause to improve our country.\n\nDon't get me wrong but there are many pandits and babas who are actually teaching us good lessons on God but the corrupt majority are making them look bad too.\n\nAlso, people who are calling Aamir this and that should actually call the whole cast racist(if it is your opinion) including writer, director, producer... not alone aamir.\n\nI have a question in my mind that temples like Shirdi's Sai, Tirupati temple, Siddhivinayak, Golden temple etc get's a lot of chadhava from shardhaalu/donors. Where is that money going? Where is it spend? Definitely there should be accountability. Why don't they come forward when there is a natural disaster like it happened in Gujrat, Uttaranchal, J&K. Why don't they use that money for the welfare of the same society who raised that money in the name of God.\n\nWake up people! Use your head when you're donating. Do it for a good cause and check it's authenticity.\n\nThere is only a single positive energy, GOD! Why are we giving different names to a god who doesn't need it. And the funny thing is, people in our country are actually getting fooled by Human Being who call themselves God. Come on! Even the educated people! For instance, Sachin - God of Cricket. Seriously? Lord is acceptable but GOD? Why are you calling a human being god and insulting the almighty?\n\nWhen we try to raise our voice against such people, you are tortured mentally/physically till you stop. Democracy is suddenly vanished then.\n\nI could write on and on as the issues are endless in the name of religion and God.\n\nI loved the movie and the concerns it raised of the India as a whole.\n\nThere were a bit flaws in the direction of the movie. So, its 9 out of 10 from my side."

Khan acts the perfect picture of a goofy alien, and PK's questions and thought process were genuinely funny. The movie concept of someone placed in a new culture they don't understand isn't a new one, but PK certainly adds its own unique spin.\n\nHowever, the second half changes tune and becomes part drama and part philosophical think piece. In both of those genres it does its job well enough, but the emotion and philosophy aren't nearly as memorable as the movie's first half."

Also a very demanding role, but he rises to the occasion, no one else could have done it better. The movie takes a good jab at religious hypocrisy (In the lines of OMG) in a manner that would appeal to (and hopefully change) the perspective of quite a few people. The Plot is involving and development is good. A little twist thrown in as we approach the end. Certainly very thought provoking and makes you laugh and cry in parts. However, it could have done better, probably been perfect, with a little more focus. The love story to begin with, then the shift to the Amirs struggle to return and then the take religion. Kind of made it a mash of different plots. Hes done his best to interweave them together, but it doesn't work for all.

Aamir's introduction scene is sure to get loads of applause. The Foundation of the story is quite strong. There is bit of everything be it romance, comedy, emotion and yes magic in the first half. Anushka and Aamir both complement each other. There is Typical Raju Hirani trademark stamp during this period.\n\nIts the second half where movie loses it sheen. The whole logical quotient seems to take a backseat, and is overriden by emotions. Its the time when you start comparing this movie with very well scripted OMG. That Midas Touch of raju hirani does not come out in its full fervor. The whole climax scene does not do justice to the film. The film does not have the wittyness of Munnabhai MBBS, no emotional gandhigiri, no quirkiness and attitude of 3 idiots. This is hirani's weakest film to date.\n\nOverall its just a one time watch.

The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie.

PK's utter curiosity, his innocent nature and bizarre personality adds humor to the movie, that will make you laugh till it hurts.\n\nLike in most of Hirani's movies, PK gives a wonderful message which will serve as an eye-opener for us INDIANS.\n\nAamir did a stupendous job, simply Amazing. Anushka's supporting act was praiseworthy.\n\nMovie's casting, costumes and effects were good.

        "review_detailed_main": "PK was my 35th movie in theatre this year I am happy I watched this movie as a closing credit to my \"movies watched in theatre list of 2014\". So here's my take on the movie.PK comes out with a bold and controversial plot on Religious beliefs or to say belief in Religion itself. India being a religiously sensitive place I should say hats off for Rajkumar Hirani for his brave attempt. Questioning the Education system of India in \"3 Idiots\" Hirani takes Religious followings and God men in his hands this time. Like the story is pretty simple what will be the answer to the question of a naive child born in a versatile religious environment about religion and God. The child who is going to ask all the questions on religion will be the Alien from a different galaxy played Amir Khan. I could easily say this was AK's one of the best performances till date. With his outlook as an alien with popping out eyes which hardly blinks, elongated ears and arched eyebrows he looks really a weird human being who arrives to world without clothes. AK has emoted well as an alien. His journey in finding his lost remote to get back to his world becomes the story and whom he met how the world treats him becomes the screen play. In this journey he learns and questions human beliefs in religion. He is been named PK by the people.On his way to help him we have been introduced to Jaggu the journalist with a broken heart played by Anushka Sharma. Her acting potential showed up towards the end of the movie particularly during the interview confront with her lost love Sarfaraz played by Sushant Singh Rajput. Sanjay Dutt plays as a band master and a friend to PK is an extended cameo and his character stays in our hearts. In between could not avoid thinking about the clich\u00e9s of the movie Oh My God !! BGM was OK. Movie had no great songs at all. Over the entire movie gave a hard message \"Believe in God who created us and not in the God created by us (ie religion!!)\" Watch it in theatre for fun filled jolly ride without becoming oversensitive to the criticism on rituals shown in the movie. I would rate 8 on 10. -Reviewed by Balachandran Sivakumar"

The only thing that sounded phony in the movie was how they made a certain Sarfraz from Pakistan look super\n\nMoreover, due to Some Adult Scenes, it can't be possible to watch it with family...

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe my wife and I are the only ones who felt disappointed with P.K. When she watches the film she's looking purely at its \"entertainment\" value. I'll admit, for me a film should make sense also. P.K. didn't work at either level. Both of us absolutely loved all Raju Hirani films in the past. We expected this film to be good too but didn't go with very high expectations and had not read up much. After watching the film her rating is 3 and mine is 5 so I settled for 4.\n\nThe first half was barely tolerable for her but I was not to lose hope easily, I thought the second half will probably carry the film through. The second half did arrest our attention more, yet it let us down on the whole. It was definitely not \"experience of a lifetime\", as one reviewer commented.\n\nThe number of small gripes is too many to mention here. Here's a sample - repetitive jokes on lead character's name; way too much Bhojpuri; a person of Parsi accent is shown as a fanatic Church going Christian who throws Aamir out of the Church (how could this have slipped through, I have no clue. Parsis are Zoroastrians. BTW, we are neither Parsi nor overly religious). We found the religion ass-whacking being stretched too far and too long in the film. The whole alien thing was tiring too - a sculpted body for an alien didn't make sense; an evolved alien specie that communicates telepathically is shown to have the same range of emotions as humans, that didn't make sense either.\n\nBut those are all small gripes. What I found most significant though is that the film fails on a more fundamental level on its core theme. Hirani picks easy targets with religious heads and fundamentalists like the earlier film (OMG). Also like that film he successfully points out the apparent meaninglessness of religious rituals but does not force people to look inwards to self-reflect. Nor does he address the more difficult question of a substitute to religion. (More serious seekers may find the answer elsewhere, for example, in the amazing Anastasia book-series by Russian author Vladimir Megre)\n\nIn final analysis P.K. is a lame attempt at mass appeal. It fails at both entertainment and providing meaning. A big departure from Munna Bhai films and 3 idiots.\n\nLet me predict that the film will also see a sharp decline in box office collections after the initial hype is over."

        "review_detailed_main": "The management of AMC Rio in Gaithursburg, MD made all the desis stand in a queue, which was marked as \"for PK audience\". Our desperation for getting into the auditorium to occupy the most prime seat and reserve 10 more of those for our friends probably was their reason for such improvisation to let us behave and not do a black Friday door-busters during Christmas. While a couple of hundreds of us were waiting in the line checking out respective facebook or whatsapp accounts the previous show finished and another few hundreds of our clan started coming out of the multiplex. I was looking at them as if they were the winners of some sort of award, and me being a latecomer to the show whose turn didn't come yet.\n\nAfter about three hours when I came out of the multiplex I saw the same line of the fellow desis waiting for the next show. And now again I looked at them as bunch of lucky folks who are on their way to have a joyride full of fun, laughter, emotion, drama and many other feel- good emotions. And to top it all they are going to have this joyride named PK for the first time in their life. I, on the other had, can and will take this ride again but that won't bring me the thrill of the \"first time\", just like the thrills of so many intimate and personal first times of one's life.\n\nSo here you go, I recommend you one of the most enjoyable movies that I have seen in my life, PK, a movie that exceeded my expectation in all aspects. By now it is probably needless to say that a movie studded with Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, Bidhu Vinod Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurav Shukla, Anuska Sharma and Sushant Singh Rajput is supposed to be a good one anyway, but what I (and my family and friends) got in return was a 24-carat jewel that any actor/director/producer dreams to make at least once in their lifetime.\n\nFor sure I am not going to tell you the story. You know I am kind of conservative, but please be alert as every single friend of yours or the websites you visit or the blogs you read may not be so orthodox in keeping the story to themselves. So if any of those liberals will tell you the summary of PK in three lines (it is absolutely possible to do a three line summary) then half of the fun will be gone anyway. But even if you are left with the other half only, that should be more than the fun you got from all the Bollywood movies released in 2014 put together.\n\nHowever let me also tell you there is a chance that you might not actually find PK as enjoyable as I found it, as you might be the one who found cotton candy boring in your childhood or preferred to sit in the hotel the entire time while holidaying in a sea-resort. I am trying not to be judgmental, but surely there are some folks out there who might actually hate PK. There is already a couple of hash-tags to boycott PK circulating in the virtual world. So in case you love to experience something different, welcoming to new concepts, ideas and questions and love to laugh your heart-out PK is your movie. And in case you are a staunch believer of the concept that AIDS can be cured by doing kapalbhati five-times-a-day there is another movie coming soon for you, which you might like and you can watch the trailer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4OTT9T1Px4.\n\nFolks go to your nearest movie theater at the first opportunity you get, watch PK and have fun !"

        "review_detailed_main": "No religions were harmed in the making of this film. That's the gist of a title card that runs before the credits in the Hindi movie \"PK,\" directed by Rajkumar Hirani, which states that the film doesn't intend to hurt the feelings of any community, sect or religion.\n\nAnd this sweet, ambling comedy about an innocent abroad - an alien who touches down in the Rajasthan desert - doesn't offend, even as it pokes gentle fun at religious differences and hypocrisy.\n\nWhen PK (Aamir Khan) lands in Rajasthan, naked and gym-buff, his first encounter with an earthling is a rude one. A man steals his flashing green pendant (it matches his flashing green eyes), a remote control that allows him to call his ship for pickup.\n\nAfter some twists and turns - including a quick, PK-less detour to Belgium for a Pakistani Romeo and Indian Juliet love story - our hero acquires language (Hindi) and finds himself in Delhi in search of his pendant. God alone, he's told, can help him.\n\nGuileless, he appeals to God in all his houses: temples, mosques, churches. Sneaking into a maternity ward, he examines an infant from top to bare bottom, looking for a label: is he Christian, Muslim, Hindu?\n\nMr. Hirani's other films include \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" (2006), a comedy about a gangster who becomes a Gandhi-inspired good guy. That movie and its slogan, \"Gandhigiri,\" were so successful that they ushered in a small real-life wave of Gandhian protests.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that \"PK,\" with its slogan \"wrong number\" (when God's interlocutors get their wires crossed), will have a similar impact. Mr. Hirani remains an excellent storyteller, weaving his disparate story strands into a convincing, satisfying whole - a rare Bollywood feat.\n\nBut \"PK\" lacks the redemptive arc of \"Lage Raho\" - at least its hero does. PK, played with earnest sexlessness by Mr. Khan, who possesses one of Hindi cinema's most ogled bodies, is another man-boy innocent meant to remind us of our own corruption. He does, but so benignly, that it's hard to feel the sting."

However, if religious teachings are in service of the truth, they act as signposts along the way, or maps left by awakened individuals to assist you in your own spiritual awakening, freeing you from identification with form.\"\n\nA quote for Eckhart Tolle from \u00abNew Earth\u00bb... It's brilliantly and boldly portrayed in this exceptional movie. PK dares to question what humanity often avoids.

It gives strong message and full of entertainment.Every age group can watch this movie. Aamir was best in his performance and so was Anushka.\n\nA must watch for all Aamir khan fans.

Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the other main characters."

I must say when I watched the movie for the first time, I was so much disappointed with the movie overall, almost to the degree of hate and disgust primarily because of the critical subject matter that the makers touched on. I was displeased because I thought the maker Rajkumar Hirani is taking a propaganda of religion for his movie which should not have been made in the first place. It's only after the multiple viewing that I realized that the movie was not targeting the god and religion but the malpractice related with them. Overall, it's a glamorous, funny, moving and glorified Hirani movie with his humor and entertainment package.\nWhat did not work:\nFinal verdict: only watch if you can take religious standup comedies, and of course if you can take the movie topic lightly. The overall message of the movie is rational but the narrative is not always pleasant."

There were time when I could not take my dinner without watching the 'balatkar' scene! It was like a part of my dinner and it lasted quite a long time. 3 Idiots entertained us more than PK is doing. I am sure, If 3 Idiots released this December, it would have reached 400 CR in domestic Box office."

Director Rajkumar Hirani crafts a well-paced narrative that seamlessly blends comedy and emotion.\n\nWhat sets PK apart is its perfect storyline. It ingeniously explores the naivety of an alien stranded on Earth, who, in his quest for a way home, stumbles upon the quirks and follies of blind faith in organized religion. The film raises important questions about belief systems and societal norms while keeping you entertained.\n\nPK is a must-watch for its comedy, emotion, and its ability to make you reflect on the world's idiosyncrasies.

Amir again do a great acting and Anushka discovers a unique forms of expression which makes comedy scenes at outstanding level, in whole movie she also use variation of expressions to make scene more enjoyable Pk really teaches a lot of lesson for actors as well as for audience. Another best thing is that its song planning is amazing at first in starting when jaggu is at bicycle the background song describes about sharfaraj and in ending orders about Pk when she miss him that's really amazing and also movie starts by story which is about Pk, narrates by jaggu which also a sign of good film One of the best thing is that the look of Amir in movie is pure a comedian which makes movie more enjoyable and even Anushka she looks so cute before when she comes New Delhi at that time of first meeting with Pk after she uses her amazing expressions to give interest in scenes I really enjoyed this movie and I bet this is the best love story movie after titanic , Titanic lacks fun it's love story is amazing and hurting , But in Pk the whole picture is perfect , the love story of Pk is better than titanic and I want it's sequel to complete it's hurting love story both characters in ending has feeling related to each other jaggu understands Pk feelings while Pk not understands that jaggu had now know his feelings about her as well as she wants Pk to stop but Pk does not wants to break her loved life with sharfaraj\n\n\"He loved too much to let him go\" and that's story is ,its creates another sweet form of love \u2764. If jaggu really wants Pk back then its time for the sequel as she long loves him it makes sequel to bring him back in the story and in last scene when Pk comes to earth I think he must wants jaggu because he maintain its form which is loved by jaggu and that's it. I really want this movie to be nominated to Oscar. i'll give 9/10 as it is the best love story movie of Bollywood and even in the world"

A bit of a blockbuster there. But I hadn't heard about it here in the US, and even though there is a pretty big spoiler in Cousin's documentary/visual essay - somehow that scene slipped my mind while watching PK until boom, there it was. Definitely a credit to the filmmaker.\n\nThat scene aside, this film walks a lot of lines with delicate precision. It blends \"Brother From Another Planet\" with \"Believer from Another Denomination.\" Where a more aggressive search for humor could have detonated \"Je Suis Charlie\" vibes, this film is careful to honor the spirit of faith, while poking light fun at some traditions.\n\nWell light fun for me as a charismatic agnostic, your mileage may vary depending upon your deity?\n\nTo be clear, PK saves its scathing powers for holy rollers, and cleverly backs a fat cat guru into a televised corner, while tying it together with a star-crossed lovers backstory.\n\nAamir Khan's oddball ogling reminded me of Marty Feldman, and his physical nature is almost a throwback to Chaplin/silent film comedy. That said, I think it's Anushka Sharma who provides the audience a warm, charming vantage to play along with a wholesome halfwit. Somehow she keeps the film from just being dumb fun, to being sort of the village idiot who notices the emperor (or reverend/imam/rabbi/etc) has no clothes.\n\nIn a way it took an old religious phrase my Mom favored to another level - \"be in this world, but no of it.\"\n\nEnjoyable, well-paced spirited slapstick. Bright in color and in content."

I tried to like the movie, but I couldn't. It is supposed to be funny, but every joke falls flat on the ground, they are for 8 years old kids.\n\nOverall: There were a few good ideas in this movie, like communicating without words, just holding hands, and criticizing the religion nonsense; but the movie direction looks like a joke, and not a funny one."

And then Aamir tells the different ways of saying Accha(Oh really) depending on the situation and moods, was hilarious :).

It provides you an entertainer that most audiences will like(after 5 years)\n\nLogic 10/10: this movie is totally logical although this logic has already been brought to us by Paresh Rawal in OMG. Not complaining about the similarity between both movies I'm giving this department a 10\n\nHumour 10/10: again, Rajkumar Hirani flicks are always funny and the main part is that the jokes are new not recycled. The humour is just amazing and to give the jokes more power was Aamir Khan's innocence in the movie.\n\nActing 8/10: I'm very impressed with everyone's acting especially Aamir khan. He needs to take one award please. Everyone else does a great job. Boman Irani, Sushant Rajput and Sanjay Dutt come in very short roles but impress in that short period. This although was very disappointing as I was expecting to see more of Boman and Sanjay.\n\nLast Word: amazing movie with everything that we need to be entertained. Although the movie has similarities with OMG but I feel it can be ignored. Also I would like to say that it surely entertained but i don't think it should have taken 5 years to make this movie. Rajkumar Hirani sir don't make us wait so much next time and if you do then please make the movie as good as 3 idiots."

And, this movie doesn't insult the religions really while pointing these things out, which was also really cool. Aamir Khan did amazing as PK, and he was hilarious. He really is the best actor today, because he does the best roles and his perfectionism helps him to do great movies. Everyone else also did good, from Anushka Sharma to Saurabh Shukla. Even though the movie has some clich\u00e9s, like the Pakistani Indian romance, you really forget about that because the film keeps you focused on the message it is trying to say. And they did get their message across, all right. If this is the most successful Bollywood film of all time thats saying something.

Aamir attempted a unique character again and as usual he was done it in his way...... It was interesting to know that how he learned bhojpuri & yes, how can i forget the scene when he adjust the payjama of rajasthani , that was the funniest moment ......In one word, Aamir was seriously \"hyper-physical\" in his role!!! No doubt on his mastery of unique role. Anushka, in character of journalist was good & Saurabh was looking perfect in the role of manager of God although there were nothing big for Boman, Sanju baba &Sushant but they also did well in their cameo role . This movie can bebetter than 3 idiots but first you must have to remove \"OMG\"(Oh My God)from your memory, because concept was exactly same but i can easily say that this is the best cinema of Bollywood after 3 idiots. #PK\u202c"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is an essential viewing experience for anyone seeking to understand the complex interplay between religion and society. It vividly illustrates how religious differences have created deep divides among people, leading to a fractured and polarized community. The film does an excellent job of portraying the various ways in which these divisions manifest in everyday life, showing the pain and suffering they cause to individuals and families. Moreover, it sheds light on the darker side of this issue by highlighting how certain unscrupulous criminals and opportunists are exploiting these religious rifts for their own profit and gain. By manipulating people's beliefs and fears, these individuals manage to create chaos and discord, further deepening the divisions within society. The movie also explores the broader implications of this exploitation, suggesting that it not only benefits a few corrupt individuals but also perpetuates a cycle of violence and mistrust that affects everyone. Through powerful storytelling and compelling characters, the film makes a poignant statement about the need for unity and understanding in the face of these divisive forces. In conclusion, this movie is a must-watch for its insightful commentary on the role of religion in society and its impact on human relationships, as well as its unflinching examination of those who seek to profit from division and discord."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched PK.\n\nMesmerized!!!!!\n\nThere are many kinds of hypocrisy within the human civilization on earth...PK is a small but an awesome attempt to hit our minds against many of them.\n\nI had an idea from my different friends and acquaintances who watched PK is that it's against the religious hypocrisy and religion-based politics/business only that was already shown beautifully in the film OMG.. But NO; that's just a part of it. It has such a wide spectrum and the most intriguing among all the hypocrisies is what has been shown at the very last part.\n\nEven if you free yourself from religious superstitions, it's too hard to get rid of the 'hypocrisy of love'. The hypocrisy of love is seated in the fact that the very concept has become interchangeable with that of lust. While Love Expands mind; Lust Contracts.For young people, mostly lust is indistinguishable from love. The real Love never captivates, but frees and in a real love-relation, both are free, both are attached only through the bond of love;nothing else.\n\nHere we 'love' to have chicken means we love to eat the flesh of chicken. And perhaps the same concept of love is in the sub-conscious of many people when it comes to human also. This is the Hypocrisy of Love in this world.\n\nTrue religion teaches to take care of others around, True civilization strives for betterment of people's life as a whole, True sages tell people to find God within oneself and in all beings, True Love makes people want their love to Be with their love, whatever and whoever that Love is.\n\nKudos to the director Rajkumar Hirani, and of course Amir Khan(PK) and Anushka Sharma(Jaggu) for their fabulous acting! In a very small span, Sanjay Dutt (Bhairon Singh) also caught our mind. Kudos also to Shantanu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire for those awesome songs that along with the situation in the film can make anybody dance in the same way as PK did ;) :D"

        "review_detailed_main": "After the stupendous success of 3 Idiots which highlighted the maladies of an education system built on rote en route to setting new benchmarks of box-office success, in PK, the team of Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan, put the multi-billion dollar industry called religion in their cross hairs.\n\nPK is an alien from a distant galaxy who lands in the middle of the desert in Rajasthan in a spaceship to study earth and its inhabitants. However, soon after landing on earth in the buff, he is divested of his remote - an exotic looking medallion - through which he can communicate to his spaceship to return to his planet. The stolen remote is purchased by Delhi based godman, Tapasvi Baba (Saurabh Shukla) who intends to use it to milk more money from his devotees for a grand temple project.\n\nPK follows the remote to Delhi and, on his way, is assisted by Bhairo Singh (Sanjay Dutt), a band leader in Rajasthan and Jaggu aka Jagatjanani (Anushka Sharma), a Delhi based TV journalist. There is a minor subplot involving a truncated romance between Jaggu and Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput), a Pakistani student, when they meet in Belgium.\n\nUsing the curious eyes of a being from another world, ignorant of the ways of our world, the director raises several valid questions on religions - man-made paths to God - as well as to godmen - those self anointed custodians of the faith who enrich themselves in the name of salvation and instant solutions by preying on the fears and weaknesses of their devotees. Though most of these questions are neither new nor, by any measure, daring and have already been part of the recent Paresh Rawal movie, Oh My God, Hirani and Aamir approach the subject with sincerity and Hirani's trademark zest which is appealing to the viewers and makes an instant connect.\n\nAamir, despite his continuing penchant to over-act, is excellent as the bumbling alien who tries to make sense of the multiple contradictions - hypocrisies which are accepted norms of our everyday life - that confound him. Anushka Sharma has an effervescent presence and lights up the screen in every scene she appears. Rajkumar Hirani regulars Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahani, Saurabh Shukla along with Sushant Singh Rajput are effective in their minor cameos.\n\nPK has its fair share of flaws in the form of a rushed up romance in the first act that is dovetailed into a contrived climax of the third act which stick out as out of place appendages. The length of the movie could also have been clipped by 20 minutes at least to make it more crisper. While Hirani might have wanted to depict PK as a commoner, he could have still avoided the thick Bhojpuri accent for PK which is tacky and hampers clear understanding of his lines. The movie is in its elements in the middle portion when PK is on his exploratory quest throwing up common sense questions on the absurdities that confront him. Yet, The songs, while not chart busters, gel well with the narrative. While there is no doubt that Hirani's movies deal with issues which are socially relevant and his tone of communication despite being evocative, remains benign, one gets the feeling that, in PK, Hirani seems satisfied having barely scratched the surface of an important issue and that, in a sense, could account for a less than fulfilled sense when you leave the movie.\n\nOverall, PK is a brave attempt (perhaps, not brave enough) - and a cinematic SUCCESS as it packages an important message by flagging several hypocrisies and inanities that baffle us in the garb of religion, rituals, accepted norms and conventions into an entertaining movie with a healthy dose of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the realm of Indian cinema, \"PK\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling, humor, and profound social commentary. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani and starring the versatile Aamir Khan, this 2014 film is not just a movie; it's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's mind and heart.\n\n\"PK\" follows the journey of an alien named PK (played brilliantly by Aamir Khan) who lands on Earth, losing his communication device in the process. The narrative unfolds with PK's innocent and childlike exploration of human customs, beliefs, and societal norms. This premise sets the stage for a thought-provoking and heartwarming tale that transcends genres.\n\nOne of the film's unique qualities is its ability to seamlessly blend satire, comedy, and drama. The humor is not only entertaining but also serves as a vehicle for insightful commentary on religion, superstitions, and blind faith. The screenplay, penned by Abhijat Joshi and Rajkumar Hirani, strikes a perfect balance between levity and depth, making \"PK\" accessible to a wide audience while delivering a powerful message.\n\nAamir Khan's performance as PK is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of an alien navigating the complexities of human society is both endearing and thought-provoking. The nuances in his expressions, coupled with impeccable comic timing, elevate the character to iconic status. The supporting cast, including Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput, and Sanjay Dutt, deliver commendable performances that enhance the overall cinematic experience.\n\nBeyond its entertainment value, \"PK\" stands out for its courage in addressing sensitive societal issues. The film fearlessly questions established norms and encourages viewers to introspect about their beliefs. It's a rare gem that manages to deliver a social message without being preachy, thanks to its engaging narrative and well-crafted characters.\n\nThe technical aspects of \"PK\" are equally commendable. Cinematographer C. K. Muraleedharan captures the vibrant landscapes with finesse, enhancing the visual appeal of the film. Shantanu Moitra's musical score complements the narrative beautifully, evoking a range of emotions that stay with the audience long after the credits roll.\n\nIn conclusion, \"PK\" is not just a film; it's a cinematic journey that challenges preconceived notions and leaves a lasting impact. It's a celebration of diversity, a critique of blind faith, and a testament to the power of storytelling. \"PK\" is a must-watch for those seeking a film that entertains, enlightens, and resonates on a profound level."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, it should be noted that the actors, pace, cinematography and music are all very good. If we have to criticize something about these, we can say that the main character's generic music is a bit too repetitive and ordinary. And since the lead character is asked to play a childish and naive character, his exaggerated facial expressions can sometimes be annoying.\n\nAs for the scenario, it is a children's movie about an alien who is stranded in this world and questions religion with his naive point of view. It is important to note that this satirical comedy is a children's movie, because it simplifies religion and people's devotion to religion and deals with them in their most basic terms. If you consider faith with its many complex aspects such as political, economic, social and terrorism, and if you approach it as an educated adult, the only reaction that can be given to the film is the title of this article. If Only It Was That Easy.\n\nStill, it's a very sweet children's movie about blind faith in religion and questioning clerics of all religions. It contains nice touches about how easily people can be separated from each other to the point of hostility, spontaneously or planned."

God bless the marketing team and Aamir khan(he definitely is a good actor who has matured with time) for their excellent job.\n\nThis movie is a pure satire on blind religious belief emerged as a result of fear. Innocence put forward by Aamir khan while questioning the religious guru's is childlike but still portrays the maturity and logical thinking which is very much needed today. The only thing which brought a change in the movie from Oh My God is the bomb blast in the name of religion and love angle between an Indian girl and Pakistani boy. This movie is not much of a refresher but do put forward some serious questions to ponder upon \"How much more stupidity in the name of religion?\"."

Might not be the most spontaneous and naturally gifted actors of Indian Cinema, but is definitely one of the finest actors Indian cinema has ever seen.Extremely hard working, passionate, has got a level head on his shoulders, a great risk taker and one of the best prodigies of Method acting. Has been daring to don different characters and tell us stories that are entertaining to say the least.\n\nLovely movie and is yet another feather in Hirani's cap, although might not be the best from the Hirani stable. Just goes to show that audiences still have the appetite to lap up good, simple and clean entertainers. There is still hope for Indian cinema with the likes of Hirani and Aamir in the Industry. Kudos to the team and a good watch with some really earnest and sincere performance from Aamir and Anushka and rest of the cast."

Emotion, Drama, Comedy, Message which literally means perfection. PK was the toughest character for not just Aamir Khan but, for anyone in the Bollywood industry. Not only Aamir, but Anushka Sharma and Sanjay Dutt did a very good job of their character which I think no one could have done. Sushant Rajput also did a fine job of his character.Like everything in this film is perfect. I insist you to go and enjoy the film because it's like a word of mouth movie,but 3 idiots is better then pk."

But PK, to me, doesn't fall in a good movie category. Its just an OK film, one time watch that too at home. 1st half was interesting and funny but later it was annoying and diverted towards total Hindi masala non sense...looked so stupid. The biggest negative thing is they failed to prove the points raised in the movie plot..religion or society..\n\nI liked OMG a million times more..it was a movie that was shot sensibly and made sense..And coming to Amir's movie, Talash was a better plot than this!"

The film look like comedy but in each and every frame it contains social responsibilities in it. Compared to \"Oh MY GOD\" that is single task, but \"PK\" is multitasking. Mr.Amir Khan - Hats Off, Ms.Anuskha Sharma - Different look with different expressions with full of confident ,Mr.Sanjay Dutt - Touching and Amazing.Mr.Saurabh Shukla - Spine of the Film. Brilliant movie with great messages for society. There are lot of powerful scenes, that will make LAUGH as well as CRY. The Screenplay is amazing and full/bunch of dialogue. It is a film that shouldn't miss and it is brave. Each and every body should love each other and don't want to fear of GOD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the years I have accumulated a lot of non-conformist ideas and I have been having a lot of difficulties explaining them to others. This movie portraits it in a fabulous way.\n\nThe way in which the movie shows our world from the eyes of an alien who comes from a world with a lot less socialization process is great.\n\nThe understanding of our world that we get from this movie is equivalent to having read and understood a lot of sociology and many inter related fields.\n\nIt's very rare to have such a great movie made in India.\n\nAmair Khan's 3 Idiots used to be my favorite movie before I saw this one.\n\nIt's a good starting point for someone who wants to see the world for what it truly is, i.e., without getting into philosophy books head first.\n\nPK's character would be the most similar to the INFJ personality type in MBTI's 16 personality types. The INFJ personality has the ability to see reality in layers which the other person can easily miss. Also as the character is portrayed to be of sensitive nature, he is also an HSP. INFJ-HSP really is a very rare and special combination to have, one that can easily make you feel different and sometimes to be from another planet (jokingly!)."

Its like grinding all the food and feeding it to a toddler. You may abhor it but the toddler needs it. As far as the bias is concerned, I actually take that as a complement to my religion that you can say such things without any ( potential) fear of dire consequences."
