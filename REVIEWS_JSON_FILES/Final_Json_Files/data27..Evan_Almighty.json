        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the characters from 'Bruce Almighty' return to the franchise. Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) is now the TV anchor from Buffalo who gets elected Congressman. He's living a nice life when God (Morgan Freeman) picks him to be the new Noah. Nobody believes him even his wife Joan (Lauren Graham).\n\nThe only salvation this movie has is the nice guy persona of Steve Carell. He has just enough charisma to keep this movie going. However it is impossible to see why nobody believes him. When his wife runs off, it signaled a very artificial bent to the story. Evan is followed by hundreds of animals and people are actually laughing. It makes no sense. I would figure he would have an army of religious people ready and willing to help. It's a manufactured reaction to make a fake hurdle for Evan to jump over. Only Steve Carell's likability kept the movie alive."

        "review_title": "Mighty Mediocre",
        "review_detailed_main": "Steve Carell reprises his role as Evan Baxter in this sequel to Bruce Almighty.\n\nEvan Almighty jumps right into the mix of things with little build up. Right off the bat we find out that news anchor Evan Baxter has segued his career into one of political aspirations. Soon after being elected to the United States Congress under a slogan painting him as a politician out to change the world, God (Morgan Freeman) commissions Baxter to build an ark in the midst of one of the worst droughts in the history of the area.\n\nIn a predictable move the area townspeople antagonize Baxter as he begins the construction of the ark. Baxter's reputation is further soiled by the fact that his political career is being looked as a joke when he starts wearing sack cloth on a regular basis, and animals of all kinds are following him around in pairs. Baxter's boss Congressman Long, who once supported him quickly, becomes the antagonist as the people begin to turn against Baxter.\n\nEvan Almighty is predictable on every turn, and has enough humor to satisfy. The animals do their part to provide a fair share of fecal humor. Morgan Freeman offers up plenty of wisdom in the role of God. Steve Carell does an exceptionally adequate job of delivering very humorous dialogue, which in his style is sure to be adlibbed in great part. The sheer amounts of animals in this film are overwhelming and a treat to behold. Overall the storyline and humor feel very clich\u00e9. Evan Almighty was a mild success, but just does not offer anything special apart from a few good laughs. Parents with children will get their money's worth out of this, but for everyone else it is a worthwhile rental."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly one of the two most disappointing movies I have ever seen (the other being Big Top Pee Wee). Let me first state that I was really looking forward to this movie. I really liked Bruce Almighty (part one). I also thought the idea of having the sequel being centered around the Noah story was a strong idea. I felt you bring back Steve Carrell and bring back Morgan Freeman. That is was an interesting way to get by without Jim Carrey. Afterall Steve Carrell is a rising Hollywood star\u0085the next Jim Carrey or Will Farrell. I saw the clips of Steve with his beard and Noah get up\u0085the visual looked funny to me. I thought there was room for some funny scenes with Animals.\n\nHonestly I was wrong dead wrong. The only animal getting really any valuable screen time were the Baboons\u0085the animals were hardy in it. I think most were just stage dressing done with CGI. Honestly the script for this movie needed a total overhaul. You will watch this movie and think you are being treated like you are some kind of moron. The worse thing about this movie though is it is not funny\u0085probably the directors fault because everything that should be funny just isn't.\n\nAgain as for the script, weird things start happening to Evan. And Evan rather than try to convince people that something strange is going on\u0085.just seems fine with everyone thinking he is crazy. A good example is one morning Evan wakes up with a beard. He tries to shave the beard. In second the beard grows right back. So rather than show his wife, family, and friends this\u0085.he simply lets them think he is crazy. I mean seriously, if some man you knew grew a full beard overnight (or really in one second) would you not think something strange is happening\u0085instead people think Evan is crazy. Then, animals following Evan around everywhere he goes\u0085in pairs. But rather than thinking something strange is going on\u0085everyone thinks Evan is crazy\u0085.look people you can see the animals follow Evan around\u0085he does not have a leash on. It is one thing after another that leaves you going \u0096 HELLO SCRIPT WRITERS ARE YOU FIVE YEARS OLD! So again, this movie was painfully bad. I really feel I needed to write a review. About 30 minutes into this I was going\u0085.wow I am so bummed\u0085.I looked forward to this movie\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085..and unfortunately it was total crap. Don't waste your time on it. This movie was rumored to cost like $200 Million to make\u0085let them lose money on it because the people deserve better than to be treated like total morons. I could not be more disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Steve Carell returns as prissy newsreader Evan Baxter, a little less mean-spirited this time around unlike his previous small turn in 'Bruce Almighty'. Of course, Carell was up and coming then but as his box-office success shows, the character responsible for arguably the only really funny scene in 'Bruce Almighty' deserves a film of his own. Shadayac and co. have approached it with a novel (if potentially expensive idea) to make God (Morgan Freeman) appear this time to instruct Baxter to build an Arc and, as Noah did before him, load it full of animals to protect them from an for an oncoming flood. It's an idea that's very entertaining, even if the jokes are less easy than the previous premise. Evan's transformation of appearance and being pursued by eager animals are the main areas of humour here, which means at times the film is thin on the ground. Sentiment comes in the form of Evan's neglect of his family; the audience will know exactly where this will be going, but fortunately the sentiment isn't as annoying as you might believe. It's also very much a family affair, the humour and the language very much for family audiences. Disappointingly, Shadayac, responsible for bringing out two of Jim Carrey's worst performances (namely 'Liar Liar' and 'Bruce Almighty') by letting Carrey overdo it by seemingly telling him to do the whole thing as an impression of William Shatner, mistakenly this time opts to take Carell down a notch. Carell's trademark hysteria and bizarre reactions are in short supply and we have an all together calmer 'Little Miss Sunshine'-esquire turn, which also means the film loses some of it's potential in this instance. Wanda Sykes and co. are merely stock characters needing better dialogue. Does this make it a bad film? Not at all. It's religious tie-ins (if rushed) are quite smart and it's very well directed visually with a great use of music and keeping a steady pace. It is what's on the label, but with a jaw-droppingly impressive final act which will really take you by surprise and could be up there as one of the sights of the summer! You could do a lot worse than enjoy 100 minutes of easy-going fun but if it's a laugh-out-loud roller-coaster you want, you will leave short-changed!"

Even his wife, was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline.\n\nSpending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. Although, Carell's career might profit from this movie, there's no real reason to go see it.\n\nIf only there was a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining.\n\n4/10 for a few chuckles here and there."

Buy your popcorn and drink before you go to the movie and don't expect to have a pain in your gut because you don't do any big laughing exercise in it.

Though the film lacked the comparable humor to Bruce Almighty, and often times any actual humor at all, the plot was creatively written, and the story moved at a very good pace. I am glad I finally got around to seeing this film, and would heavily encourage others to see the film as well. Is it the best film I've seen? No. Is it a film to go out of your way to see? No. But it is not a film worthy of anything below a seven rating. I would watch this film again. I did not see it in theaters, and am more thankful for that.

        "review_detailed_main": "One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles, you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.\n\nA sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty, this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter (Carrell) moving up the ladder into the main player slot. The story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic sons (slightly weird primary school moppet, spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager). Evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark.\n\nIn other words, it's an updating of the old Genesis story, with Evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. Unfortunately, while the premise is reasonably promising, it sadly does not provide many laughs. There's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where Evan's straight-laced MP tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it, but as soon as he accepts his divine mission, the film takes a nosedive.\n\nFrom this point on, it turns into a message movie. Evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom, while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance though, the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal-feces jokes and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's exasperated right-hand man. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel, especially seeing as Carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the back-burner.\n\nIn some respects, it's slightly similar to the Passion of the Christ, but unlike Mel Gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood letting and guilt tripping, Evan Almighty tries a more gentle approach. The movie simply tells us that we should have faith in God, because He has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the Passion is. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes don't exist and Wanda Sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. It might be sweet, but somebody just tossed $175 000 000 overboard."

        "review_detailed_main": "Evan Almighty generated a lot of hype before its release. A lot of people loved Bruce Almighty, and were expecting something just a zany and hilarious in Evan Almighty. Most of them were disappointed: this movie was received negatively by most critics and audiences alike. Well, I liked it! First of all, this movie has been misunderstood, because it was mismarketed. It was marketed as a hilarious sequel to Bruce Almighty (and the trailer made it look that way, too). But, to be perfectly honest, this is more of a family film than a comedy. But it is a really good family film.\n\nThis film had a lot of potential for comedy. It delivered at times, but not consistently. It also had two very crude toilet humour jokes involving male genitalia (just the word, though, nothing beyond that). I will freely admit, this isn't nearly as hilarious a comedy as the original. But it's good in its own right.\n\nMorgan Freeman's scenes as God were excellently written and performed! One scene in particular, in a restaurant, was really touching and moving. Freeman is really a terrific actor, I'm glad they cast him as God. The performances in this movie were, overall, great. (Although it's a lot of fun watching the young kid unable to resist looking into the camera when pointing out two doves to his dad.) So, all in all, Evan Almighty is not \"almighty\" but it's still \"alrighty\"."

I liked the part that Evan couldn't cut his hair or beard and then then the Moses robes added to the effect. I have to take away some praise though with the whole ark floating though Washington DC. That was just plain silly. Wanda Sikes gets some good one liners too.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: More geared for kids. It's OK to watch once, but not good enough for more viewings."

I like a story rather than just a sitcom. So sue me, you half a billion people who disagree.\n\nWhere \"Bruce\" was insufferably stupid, tasteless and unengaging, \"Evan\" was intelligent, inoffensive and actually contained a story and a message, and the story and the comedy actually worked together. I am not religious. Nor am I normally a fan of Steve Carell, at all. Much bigger fan of Jim Carrey. But I found \"Bruce\" to be forgettable crap fluff, whereas I'm quite convinced that \"Evan\" will be remembered far longer and far better by posterity. Especially because posterity tends to be a lot more intelligent than the present. Nyah nyah.\n\n7 out of 10. Just about my maximum rating for movies of this particular type."

        "review_detailed_main": "In \"Evan Almighty,\" God turns out to be a celestial one-trick-pony (or should that be a PAIR of one-trick-ponies?).\n\nApparently, the good Lord does what every cheapjack Hollywood mogul does when he's run out of fresh ideas and inspiration: He remakes one of the old standbys that proved its worth the first time around. And what more dramatic material to bring up to date than the story of Noah and the worldwide flood?\n\nWell, I guess if Billy Bob Thornton can single-handedly build a fully functioning rocket in his own barn, then Steve Carell can certainly construct a full-scale, floatable ark in his backyard - although in fairness to Thornton, it should be pointed out that his character doesn't have God Himself, in the person of a gap-toothed Morgan Freeman, providing him with the resources and know-how necessary to get the job done.\n\n\"Evan Almighty\" is an in-name-only sequel to the hit comedy \"Bruce Almighty\" from a few years back. In the lead role, Jim Carrey has been replaced by Steve Carell, who played the manipulative, sarcastic Buffalo weatherman, Evan Baxter, in the previous film. Somehow, Baxter seems to have undergone a complete personality transformation over the course of several years, since now he is a puppy-dog idealist who has just been elected to the U.S. Congress on the ever-so-trite slogan, \" Change the World.\" However, no sooner does he move his family from upstate New York to suburban Virginia than he begins receiving visitations from a strange man claiming to be God and commanding Evan to build an ark on the lot next door. Naturally, his family and co-workers believe the poor man has gone off the deep end, although here the movie betrays its lack of internal consistency since the \"miracles\" that are occurring to him - being followed all over town by pairs of exotic animals, being unable to shave his newly grown beard and whiskers etc. - are there for all to see, thus making the disbelief of the populace either a monument to their own stupidity or, more likely, an implausible, heavy-handed plot device. And speaking of plot devices, why do all these non-indigenous creatures like giraffes, elephants and lions - let alone all the birds - show up to this location when the flood itself turns out to be a mere local event? Exactly what are they fleeing from (unless there's a zoo with very flimsy cages nearby which we know nothing about)?\n\nAnd, of course, to smooth things over for modern audiences, who might be made a trifle uncomfortable by all the wanton death and destruction in the original story, the Steve Oedekerk script is quick to point out that THIS flood is no act of wrath on the part of God, and that even the first one was actually a tale about commitment and love. Is there nothing Hollywood can't reduce to sheer dreck and utter pablum?\n\nDirected by Tim Shadyac, \"Evan Almighty\" is said to be the most expensive comedy ever made. Well, the \"expense\" we can see, what will all the CGI effects and animal-control needed to make the concept come to life on screen. The \"comedy,\" on the other hand, is a trifle more difficult to discern. Even though the movie gets its requisite dog-poop joke out of the way in the first five minutes, this is a decidedly more tame, family-friendly movie than the often raunchy \"Bruce Almighty.\" That would be fine if the jokes in \"Evan Almighty\" happened to be funny. Instead of humor, however, we're given a God who smiles smugly and delivers sappy little homilies about belief and faith in terms so simpering and blithe they make your average Sunday School lesson seem edgy and dark in comparison.\n\nCarell does what he can with a poorly written part, but Freeman's arch condescension wears thin very early on. Wanda Sykes, as one of Baxter's Congressional aides, repeats her trick from the wretched \"Monster-in-law\" of hijacking all the movie's best lines, and one wishes she could at least have been assigned the role of Mrs. Noah as a means of garnering her a bit more time on screen.\n\nHere's hoping that God comes up with new and better material - or at least a better ghost-writer - the next time around."

A sequel one level down in the rating (PG-13 to kiddie movie PG), without the main actor. With that said, I didn't hate this movie, I just didn't think it was very good. It relied on all the jokes to be made by \"funny woman\" Wanda Sykes, and Steve Carrell to act like an idiot. In \"Evan Almighty\", Evan Baxter, has quit his news job, and is now a congressman. He begins having trouble after he prays to make his family closer, and he meets God (reprised by Morgan Freeman). Slowly Evan becomes Noah, which leads to very predictable humor and plot. Though Evan is supposed to be an intelligent man, he somehow hits his thumb four times in a row with a hammer trying to build this ark(?), was one example of stupid humor. The highlight of this movie is Jonah Hill, playing the suck-up intern, and he was actually funny at times. Other than him, and a few lines from others, all you have is poor special effects and Steve Carrell playing the same role he's played in every other movie (Though I normally do like him).\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. Rated PG for crude humor and very mild language. 89 mins."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: An enjoyable effects-heavy comedy where Steve Carell is never upstaged by the gimmicky effects.\n\nAfter a popular yet small role in 2003's BRUCE ALMIGHTY (still credited as Steven Carell), Steve Carell gets his chance to share scenes with the Almighty in this sequel/spin-off EVAN ALMIGHTY. With a shorter running time and a lighter PG-rating, EVAN will appeal to the kids as well as to the adults, even if the tone is uneven; some of them work, some not.\n\nEvan (Carell) is back, this time not as a news anchor, but as a newly-elected congressman. But his days in Capitol are numbered when The Almighty (Morgan Freeman) returns and gives him a task to build an ark to save thousands of animals and his family from an impending flood. Of course, with such a promise, a flood and thousands of animals require tons of special effects work. With a much bigger budget, director Tom Shadyac manages to give as some eye-catching special effects to populate the film along with an all-star comedic cast that includes John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, Lauren Graham, John Michael Higgins and Jonah Hill.\n\nWhat starts out as a twist on the Noah's Ark story quickly becomes something reminiscent to a Roland Emmerich disaster movie during its climax. The special effects are distracting, and the said big effects climax is distracting and evidently gratuitous to what might have been a simple comedy like its predecessor. Writer Steve Oedekerk, who co-wrote the first film, offers more slapstick than ever (with pratfalls that will probably appeal to the kids rather than adults). Regardless of that, EVAN ALMIGHTY serves its purpose as family entertainment. If Carrey made all you grown-ups laugh like idiots, Carell is a somewhat lighter guy that you can assure could bring a smile to the whole family.\n\nRating: ***1/2 out of 5."

Evan Almighty was not able to manage the expectations of those who came to see it anticipating as riotous a ride as its predecessor Bruce Almighty. It retained the premise of the original as a spin-off but it doesn't work not because Steve Carell is less talented than Jim Carrey but because he had lousy material to work with. Even Morgan Freeman (who reprises his role as God) lost the zing and impressive qualities he had in the first installment.\n\nEvan Almighty apparently targets a family audience with its decidedly more religious overtones (check out what ARK really means), so it shouldn't have attempted to fool the audience by maintaining the Almighty franchise because it doesn't fit; its brand of humor and story simply failed to keep up.\n\nIt would've probably done better if it were marketed differently instead of lazily riding on the success of Bruce Almighty when it painfully couldn't deliver the same punches."

This film is one more symptom of Will Ferrell-itis. Just say no, Steve! My wife disliked this movie because she said the religiousness necessarily behind the concept was a little too over-the-top and in-your-face for her. I personally think the movie does its best to keep from alienating people whose belief in biblical events like those portrayed here is minimal at best, even making fun of Congress' lack of faith, but it's almost as if the movie tries so hard to avoid this problem that it pours on the \"love your family\" sap with so much thickness that the audience just can't get unstuck or see beyond it.\n\nMy main problem with the movie: it's not funny. Plain and simple. The only somewhat chuckle-inducing moments come from Wanda Sykes' one-liners; Steve Carell does not have a single funny thing to say the whole movie. I almost felt bad for him, stumbling through this poorly-written and ridiculously implausible script with a goofy look of frustration the whole time about how the world didn't believe him and God expected too much of him. In reality he must've been frustrated by having been suckered into what will hopefully be the worst film role of his career.\n\nAs other reviewers have stated, why are there two of all exotic animals if the flood is a brief local event that hits only suburban DC? Why does no one believe Evan even though it would be quite easy to demonstrate how his beard grows back immediately? Why haven't the producers of \"Click\" sued for the cheesy family-is-more-important-than-work point hammered repeatedly into the viewer's skull when the protagonist has to go through some ridiculous experience to gain some perspective? Watch repeats of The Office instead of wasting your time on this pile of absurdity and inanity."

The first film played upon every daydreamer's fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit. Evan's experience though is entirely different. He has none of the control that Jim Carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief. Now this would have been fine, since the first film was preaching the same message. The problem is that the sequel does it's preaching at the expense of the comic relief. And to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot. You get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film, and it's main objective is not to make you laugh. To sum things up this movie is failed mixture of Eddie Murhphy's \"The Distinguished Gentleman\" and Charlton Heston's \"The Ten Commandments\". I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is at fault here, you get a sense that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about."

Weird things start happening to him including goafer wood being dropped outside his house and Gen 614 turning up everywhere. When he sees God himself (Morgan freeman) he thinks hes gone nuts, especially when God tells him to build an ark as a flood is coming. Evan is unwilling to do it but after a little 'persuasion' from God almost involving him getting fired from work, Evan agrees. This is a very sweet and funny film, it is especially heart-warming seeing Evan spending time with his kids building the ark and the animals joining in to help. It has a very moral message: Trust in God. The slight twist at the end helps to enforce this. Was slow and corny at times but still an entertaining film for all the family. :)"

The animal bits are a nice touch, and the ark itself is impressive.\n\nAs for the actors, they probably should have chosen between Wanda Sykes and John Michael Higgins, because both are not needed. I would have gone with Sykes' character, because Higgins' is needlessly irritating here, and I normally like him. Evan's wife is an underwritten, underdeveloped character--and not very likable. He could have been a widower and it wouldn't have made much difference. John Goodman is well cast as a corrupt senator, but it seems he just toned down his evil salesman from O Brother Where Art Thou.\n\nBut other than a few minor quibbles with the characters, there's little in this movie not to like. Comedy is often very subjective. There are some well-reviewed films I don't find funny at all, while this one I have to say deserves a higher rating. I think many viewers who give this a chance will agree with me."

And Morgan Freeman is usually good in whatever he's in so that's a definite plus. Steve Carell was fine in his bit part in Bruce Almighty and I also loved him in \"The Office\" and The 40-Year-Old Virgin he made the previous year so I managed to find him mostly funny enough in this.

The effects for a movie which cost $175 million to produce were quite simply laughable. It is more than obvious that every other scene is shot on a blue/green screen (and edited poorly might I add) and there is a horrible fuzz which invades the screen in the scenes involving animals. For a comedy it lacks any comedic punch whatsoever, they tried to cover that up by randomly and annoying cutting to Wanda Sykes spitting out some pretty awful one-liners.\n\nAnd all of that is beyond the fact that the directors and writers quite obviously chose to pursue a far more religious offering this time around rather than focusing on making their audience laugh. This movie is more akin to a (mildly) comedic companion piece to \"The Passion of the Christ.\" Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I felt bombarded by Christian doctrine when all I really wanted was to laugh.\n\nIn short; Steve Carell and John Goodman, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You're both capable of much much better work."

It didn't take long for me to think, \"She's takin' in water, Cap'n, and fast!\" I guess this just goes to show that a 200 million dollar budget can't buy laughs, nor can it generate any of its own. And in keeping with the theme of this movie, may God have mercy on the poor souls who not only see this movie, but those who enjoy it, too. And with that 7.5 rating, he's gonna have a lot of mercy-ing to do."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even without Jim Carrey, EVAN ALMIGHTY is still a pretty entertaining and occasionally funny movie, with a serious message for the kiddies: you have to believe in yourself and what you do, and assuming you are religious, you have to put a little faith in God. There's also an eco-friendly theme throughout. This family-oriented followup to the slightly raunchy BRUCE ALMIGHTY sees former news anchor Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) becoming a D.C. politician with a big new house in what used to be the woodsy suburbs of Virginia and a Hummer for his main vehicle. He falls in with a corrupt elder congressman, played perfectly by John Goodman, who has been developing land illegally. Then along comes God in the familiar form of Morgan Freeman, telling Evan to build an ark and prepare for a major flood. You can probably guess where this is going. Evan's family and friends and co-workers all assume he's lost it as he begins to build his ark -- and grow a lot of hair, just like Noah before him. He even begins sporting a Noah-like robe, and when he tries to wear anything else, he finds he simply can't. Also, birds and animals begin following him around. Lots and lots of birds and animals. Carrell is believable enough in a preposterous role, although a little of his trademark bellowing goes a long way after awhile. The movie's visuals and production design are stunning, including the massive ark and the thousands of animals preparing to board, two by two. But it is the little things that really count, like Evan trying to shave his constantly growing beard or stepping out his front door in a natty suit, only to find himself suddenly stark naked in front of the mail lady. One might nitpick some of the finer details, like where are all the animal rights activists when the police are preparing to destroy the ark? But you'd just be nitpicking. For those old enough to remember, there was a popular movie trilogy called OH,GOD! 20 years ago, featuring George Burns as a golf attire-wearing deity appearing to ordinary mortals for various divine purposes. If this current series does come up with a second sequel, who knows what might be done for an encore? Only God knows. And he ain't talking at the moment."

Seriously this should have been a made for TV sequel on ABC family (or maybe Pax)like Romy and Michelle had. I am actually a big Steve Carell fan, but he needs to let go of past projects, the subtle hints of \"Over the hedge\" (the squirrels on his parking spot) and \"The 40-year old virgin Mary\" were just embarrassing, like \"here remember I was funny in this\". If you want to see Steve Carell make you laugh go see \"Knocked Up\" his cameo has more laughs than this whole movie. There are also numerous bird sh*t jokes, i guess its the only funny thing you can do with birds. Oh well. I take it this might be an entertaining movie for kids. If they could handle a premise like \"God's wrath\" for a movie. But that wouldn't be consistent with the first movie's more adult humor. If you don't believe me please be my guest when you walk out of the theater you will say \"that guy was right\". I bet you will even stay for the dance montage at the end praying for a couple extra laughs, trust me they don't come."

It was also a great story about don't cut corners, don't be greedy, really take care of your family, and don't fight God just cooperate with him and he will lead you to be so kindhearted to the point you will change the world for the better as displayed in the story with the Ark.

        "review_detailed_main": "With the new big-budget crapfest that is Evan Almighty, I truly was expecting something special; the plot sounded promising and Bruce Almighty, the first film, was spectacular. In this film, however, everything is washed down the drain. There is an unbelievable amount of talent here, and all of it is wasted on a hideously awful and clich\u00e9 script; from Wanda Sykes to Steve Carrell to Morgan Freeman, Evan Almighty had an obscene amount of potential that was all washed down the drain.\n\nFor one, all of the characters are completely hollow crapless shells that have no substance whatsoever. There are scenes that go for unique family drama and they didn't work on any level. The villain, played badly by John Goodman, is not even much of a villain. When you think clich\u00e9, think of this film. If you've seen the trailer, then you know what is in store for the next hour and a half. EXACTLY what is in store. This movie offers nothing at all new, and it falls victim to every clich\u00e9 in the book. The only good aspects of the film were the actors and the special effects. There was one scene where something resembling comedy ensues, but it doesn't last very long.\n\nTrust me, a movie has to be really awful for me to say it was awful. It was a gigantic disappointment. Ratatouille is an amazing movie--you should see that instead of the utter piece of flaming trash that was Evan Almighty. It had a couple funny parts and a great cast, but they couldn't even save the film from a disappointing conclusion, poorly written characters, and a mess of a script. Evan Almighty is the perfect example of a brainless, mindless, horribly-written pile of clich\u00e9s that wastes talent and sucks the life out of anyone who sees it. In its attempt to be heartwarming and teach life lessons, the movie becomes redundant and annoying as hell. Skip this one and never ever see it. You won't miss anything; watch the trailer and you have to whole movie right in front of you."

Of course his colleagues and family thinks he's off his rocker. Lauren Graham plays Evan's wife and John Goodman an intimidating congressman while Wanda Sykes & Jonah Hill play assistants.\n\nThis sequel isn't laugh-out-loud funny like much of \"Bruce Almighty\" was, but it's a fun and amusing flick AS LONG AS you favor the cast and the biblical theme. It's also more family-friendly. Steve's a quality protagonist, Graham looks great in tight jeans, the moral's worthy and the last act delivers the goods. However, with just a little more imagination & effort it could've been so much better. As it is, the second act lags and tempts the viewer to tune out. So I can only give it a mild thumbs up. Incredibly, the movie cost $175 million to make (in 2006 dollars).\n\nThe film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Virginia and Universal Studios, CA.\n\nGRADE: B-"

If anything the scale and the quality of the effects did to an extent save it from be rubblish.\n\nThe humour which should have been an important aspect considering this was meant to be a comedy was brief but funny.

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone who likes \"Bruce, Almighty\" will definitely like this movie, which looks like a spin-off, based in the biblical story of Noah. In this case, it's adapted to our time and contains several ecological and ethical messages. The finale is excellent and takes full advantage of CGI to impress us. Since it assumes from the beginning that its a rather irreverent comedy, questions surrounding the likelihood or plausibility of the facts don't apply here. Cinematography is also good as well as soundtrack. Despite this, there is no effort to develop characters, with the overwhelming majority of them representing archetypes more than real people. For example, the movie villain, played by John Goodman, isn't a person with personality or story but just an archetype of the corrupt, greedy American politicians, concerned only about their personal gains. This senator isn't only representing himself but an idea. From this point of view, and since the film seeks to convey some ideas and messages (acts of random kindness, other ecological, human, altruistic ideas and messages), the use of archetypes makes this task easier, although many people may simply think that the characters were poorly developed.\n\nSteve Carrell is a good comedian and does a very nice job in this film, which is a major evolution in his career, that started badly with vulgar comedies and easy jokes. Morgan Freeman remains playing God and becomes one of the actors who best gave life to the Creator in the movies. He can also be funny, but it's a different kind of humor, more restrained and serene than Carrell's comedy. Goodman was good as a villain, in that he made his character into something that was both funny and execrable. This is a good family movie with lots of entertainment and good comedy, that cannot get past \"Bruce, Almighty\" but does what it takes to amuse the public. The film is funny and can really make us spend some quality time."

It does teach some good lessons, however, and that's its biggest strength.\n\nEvan Baxter (STEVE CARELL), the co-anchor from \"Bruce Almighty\" has recently been elected a U.S. congressman. He takes his wife, Joan (LAUREN GRAHAM), and his kids to a richer community. There, they begin their new lives in a giant house with a stunning view. Evan won his election with the idea of changing the world. One day, God appears to him in the form of MORGAN FREEMAN. He tells Evan to build an ark because there is an impending flood in the D.C. area. Of course, Evan refuses to believe, and goes through all sorts of trouble to understand that this is no joke, and that the vision he had was real. He spends the rest of the time building the ark, warding off a corrupt congressman (JOHN GOODMAN), and warning people of the upcoming dangers.\n\nAs I said, this movie has a horrible screenplay. The dialogue is forced and unreal. The movie has a few laughs and the rare smile, but the filmmakers seem to think this movie is funnier than it actually is. When you watch it, you know when you're supposed to laugh; they cut to the characters chuckling and giving each other high-fives. The only problem is, we don't care. We're not laughing at all.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this movie a 5, is that it has a very good lesson. Its morals are religious and true. It's good that the movies can still share these ideas with an audience. Morgan Freeman is impossible not to like, and Steve Carell gives the best he can with such an awful script. There are also a couple of moments of moving drama. Yes, not the strongest dialogue, but still moving. These scenes suggest the movie would have worked better as a drama.\n\n\"Bruce Almighty\" is a lot funnier, and still holds those important values. This movie isn't worth a trip to the theater because it's not a good comedy. I'd say rent it on DVD for Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, and to be reminded of those important ideals many seem to have forgotten."

With Steve's promising career, mostly in comedy, this seemed like a guaranteed hit. I didn't get to see it over the summer unfortunately, but I figured I would wait for the rental since it wasn't getting the best reviews. So I watched this movie tonite and I have to say that this film was cute and entertaining, worth one watch, but it was more of one of those cheesy comedies that didn't seem to please as much as the original with Jim Carrey. Steve did fine, I think it was just the story and how it turned too much into one of those typical family comedies that overdoes it on the cheese.\n\nEvan is a news anchor turned politician who is about to make it in high ranks in Washington, D.C. But his family life isn't going so well, he makes promises to his kids all the time, and doesn't keep them. One day while he prays to God that he needs help and wants to change the world, God does come to him and tells him there will be a flood and he needs a man who will build an ark for animals and humans to survive. Of course, Evan doesn't believe him, but eventually gets it on how important he is, so he and his family come together to build the ark. But his career is going to have to take the back seat if he's going to get this done on time.\n\nEvan Almighty, don't get me wrong, it was a cute movie, I would agree while it should have been more of a pure comedy, it was a good family film. Like I said, I just wished it could've been more like the first Almighty where it was just the most wrong guy for the job type of a movie than a man who needs to get close to his family. But, it's all good, the cast looked like they actually enjoyed making this film and I loved the 40 year old virgin reference, cheesy little laugh. So Evan Almighty is worth a watch, but I wouldn't go for another watch again for a while.\n\n6/10"

The screenplay isn't great but it isn't bad either and offers some good laughs. Where this film falls short is with the ending and the simple fact that it mentions religion, which is a touchy subject for some.\n\nIn terms of the ending, I think you just expect more, something bigger. The film does a nice job of building to the end but when it gets there, you're left scratching your head a bit, as if to say, \"That's it?\" As far as religion's role in this film, you need to be able to set your personal beliefs aside when watching this movie. It is a movie after all. God, played by Morgan Freeman, explains why and for what purpose he brought a flood to Earth, an event detailed in the Bible. Some viewers do not believe this was really God's reason or intent.\n\nDespite the somewhat disappointing end to the film, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it was simple in its design. You can afford to sit back and really just enjoy it for what it is - a funny family movie. It isn't bogged down with complex plot twists, or messy emotional themes that just don't belong in this type movie.\n\nI prefer this film to \"Bruce Almighty\" and recommend it for viewing. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "(My Synopsis) Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) is a Buffalo newscaster who was just elected to Congress. His slogan was to \"Change the World\". He moves his family to Virginia to start his new life. What Evan doesn't know is that his world was about to change. Evan prays for guidance in his new house and the next morning he begins to encounter strange things. First his alarm clock goes off at GEN 6:14, and then he finds a house warming gift, a box filled with old tools, at his front door. The next weird thing is a truck load of gopher wood is delivered to Evan's house. Finally, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan, and commands him to build an ARK just as Noah did before him, and fill it with animals to protect them against the coming flood. Evan believes he is under a lot of stress and that is causing him to go a little crazy. So it takes a little persuasion from God to get Evan to build an ARK.\n\n(My Comment) This is one of those cute and funny movies that you can take your children to. It has a moral message to Trust in God and Family. The movie shows that there are consequences when working parents neglect their family for their job. Evan learns this lesson when he begins to spend time with his wife and children building the ARK together, and learns that we should live life to the fullest. There are some funny scenes when the animals join in to build the ARK and the changes that were made in the personal appearance of Evan. I liked Wanda Sykes with her one-liners. This is a sweet and entertaining movie with language and humor that is made for a family audience. God told Evan that an individual can Change the World by an Act of Random Kindness, \"ARK\". Be sure to watch the outtakes at the end of the movie. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:35, Rated PG)(7/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a completely different film to 'Bruce Almighty' - far more family-oriented, and Steve Carrell has none of Jim Carrey's manic, oddball, dangerousness (or irritation factor, depending on your point of view). Aside from the presence of Morgan Freeman as God, it's not really a sequel at all. Most Hollywood comedies nowadays come with a message - it's a surprise just how blatantly they're now being hammered home, almost overwhelming the comedy : it's possible to sit through a comedy film which has not a single genuine laugh in it - just a few mild chuckles, in-jokes, and so on. Maybe we've just been spoilt by the glut of jokes in Shrek. Or maybe this is just a badly-written film. Birds making messes on people numerous times - people falling over numerous times - check. This one's focus turns out to be environmental - John Goodman's big bad congressman cutting corners to develop precious unspoilt land - at one point he makes a comment (can't remember actually what) about not standing in the way of 'progress' - with a hint at global warming/environmental damage, perhaps? The other side of the message is about the modern man whose worries about his appearance (something God mentions, and which we see during the, erm, 'hilarious' scene of Carrell pulling hairs from his nose - Mr Bean, but less funny?) and doesn't spend enough time with his family - building the ark enables him to spend time with them, and, at the end of the film, hiking through the unspoilt countryside, they could be pioneers from the old days...Well, maybe that's taking it a bit too far. But the movie's insistent on returning to old-fashioned values (anyone notice the scene where Evan's bearded appearance is compared to Abraham Lincoln?) - including Christian ones: the Christian emphasis is pretty overt (though not stiflingly so, for those who don't subscribe to Christianity).\n\nDue to this emphasis on family values etc etc, it's appropriate that Jon Stewart's cameo on a TV screen, featuring an item on Evan in his Daily Show, has him becoming (or maybe just being) the cynical sceptic who laughs at Noah building his ark - like everyone else who mocks Evan, the implications is that these sceptics, those who don't believe in the unusual/the supernatural/God, can be aligned with the sceptics who got washed away in the Biblical story. (Stewart, in the 20 seconds he's on screen, fits the role like a glove (OK, it's not really a role, he's just doing what he does on TV all the time) - for those who can't stand his self-satisfied smug cynicism, it might not be such a bad thing if he got washed away...But that's besides the point). Of course, this couldn't happen in a modern film - cuddly old Morgan Freeman may play a few mischievous jokes on Evan, but it's all for his own good, and he's far too dignified to sweep a few hundred people away in a flood.\n\nOverall, what I'd expected really. Give it a miss."

Running about 90 minutes the film never feels bogged down and Steve Carell holds his own as the title character.\n\nWhen god (morgan Freeman)chooses Evan Baxter to be the next to learn an important lesson from his strange way of teaching, life turns upside-down for the man who we last saw as a buffalo news anchor in Bruce Almighty. Now a U.S. congressman, Evan is trying to adjust to a new way of life when one day god comes forth and commands Evan to build an Ark. A series of comical situations follow as Evan, his friends, family and fellow congressmen try to understand whats happening and why.\n\nCarell and Freeman hold their own as the main characters of the film, along with some help from John Goodman, who takes a turn as the bad guy for an interesting change of pace, and a wide assortment of animals that show up at the site of the ark. All told this is a slightly different tale than that of Bruce's encounter with the big man upstairs. With its PG rating it lacks some of the adult humorous situations of it's predecessor, but still holds enough wit and charm to leave you walking away from the theater satisfied."

The direction wasn't as good as it should've been, and didn't seem to do any favours directing his stars.

What follows is a rather far-fetched and quite 'silly' storyline, which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience. Unlike it's predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' tagged upon it's misleading position of 'sequel' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature, upscale audience.\n\nGenerally speaking, Evan Almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values. The acting; omit Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production. Additionally, the cast includes acting legend John Goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety; I didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy. Every other character in the movie (especially the wife and kids!) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size Kiev. Be warned though; it is the typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated films, so I'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight.\n\nIt may seem the movie is worthless thus-far, however, it does have -some- promising aspects. The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the Ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end. The particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although part of me couldn't help, but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were, in my opinion, 'too good' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout.\n\nOverall I view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential, but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content I had so far witnessed. This wasn't the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits. As I sat discontent I couldn't help, but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as 'Mighty' as I hoped for. In many ways the film reminded me of a watered down \"Night at the Museum\" as it showed similar styling and characteristics, but unfortunately was leagues below even that.\n\nI give this movie 3 out of 10, as it is watchable, but it's definitely one to be avoided! If you HAVE to see this film, be prepared for disappointment as 'mildly entertained' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I began watching this movie, I completely expected a rip-off of the hilariously funny \"Bruce Almighty\" starring Jim Carrey. Same concept, same jokes, same old, right?! Thankfully, this version went in a bit of a different direction and was all the better for it.\n\nThe film follows news-caster Evan (from the first film, played by Steve Carell) as he leaves the newsroom behind and branches out into politics. Of course, just when it seems he has it made, he gets a little visit from God (once again personified brilliantly by Morgan Freeman). God tells Evan that he must build an Ark (ala Noah), as \"a flood is coming\". At first, Evan tries desperately to ignore or even outright thwart the \"hand of God\", but quickly learns that such an attitude is impossible. Thus, the Ark begins to be built and hilarity ensues.\n\nYet, despite the great sight sags and situational humor that Carell (of \"The Office\" fame) nails so perfectly, is this film really a comedy? I would have to say an emphatic \"no\". The only actual jokes offered are commentary from Wanda Sykes, and those get old real fast. Instead, the directors/producers use a combination of those sight gags and crazy situations to fashion a family film with a great message and a compelling storyline. Basically, while it may not have you laughing out loud, you will find yourself chuckling throughout, then actually caring about what happens to the characters at the end.\n\nGoing in that more family-oriented direction saved this film from becoming a re-tread of the first effort. The writers knew that only Carrey could have nailed the physical comedy and \"in-your- face\" jokes of \"Bruce Almighty\", so they toned it down a bit for the much more understated (yet still funny in its own way) Carell.\n\nThis film is perfectly safe to watch with your children and enjoy with the entire family. It isn't an instant classic, but you won't be looking at your watch, either."

Shortly after he arrives there, though, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to him and tells him to build an ark.\n\nWhy, you ask? Why, to drive the plot, of course. Back in ye olden times, Noah was told to build an ark so that when God flooded the planet, the humans and the animals could repopulate. That's not quite the scope of the task at hand here, though we don't find that out till near the end of the movie.\n\nBuilding an ark in this day and age is disconcerting enough, but Evan has ancillary problems. He prides himself on his appearance, but lo and behold, once God has Spoken to Evan, he notices he can't shave in the morning. Or anytime. The beard grows right back. His hair also begins to grow at an alarming rate. And pairs of animals, from gophers to birds, are following him everywhere. Not a good turn of events if you're a freshman congresscritter.\n\nNaturally, no one believes that God has spoken to Evan, thus making for awkward moments when a powerful congressman (a hammy John Goodman) wants Baxter to cosponsor some kind of land rights bill, and every time he runs into Evan he sees animals and hair. Bad impression! Not that the movie's completely lacking in cleverness, however. Evan's wife is Joan (Joan of Arc, get it?); the Baxters' realtor is Eve Adams (an annoying Molly Shannon) (Eve, Adam, get it?); God His Own Darn Self wears a name tag when he appears to Joan that says \"Al Mighty.\" Oh, and the company that drops off the wood that Evan's supposed to use to build the ark is the \"Go 4 Wood\" company. Because the original ark was supposedly made of gopher wood.\n\nFor the most part, the movie is pretty formulaic. No one believes him, especially his family. Then they sort of do, but no one else does. Then people ridicule him while he builds the arc. Then the flood happens, and suddenly everyone's a True Believer. Har. Oh, and then there's the obligatory sideplot of the supposedly nice politico who's actually up to dirty tricks. In Washington, of all places! I know! Carell isn't too bad, and neither is his supporting cast, and that may actually be the problem - they're just \"not bad\" instead of \"pretty good.\" This isn't a movie you'll remember in a few years, in other words, except when you think of movies that had pretty good CGI scenes (check out the flood!). Freeman is as smooth as you'd expect Morgan Freeman to be, really, and there's no one else who could have done a better job than he did. But really, everyone else in the movie was sort of bland and could have been replaced by another, similarly innocuous actor. (Except Wanda Sykes, who plays Evan's executive assistant - she could be replaced by someone who's not a major irritant.) The end does compensate for an otherwise grayscale movie, with a wonderful staging of The Flood. Except, you know, on a much smaller scale, which sort of undermines the whole idea of The Flood in the first place. In Bruce Almighty, God wanted Bruce (and HIS not-understanding girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston) to gain understanding. Here, He's asking Evan to solve a political/social crisis. Bruce Almighty, it turned out, taught us about free will; Evan Almighty teaches us that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. Evan Almighty's overall message just doesn't feel as all-encompassing or rich as that of Bruce Almighty, which makes it feel a little flat."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this over-the-top sequel to BRUCE ALMIGHTY, Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman bring to the screen this tale of a nonbeliever who talks to God 30 years after John Denver and George Burns played the same mismatched characters. Putting aside the notion that the real Almighty would likely appear to someone who's so indifferent to His existence, be it a character played by Denver, Carell or Jim Carrey, and that God would call forth a modern-day Noah to build an ark and save a bunch of animals and some people after He promised in His own Bible that He would not destroy the world again with a flood, I found myself a bit uncomfortable enjoying this film so much. It's one thing for Hollywood to make a film with historical characters or events that veers far from the truth, but it's a bit unnerving when these characters include the Creator of the universe who's been worshipped by billions of people. I'm sure God must have a sense of humor, as someone said when they first saw a platypus. The same can't be said about the folks who made this film. When the first real slapstick scene has a dog biting Evan in the crotch, you know this movie's in trouble. For a comedy that's not really too funny, there are some good bits to recommend. The scenes with the animals are very good and if animal wrangling ever becomes an Oscar category, this deserves the statuette. The scenes with Evan and his problems with facial hair were well done and the flood scenes were well staged, although a bit improbable to see mountains and deep river valleys in an area that's supposed to be the D.C. tidewater basin.\n\nOme more personal note I would like to relate. When I went to my neighborhood Garland Theatre to see this movie, I realized I had forgotten my wallet. Luckily, I had been sorting through the state quarters I've been collecting and I had placed the ones that were duplicates or not in anything approaching mint condition in my coin purse, which I realized was the only money I was carrying when I reached the ticket window. By the time I counted my change, I had 80 cents in pennies, nickels and dimes, but I had 13 quarters, worth $3.25, which paid the bulk of the $3.50 admission price. I may not be able to see and talk to God like Evan, Jim and John do on screen, but I think He was there for me nonetheless. Dale Roloff"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sequels are a dicey business, even if you do manage to bring back all the old cast, writer, director, etc. which didn't happen here. Writer Steve Oedekerk (who shared credit on Bruce Almighty) returns, as does director Tom Shadyac. The cast is largely new except for Morgan Freeman who shines again as God and Carell, who moves from a bit part into the starring role this time out. Carell is still a bit new to this leading man thing, so I will offer a little un-requested advice. When they offer you the most money, make sure they are also offering most of funny lines, too. Freeman has the best written role here and it is was so much better that I started to feel a sense of relief anytime I saw his character return. Carell spends too much of the movie gasping in shock, surprise, or dismay. In Bruce Almighty, Carrey's comedic talents drove the movie, but Carell is more of a straight man and doesn't have that one-man-show talent. There are a few laughs but not enough and the story is OK, but nowhere near enough to make up for the lack of chuckles.\n\nCarell plays TV anchorman, Evan Baxter, who has just been elected to Congress, where the environmentally, self-absorbed, oblivious Washington rookie is quickly sucked into the sphere of the powerful Congressman Long, played masterfully by veteran actor, John Goodman. Everything seems to be looking rosy for the Baxter clan, when God (Freeman) shows up to tell Evan Baxter to forget all this and build an Ark. Evan is understandably reluctant to do this, but God can be quite persuasive and soon Evan begins the project as stunned staffers and family members look on. For humor, we are fed a steady diet of slapstick building mishaps, animal schtick and a Santa Clause-like transformation. It's not much, but that's what we've got. There are a few laughs, a somewhat suspenseful ending and some good effects.\n\nThis is a safe, bland, family viewing choice that is unlikely to be either hated or loved, although it had one scene that offered far more nasal care coverage than any movie needs. In this flick, God appears to have pretty low expectations for behavior compared to how things seemed to have worked in the Bible days. There is some kind of goofy message about the importance of family and God giving opportunities for us to help ourselves and make good choices, but God-Freeman pretty much only offers one choice then rewards his followers for making that choice. There was probably more to the message, but I've already forgotten it, just as I will soon do with the rest of this movie.\n\n(This original ManhattanMovieManiac work first appeared on realmoviereview)"

It's the perfect film to take your family with to see. It might even get your kids into the bible at a very young age.

Morgan Freeman again returns as God, this time to help out Evan Baxter who has just recently been elected to the U.S. Congress and Steve Carrell is good in this role. So upon buying a new home with the wife(Lauren Graham) and kids Evan is visited by God and told to build Noah's Ark! Really this film with it's religion type theme makes for the dullness because it simply hurts the charm and comedy style, as a viewer you feel torn between a religious tale and comedy and religion is no laughing matter. Yet building the arc, and animal scenes, and the funny scenes of Carrell's transformation of hair growth is funny and crazy! Plus Lauren Graham brightens up the screen as his cute and caring wife and she provides some substance to the film. This film will provide plenty of laughs it's just so unrealistic while it drives a good hearted message of kindness and growth of family and community bonding, it's dull ending with the punch ARK standing for random acts of kindness. Overall just watch for the laughs and throw away all truths."

Evan has been promoted, has left the news presentation business and has moved to another area with his family. Little does he know that God has a task for him.\n\nSo far the only link between the two films is the appearance of two actors ad their respective roles. Strange enough this is more or less the only real linkup between the two. The two films are very different. Where BA was more or less the story of an angry man getting the power and using them for his own good EA is the story of a man getting the power and doing what he is asked. Both lean toward the comical track though.\n\nPersonally I found BA a fair bit better than EA. Although there are some good laughs in this one there are too many spots where there is nothing to laugh about and the speed just leaves the film altogether. The added moral story isn't one that was needed either - it just adds a clich\u00e9 that doesn't have anything to offer except just being there and that's a shame.\n\nAll in all, 5 out of 10 dancing Gods"

It's a shame to see yet another shoddy template movie being puked out by Hollywood. This movie is a complete waste of Steve Carell's talent.\n\nAt the risk of taking this movie too seriously I think probably hundreds of people would have died in such a massive unexpected flood. I seriously doubt the whole town (all 30 of them?) were loaded onto that Ark in 2 minutes. It certainly raises some questions about the morality of a god who would kill hundreds of people to help Steve Carell's family have a good time."

This was a fun movie to enjoy if you are 12. Fortunately for me the day I went to see it just so happened to be my monthly \"I'm pretending I am 12 (again) day\" where I try to see everything in life as if it were new and exciting, and not through the jaded and cracked spectacles of my age-hardened cynicism. Mostly this movie is fluff, fluff, and more fluff, but in a fun way. Jesus freaks would like this, but there is no Jesus to be found here. Noah freaks perhaps? Hey! I liked it, even if I was pretending to be 12 so I could save a buck on the ticket price, and get a jr. soda. This movie will make you feel like a kid, even if you do not suffer from the same delusions I do. It will make you feel small and worthless \"unless you are fulfilling a higher purpose.\" So make sure you buy extra popcorn."

The fact that Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston declined this movie should have been a warning to me. I'm wondering why Morgan Freeman agreed to play his role as God in this Godawful movie. In other words, it is an abomination.\n\nThe acting sucks. I expected a lot more from Steve Carell. And he was by far the best actor in the cast. Although my hatred for Wanda Sykes was already at a maximum of 100%, she still managed to raise that percentage. Whenever she opened her mouth, I started feeling more worse for her that this movie would affect her whole career. But maybe that's for the best...\n\nThe reason I quoted this movie a 2 is for the cinematography. When you're not following the story, the image is still quite entertaining.\n\nI hope I have convinced everyone to not spend his or her precious money and time for this odium."

        "review_detailed_main": "The question of real importance is, was this film worth the 10 bucks paid for it. The answer, in my humble opinion, is yes. Let's start off with the bad of this movie. 1.) Many jokes that aren't funny or don't work or fall flat 2.) Steve Carrell as straight man. He needs to be crazy or doing something offbeat to be effective. In this, he was a boring husband with mildly irritating quirks. 3.) Long and drawn out. I don't think this film needed to be 2 hours. 4.) Still Long and drawn out. 5.) Jon Stewart not even funny in the movie. 6.) Terrible Special Effects. How can Jurrassic Park do it better when it is 14 years older?\n\nThe Good 1.) Supporting cast of Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins and Jonah Hill. All were quite funny and delivered most of the few laughs that did come. Unfortunately, they are not seen often enough or focused on enough. 2.) Steve Carrell going beardo. Just looked funny.\n\nAs can be seen, the bad clearly outweighs the good. However, there is one good I have not mentioned yet, and is what gives this movie a 6 rating instead of a 2.\n\n3.) One well timed extremely funny joke when they are on the boat. My face hurt from this joke. I was laughing for about five minutes straight. I can't say particularly why it was so funny, or if anyone else found it funny, but I was particularly tickled by this one.\n\nSo, back to the initial question. Was it worth the money? Personally, I would gladly pay 10 dollars to laugh so hard my face hurts, even if it only happens once in a movie. Maybe worth a rental or download, but not likely a buy."

        "review_title": "Evan Almighty",
        "review_detailed_main": "The only reason Evan Almighty sounded even remotely entertaining was the fact that it starred Steve Carell. Carell plays Evan Baxter, a recently elected congressman who finds himself commanded by God to build an ark. I generally hate a sequel that should have never been a sequel, like this movie. However, with Carell leading the way of a talented cast that includes; John Goodman (Chuck Long), Lauren Graham (Joan Baxter), Jonah Hill (Eugene), Molly Shannon (Eve Adams), Wanda Sykes (Rita Daniels), and, Oscar winner, Morgan Freeman (God), I couldn't pass it up. Fans of the hit NBC sitcom, The Office, will even see along with Carell that Ed Helms (Ed Carson) and Wayne Wilderson (Ark Reporter #6) find their way into this movie. Carell, however, stole the show. He provides his usual comedic brilliance and brings life to a soft and predictable script.\n\nThe unrealistic story line was too light for most of the movie. It seemed like I was watching a movie that I had watched 20 times before. A father spends too much time with work, his family gets sad, some unfathomable situation presents itself, family leaves, family returns, blah, blah, blah, and they live happily ever after. And Baxter's kids! Man, give me a break. It looked like the lineup for the next 7th Heaven more than kids that even bore a slight resemblance to Steve Carell. Come on people, these are the same kids in every movie with their floppy little heads. And is there a story line model that production companies use when they need to put out a movie quick? This movie makes me think there is. All I'm asking for is a little creativity people. Is that too much to ask for? I shouldn't rip this movie up too bad. What would I expect from a family comedy about a modern days Noah's Ark. I would much rather watch this movie than a comedy riddled with the same poop and fart jokes over and over again. One thing I like is that I could actually sit down with my entire family and watch this. I don't think I heard a single swear word throughout the whole movie.\n\nI thought Jonah Hill's performance as Eugene, Baxter's intern, was laugh out loud funny. There's something about Hill that just makes me laugh every time I look at him. Eugene's admiration for the Congressman was so creepy that it was awkwardly funny. It was nice to see John Goodman again, although his character's script didn't showcase his full talents and left me wanting more. I think that this movie could have been a lot funnier if Molly Shannon had played Baxter's wife and not Lauren Graham. Graham was good, but Carell and Shannon could have really hit it off. This movie could have also been a whole lot better if somebody else would have written the script. The jokes were usually predictable. And that stupid dance that Baxter kept doing throughout the movies entirety needs to go. It was like a chipmunk having a seizure while trying to do the Macarena. The actors' performances are what made it funny. Not the jokes.\n\nOur nation was founded under God and this movie makes you think how far we've fallen from that as a society. The importance of family togetherness is also another fading virtue in the U.S. These are two great messages that need to be emphasized more often. I did get a good vibe from this movie, which was nice. This movie was definitely geared towards a family audience. If you're not in to good old, light hearted fun humor, then you should stay away. If you were expecting a Michael Scott performance from Carell then you might be disappointed. But if you appreciate him for the magnificence of his remarkable talent, or if you want to relax and just watch a fun movie for everyone, here's your ticket.\n\nI didn't expect much coming into this so it was hard to be let down. And despite all the downfalls I actually liked it. Given the right roles, I believe Steve Carell could be recognized as one of the finest actors of our time. This was not the role that will do that. This movie is worth renting, but if you want to buy it, wait until it goes on clearance."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you've seen Bruce Almighty, this sequel just doesn't live up. Evan Almighty is a modern retelling of the story about Noah's ark. Evan is asked to build an ark and save the animals and his neighbors from an impending flood. Morgan Freeman resumes his role as God in this sequel, but he offers forth a lot less advice and wisdom. Steve Carell as Evan Baxter does okay, but his style of humor is very dry and he didn't really carry the movie. Lauren Graham plays the wife of Evan as Joan Baxter. Lauren's character could've been plucked off of an episode of Gilmour Girls. She doesn't exhibit any great acting skills and she never really is convincing as Evan's loving wife. This movie is centered around a family, but it lacks the chemistry of a loving family. John Goodman as Congressman Long lacks any jovial qualities, so overall you get a dry witted comedy that isn't very captivating or inspiring.\n\nGod is more of a sadist in this movie actually forcing his will onto Evan rather than letting him make the choice based upon faith. This is not the God from the Christian Bible. With the exception of two lines of wisdom, this movie is really just an excuse to watch them build an ark and populate it with animals.\n\nAll the funniest lines are provided by Wanda Sykes playing Rita. If not for her, it would be hard to even describe the movie as a comedy.\n\nIn summary, this is one to rent. If you have a family with small kids, it might be worth buying but there are better movies out there for entertaining kids. It's only worth seeing in the theater if you feel like wasting an afternoon. The extra money you spend on popcorn might make you regret seeing it in the theater."

However, the character Evan Baxter didn't really appeal to me in Bruce. And really: sequels are usually a lot worse than the original concepts.\n\nHowever, I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, and that's mainly because of the much lighter approach. Bruce had a lot of embarrassing jokes (the 'monkey in the ass' gag being the worst), but Steve Carrell is just entertaining without being offensive. His reactions to everything that's happening are really funny and the whole biblical thing being converted to modern times ('Ark building for dummies!') makes me smile too. But there's still enough space for the more serious plot of the man standing up for what he believes is true, which carries the movie to a higher level than Bruce.\n\nAre there some downsides too? Yes, there are. The family-acting could be a lot better and Morgan Freeman should have gotten more screen time, but overall I just had a good evening and that's what it's all about. Evan Almighty is a worthy sequel, and God has nothing to be ashamed of :).\n\nP.S.: don't walk away immediately when the movie is finished. The dancing-video in the subtitles is hilarious!"

        "review_detailed_main": "You can't buy laughter. And you can't get a better of example of that than \"Evan Almighty.\"\n\nFueled by its publicity tagging it as the most expensive comedy ever made, the film sure did not skimp on visual effects... unfortunately, at the cost of anything resembling wit, intelligence and soul. And for a comedy, humor comes unfortunately sparse in the quasi-sequel to the 2003 Jim Carrey-starrer, reuniting director Tom Shadyac with \"Bruce Almighty\" co-star Steve Carell.\n\nFormer anchorman Evan Baxter (Carell)leaves Buffalo, New York for a congressional campaign that would have him and his family move up to a Virginian suburb. But as soon as the family settles at their new home, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan and tells him to build an ark in preparation for a flood. Short of breaking down after pairs of animals keep on following him to the most awkward places - not to mention facial hair growing faster than you can say \"BeeGees\" - Evan soon gets to work with his three sons much to the worriment of his wife (Lauren Graham) who believes her husband is undergoing a midlife crisis.\n\nBusily going for something with environmental awareness twist to a classic Sunday School story, the film sorely lacks the requisite laughs. Carell is as endearing as he was in \"The 40-Year Old Virgin\" but the material doesn't present anything genuinely funny for him to work with. Freeman is underutilized and is left to recite Hallmark-ready speeches most of the time. And the usual busy-father-has-no-time-for-children plays all too mawkishly that in inspires groan more than anything. You don't even have to have God's powers to see where the film is headed.\n\n\"Evan Almighty\" is proof that money can only go so much to make a good comedy - or a good movie for that matter. The special effects are good to look at but ultimately, the lack of funny moments leaves a film so dry Evan needs all the help he can get to convince that building an ark is justified."

People everywhere wrote that this movie was way too mild, but you just don't see a lot of films like this these days. It's kind of nice.\n\nWhat I didn't like: The drama in the film was a little too empowering for my taste. As the expression goes, you have to have drama to have comedy, but it really did get awful before it got better for the main character. The message of the movie was important, though.\n\nSo, basically: Mild? Yes. Good message? Absolutely. Give this a shot, I say. It's worth a solid rent."

What was the purpose of all the animals? What? They just appear and then go back home when it's all over?\n\nLauren Graham is one of the worst actors I've ever seen! She has no idea how to deliver a line and make it believable. And who was that ugly kid with all the lines? Even the great Morgan Freeman couldn't save this turkey!"

I wonder if the critics even know what a family film is supposed to be? Do they know they are making themselves irrelevant? I was watching a film review show on TV and as one of the critics was listing the reasons he hated it, one of the reasons was that it had a Christian message or something to that effect. I was flabbergasted. Are we supposed to hate films if they have a good underlying meaning or message? And the message isn't even specifically Christian, I believe the story of Noah and the ark was in the old testament, a book that pretty much is embraced by a lot of different religions. This particular critic was definitely taken down a few notches in my view. Having a good message should never be a reason to dislike and trash a film. This summer there seems to be nothing but bad news and tragic stories. A good, uplifting film was definitely worth seeing and my kid has already asked for the DVD when it comes out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow! I thought, going into this film based on what I heard the critics say, that I was in for a worst disaster than Gigli or something like that. True enough, Evan Almighty is not great. It's not real good or good either. It's not even Bruce Almighty to be sure. It is mildly(very mildly) entertaining. Steve Carrell is given the task of building an ark in a highly affluent neighborhood in the Chesapeake Valley. Tools arrive. Lumber arrives. Beards start to grow lushly and thickly on Carrell's face and the media circus arrives as Carrell is a newly appointed congressman from New York. Well, you get all the silly, nonsensical plot contrivances one would expect from something like this. You get the one-dimensional acting and the supposed comedic one-liners too. Carrell has some moments but his character, even though he is suppose to be dimensional, really isn't. Nor are his wife or children or the other cast members. John Goodman plays the heavy(literally and figuratively) with his usual aplomb and seems to be getting really comfortable in those shoes. Wanda Sykes is here too giving what Wanda Sykes gives. John Michael Higgins and Jonah Hill especially deliver the most amusing roles, but that really does not say much as the comedy here is pretty dire. Morgan Freeman playing God again appears to be here just for the paycheck. I am sure it was a heavenly experience for him! What we do get; however; after all the mediocrity and silliness that really isn't funny are some impressive scenes with many animals and one hell of an ark. The animals were used and trained to do all kinds of stuff. The film boasts the most REAL animals of any film ever made. The ark itself is equally impressive as it is real and built specifically for the film. I will say that the DVD extras are plentiful with many vignettes on the cast, the making of the ark, the animals, etc... I wasn't flooded with feelings of amusement or even glowing admiration after having seen Evan Almighty, but I was misted with a touch of entertaining mediocrity. I have seen so much worse. Much worse."

Freeman mostly smirks and smiles his way through the movie, always wearing all white ... and sometimes even a name tag! The comparisons to George Burns' God films are actually quite fun. While Burns and John Denver seem a bit dated now, the message really hasn't changed. One must face the scoffing masses if a stand is made for a belief ... doesn't matter if you are a Congressman (Carell) or a supermarket manager (Denver).\n\nJoel Cohen assisted director Steve Oederkirk on the story and certainly that explains some of the humorous bits, but mostly this is a film with a good heart, plenty of laughs and a nice message spelled ARK."

They spiced things up by forcing Evan to change his appearance, which added a little more relational conflict woth other characters, but I still found the second act boring. The third act saves it a little. It's got its own charge of tension and excitement, because I think the empathy with Evan has been build properly. But yeah, the movie's got a long problem in act 2."

Not only was Steve Carrel not so funny in this movie, the story looked as though it was written by a bunch of six year olds. The story was incredibly simplistic and to top it off there weren't even many good jokes in the movie. Not even the collaboration of Wanda Sykes, Steve Carrel and Morgan Freeman made the film better. Although this movie became a blockbuster breaking $100M, the makers should be ashamed for their undeserved success."

        "review_title": "Cute, But Not As Good As \"Bruce\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "In \"Evan Almighty,\" Steve Carell reprises his role as Evan Baxter from the movie \"Bruce Almighty.\" In this sequel, Evan - who in \"Bruce\" was a newscaster from Buffalo, and something of a nemesis to Bruce (and was featured in what was probably the funniest scene of that movie, when Bruce takes his revenge against him) - is elected to Congress and moves his family to Washington with high hopes of becoming powerful and influential, only to have his plans interrupted by God (again played by Morgan Freeman) who commands him to become a modern-day Noah by building an ark. While it's not a bad movie, \"Evan Almighty\" doesn't measure up to its predecessor, which was really quite good.\n\nOne of the problems with this movie, in my view, is that it stars Steve Carell. I have nothing against Carell. I've seen him in supporting roles in many films (\"Bruce Almighty,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and \"Anchorman\" leap to mind) and in those supporting roles I've always been impressed with him. This was the first time I've seen him as the lead, however, and I'm left to question whether he has the presence to be a lead actor. I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carrey (and sometimes find him a bit irritating actually) but Carrey has an on-screen presence about him that grabs you and pulls you into the film. That's one of the things that made \"Bruce\" work, in spite of the fact that there were several of the typically irritating things about Carrey featured in that movie. Carell just doesn't have that same presence. He was an actor playing a part - and he played it well enough - but he never grabbed me. I think he's a supporting actor - and a good one - but not a lead.\n\nThe story in \"Evan\" is also a different kind of story than was featured in \"Bruce.\" Beneath the comedy - and sometimes even ahead of it - \"Bruce\" had a serious undertone to it (I think of the rioting in the streets of Buffalo as an example) whereas \"Evan\" seemed to go for the cute angle. The animals following Evan all over the place come to mind as an example of this. This is much more of a family movie than \"Bruce\" was, which makes it a little more bland, in my opinion. Whether deliberate or not, I also thought that \"Bruce\" offered a much deeper reflection on a theological subject - the \"problem\" of unanswered prayer. There is theological reflection in \"Evan\" - how much are you willing to sacrifice to follow God (and Evan was asked to sacrifice a lot - his reputation, his credibility, possibly his family), but somehow that reflection also seemed lost in the attempt to make this a cute comedy. Evan's role was far different than Bruce's. Bruce got to play God with all the associated powers; Evan is clearly God's servant, which perhaps makes the title a little bit misleading. Evan was hardly \"almighty;\" the title serves no purpose other than to connect the movie to its predecessor. This different role perhaps also leads to a less interesting interplay between Evan and God than was featured between Bruce and God, and, perhaps related to that, I thought Morgan Freeman was underused - or perhaps badly used is a better way of putting it. The basic premise of the movie also seemed a bit preposterous. I found it hard to believe that a newly elected Congressman would be of so much interest to an apparently powerful veteran Congressman such as Long (John Goodman.) The supporting cast underwhelmed me. I've never much cared for Goodman and Lauren Graham as Evan's wife Joan added little. I have to say that Carell's makeup was great and totally believable, although after a while the whole Noah thing became a bit tired, and I had the cause of the \"flood\" figured out long before it happened.\n\nAs I said, this is not a bad movie, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. It's a pretty good family comedy; you can watch it with your kids, and you'll get a few laughs out of it. It's worth about 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the Jim Carrey hit comedy Bruce Almighty (2003) turned out to be surprisingly good, it was interesting to see if the charm would still be there in the sequel with the focus on a different lead character. The plot resembles the first movie but is larger in scale: former news anchor Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) has been elected to Congress and moves to a new fancy neighbourhood with his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) and their three kids. However, his budding career in politics is put on ice when he is approached by God himself (Morgan Freeman) and instructed to build a massive Ark for later use in case of a major flood that may or may not be expected in the near future.\n\nIt is strange how one actor can pull certain type of antics off while others can't. Maybe it is just that I am biased due to nostalgia (having grown up with Jim Carrey movies), but I think Carell's attempts of imitating Carrey's noisy rubber faced style come across as more irritating and unnatural than funny. Well, the preference of actors may be very subjective, but I don't think Evan Almighty really brings many new ideas to the table when it comes to the jokes or writing in general. The budget has obviously been bigger, as evidenced by the epic and surprisingly serious climax of the tale, but the humour is largely based on the protagonist's exaggerated reaction to his uncontrollably changing appearance; a plot line reminiscent of Christmas hit The Santa Clause from 1994. With a better comic actor in the lead role it could have worked, but now the supporting actors do much better jobs than the star: the calm Morgan Freeman is always good as expected, but Lauren Graham is pleasant to watch as well, even in a run-of-the-mill role like this one.\n\nThe underlying message of the movie is so completely predictable (\"stand up for your ideals\", \"believe in yourself\", \"family is important\" and, of course, \"God works in mysterious ways\") that it is difficult to get very excited about the story at any level. The dance montage over the end credits lightens the mood up a bit but it is hardly enough to make the whole runtime worthwhile. Personally, I would only recommend Evan Almighty to fans of Steve Carell, others may proceed at their own risk."

The problem with Evan Almighty is that it is none of these things. In the original Steve Carell played an annoying supporting character, but it worked because his character was supposed to be annoying. The problem here is that Carell's character is still annoying, and he's the main character! The result is an unfunny main character, an unfunny script with an unfunny plot that just doesn't have the depth of the original at all. Young kids might like it, but the film distances itself from them too by including politics heavily in the plot. I think I laughed twice in the whole film."

Although Carrell has talent and charm he is lumbered with a weak script so is left frantically trying to re-create the magic of the first film.\n\nWhereas the first film had a more adult feel Evan Almighty goes for a family audience but misses the mark here as well. Morgan Freeman is given more of a role and Lauren Graham is believable as Evan's wife Joan.\n\nCarrell alone cannot save this film nor help it recoup its massive budget. Perhaps worth watching once but you won't be rushing to see it again as it proves to be an almighty flop."

But it looked like it would be cute, so we went to see it.\n\nThere are scenes that are quite funny and there are some touching scenes as well. Is it a deep, thought-provoking movie? Of course not, and it doesn't purport to be that.\n\nIt was obvious that the beard, long hair and biblical-style robes were to give a huge contrast between the news anchor/congressman Evan and the Evan who realized the importance of doing what God asked. We see a scene where Evan is primping (close ups of cutting out nostril hair - yuck!) before he reports to Congress his first day. That Evan was very much appearance oriented - bought the \"right\" house, a Hummer is the \"right\" vehicle, clothes and hair have to be perfect. He gave lip service to caring about his family but didn't really follow through with anything unless it was work related. Then God comes into the picture, and Morgan Freeman is as wonderful as he always is (yes, I'm a fan). Evan would have continued to ignore God's request if his appearance hadn't gone out of his control and if the animals hadn't started showing up.\n\nThis movie was somewhat predictable, but who cares? The animals were fun, Wanda Sykes got to put in a few zingers, Morgan Freeman made some very wise statements and the \"bad guy\" got his. What's not to like? To people who have a problem with all things religious oriented will also have a problem with this. However, it wasn't preaching particular beliefs. The major message that I saw related to the importance of family, being kind and being a responsible steward of this planet. Again, I don't see any of those being objectionable.\n\nWill I go see this again at the theater? No, but I don't see other movies multiple times at the theater. Will I recommend it to others? Yes. Will I watch it again when it is on TV? Yes."

        "review_title": "Frustratingly tame comedy",
        "review_detailed_main": "The creative team behind Evan Almighty really should have been able to make a better film. Starring one of America's favourite funnymen and helmed by Ace Ventura Pet Detective director Tom Shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. Hell even Steve Oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious Barnyard, and attains a writing credit here has done better work. The fact of the matter is that Evan Almighty isn't the worst picture of the Summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. The title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's Bruce Almighty. That picture had Jim Carrey in the lead, and whilst both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. I've heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. Thus Shadyac moved over to Carell, who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. After sleeper hits The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine the man has become big business, and so it's him rather than rubber faced Jim who leads this production into theatres. The story see's Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) having been elected as a Congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so Evan can find success with his job. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards Evan, who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. However things start to go belly up fairly fast, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an Ark. Initially ignoring the encounter, Evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. Evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow Politician (John Goodman). Anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of Tom Shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and hell even Bruce Almighty where largely very funny pictures, but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats Jim Carrey's presence. Shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without Carrey at the helm, he's worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but still only Carrey seems to meld successfully with Shadyac. Carell after the disappointing Box-Office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again, and with Carrey now doing more serious projects Shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. Carell himself is fairly dull here, whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (Despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. I expect after Bruce Almighty's Box-Office draw it was Universal studios themselves, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud, and thats exactly the case with Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham isn't any great shakes as Evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. Freeman lets it all hang loose as God in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. Indeed the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's Secretary (Wanda Sykes) and creep co-worker (Jonah Hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedekerk's writing has been worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. The film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds, indeed the opening church sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion harder than Evan Almighty's whole 95 minute run. With a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. I don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film, but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. There's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile, a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side off. Maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch, but I can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy."

It's not an extreme improvement, but I definitely preferred this film to the first.\n\nIt's far more like 'The Santa Clause' (1994) than 'Bruce Almighty', with Evan taking over 'Noah's' (You may remember him from such books as The Bible) responsibilities and growing in to him to save the day \"One Small Act Of Kindness At A Time\".\n\nI haven't always been a fan of Steve Carell, who plays Evan, because he can be a bit much at times, but for the most part he wasn't too bad here and he was definitely more enjoyable than Jim Carrey was. That chest rug was pretty impressive too. I'm lead to believe that it was real and not CGI'd too.\n\nIt did seem to miss out on a lot of opportunities for jokes. With all of those animals on set, there were plenty of funny things that they could have done, especially as one of Evan's sons had an interest in critters, the focus seemed to be on Evan's transformation instead.\n\nHowever, it was a simple story and probably slightly less adult than 'Bruce' meaning that it is more accessible for family viewing. I could watch it with my Nan or with my Nephew, if my Nan hadn't passed away and my nephew was ever at home, but you get the point.\n\nI don't need to rush to watch it again and I will probably only come back to it in years to come, as I see it whilst flicking through the TV, but I wouldn't be adverse to watching it every week if I suddenly had a child that was obsessed with it (The chance would be a fine thing). It really is that inoffensive.\n\nIt's kind of a middle of the road type film, not outstanding, but not tiresome either.\n\n621.29/1000."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh Mr. Carell! How far you've fallen! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. Although THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN was entertaining, it was dwarfed by his \"Sunshine\" character. Hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might await me here. Not much...\n\nGiven the trite and clich\u00e9d script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. Poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current U.S. administration's take on the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.\n\nNearly every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and The Ark. God's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family, and two of each of His creatures on Earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. It was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).\n\nSo why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? The simple answer is that He never would. Too much emphasis was given to U.S. government policy and not enough on world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and Ameri-centric film. Although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.\n\nJohn Goodman (CARS) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.\n\nThe only funny moments are between Carell and the animals, especially as Evan learns what animal magnetism is REALLY like. Birds literally flock to him. Sheep herd around him. Lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).\n\nThe special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). The \"flood\" was interesting in that the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and shoved in just the right direction.\n\nBut other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect."

It's hard for me to explain why. Still, he was very funny. If you ask me, he was just as funny as God was. There is only one thing about this film that made me feel uncomfortable, and that is are Evan growing a pointy beard. I also felt a little weird, too.

Suddenly, God interferes his ambitions and gives him a mission - to build an arc. Imagine how boring can congressman office and building a wooden arc be. It was exactly like that.

Even though the story might seem to run along rather quickly at some instances, I can't quite be sure why this film doesn't have that high of ratings (I'm talking to you, Rotten Tomatoes!).

The special effects, especially involving the animals, are impressive and add to the film's whimsical charm.\n\nHowever, the plot is quite predictable and lacks the originality that made its predecessor so appealing.

He is 'Evan', a newly elected congressman who just after moving his family into a fancy new house in northern Virginia, is summoned by God to build an arc.\n\nThe storyline is predictable, especially with the bad guy (John Goodman) and the damn foreshadowed early on. Johnah Hill was a bit of a surprise here, the continual hair/beard growing as Evan turns into Noah is funny, all the animals following him around and helping him build the arc are neat/ fun (again for family audiences) as is I suppose the message being promoted of random acts of kindness.\n\nMake sure to watch the closing credits, the cast and crew dancing is hilarious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) has left his job as Buffalo, New York's lead anchorman for Channel 7 news and has now won a bid as a Congressman from the city. Evan along with his wife Joan (Lauren Graham), and three sons Dylan (Johnny Simmons) the eldest, Jordan (Graham Phillips) the middle son, and Ryan (Jimmy Bennett) the youngest move to Prestige Crest in Virginia for Evan's new job. Evan finds himself approached by senior congressman Chuck Long (John Goodman) for the opportunity to co-sponsor Long's Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act which leads to a sizable time commitment from Evan leading to delaying spending time with his family. After praying to God to give him the power to change the world, mysterious packages containing old tools and bundles of lumber are sent to Evan from Alpha and Omega Hardware. The sender is eventually revealed to be God (Morgan Freeman) who assigns Evan the task of building an Ark. As the pressures of building the Ark mount Evan finds himself pulled in multiple directions.\n\nFollowing the success of Bruce Almighty becoming the fifth highest grossing film of 2003, Universal was keen on continuation. A screenplay titled The Passion of the Ark written by Bobby Florsheim and Josh Stolberg became the subject of a multi studio bidding war with Sony Pictures eventually acquiring the spec script for $2.5 million, then a record for a screenplay from unproduced writers. Universal made a deal with Sony to co-produce the script as a sequel to Bruce Almighty with Steve Oedekerk who re-wrote the first film assigned to re-write the sequel only for the studio to discard the script entirely and have Oedekerk start from scratch. Carrey was asked to reprise his role as Bruce for the film but declined due to being uninterested in reprising characters and when it became clear Carrey wasn't going to agree director Tom Shadyac convinced Steve Carell to reprise his role as Evan Baxter with the film being repurposed as a spin-off. The film was authorized with a budget of $140 million becoming the most expensive comedy ever made, and coupled with set construction costs, the scale and enormity of the visual effects, and the issues involved with filming and caring for the various animals the final budget for Evan Almighty was estimated at somewhere between $175-200 million to the point Sony got cold feet on the project and handed control entirely over to Universal. Universal defended the costs as the film was designed as a \"four quadrant tentpole\" so the broad commercial appeal justified the budget size. The film was made with a PG rating as opposed to the PG-13 of the original film, and was more specifically targeted towards families and church going crowds with its marketing. Upon release the film received negative reviews from critics and despite opening at the top of the box office, Evan's $31 million opening weekend was considering less from Bruce's $67 million and the film fizzled out with a final world wide total of $174 million making the film a substantial loss for Universal. While none of the cast were affected as all of their careers continued with no repercussions, Tom Shadyac's deal with Universal was terminated shortly thereafter and to date Shadyac has not directed a major tentpole or studio comedy since. Evan Almighty isn't offensively awful like some Carrey-less sequels, but it's also not very good either.\n\nDespite Steve Carell reprising his role as Evan Baxter, the character has had his edges considerable filed down in order to make him a relatable \"family comedy everyman\" including retconning the character into having a loving family with three sons. This is a major problem with the movie because much of the humor in this film is derived from Evan being subjected to various humiliations and indignities foisted upon him by God such as being followed and pestered by animals, having his beard grow uncontrollably similar to the gag from The Santa Clause, or forcing Evan to wear only biblical robes. While I wasn't the biggest fan of Bruce Almighty, at least the underlying core of that film made sense in trying to teach Bruce some kind of lesson about humanity and having a personal locus of control. In Evan Almighty it's like they took the feeling Bruce had of \"God being a kid with a magnifying glass and an anthill\" and building their premise out of that. While it's not unthinkable God doing this kind of stuff could be funny, Evan isn't presented as being unlikable enough to warrant being subjected to this kind of treatment especially since Evan is nowhere near as abrasive or jerky as he was in Bruce Almighty and aside from being a neat freak and driving a Hummer there's not much to Evan (aside from a stupid dance that's a running gag).\n\nEvan Almighty doesn't really have much in the way of laughs or humor to show for its $175 million+ budget and what chuckles we get from the cast are purely from delivery and not from writing. But while Evan Almighty doesn't bring the funny, it does bring elaborate sets, large scale animal choreography and visual effects galore...none of which are funny. Whenever visual effects are used in this movie, they're not used in service of anything humorous or silly (with the exception of a multitude of poop jokes) but rather they're in service of creating scenes of either awe or devastation. A big reason for this movie's ballooned budget was the climactic flood sequence involving the Ark going through DC (which begs the question of why there are two of every animal if the world isn't flooding) and while impressive looking it's not funny nor does it feel like it's trying to be.\n\nEvan Almighty is just a waste of money. It's a comedy that isn't funny but at least it's not overly painful like certain other comedies I've seen. There's a reason family audiences ditched this movie in favor of Ratatouille, because that film had beautiful visuals AND humor and this film is a comedy with no major laughs and just pretty visuals."

The interesting part about the firts one was that Jim Carrey's character had the freedom to do whatever he wanted with God's powers, but he later founds out, also the responsibilities, and through the movie we watch him grow up \"spiritually\" or however you might want to call it. Here, he has to do a job (Noah's job). And keep \"believing\" that it all makes sense. Having faith. That's it. And once he finds that faith, the film loses the little it had.\n\nAnyways, the most criminal part of this movie is that it lacks laughs. It's just not nearly close to fun enough. It might be cute to some, because of the amount of animals and all, but it's just not funny.\n\nIn the end, it just wastes one of my favorites comedians (if not my favorite), that also himself doesn't seem too bothered to try anything strionic to give life to a continuation of boring scenes that drives you to the end of this terrible movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I quite enjoyed the original \"Bruce Almighty\" movie which centred on a then-at-his-peak Jim Carrey, where Steve Carell's Evan Baxter was a supporting character. This revisiting of the idea of Morgan Freeman's white-suited God picking another hapless human to carry out his instructions and so avert a great disaster while of course coincidentally re-connect with his wife and family, is diminished by its return, although early in the movie there is some palatable humour and while the ending is highly contrived, there is still some C-Gen SFX to catch the eye.\n\nCarell, whose career-profile in Hollywood as risen as Carrey's has fallen their earlier \"Almighty\" appearances, does his best to carry the film, but that feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu from the plotting from before, is off-putting. However, the film deliberately isn't as racy as Carrey's Bruce outing, not necessarily a bad thing but the urge for going for the family audience, or at least the mawkish sentimentality which accompanies it certainly shoukd have been resisted.\n\nIt's really a movie of two halves, Carell's gradual morphing in the first half into a modern- day Noah, head-to-toe air and robe to match, is fairly humorous but the second half founders as it strives for spectacle and adventure, at the expense, unfortunately, of the laugh count.\n\nStill, Carell as I said, is pleasantly engaging, Morgan Freeman earns an easy pay-day as God Part 2 and John Goodman, bad toupee and all (I'm guessing it was deliberate) gets to ham it up as a self-aggrandising politician.\n\nThe film is definitely at the featherweight end of the light entertainment scale, but as undemanding family fun goes, it did its job."

Despite its shortcomings, Evan Almighty has moments of genuine humor and a positive message about faith and environmental stewardship. The cast, including Lauren Graham and John Goodman, delivers enjoyable performances, but the film's ambitious scope and heavy-handed delivery may leave audiences with mixed feelings."

The movie is only saved by the comedic talents of Steve Carell, thanks to whom the movie does have some fun gags. Most of them you'll see in the trailer though so I'll leave it up to you If you'd find this movie a waste or time or not. For me, I don't mind the movie as background noise when it is already on TV, but it would never occur to me to watch it from my own will. I don't mind watching it, but there are some major problems.\n\nThe first one is right there in the title. They wanted to let the audience know that this was related to the better received Bruce Almighty, but the problem is that Evan isn't indeed \"Almighty\". Evan is LARPing Moses from the bible, but is not allpowerful god as Bruce was.\n\nThe Moses Larping is also problematic. It is very clear that they wanted to make a movie where the character of Evan builds an Arch and some animal related gags. Those are OK, but the problem is that they failed to come up with a compelling reason for all this. When said Arch should have saved the inhabitants of the urban area that is flooded, then what was the point of bringing Elephants and Lamas from god knows where on board? They could have had a valid reason by showing us a Zoo in the neighborhood, but they couldn't be bothered. And the endgame of the story isn't some personal growth, a moral lesson but something about real estate law. Let's not pretend that Bruce Almighty is some sort of masterpiece, but compared to this movie it is. It's title and plot while simple, at least makes a remote kind of sense. Here the plot is bult around the idea of having a dude turn into Moses and build an arch? Why? Who cares...\n\nThis lack of effort makes the movie feels forced and ultimately forgettable. Viewing the Box Office results, the movie didn't even break even, which is not surprising at all."

John Goodman plays the bad guy. I was distressed about watching it, but the flick gave a pleasant surprise and had a good amount of humor. It also had a lot of heart. I highly recommend it! 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think most people would agree that 'Evan Almighty' isn't a patch on the original 'Bruce' film, but judging it on its own merits, this is a fairly average family movie and certainly not the disaster that some reviewers and critics have made it out to be. Okay, it's nothing special and it's nowhere near as funny or imaginative as its predecessor, but for entertainment value it isn't that bad.\n\nSteve Carrell is good as Evan, but he's certainly no Jim Carrey, who has an effortless ability to get laughs out of any material. The plot is original but also predictable and typical of a family film, with by far the best part of the film being its ending. It makes the very average first three-quarters of the film worthwhile with some brilliant special effects and cinematography. 'Evan Almighty' is an average family adventure film. It's certainly not as good as its predecessor but also not as bad as some would have you believe."

Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His children don't really add anything to the movie. They seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous.\n\nI found the original to be a decent movie. Disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere."

The difference is this one didn't seem like it was going to be horrible and fail, nor did it seem like a desperate cash in on the previous films name. It seemed to have some form of dignity, as the others did not. It starred Steve Carell and returning as the man upstairs Morgan Freeman.\n\nThe result is a film that has some heart but few laughs. It relies a lot on Carell and it just seemed too big a film for him to handle, nor did it seem like something he was comfortable with. Following in Jim Carry's footsteps is not something you want to do and it seems that the first film overshadows this one.\n\nThe jokes aren't fresh and throwing in The Santa Clause is just one of many reasons. The instant growing of the beard was funny in 1994, but using this same joke in 2007 just seems stale. I wanted to like this film, but it made it really hard to do so.\n\nI did enjoy the animals though and some scenes did come off as smarter then I thought this film would be capable of. Specifically the scene involving Freeman and Lauren Graham in a diner.\n\nThe CGI wasn't horrible, but obvious with a lot of animals, also why do all these animals even need to be on the Ark? When you watch the film and you see what happens at the end it doesn't make sense. More then half of these animals do not live in the wild in Washington.\n\nSkip this one unless you really have nothing better to do, it just too average and not really funny. I think it's just too family friendly."

Even funnier is the idea of using for dummies guide (lol) of making an ark is totally crazy and hilarious . But the final idea of making an ark tha stops in front of the capitol /white house for a very short route of less than 20 miles (???) inside the city is really extremely much for nothing even for stopping a federal law.\n\nLaugh wise:OK Logic wise : much below zero My money back please!

Afterwards, his dialog is cut very short and he mostly shown haphazardly reacting to situations.\n\nThe storyline is also a bit depressing and tired: a generally good-natured person who comes into good fortune has to give it all up to serve some societal good. How wonderfully fun.\n\nThe original \"Bruce Almighty\" worked better simply because Jim Carrey excessively over-reacts to things and his body language is kind of dialog in itself. Steve Carrel is more reserved in his body language and needs the dialog to set up his trademark \"surprised\" facial reactions.\n\nIf you're a Carrel fan, you're main enjoyment will be at the beginning of the film. For everyone else, there's simply not enough good material here to recommend watching it."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Evan Almighty",
        "review_detailed_main": "Surprisingly, Evan Almighty is not a comedy per se. A sequel to the Jim Carrey movie Bruce Almighty, where Steve Carrell played a television journalist Evan Baxter - the one with the rubbery face giving Jim a run for his own money, this movie is sans Jim, and Steve is thrust into the leading role, with writer Steve Oedekerk (the one who gave us androgynous Barnyard cows) providing Evan Baxter a fast track in his career, to that of a newly elected Congressman.\n\nWhat Evan Almighty is, is serious family drama. For anyone out there working hard (read: workaholic), this story is a reminder on the finer, more important things in life, and that is family ties, and never to neglect your kids as they are growing up. To anyone bringing home the bacon like Evan Baxter (and to feed that fuel guzzler of a vehicle), these work-life balance scenarios are sometimes more myth than can be actually achieved. Building his campaign on the promise of Changing the World, he now has to deliver those election vows, much to the dismay of his wife and kids whom he had uprooted and moved to new suburbia.\n\nAnd like The Willow Tree - not that this movie is as classic as that - be careful what you wish for from the Old Man upstairs, as sometimes he has a strange sense of humour, or wanting to teach you how to fish rather than grant you that fish himself. Ask and you shall receive, but you know not in what form that wish will come in. There's a poignant moment, for those who make requests from time to time, that the Almighty provides an opportunity for you to achieve something, rather than providing you with that something without you earning for it, or presenting it on a silver platter. Miracles don't come easy nor cheap these days.\n\nMorgan Freeman reprises his role as God. One of my favourite character actors, I felt he has immense presence in whatever roles he takes on, and it's no wonder he's given this manifestation of the supreme being. There was a slight tongue-in-cheek moment in the story where he referred himself as a storyteller of sorts, and those who have followed Freeman's career roles (I've only done so for the last 25 years or so), would know that's a reference to his days as the Easy Reader on the Electric Company.\n\nThanks to 40 Year Old Virgin, we do know Steve Carrell is kind of hairy, and as Evan Baxter turns into Noah, this wealth of hair comes into great use. But Steve's not Jim, and the story doesn't allow Steve to exhibit any kind of physical comedy, unless you count the repeated falling from heights funny, or his trying his darndest best to escape from animals who come calling, making him seem like a reel alternative to Eddie Murphy's Dr Doolittle. It takes while for Evan to finally resign himself to God's commandment, and that actually doomed the movie to some uninspiring scenes just going through the motions, which the trailers have more than covered with the skeptics doubting and mocking Evan as Noah. Even Steve's little crazy jig expires after a while.\n\nThe supporting cast of John Goodman, Lauren Graham from the Gilmore Girls, and Wanda Sykes all seem to be playing caricatures, and amongst the three, Sykes unfortunately turned out to be the most irritating of the lot, spouting one-liners so bad, you'll cringe in your seat. But one-dimensional characters aside, Evan Almighty did boast some nicely done, especially when you see the ark in its final glory and gets put into some use, reminiscent however of a turkey of a movie in Speed 2: Cruise Control.\n\nEvan Almighty could probably join the list of sequels that shouldn't be made, but tear away its association with its predecessor, it might work as a standalone given the strong human emotions, and its cursory statements on environmental issues should it be paid more attention to. Saving the earth, saving the animals are contemporary themes these days, and with the reminder on performing Acts of Random Kindness, there are moments when watching the movie that you'll nod your head in concurrence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whats it about Evan Almighty, in which Steve Carell, playing a newly elected congressman from Buffalo, is commanded by God (Morgan Freeman).\n\nFrom news anchor to congressman the why and how is never explained but the logic in this movie is as thin as a rake, like in Bruce almighty its never establish what kind of religion our characters follow but we know they pray,one of the issues in the movie is the relationship between Evan and his family,he never has time to spend with them, the man is in congress he is not going to work his not going to work from nine to five Monday to Friday this work demands a lot of time so his family has to be very naive or very possessive,so after God delivers Wood and tools he reveals he wants Evan to build an ark there is a flood coming,he doesn't agree at first because if he did it wouldn't be so funny so Evan is chased by animals making any excuse to build a bad joke.\n\nAfter God makes it clear he wants Evan to build the ark, he starts to look like Noah for reasons,beard White hair and robes making him look like a homeless persons possibly affecting his job and everyone around him thinking his crazy, so as the ark is finished in quick movie montage Evan summons all the animals,most of them that are not from the Buffalo area or any area in the west hemisphere, so the flood comes and all the people in the area get in the ark, at this point i have a lot of questions in my mind that i probably will not find any answers to , such as why did all those animals need to be in the ark only the residents in that \u00e1rea would be affected, it was a local incident a lot of those animals would still exist, but I'm just running my mind at this point, so the day is safe Evan gets to spend time with his family.\n\nThis movie doesn't have a solid plot point, its not about a guy getting the powers of God, its not about him getting to establish a good relationship with his family because it barley touches it,everything he dose is because his forced to thats it, The reason that this film exists is to cash in the success of the previous one, its a hit and miss only if your a hardcore fan of Carell you could probably give it a watch"

This is the story of a congressman whose career is going strong and whose social status keeps rising, but lacks that which is most important in his life: family chemistry and strength. He tries hard but fails badly at satisfying on both fronts. One day, he meets 'God', who has a mission for him. The film does a great job at being inspired by a previous film, 'Bruce Almighty', while never being anything of a mere sequel, and while standing alone on its own. There is great depth in this film in that Evan is chosen to do a job of biblical proportions, in a pragmatic world that believes in nothing but power and money, and that through this trying adversity, is the coming together of a family, that finally finds love. The dialog is very subtle in places: I remember especially when God talks to Evan's wife in the restaurant, very deep. It's not surprising the cinema people wouldn't like this film that much, although it is certainly troubling. Very solid film, very well written, original, well acted out, strong from start to finish makes for a smooth viewing with humor, depth and, for once, a true message."

Plenty of charm, awesome cast, phenomenal coincidences, and just nice entertainment for 96 minutes. Easy to bash but not as cheesy as Tooth Fairy that I watched previously. For a movie that has tremendous connections to the Bible and a little bit of 40 Year Old Virgin it's a so good to me I've always enjoyed even 15 years ago!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I read through a stream of hateful reviews by people who frankly were threatened by the unabashed use of biblical tropes, most of whom didn't even try to veil the intent or motive of their discomfort.\n\nThis movie is a funny, family film for people of all creeds with a feel-good approach and packs in star-power. If you are religious, it's an intelligent homage to a story you have heard many times. In some cases can be thought provoking and exemplary of the modern challenges of being a god fearing individual within a vessel of Judeo-Christian lore, but should be approachable for any religion and does so without being preachy. It may very well have more to offer for those that are not previously exposed to these tropes, and our not threatened by the notion of a God.\n\nFor those that aren't or consider themselves a non-believer, all the same, in a world of larger than life super heroes dominating our ideas of what is supernatural and coupled with their ability to captivate all viewers- the various depictions and biblical interactions can be explained away by an intelligent parent that understands the use of parable in literature and film as a way to teach a lesson as opposed to some veiled attempt to convert you which it rigidly is not. In this sense, while much lighter fare than a Marvel epic I see no reason why the same suspense of disbelief for Evan Almighty would suddenly be unwarranted."

The acting was very good, the costumes, it just felt and seemed genuine.

We were most impressed with the writers who lined up Genesis 6:14 in the story line, as well as A.R.K. One \"act of random kindness\" at a time.

It's got a great message about sticking by the ones you love, keeping family together, having enough faith to do the impossible, and conserving our planet. Overall, it was a great feature.

Director Tom Shadyac has come up with a film that offends no one and anyone can come away with a great belly laugh and a good feeling all at the same time. The American Family has been shown to be at it's weakest when the children begin to question the logic of one or both of the parents. In Evan Almighty it is the father who begins to throw caution to the wind to gain back the trust and faith of his three sons. His wife questions his strange back to nature methods until she too joins the family tree. Here in the family is 'reborn' and the laughter never stops! The humor in Evan Almighty is most similar to the film, The Incredibles. While your children are laughing at one joke, you as an adult will be laughing at the punch line which follows the previous jocularity. Your children will believe you are laughing at the same joke that they are but the pun is on them. Parnethood puns partiality preclude precise palindrome. In other words let us all enjoy a good bit of tomfoolery at the movies and let no one be the target of the joke!"

I enjoyed Bruce Almighty, but found the sexuality a bit much for my grade school age daughter. She is ten now, and there wasn't a single time I cringed or worried about what she saw or heard. I can't remember the last time I could say that about a PG film.\n\nThe jokes were funny for many age levels, and the resolution was a bit of surprise. We will see it again, and will likely purchase this film when it appears on DVD.\n\nI highly recommend it for Steve Carell fans, and for Christians who want family fare."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, Bruce Almighty was one of a kind, good and funny. Evan Almighty is not Bruce Almighty, we gathered that. Question, why would we expect it to be? For once I am glad this movie took a slightly different direction to be something more than a mere sequel, and I believe they have totally done it. It doesn't even feel like there was a Bruce Almighty before it, if it wasn't for Morgan Freeman who is always great to see. And yes, Steve Carrell is not Jim Carrey, yet who cares? Jim Carrey is good but he is overrated. I don't like Steve Carell really , and wasn't expecting much from him or this movie to be honest after having seen this summer's sequels and \"blockbusters\", but boy am I glad to be able to come in here and leave a positive comment.\n\nThis movie totally did it for me. Maybe it wasn't as funny as B.A. but it was funny enough. It was well built, the script and the plot felt complete enough, the acting was very good, the effects great. Most importantly, I followed the entire movie without being annoyed or getting bored, and I even laughed a lot. And the ending, oh I just loved the ending. The kind of climax that Superman Returns so desperately needed but lacked poorly. Now, there were some little things that raised questions or seemed forced, like \"How come there were so many kinds of animals just in that specific forest; while it was obvious that only that area was in need of saving, and not all the animals or beings of the world\". But, that's the kind of things you can let slip by, 'cause it's just not that relevant.\n\nI had read bad reviews about it beforehand, and wasn't expecting much, but they were really wrong. I am not afraid of going too far when I say that even though I liked all the other great movies of this summer like Pirate of the Caribbean 3, or Spiderman 3, or Fantastic 4 etc, they lacked what this movie gave me, a feeling of completion and satisfaction. I was able to honestly say in the end: \"I liked it\" which I haven't said once this summer. I don't know why so many people are giving bad reviews about this film; it's a good one and they're just being too harsh and expecting I don't know what.\n\nGo see this movie and try to enjoy it without prejudice. Trust me, you will.\n\nIn the end; I would give this movie a 7.5 or 8 score but only because I think most of the bad reviews in here are unfair, I'm giving it a 9.\n\nTung!"

I must say this is one of those movies that is funnier the second time you watch it. It is more for children than adults. There are jokes that only adults will understand, but there is maybe only one that could be offensive. It is also a great way to educate your child about the bible. I think it is a great way to bond with a family member of any kind. The animals in the movie are very well trained and the visual effects are outstanding. If you liked Bruce Almighty, then you will enjoy this movie. If your looking for a movie that will make you laugh and leave the theater happy, then this is a sure bet."

It's not an edgy, fast-paced, pure comedy but it's a genuinely likable, sweet, and funny parable that I absolutely loved. The negative reviews could have to to with the expectations for a film with such a big budget; the critics may have been expecting something more Star Wars-ish with guffaws. Oh, well. I hope the movie is successful in spite of the reviews, that people check it out for themselves and not rely of the critics to make that decision for them. Tom Shadyac and Steve Carell have taken a chance with a movie that has a universal spiritual message (IMHO) and doesn't have to cut anyone down to present it. Plus, it's just plain fun!"

Steve Carrell is outstanding and Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always. Wanda Sykes is very funny as well. It is rare to find a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy without one party being bored or offended. Don't let the negative reviews sway you - this movie is GREAT for all ages and has a nice message. (Not to mention a pretty funny dance sequence during the credits!)"

To be honest I actually enjoyed this more then Bruce Almighty, I think that it was an OK movie but it's not something I would want to watch again. Also I guess because this one had more of a story line. Like it was going somewhere with something. Steve Carell has come in to his own with the movies he's done and now people are really looking at him. It's still hard to believe he was a rent a cop in Sleepover and now he's making million dollar films. Lauren Graham is always a delight to watch on screen. She's very natural and funny and just plays it so real. They casted the kids great and their characters were not overlooked. The animals were adorable and you can't just go in to this movie thinking it's all about religion. It is but there's a bigger picture to it. If you didn't like the movie because of whatever reason then fine, no ones asking you to like it. Myself and several thousands others did enjoy this film and saw it as a true jewel. Definitely recommend for the family!~!"

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed many of the other summer hits, such as those by Judd Apatow, but this was a refreshing change from those kinds of movies. I would definitely take my young kids to this one. You don't need to be Christian to enjoy this movie, but maybe it would aid in your appreciation of it. For a family-themed story, the jokes are appropriate, the language is appropriate, and the length is also appropriate. Great movie!"

Steve Carell did a good job, even though once or twice he got on my nerves. He was pretty funny. I think the funniest parts of the film is when Wanda Sykes is in it. She is made me laugh the most.

        "review_detailed_main": "How fun, how humorous, entertaining, and religiously funny is Evan Almighty? Once again, professional critics have missed the boat on a comedy. I go to the movies to have a good time\u0085critics go to harshly critique. And truth be told, it is easier (for me, at least) to write negativity than positively. However, why rip apart a movie which is so genuinely fun to watch? Back in 2003, director Tom Shadyac (Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty- lots of Jim Carrey films) brought us Bruce Almighty, a subtle yet fun comedy that featured a god-hating man, Bruce Nolan (Carrey), and the help he eventually receives from God, played by Morgan Freeman. Carrey takes out his anger on fellow newscaster Evan Baxter (Carrell), who snubbed him out of the anchor position. All this leaves Baxter as a walking joke of a man, which is where Bruce Almighty leaves off at.\n\nSome time more than four years must've past in between the movies for the character of Evan Baxter. From being an utter mockery after his joke-newscast in Bruce Almighty, Baxter begins Evan Almighty as a successful politician who is running for senator for the state of New York. His newly introduced (and very Hollywood-like) family support him fully with big fake smiles and very unnatural conversations and horrible dialogue. Something strange happens in the midst of all the good news for Congressman Baxter: messages of Genesis 6:14 start appearing wherever he goes or looks; a delivery man brings packages of wood to Baxter's home labeled as 614 Genesis; his alarm clock wakes him up at 6:14 AM; his new license plate reads GEN 614, and so on. (Incase you were unsure on what Genesis 6:14 is, it's a Bible verse about Noah's Ark.) It's good for a knee-slap or two. Or not. It will, however, bring a smile to your face. All of these odd events are topped off when Morgan Freeman appears in front of Baxter's house and explains just who he is: \"I am God.\" \"God\" tells Baxter that he must build an ark and save the city from the flood. The more Baxter puts off the task, the more signs of the flood start occurring. Animals of all sorts follow him everywhere. In a cute little scene, nearly every species of bird fly into Baxter's office. When his associates open the door to his office, they see the birds and Baxter's reaction. Funny stuff. In addition to the animals, Baxter also grows irreplaceable facial hair. Try as he may via shaving, none of the hair goes away. Just as a warning, prepare for some funny metro sexual jokes. Perhaps the funniest scene is when Baxter is delivered what appears to be torn robes. Donning them, Baxter resembles a cross between Noah and Jesus. He is a laugh-riot, even if you're not exactly laughing out loud.\n\nEvan Almighty is, at $175 million, the most expensive comedy ever. As one could guess, most of that money goes towards the high count of animals in the movie and the ending scene. With a budget like that, you would expect a crazy amount of special effects. We only get a few, if you don't count the real life animals. Thankfully, the movie didn't seem to be lacking without the excess effects. With an opening weekend of $32.1 million, it seems that the movie isn't on track to earn any money in return, which is a shame. Come on, people! Evan Almighty is fun in its on way, and is a movie that I would definitely recommend.\n\nGood) Carrell absolutely owns the screen, lots & lots of animals Bad) a bit immature at times, generic family painful to watch"

Some of the scenes with Evan and the animals and his dealing with his appearance were hilarious!"

Morgan Freeman does a great job as well in his role.\n\nIf you're not looking for complexity, but just want an uplifting, good-natured film this is a great choice. It also hits on the struggle a lot of us face of whether to listen to or ignore what you should REALLY be doing vs. what YOU think you should be doing.\n\nA movie with heart:\n\nToo many comedies these days go for shock or crudeness to impact the viewer. This movie is great in that it makes you laugh and feel good, not violated.\n\nA fun and refreshing movie. Recommended."

The hilarious script, story, tying into current times and believable themes made it stand out, not to mention the exceptional acting. After looking on-line about this movie, I completely disagree with the \"critics,\" whoever they are. Seems like they usually are on opposite ends of my enjoyment spectrum!

        "review_detailed_main": "Although, I can see why others didn't. To begin with, the movies premise is a little awkward and obviously unrealistic. That's fine. I went into Evan Almighty knowing, for the most part, what the story was about. I wasn't going to say \"wow that is unrealistic\"...because that is what the movie is, unrealistic.\n\nSo if you can get past that step of knowing that the background is totally impossible, nice job. Now you have to ask yourself, \"do I enjoy this movie on an entertainment level?\" And that is where you may get hung up. I did, but it seems like some didn't.\n\nThat is the main problem it seems like. An unrealistic background combined with the fact that it isn't entertaining (to others), hurts the film. Not to mention a few other things.\n\nThere are a lot of clich\u00e9s. Just use your imagination. Obviously, clich\u00e9s don't make people too angry or otherwise they wouldn't be in so many movies and therefore not be called clich\u00e9s in the first place. However, Evan Almighty uses them and uses them proudly.\n\nAnother problem is the pace. At 90 minutes long the story unfolds pretty quickly, not giving much time for complexity. And that's okay with me. Complexity mixed with PG comedy/family films isn't always a great it.\n\nBottom line, I enjoyed it. It was a nice movie, not as funny as Bruce Almighty and not even too funny on any level, but entertaining enough for me to go home satisfied. (The funniness was actually provided by the many references to other films).\n\nNot to mention the effects were pretty good.\n\n7/10, worthy enough."

My husband and I looked at each other and said, \"Why do you think it got such a low rating from the critics\"? And we both came up with the same answer, \"Because it had a message that is almost always unpopular with the critics.\" We laughed often during this movie and enjoyed the same Steve Carell comedy that we look forward to, but at the same time, we left the theater not only laughing but thinking about life just a little bit more. I suppose the critics prefer to just be entertained. If I can get entertainment, along with a little thought provoking material then I figure I've won the jackpot. I can only imagine a pessimist or cynical person being disappointed in this film -- or maybe someone who does pick apart every aspect of a film. As for the general public, I think we tend to look beyond some of the small stuff in favor of the deeper meaning. Great job by Steve Carell. If you are familiar with Steve Odekerk and enjoyed some of his films, you'll be glad to know that he helped out with this one as well.

I was satisfied with sufficient sight gags and cheap humor that kept it funny, but did not destroy serious moral lessons or reminders in the Plot. The importance of supportive family, respect for our \"God-Given\" environment, Faith, Integrity, the price of corruption. But I found myself MORE awe-struck with the grand scale of the Ark and the Animals.\n\nI had a wonderful sense of the Scale of the Original Noah's Ark, and felt connected to the historical significance of this massive construction task with Biblical era tools. I was amused and amazed at the range of animal scenes, especially the humor in their contributions to Ark building. A comedy of immense scale and record cost, but well worth it.\n\nCongrats to all the major players, who did not disappoint me from previous Roles, Especially Morgan Freeman, John Goodman, Lauren Graham, Steve Carell in that order. No disrespect to the Newer or Younger players, where I had no Expectations -- all fine for their roles.\n\nSo, enjoy the Humor, Love the Animals, Admire the Actors, Identify with the Struggles and Doubts of the Characters, be Redeemed in the underlying Themes, and above all, for God's Sake, See it on the Big Screen!"

Actually, I think the real reason they didn't like it was because it actually had a good message, and horrors, mentioned people praying. It wasn't gut-busting funny, but it was funny and a pleasant use of the time in the theater, unlike a lot of movies put out in the past couple of decades. Ironically, one of the funniest parts comes after the official movie end, so don't leave the theater when you see the first credit start."

Because of them, and what many critics said as well, I went into this thinking it would be just terrible. I was, however, quite pleasantly surprised. This is a sweet, good-natured film that left me feeling quite happy.\n\nI think what irked the unsatisfied reviewers is that this is absolutely NOT 'Bruce Almighty'. Anyone who expected that is going to be disappointed. I'm sorry that marketing relied so much on billing it as a sequel, because it's really just the same God operating within the same movie world. This is a much more family-oriented and \"safe\" comedy. Many of the jokes are juvenile at best. The special effects aren't dazzling and the moments where the comedians in the film try to milk their standard style for all it's worth are often just uncomfortably bad. As said in several other reviews as well, Carell is at his worst when he's obviously trying too hard to be Jim Carrey.\n\nBut none of those things took away from my enjoyment of the film. The messages were really quite well done and the more subtle bits of humor were fantastic. I thought they did a great job of giving each bizarre biblical occurrence a particular purpose and meaning in the modern story as well. Morgan Freeman's God is, as last time, absolutely wonderful. He's mischievous, good-natured, funny, and great to watch.\n\nI thought 'Bruce Almighty' was pretty forgettable and certainly not some genius comedy that this film doesn't measure up to. It's simply not the same kind of film. I think if you go into it as a family film with some nice messages, you'll enjoy it a lot more."

However, it is not religious movie, God is mentioned (and well played by M.Freeman) but there is wider context here -- are your beliefs, thinking and acting the same, or you believe in something, think something else, and act quite differently?\n\nWhat's most important in a gentle way it shows some obvious truths about life -- for example, obstacles are to overcome them, not to despair.\n\nTouching (I admit, in restaurant scene I almost cried), heartwarming movie (beautiful Lauren Graham), with disgusting jokes almost at level zero (rare thing for American movies nowadays), I highly recommend it for watching for whole family.

We finally had a movie that was just plain funny - yes, so it was a tad goofy at times - but it gave us what we needed - good clean fun and laugh, sometimes, till it brought tears. The animals were great and if you watch the Special Features you can see what was Computer Graphics and what was not. It was a huge undertaking and I thought they did it just right.

Bruce creates Mahem for himself by increasing his own responsibilities and having dire consequences with his decisions but Evan is given the burden of responsibility as the only way he can continue and there is nothing he can do to avoid it.\n\nThe moral of the film, God works in mysterious ways and eventually it will pay out if you follows his given guidance.

        "review_detailed_main": "***** SPOILERS ***** Looking past the 'Crazy Conservative' and 'Silly Believer' overtones, this movie has a much more important message going for it.\n\nGod is still in charge, and still loves us. This is not a retake on the Noah story. This is yet another warning for mankind that it is never too late to start believing in God, and turning to Him for guidance and support.\n\nSteve Carell is great, Morgan Freeman shines as God, and Lauren Graham is as beautiful as ever.\n\nThe animal scenes are cleverly done. Seeing some animals took me by surprise.\n\nThe scenes where Baxter's neighbors and the media simply point at him as some religious nut-job is not as powerful as seeing those same people run for their lives as the flood waters, as Baxter said would come, came.\n\nJon Stewart's cameo was not needed. How the man still has a career is beyond me. He isn't funny, and the only 'jackass' in this movie is Jon himself.\n\nAnyways, I hope people who check Evan ALmighty out actually think deeper than what they see on the screen. There is a message here, and it is not too hard to find.\n\nOh yeah, it seems Heather Langenkamp (Anderson) now works behind the scenes. I'm happy to see her working at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is really funny, like really FUNNY! This movie gets an instant 10/10 from me. I loved it when Evan Baxter started to grow a beard and when he tries to shave it, the hair keeps on growing back. I cracked up when he had to wear a ponytail and braid his beard in order to go to work and make it unnoticeable to his co-workers. I was like \"Is that Moses or God?\" when I saw Evan with white hair and a disheveled robe. When Congressman Long (Who people were referring to as \"That Fat Guy\") was about to curse out at Evan, I laughed when all the birds decided to take a crap on him. That was the most funniest scene ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not just funny, its makes you laugh really hard. And it is touching and moving at the same time. Half time I was crying with laughter, half time I was crying with emotion. Altogether, I just still can't believe I liked it that much! Give it a try, you won't regret. Steve Carrel is better than ever, Molly Shannon has a small but traditionally goofy role. A short appearance of Jon Steward just completes it, and Morgan Freeman, that guy rocks the most. The plot is unconventional yet made with such an ease that makes the whole things very powerful and impressive. Not being a fan of comedies myself, I do recommend Evan Almighty."
