        "review_title": "A 14th century Crusader returns to a homeland devastated by the Black Plague and undertakes a dangerous adventure",
        "review_detailed_main": "This thrilling film deals with 14th-century knights who transport a suspected witch to a monastery, where monks deduce her powers could be the source of the Black Plague which spreads death across the lands and villages , decimating life across Europa . Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague , a warrior is tasked with learning the truth about his fate as he is charged in leading a fearsome witch , as Beheman and his group of mercenaries have to go a remote location. It's an exciting story plenty of battles , action and excitement . The scenery is beautiful, and so was the cinematography . The music was great. The acting and directing was acceptable . A beleaguered church ruled by Cardinal D'Ambrosio (Christopher Lee), deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights named Beheman (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) to transport an accused witch (Claire Fay) to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight (Ulrich Thomsen), a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth (Robert Sheehan) who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. The group must fight mysterious creatures for consuming every living thing in their path . Eventually surrounded by the frightening and ferocious foes, they must conquer his personal fears and help battle the illusive invaders who emerge out of the shroud of fog in the black of the night. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force .\n\nThis sword and witchery epic movie begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise with impressive battles set in Crusades and wind up with continuous struggles against weird beings . The picture packs great loads of action , special effects abundant , horror, breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . The film gets an impressive control of the crowd scenarios with a climatic and overwhelming finale battle . Exceptional and colorfully cinematography is shot on location in outdoors from Hungary , Salzsburgo , Innsbruck , Tyrol, Austria , Croatia and Shreveport , Louisiana . The camera work by Amir Mokri in this film is dangerous and thrilling . Our perspective is intimate and that lends a great deal of excitement to the movie experience . Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a castle lift this story . Musical score by Orvasson is evocative and spectacular . There's something for everyone here ; fans of horror, fans of action, fans of medieval adventure should all find something to enjoy about this film . It may not be the best film ever made, but its still one passable movie. The motion picture is professionally directed by Dominic Sena who has got a career full of hits as \u00a860 seconds\u00a8 , \u00a8Operation Swordfish\u00a8 , \u00a8California\u00a8 but also some failure as \u00a8Whiteout\u00a8 . Rating : Acceptable and entertaining film that will appeal to Nicolas Cage fans ."

        "review_detailed_main": "Season of the Witch is getting ravaged by reviews as I write this. Is it that bad? I don't think so. Is it fantastic then? Well no. This is one of those sword and sandal fantasy films that tread the middle ground, having an interesting premise set up in a fantasy fellowship quest, only for the execution to be hovering around mediocre standards following a rote formula of introducing the problem, gathering the players, and have them encounter sequence after sequence of battle obstacles on the way to their objective.\n\nNicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play buddies Behman and Felson respectively, knights of the Crusade who make a reputation of being fearsome warriors fighting for a higher cause, only to desert their army and turning their backs from continuing onto Jerusalem after realizing that they are nothing but fighting pawns for the whims of man. Their services get called for by a town inflicted by a plague because of a curse by a girl (Claire Foy) whom they deem a witch, and the agreement forged was for them to escort her to a monastery for a group of monks to decide on the authenticity of the claim, and if so, decide and inflict punishment.\n\nGathering Priest Debelzag (Stephen Campbell Moore), guide Hegamar (Stephen Graham), one of the remaining fighting fit soldiers of the town with Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen) and a priest in training Kay (Robert Sheehan) whom the party picked up early in their journey, the group has to band together if they are to get to their destination in one piece, with the accused girl being locked up in a cage but always seem to be drawing undue attention to herself, raising questions about her innocence as we get to see her demonstrate abilities and superhuman strength even, while putting on a saccharine sweet face. Now while all these may point to certain plot loopholes and irrational human behaviour, I'm willing to overlook these flaws since they do get addressed in the final reveal, so all's not totally lost in Bragi F. Schut's story.\n\nBattle sequence design was a little sleepy, and although the introductory big battle scenes involving soldiers of the Crusade were plentiful, it didn't go beyond the usual slash-parry- stab-wash-rinse-repeat cycle coupled with cheesy dialogue exchange between Behman and Felson that try to pass off as comedy. There's an awfully long and painfully executed crossing of a creaky bridge that doesn't seem to want to end, but otherwise passable CG was employed in an attack of wolves, and the money shot in the final battle where all hell breaks loose in the monastery with grotesque looking winged beasts and the expected big boss to fight in an all out melee done arcade style.\n\nSome will probably find the themes here quite objectionable, especially since it sets its sights squarely on how religion gets manipulated by the few, and made suggestive queries what if the Crusade wasn't a calling made by god as claimed by the messengers, but of more negative forces since it involves the killing of innocents. What more, this was played out in quite direct fashion when the final act made that cross-reference in point blank fashion. It's bold in its statement and association, which otherwise the story here lacks any selling points to make an audience sit up and take notice\n\nI'm not sure what Ron Perlman is doing here - the billing on the poster doesn't seem to give him much respect, preferring to marquee Cage alone instead, so while there are inside nods to Hell and the devil and demons here, I'm hoping that we'll get to see another installment of Hellboy instead. Under Dominic Sena's vision, you'd know what to expect when you scan through his resume, being responsible for flicks like Whiteout, Swordfish, and yet another Nicolas Cage starrer in Gone in Sixty Seconds. They're no more than Guilt Trips with potential not lived up to, so don't expect a classic or a masterpiece, but at best entertainment that will struggle to satisfy jaded audiences."

Looking forward to an epic fantasy, I was highly disappointed. I found myself annoyed at the unnatural behavior of Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman. It was like watching Starsky and Hutch with their witty bantering during battles and in the face of peril. Very cheesy. The movie lacked a good flow. It was mildly entertaining in parts, but never reached any peak, not even at the end, because it was just too absurd. The acting was not good, but I think it was just a poorly written script more than anything else. It seems like it had the makings of a very good movie, but fell very very short."

Nic Cage really makes an effort and Ron Perlman, well has never been better than in a middle ages setting. For all the historic inconsistencies they at least got the atmosphere about right. What makes it entertaining in the end is the sustained air of suspense while being on route. Not that it keeps you on the the edge of your seat, but it is decent enough. Travelling in the middle ages must have been a sort of Russian Roulette with little more than a sword to rely on. Unfortunately the last 20 minutes or so, the film goes over the top in a strange , pointless , exercise of CGI effects. The CGI itself is passable, but in contrast with the subtle air of discomfort during the voyage that makes up for the 2nd part of the film. As proclaimed, a painless sit-through , but could have been better with a subtle last act.."

        "review_title": "Where's the magic?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Nicolas Cage. Magic. Blockbuster. A familiar combination, since Dominic Sena's Season of the Witch hits theaters only a few months after The Sorcerer's Apprentice (whose producer Jerry Bruckheimer, in the oddest of coincidences, worked with both star and director on Gone in 60 Seconds, eleven years back). While the latter was a by-numbers Disney effort (plenty of effects, a general lack of heart), Sena's latest work manages to also be quite a bit boring and occasionally ludicrous.\n\nThis time, Cage doesn't play a magician, but a crusader who, having witnessed too much bloodshed, runs off to Europe with his fellow soldier and best friend (Ron Perlman). They discover a plague-ridden landscape where witch hunts are an everyday routine, and eventually make it to a village where they encounter a priest (Stephen Campbell Moore) who needs help taking a potential witch (Claire Foy) to a monastery, where she will face trial. Assisted by a loyal knight (Ulrich Thomsen) and an eager youngster (Robert Sheehan), they begin a perilous journey that will test their faith in every possible way.\n\nThe storyline certainly had enough spark to produce an interesting movie, but Sena messes with the final product by not knowing what to aim for: depending on the section, Season of the Witch is a historical drama, a thriller with hints of the supernatural or, at worst, a clumsy meld of horror and fantasy (then again, what should we expect from a film that shares its title with the third Halloween flick?). Setting aside factual inaccuracies, namely the fact that the Crusades, witch hunts and black plague didn't occur simultaneously (and what's with Cage's sudden bout of modern cursing in a Medieval setting?), the uneven tone kicks in after a moderately promising first half, leaving room for basic plotting that culminates in a ghastly genre switch and a most annoying \"twist\".\n\nThe acting is a similar mixed bag: Cage does his usual generic blockbuster shtick, which jars considerably with the gravitas coming from Thomsen and, to a lesser extent, Sheehan, both of whom are taking the film far more seriously than required. A cameo by Christopher Lee - who actually looks more like Max von Sydow - livens things up despite its brevity (even Tim Burton has given him more screen time), and the joy of seeing him and Perlman - lovable as always - in the same movie could make up for the rest if the second half of the picture wasn't so shoddy. As for the witches (yes, they do appear in a few scenes), well... they look like cheaper versions of Doctor Who's Weeping Angels, minus the scares.\n\nSeason of the Witch could have been interesting, but it comes off as a bland blockbuster with very little to go for it. Sure, it's got Ron Perlman head-butting a demon, but is that enough? Afraid not."

Season of the witch is a movie that will be just perfect for anyone who wants to fill his/her Saturday afternoon in warm couch with beer/hot tea and snacks.\n\nAtmosphere of the movie is really nice, I liked the factor of paranoia which slowly gets into minds of main characters. Movie tempo unwraps in best possible way, not too slow and not too fast, and it will keep you in the center of action and happenings all of the time. Pure fun in my opinion! Characters aren't elaborated to some detail levels, but just enough for you to like and know them. Music in the movie, I don't know was it something wrong with me, but now when I try to remember the music - I just can't! Was it because the music wasn't there, or it was really bad, or I was in a weird mood? Don't know!\n\nAll in all a good movie with good tempo and plenty of fun, I would recommend it. Oh yes, and it has a cool little twist at the end, a bit naive and without much sense maybe, but I loved it since I didn't expect it."

So while Season of the Witch was not as bad as it could've been, to me that didn't mean much. The costume and set design are great, the effects are good if too over-reliant in the last third of the film and Ron Perlman is a nice presence. So what spoilt it?\n\nThe two assets that spoilt it for me were the cheesy, anachronistic writing and the characters, that were both bland and clich\u00e9d. The storytelling is often thin in structure and sluggish in pace, and further hampered by a final third that is nonsensical and reliant too much on special effects. I missed the intimacy of the choreography of the action sequences as well, not sure whether it was lack of heart in the performances or the moments of hackneyed editing there was, and the direction shows signs of awkwardness. Perlman aside, the acting is pretty awful, and hurt even more by inconsistent accents. Nicolas Cage is especially wooden.\n\nOverall, it wasn't quite as bad as I'd heard, however to me it was still one of the weakest of a very hit-and-miss year. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

For the most part it's well acted, Perlman played a blinder as Cage's sidekick and Cage himself was quite good too. It was good to see MisFits star Robert Sheehan in a starring role, and the writing wasn't bad either, aside from the odd cheesy line. As far of the story goes, it works, although some of the aspects (such as Cage's motivation for going on the journey in the first place) seem a little far fetched, it's difficult to understand that Perlman's character in particular would go to such lengths for something which only affects Cage, perhaps a more developed background of the two knight's may have helped. The special effects, although in my opinion at times rather unnecessary, are pretty good, and I think the atmosphere of England suffering from the plague was recreated very well, except for the plague suffers seemed to look a little extreme.\n\nI would have scored the film higher, except for that I feel it is very much aimed at quite a small audience, if you don't like the themes this film explores, you won't like it. The film could also have been longer (at 1h34m including a 10m credit sequence) I feel certain things (such as the Cage/Perlman background) could have been developed further to provide a more well-rounded film. Still worth a watch though, not as bad as people are saying."

Good for TV, bad for the big screen.\n\nThe actors where OK, nothing really to blame on them.\n\nThe dialogue wasn't horrible but the fact that it jumped from \"well site and drink at the table of my for-bearers\" to \"let's kill this (female dog)\" just didn't work! Please pick a linguistic style and stick to it. Ron Perlman was speaking like hamlet one minute and Hellboy the next.\n\nThe photography was well... bad. as in dark, grainy, who fogged the movie screen bad.\n\nThe ending is fairly predictable and the only reason I saw the end is because my wife said she was liking it when I asked here about 20 minutes in.

Its not often that happens.\n\nI heard from a unenthusiastic review (one of numerous scathing reviews out there, as anyone with the internet can tell) about the on screen shenanigans with Nick Cage and Ron Perlman were so enjoyable that it made the rest of the movie bearable. Going in with that anticipation, I found myself not only pulled into their characters' fun and convincing friendship but also into an intense and yes even edge-of-your-seat suspenseful movie. I forgot about my troubles for the day and enjoyed a good adventure.\n\nIt was inspired, yes, by DnD, video games, and a number of other swords and sorcery books and movies that preceded it, but it is its own story. In a market saturated with sequels, prequels, reboots, comicbook diarrhea, etc... it's nice to see a story that is it's own, however simple.\n\nYes it plays by the numbers. You know guys will die. Hell, you probably know who and in what order, if you've seen movies of it's ilk. You know there is a supernatural bad guy. And you know there will be one liners, oh are there ever one-liners! But the characters are fun to watch, even a little engaging. You may not want to see them die. I didn't. They weren't a group of scum with a bullseye for heraldry. The enemy was threatening and tricky, a real danger to our protagonists. And the one liners were, gasp, funny! Yes, even Nicholas Cage is worth the price of admission here. If this was \"just another paycheck\" role for him, he looked like he was having a lot of fun with this roll. And I don't know about you, but I like to see my actors have fun in a movie that costs me 9-12 bucks to see..\n\nIt looses some points with me for the CGI. obvious CGI is obvious. But honestly the crispy gray CGI contrasting against a darker, colorful, moody lighting STILL didn't detract from the encounters or the climax. If you come to the movies to have CGI convince you that magic and demons are real, you come to the movies for jaded and asinine reasons. If you wanna see pretty visuals with a meandering pointless story, go see Tron.\n\nBut if you wanna see a fun yet dark heroic adventure, go see Season of the Witch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Plopping out in early January, time honoured dumping ground of inferior product and draped in mediocre to poor reviews, Season of the Witch had quite a lot stacked against it. But for all this it ended up being one of the better films I've taken in on a whim, albeit far from any kind of classic or even especially good. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play disillusioned crusaders against witchcraft who get caught trying to escape their service and are recruited for a particularly tricky witch escorting mission. So we get an arduous mission through harsh medieval lands, trekking interspersed with action and capped with a nice blazing finale, and it should be a blast, should be a lot more entertaining than it is, but owing to lack of budget or balls (or some combination of both), it ends up being rather forgettable. The first noticeable problem is studied downplaying from Cage and Perlman, they have some measure of chemistry and a small smattering of good lines, but there's no fire. Both have potential for greatness, and both have a facility for the fantastical but for some reason neither of them chew too much scenery or puff with much in the way of rage so the film constantly feels like its missing its opportunities as well. The ethereal Claire Foy suffers similarly as the witch, she has a sweetly otherworldly way to her and lights up the screen, so its a shame she doesn't have more to do. As for Christopher Lee, well he's barely in it and just about anybody else would have been a worthy substitute. These problems aside Season of the Witch manages to be quite good fun for enough of the time that I overall enjoyed the experience. Its well enough shot to conjure an effectively macabre and misty mood at times, while Dominic Sena handles his directing duties with fair adeptitude, making for some exciting and sporadically stylish action. The pacing is a bit off but never truly dull and one or two low key spooks (the highlight being a rather neat opening) keep things interesting in between the few action set pieces, while the ending is very daft and rather good fun. If only it gelled together better, if only it realised whether it wanted to be a rousing medieval fantasy or a creepy horror and got a better handle on its tone, heck if only it wasn't aimed at a younger audience with its PG13 certificate so it could get away with a few actual shocks. Bah, it could have been a lot worse, 5/10 from me."

The Cardinal D'Ambroise (Christopher Lee) proposes them to join the knight Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen), who grieved the loss of his wife and his daughter, and the priest Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore) to deliver the Black Witch (Claire Foy), accused to be responsible for the Black Plague, to the Abbey at Severac, where the monks possess the last copy of an ancient book of rituals that will destroy the witch's powers and end the Plague.\n\nBehmen promises a fair trial to the youngster and the swindler Hagamar (Stephen Graham) guides the group through a dangerous way. Along their journey, they meet the altar boy Kay (Robert Sheehan) that wants to be a knight and joins the team. Soon Behmen concludes that the girl is really a witch but when they reach the monastery, they realize that the danger is even greater than they have imagined.\n\n\"Season of the Witches\" is a reasonable adventure full of special effects with a silly conclusion.

The greatest flaw in the plot is to use the absurd witch hunting promoted by the Church in the Middle Ages and gives a kind of endorsement to the action of the Church, showing the existence of real witches. The final fight against the powerful beast is not good. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Ca\u00e7a \u00e0s Bruxas\" (\"Witches Hunting\")\n\nNote: On 29 Aug 2020. I saw this film again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nicholas Cage needs to pick his roles more carefully. Some actors can carry period films, but unfortunately, Cage isn't one of them.\n\nHere we are supposed to buy Cage as Behman, a disillusioned 14th century knight, who has deserted the Crusades and the Church and returned to Europe with his comrade-in-arms, Felson. It sounds alright on paper, but Cage looks uncomfortable in his chain mail, leather costume and horrendous hairpiece.\n\nThe land is ravaged by a mysterious plague, and the religious masses believe it is the work of witchcraft. As deserters, Behman and Felson are arrested, but soon get roped into a mission to transport a 'witch', who looks just like an abused, frightened girl, to a faraway monastery in order to stop the plague.\n\nAccompanying the two former Crusaders on the mission are a righteous priest, a noble knight, a guide for their journey and an altar boy who wants to become a knight. Soon, however, Behman realizes that there might be more to the girl than meets the eye, and that she might actually have some evil powers lurking inside her after all.\n\nThe film sets itself up as a supernatural adventure film, but despite a couple of really good sword fight scenes, something is missing. The characters don't have much time to develop, and the paper-thin plot, with its many clich\u00e9s, just makes everything feel rushed.\n\nMaking things worse is the fact that Cage and Perlman are forced to utter some of the most forced-Shakesperean dialogue ever put to film. It sounded like a secondary school production of Hamlet.\n\nAnd despite the European setting, for some reason the director has deemed that all the accents should be American, which means the British and European cast members have to put on fake American accents. One of them even sounds like a New York cabdriver! The only thing saving this movie for me are the thrilling fight scenes, and this one suspenseful scene where the group are trying to cross a shaky, rotting, wooden bridge. The supporting cast do a much better job than the two leads, especially Clare Foy who plays the witch.\n\nStrictly for Cage fans, or people who don't have very high expectations from a Nic Cage film."

Soemn of the special effects are cheesy, but so what? It's the story that counts and here the story is what drives this movie. Once again, there is a frail, young woman who causes so much havoc, yet at first glance she seems so harmless. This theme, of the helpless young girl as both victim and harpy, is continued in this movie, with good results. Far from being hokey, the story contains enough dramatic material to keep the audience's interest. There are those who may lambast this movie, dismiss it as just another Hollywood potboiler, and they may be right. Nevertheless, the movie does present a story and does not purport to be something that it is not, which affords the movie a modicum of integrity."

        "review_detailed_main": "Historical set supernatural action/horror have slowly been more popular with studios. In 2011 Solomon Kane and Black Death and these films are an attempt to make to cash from fantasy fans whilst have an adult edge. Season of the Witch is a small addition to this trend.\n\nBehmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) are two 14th Century knights fighting in the Crusades. After deserting the army, the two knights discover Europe has been decimated by the Black Death and after being captured in a town, a Cardinal (Christopher Lee) ask them to escort a suspected witch (Claire Foy), blamed for the plague, to a monastery. At the monastery is the last Book of Solomon that will destroy her. With another knight (Ulrich Thomsen), a priest (Stephen Campbell Moore), a teenager who wants to be a knight (Robert Sheehan) and a dodgy merchant (Stephen Graham) the knights accept the quest but question both the mission and what the girl really is.\n\nSeason of the Witch is basically what would have happened if The Seventh Seal was made as a silly B-Movie. The relationship between Behmen and Felson and their characterisation is similar to Antonius and J\u00f6ns, but obviously without the intelligence or the depth of themes. Both sets of men are on a similar mission, battling an supernatural force and going through Europe during the height of the Black Death. But the issues of lose of faith felt very false in Season of the Witch.\n\nDominic Sena, is a gun-for-hire director. He gets the job done and made a fast pace movie but with much of visual flair. The action scenes were standard, decent enough, but we have seen this all before. The fights were clean and quick, it was not like Ridley Scott's brutal, realistic style, Zack Snyder violence comic-book style or Peter Jackson's epic sense of filmmaking. Sena was unable to give this film any atmosphere and any horror moments are limply handled, done in that typical way of turning the music up really loudly. The humour was also weak and this is a film that is hard to take seriously.\n\nThe acting in Season of the Witch was appalling. Cage just gave a lazy, phoned-in performance and many of the actors of seemed like they did not care (whoever thought he could play a Medieval knight should reevaluate their career in the film industry). The actors' voices and looks were wooden and shows that none of them did not really care. It is made even more shameful because some of the talent who was involved. I would have though Perlman should have learnt from his from his experience with In the Name of the King and I would not be surprised if Cage earns an Razzie nomination. But there is some hope, Foy was able to show some range, playing someone who can be seem innocent to someone with menace. Foy was a decent bit of casting because of her young, girly look, but that is the only bright spark on the acting front.\n\nThe script by Bragi F. Schut is a poor piece of work. The dialogue is laughable (in a bad way) the story is thin and characterisation is non-existence. We do not get to know anything about the characters and we simply see a bunch of clich\u00e9s. He is not J.R.R. Tolkien or Robert E. Howard and shows what happens when a supernatural fantasy is not done properly and filled with plot-holes."

However, is she really a witch or was she just randomly blamed for causing the pestilence in their country?\n\nI do not know how Nicolas Cage chooses his projects, but he sure gets the cheesy ones like \"Wicker Man,\" \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and, in the same general vein, this one. Different times in history, but the same lame storytelling. The acting of everyone involved was so over the top, and yet, they were taking it all so seriously.\n\nThe supposedly exciting scenes, like crossing the rickety old bridge, the attack of the wolves and even the Grand Guignol-style face-off with the demons at the end, were plagued with unsatisfactory special effects. You know they were meant to be special because they sure took a lot of screen time. However, I found them unexciting and predictable.\n\nOK, this may be entertaining for a lazy afternoon, where you can simply turn off your brain and watch it to while away the time. But watching it in January where all the Oscar bait films are being screened, it surely exposes how bad this film really is."

However since then OK Gone in 60 Seconds and the horrible Swordfish and have not seen Whiteout yet. So I walked into this movie with little expectations and was surprised, I have yet to see the Sena from Kalifornia but this is still good. Knowing that this was barely over an hour and a half I was unsure how much they would be able to cover since it is suppose to be a historical piece and even though they cut a lot out and focus on the one thing it still works(however less is not always more). If they would have had a lot of side trips it would have distracted from the main point of the movie.\n\nSomewhere towards the beginning of the journey I was worried it would be short quick and over. I was so happy I was wrong Nic Cage and Ron Perlman have yet to disappoint me, However the role that surprised me was that of the Debelzag the priest that goes with them. I don't want to ruin anything but pay attention to him along the way.\n\nThe plot is a girl is accused of witchcraft and is being sent to a monastery to stand trial. One thing that makes this movie good is that during the journey I was more intrigued by what was happening at the moment then waiting for it to get to the end. I have a tendency to not talk about the plot that much since you should already have an idea about what it's about. My goal is to either push your towards or away from a movie and this is one that is your on the fence about give it a chance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Season of the Witch (TIME, PG-13) \u2014 fantasy: sword & sorcery, 3rd string, original\n\nNicolas Cage has an interesting track record. He's not afraid to take on oddball, off-beat roles, which sometimes pays off for him and sometimes just makes him look clownish. He was stunningly good in his Oscar-winning performance as the self-destructive alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas, for instance, and he did terrific work as the magician in the sadly under-appreciated Next, a movie based on (of all things) the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. (Picture THAT as the strange attractor on a movie poster!) He was pitch- perfect as Big Daddy in Kick-Ass (another movie I liked a lot better than the mainstream critics). OTOH, The Wicker Man, Ghost Rider, Knowing, say no more.\n\nSo it's kind of a crapshoot attending a movie whose advertising comprises essentially \"Nic Cage is in it.\".\n\nRegrettably, you can chalk Season of the Witch up on the \"What was he thinking?\" side of the ledger. It's a classic stinker.\n\nThere's a brief prolog set in the geographically indeterminate village of *ahem* Villach in 1235 AD, as 3 supposed witches are summarily executed by hanging and drowning. I presume the primary purpose of this sequence is to demonstrate the \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" attitude of the Catholic Church, since once you were accused of witchcraft, there was essentially nothing you could do to demonstrate your innocence.\n\nNext we jump ahead a century to a montage of battle scenes from the Crusades, spanning the years 1332 to 1344, as valiant knights Behmen (a slightly chubby Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) slauter their way across what was then called the Near East. Finally, moments after sticking his sword into a peasant woman, the nihilism of it all comes crashing in on Behmen, and he walks away in disgust, his loyal buddy Felson at his side.\n\nA month later they're passing thru a village that's been stricken with the plague, and they are press-ganged by the dying Cardinal D'Ambroise (Christopher Lee, looking pretty stricken himself) to transport a suspected witch to the Abbey at Severac, where they can definitively determine if she's the cause of the pestilence upon the land. That's because they possess the World's Only Copy\u0099 of the Book of Solomon, which is full of information about such things. The girl (Claire Foy) is young, pretty beneath all the dirt, dimpled-chinned, and strong as an ox. Half of the ragged band accompanying her prison wagon to the abbey are already convinced she's a witch and want to do her in on the spot. Behmen, sick of pointless killing, resists, insisting that he's pledged that she will get a fair trial. Yeah, right.\n\nThere are adventures along the way, and a couple of surprises await at the end of the journey.\n\nThe one good thing about the movie is that it shows all the ugliness of the religious fanaticism involved as the Crusades spilled over into the Inquisition. But that's it. The performances are dull and listless, the dialog is uninspired, the color palette is relentless shades of gray, the score is unmemorable, and there's virtually no production design, as almost everything occurs somewhere in the nameless central European out-of-doors. (The movie was shot in Hungary and Austria.) The dirt and muck are pretty realistic, tho, and I suppose it's a good thing the movie wasn't able to reproduce the medieval stench \u2014 at least not literally."

Reading the bad reviews on IMDb I thought this was going to be a complete disaster, but frankly it was the opposite. Yes the story line is very simple and some of the special effects are like many people said before of a typical B movie but I don't think that this is necessarily a flaw. Nicolas Cage and Ron Pearlman do a great job in this one, the mood and the atmosfere of the movie is very dark some times ( specially at the end) and that is a good thing. Also the ending was a little unexpected and if you are willing to give it a try you can leave the theater talking about important topics such as religious fanatism, intolerance and self-forgiveness. Definitely worth a look."

Nicolas Cage tries to hard to channel Russell Crow from Gladiator(2000), but in other scenes he was just being himself, it was not that great. Claire Foy was just not that impressive, but I hope she will do better. Ron Perlman is alright in this, he seems to bring it up a little. the effects are not that impressive, but there are some good scares, but other than that this movie wasn't much of anything."

Season of the Witch is essentially no different from Cage's usual fare in that it's a fairly straightforward \"popcorn flick\" type of movie.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that the film lacks any depth, but unfortunately the action scenes are severely lacking as well. The visuals would be impressive if anything new was offered, but instead we get typical scenes like \"group fights pack of wolves\" and \"group tries to cross a decrepit bridge.\" There are no shocks, no surprises, and the one \"twist\" the movie offers barely has any impact whatsoever.\n\nAnother big complaint I had was that the whole \"witch\" aspect of the movie was totally underplayed. The first scene plays on this a little bit but the rest of the film never really goes anywhere. \"Season of the Lame Wisecracks\" is probably a more fitting title.\n\nThe movie is boring at best. It offers nothing new, and there aren't even enough \"bad\" moments in the film to make it a half-entertaining B movie. Pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "SEASON OF THE WITCH, a film which bears no relation to the George Romero title of the same name, is an uneasy mix of a historical action film and a demonic horror yarn. It throws in the Crusades, demons, possession, religion and the black death into a journey narrative that sees an offbeat bunch of characters thrown into a sinister world.\n\nFirst off, this is a PG-13 film through and through: there are some very adult scares here, including a couple of effective jump scenes (the opening sequence is particularly startling), but virtually no bloodshed or crimson gore. Secondly, it's about as realistic as ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES, with the characters inhabiting a fairytale version of Europe that bears little resemblance to historical fact.\n\nNicolas Cage and Ron Perlman are the unlikely characters headlining this mess, and out of place they certainly are. After their Crusader introduction (achieved by a mildly impressive montage), they grumble and gruff their way through every scene, their American accents never rightly explained. Cage tries hard, as ever, but Perlman seems to be sleepwalking for the most part.\n\nThe supporting players are a lot more interesting. Stephen Campbell Moore hasn't given a bad performance yet, and he continues that tradition here. Stephen Graham is good value, but why he adopted an American accent as well is anyone's guess. Ulrich Thomsen is unfortunately wasted (watch THE SILENCE to see him give an unforgettable performance) but watch out for a good, spooky turn from a rotted Christopher Lee as a plague-struck cardinal.\n\nThe action is what disappoints most about this production - it's all CGI beasties and flights of fancy straight out of the likes of VAN HELSING - and come the end it deteriorates in a big, FX-filled mess, as do so many Hollywood productions in their attempts to outdo each other in terms of spectacle. Still, the flashes of horror and uneasiness along the way count for something, so this isn't one of the worst I've seen."

But honestly the whole plot of the movie is weak, not the acting which is why i finished the whole movie. The violence is decent with several types of enemies which I appreciate in a fantasy movie, but the CGI is only half decent.

A silly medieval bunch o' nonsense about a couple of deserters from the Crusades who have to transport a witch across country and stop the Black Death, or something. And of course, zombie ninja monks.\n\nAnd it's dull, so dull. Cage and Perlman are unusually restrained, and the plot plods drearily from Point A to Point B with all the verve and style of a kid doing a homework essay on plankton. That journey across the vast and unknowable heart of medieval Europe? There's bad CGI wolves, and a dodgy rope bridge. Our heroes run away from the wolves, and cross the rope bridge. That's it for the journey.\n\nOnce they arrive at the monastery, they do battle with the bad CGI zombie ninja monks, but the CGI is so very, very bad that you can hardly work out what's going on most of the time, and the monks are little more than blurry shapes. All the battle scenes are like this - confused, badly shot and impossible to follow. The director can't do tension or suspense to save his life, either.\n\nOh, it's not a total loss. The dialogue is often hilarious, sounding as though it's been translated via Babelfish from English to Ukrainian and then back again. I particularly liked Cage saying 'Can't sleep? Myself, as well' among many other examples. The scenery is nice, and you get to see Ron Perlman headbutt the Devil in the face. A few more moments like that and this mess might have been worth watching, but as it stands it's not good enough to be good, and not bad enough to be campy fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is centred on Sir Behmen von Bleibruck and Sir Felson; two fourteenth century knights who have participated in many battles during the crusades. But after their latest 'battle' turns out to be a massacre of civilians they desert and head back to Europe. Things here are not as they expected; plague has ravaged the land and the church is blaming it on witchcraft; in particular one young witch. Rather than be gaoled for desertion Behmen and Felson agree to transport her to a remote monastery, a week's ride away, to face trial. It is believed that if she is indeed a witch the monks will be able to remove her powers. They are accompanied by a guide, a priest, an altar boy who wishes to become a knight and a couple of others. On the way things start going wrong and they must overcome a number of difficulties... that is nothing compared to what the survivors will face at the end of their journey.\n\nI expected this to be rubbish, just hoping it would be enjoyable rubbish... I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be rather good for most of its run time. The atmosphere is impressive with a good sense of mystery about whether the 'witch' was what the church claimed. The early part of the film serves to introduce the characters and the general unpleasantness of the era. Their journey provided some good tense moments, my personal favourite being their crossing of a rickety bridge over a gorge. Unfortunately things get disappointing at the end when the truth is revealed and our heroes must battle CGI demons. The cast are solid; Nicolas Cage is on good form as Sir Behmen and Ron Perlman is good, as expected, as his friend Felson. There is also a fine performance from Claire Foy, in her first film role, as the young 'witch'; she successfully keeps the character nicely ambiguous. A brief appearance from the late, great Sir Christopher Lee adds a nice 'Hammer Horror' feel to proceedings Overall I wouldn't say this was great but it was certainly better than expected and is a decent way to kill ninety minutes if you enjoy the genre."

So it's with general disappointment that I have to say Season of the Witch is not one of his best, even by the standards of being a fan of his. This is a very misguided movie that with a better director and cast and bigger budget could have really been pretty awesome. For the first half of the movie, things are not too bad- the buddy relationship with Cage and costar Ron Perlman works and is entertaining, and there are some very ominous and downright creepy scenes to keep us on edge. The premise has Cage and Perlman as Knights in the Dark Ages, returning home from battle to find the people stricken with \"The Plague\", and that the cause of this plague is witchery. They must escort an accused witch through treacherous terrain where the church will then decide her fate once they arrive. But along the way many supernatural terrors await them... It's fun for awhile and I really tried to get into to it, but I couldn't. The film just looks shoddy, it's not well edited or directed, and Cage, much as I like him, looks very out of place and doesn't seem to be giving it his all. Ron Perlman has some funny one-liners but doesn't fare much better. Don't get me started on the CGI effects either. Basically, some good moments near the beginning (before the absurdity of the plot is really revealed), and good scenery and cinematography are the only redeeming qualities. Sorry Mr. Cage, you have finally struck out with me-better luck next time I hope! It's the kind of movie you will find sometime on the SyFy channel in the 3AM dead zone..."

In the beginning they sail to the coast of Styria - guess what? Yes, Styria never had (and still hasn't) a coastline at all since Austria is a landlocked country. The whole movie gives one the impression that they worked over this so often that in the end, nobody could remember what it was about and they simply decided to give it a quick end (which is really a b-movie style ending with the overdone standard cgi fx you can see in nearly every b-rated horror movie) to get it over with.\n\nIf you're into decent medieval mystery stuff or medieval action, stick with The Name of the Rose or Kingdom of Heavens if you must ;)"

Yet, when you see it, turns out to be just about exactly what you'd expect. Leading to the question: are people seeing it just to criticize it, or what?\n\nThis film aims to be a medieval horror-action-adventure. And that's exactly what it delivers. There are some nice creepy bits, some really impressive action scenes, and some CG fantasy stuff. There's a solid, if unspectacular, performance from Nicholas Cage, and a really nice contribution from Ron Perlman, clearly having a ball in an uncharacteristically jovial role. The story does a good job of moving from A to B to C, hitting all the requisite thrills and chills between.\n\nSo what, for pity's sake, is the complaint? For me, the only real negative is that the film seems too short. I had the feeling that maybe the backers became nervous (again, who knows why) and a more ambitious version had to be abbreviated. I'd have loved to spend more time with these characters, allowing Cage to evolve his bitterness and dogged determination to make things right. And I'd have loved to see more of the depths in Perlman's sterling supporting part. But no big deal... I deduct one star for brevity, but Season of the Witch, as it sits, is a really entertaining bit of escapist dark adventure.\n\nWhen it comes to this type of film, I've entirely stopped paying attention to both critics and so-called 'fans.' Whatever it is you people are looking for, why don't you look somewhere else? And stop dumping on nice little films that deliver exactly what they promise."

I didn't think I could get three out of three for great films. I was wrong, though not in the same league as the last two, Season of the Witch continues the chain of a great year of films for 2011.\n\nSeason of the Witch obviously wasn't highly publicised as much as other Hollywood films and most critics I have read in newspapers and quite a few people on here have lambasted this movie for being terrible, which is fair enough as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and even I thought I wouldn't give this higher than a five or six out of ten on here, but I really enjoyed this.\n\nBasically set during the ages of the Crusades in the 14th century we are introduced to two of the main characters Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) who are knights and part of the Crusade fighting in wars for God and the Church, but during one battle Behmen kills an innocent woman and realising what he's done, he and Felson abandon the Crusades and become deserters. Eventually they come across a small town where they find the plague spreading and a cardinal (Christopher Lee) when the two men are captured asks them to transport a young woman (Claire Foy) who he believes is a witch to the monks in a remote abbey to ascertain if she is actually a witch and kill her to end the plague. Eventually Behmen and Felson agree as long she is given a fair trial. On the journey four other people join them a priest Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), a swindler who has journeyed to the abbey before and acts as their guide Hagamar (Stephen Graham), a young altar boy who dreams of being knighted Kay (Robert Sheehan) and another knight Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen)\n\nThe cast give good performances all round. Nicolas Cage gives a great one and perfectly fits into the role gracefully. He's done some very different and daring roles recently to flex himself like The Socerers Apprentice and playing Big Daddy in Kick-Ass and like Season of the Witch it's paid off and I commend him for that. The other performance, which I thought was the best one was Claire Foy as the girl accused of being the witch, she was excellent and perfectly transitions herself into being a frightened innocent girl one moment to being very manipulative and menacing the next, Ron Perlman, Stephen Campbell and Robert Sheehan give decent supporting performances. Also there was a convincing buddy friendship between Cage and Pearlman with some witty one liners, though a bit clich\u00e9 were used to useful comic effect, the script isn't the best, but it's certainly not too bad and is average enough. Other great things about this movie is the action, which was choreographed well and entertaining with suspense and tension, particularly the moment where the characters have to cross a deteriorated wooden bridge, the cinematography was lovely with some gorgeous scenery and the special effects were superb. Yes there is little character development and the plot is quite simplistic but even so there is a good twist near the end, which I wasn't expecting. However this is a great film overall and one which should have received much more recognition from critics and a higher rating on here overall. No it might not be anything Oscar winning, but it fulfils it's function to entertain for the whole ninety five minutes. I felt I had got my money's worth and I never got bored throughout. Very enjoyable fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Looking back on this movie, I can understand why it was overlooked. It was somewhat of a period piece wrapped into an action/horror movie. However when you get midway through it's actually hard to believe that it's Such understated ensemble cast that was likely overlooked for simply being what many assumed like be a predictable, venerable concept. I'm guessing GOT wasn't even as big yet for ppl to appreciate a \"Crusades\" era horror, But the real driving force of this flick is simply the suspense, & conviction of each character.. yes even Cage is good here. While this lil gem released the height of \"found footage\" horror flicks, we could've expected a cheesy bunch of jump scares and lame CGI at some point. But the driving story keeps all those cliches surprisingly minimal. And besides Cage & also have an all star cast w Ron Pearlman, Christopher Plummer, Claire Foy, Robert Sheehan, & Ulrich Thompson. It's honestly just a fun, movie w a serious tone if you will. By midway, we're so engrossed in journey of two Knights who're charged w the transportation of a \"possible \" witch in exchange for their freedom, we don't notice we've been spared all the predictable cliched tropes, in both action and horror movies. That's also the thing, it's also somewhat mystery, as we like Cage's character question whether or not said girl is actually a witch. I give it a 7 for its likeable cast , & simply being a unique film against the odds for its time."

The story line goes good and smooth but it feels that it is going slowly, but at the same time it doesn't. Nicholas Cage delivered a good movie, but he did not do it perfectly. Overall the movie is not the best, but a fine rental or a movie theater that plays the movies cheaply will do for this one."

It's a bit of fantasy writing that doesn't try too hard to have a lot history or even like correct language or accents etc (Nicolas Cage just sounds like the Californian he is). Honestly it could've been any time or era. If you just take it as it is there's great character acting. I agree that while Nicolas Cage doesn't have the accent he does have a very handsome look in the film and like a focus and a kind of purity and it's a great portrayal even if it is a popcorn film.\n\nClaire Foy now popular for The Crown amongst other films stars as the Girl/the Witch and Robert Sheehan now known for The Umbrella Academy stars as Kay the pious altar boy wannabe knight. They both give great performances and are fully believable.\n\nI enjoyed the film and all the secondary actors as well who play the monks, priests and guards who give the film an element of seriousness. I like the mystery of the plot about the Girl (is she witch or isn't she?).\n\nI felt the ending was a bit weak (omg that demon) and you start to question if a a certain character is as strong as they are, why aren't they using their powers.\n\nBut otherwise a much better B movie than others, nice mix of actors having fun and also being serious and giving good performances. Watch it!"

The acting is not even close to what you see on your daily soap opera. And I will not even say a word about the bad CGI.. This movie is one of the (there is non such word) I haven ever seen. The story started OK and from that part it goes down and and down and down. Even so far down you star laughing so loud and you will keep watching because it is getting even worse than you thought it would go.\n\nAll and all pretty funny to watch..

Just like Drive Angry, Season of the Witch is a bad film that is entertaining enough to warrant a viewing. There are many aspects of the film that are not good and would normally scare people away. Shoddy CGI near around the climax, a weak story that is basically go from point A to point B, lazy acting and bad writing. With all these aspects working against the film, it still finishes with its shameful head held high.\n\nThe characters are more wooden than a puppet. You never get the sense of friendship that is suppose to be between Cage and Perlman. They both don't even seem like they want to be a part of the film. Yet Nic Cage does what Nic Cage does best and elevates the film to a Nic Cage level. Clich\u00e9d elements enter the film left, right and centre. Cage kills a woman and it haunts him, so he throws down his sword, as does his Perlman. What they fought and killed for wasn't what they thought. Enter his guilt, a nightmare here and there and nothing more and tangible for him as a character.\n\nIt definitely feels like a Nic Cage vehicle as no one else in the film really has the chance to do anything. Not even the girl who plays the \"is she/isn't she\" a witch. She sits in the cage the whole time. I would have liked the film to play up the whole mystery around her. It spells out what she is capable of way too early in the film for my liking.\n\nI have a soft spot in my heart for films like this, I was one of the few people who really liked The 13th Warrior. A film about a small group of people who must defend or go on some kind of journey always seems enjoyable to me. Season of the Witch is just that, an enjoyable movie. Maybe if you go in expecting trash, based on the numerous reviews, you'll leave thinking it wasn't all that bad. I know I did."

They are accompanied by a motley crew: priest, a seller of relics who serves as their guide, a father who lost his entire family to the plague, an altar boy with impressive fighting skills, a alleged witch, and each other. Ignore most of the reviews. This film is watchable."

Throughout the entire movie you are led to believe one thing, and then the movie takes a turn for something else. I am not getting in on what it is, just watch the movie and see.\n\nAs for the cast, well they all did a good job with their roles. Even Nicolas Cage (playing Behmen). Yeah, no secret that I am not particular a big fan of his acting, but his performance in this movie was actually good. And also Ron Perlman (playing Felson) was really well-cast for this movie. Seeing Ulrich Thomsen (playing Eckhart) in the movie surprised me. I had no idea he was in the movie actually. Most noteworthy, perhaps, was Claire Foy (playing the girl). Her performance was really great. And Christopher Lee (playing Cardinal D'Ambroise) was a good addition, despite he was there for only a short while.\n\nThe effects in the movie were really nice, and there were some really nice battle scenes, especially the big historical battles, those were nice. But there was also a lot of detail in the sets, such as the villages, etc. The witch/demon also looked really cool. And hats off to the way they made the plague-struck people look like. I loved that make-up, it was simply awesome.\n\nHowever, when there was a bunch of monks who died from the plague and came back as demonic possessed, the movie did take a turn for the more ridiculous and lost some of its appeal. Sure it looked cool and everything, but it was a tad too much.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" delivers good entertainment, because there is a lot of action in the movie, plus there is a good amount of suspense as well. I watched it with my wife, and she was oblivious to the facts of history, that these witch prosecutions actually did take place in the name of Christianity and the crusade as well. So there is also a certain amount of good historical aspect to \"Season of the Witch\" as well.\n\nThis is an entertaining movie, just look past Nicolas Cage's one and only facial expression."

I am talking about the story line not the viewing time which was pretty short as well. All the excitement is in the trailers, that is IT. There is nothing more to see. The 4 points is for the comedy, for such a sobering topic there was some good quips, Ron Pearlman is the funny straight man as always. All in all the battle scenes were well done, spanning several years and wars, it was funny. The scenery is very nice. Those crusaders were not a nice bunch, but we will not get into religion."

I actually think he's a good actor when put in the right roles... but this was not one of them. I have no idea how he landed in this movie, but it was all wrong. Ditto for Ron Perlman, another actor who's great when in the right roles. But these two did not belong here. They did their best, but it was poor casting.\n\nThen there's the overall feel of the film... the director did a good job with a limited budget, and the film never feels small, although some of the CGI is second rate which is a disappointment. The writing could have been tightened up a bit as well, as it occasionally comes off as inauthentic for the time period, and is exacerbated by the poor casting mentioned previously.\n\nFortunately the movie is saved by the unique premise; you begin with the impression that the film is about a 'witch hunt', except you quickly learn that there is indeed a witch and not just insane religious paranoia. This is an interesting twist on an old trope, and helps to hold your attention from the beginning.\n\nBut it could have all been done better. There was a lot of potential to do something really special with this idea, but it didn't quite happen. It's not that the movie is bad... but it could have been very good."

Oh Nicolas Cage, you are a contradictory delight. The Oscar for \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is proof that you're worth the admission price. And recently your quirky on screen presence in \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of New Orleans\" and the great \"Kick-ass\" brought flourish to the movies. But it's that childhood mentality that gets him in trouble so so much. More times than not it seems like Cage is just interested in playing dress-up and crossing off the characters he imagined during school's recess. Sure, \"Kick-ass\" rocked but being a sorcerer in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", a hit-man in \"Bangkok Dangerous\", or a bear in \"The Wicker Man\" did not. These films, much like dressing up as a knight in \"Season of the Witch\", needed so much more than just fun costumes.\n\nThere is so much wrong with \"Season of the Witch\" it's hard to know where to start. Cage teams back up with his director from \"Gone in 60 Seconds\", Dominic Sena. Sena's last effort was the abysmal \"Whiteout\" and \"...Witch\" is no better. Terrible F/X that wouldn't pass in today's video games, a script that seems like it was originally out for laughs but was edited against that idea, and overall just a boring story that's poorly executed. Not to mention acting without effort from Cage, who doesn't mesh at all with Ron Perlman who's just recycling his \"Hellboy\" shtick.\n\nAfter that awesome enticement I bet you're just salivating for some sweet plot synopsis? Well I'm gonna give it to you anyways. Behmen (Cage) and Felson (Perlman) are Crusader knights who've decided enough is enough with the blood-thirsty church. They defect and return to Behmen's home which has now become infested with the Black Plague. The Black Plague is blamed on a young girl who's accused of being the Black Witch. Behmen has his doubts but agrees to take the girl (Claire Foy), who is billed poetically enough as The Girl, on the long, dull, and dangerous journey so that she may have a fair trial against her charges.\n\nWouldn't you know, mild danger ensues. The kind of clich\u00e9 crap you'd hope the filmmakers would be able to not put their characters through. But they did. A young follower named Kay (Robert Sheehan) who wants to be a Knight himself is discovered. Felson tries to shoo him away but learns in a swordfight, that he actually does have skills to offer. This lame swordplay, much like the earlier Crusade battle scenes are supposed to pass as exciting entertainment. FAIL! My least favorite moment includes the crossing on a rickety old suspension bridge with heavy horses as the rope is giving way. C'mon, really?\n\nWhat's most odd is \"Season of the Witch\" hints that it was written to play in the comedic tone of a film like \"Army of Darkness\". A demon that sounds like an angry Jar Jar Binks, and 80's action one liner quips from Perlman, such as \"now she's sedated\", amount to no humor at all but elude to some being attempted in an earlier draft. The accents are also incredibly odd. Their journey's guide, Hagamar (Stephen Graham), sounds like he's from the Bronx, while Cage goes so in and out with an English accent you don't blame him for not even trying by the middle of the movie and Perlman doesn't even bother. Anywhoo, you get the point. \"Season of the Witch\" is a season to hibernate your way through.\n\nNicolas Cage, who turns 47 the same day this film is released, hopefully will start acting his age and put down the playtime costume characters that have treated him so poorly throughout his career.\n\nHopefully \"this\" starts acting his age."

Now we flash forward to the 14th century. Brave crusader knights Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) get fed up with their slaughtering ways and desert.\n\nSoon they are pressed into a new mission. With a motley rabble, they must deliver a supposed witch (Claire Foy) to a monastery to break the back of the plague that could take over the world.\n\nWe spend most of our time in this film wondering is she or is she not a witch. We may find that this mission is a part of something much greater than a simple fricassee of the witch. As we watch Behmen and Felson's struggling with their differences between God and the church we have some food for thought.\n\nKeep in mind this movie is simple: who is the bad guy, and will they get their film finished? There is not any excess gore but a few spooky scenes with fiery eyes.\n\nYes, some things could have been done better and yes there are loose ends, but this is way too much fun to worry about that at this point."

Note, that slaying thousands of men while cracking jokes is mildly annoying but somehow an acceptable lifestyle, as opposed to killing women, which makes cool crusaders desert the army. Regarding that, if you don't feel like crusading anymore, you can tell the local harbinger of gods word to kiss your ass.\n\nLater - The wise man knows, that if a woman gives you a sad look, she can' t be a which. Also, you can not bargain with the church. But you can command it to do sh*t the American way. And I think at one point the witch might have offered Nicholas Cage a hand job.\n\n3/10"

Very slow moving at the beginning and the person I started to watch it with wasn't impressed with it and left about 1/3 of the way through the movie, though if they had stayed they would have enjoyed the ending.

It's entertaining and unintentionally funny but it leaves me with one question, why is this movie not more of a meme?

I mean what does this guys usually put out 2-3 per year? Well this is why i cut him more slack then any of the others cause with that many projects on the go they all cant be winners. Season Of The Witch wasn't. If you don't mind b rated entertainment and also enjoyed such 'dead zone' TV time shows such as Hercules, or even Xena the warrior princess which aired on Saturday afternoons, you should be OK with this as i was. Sure it was cheesy, sure the beginning hyped up a more cooler look on the period and witches but ended up falling flat however lower your expectations and ull be more happier about it. In this Cage plays Behmen and Ron Perlman plays Felson two 14th century soldiers of god who have fought through war after war against darken foes all in the name of Christianity. After the church leads them into a fight where they are to destroy women and children they leave the army and return home only to find that their homeland has been desecrated by the black plague. After being detained by their own authorities for deserting they make a deal with the head bishop of the church in exchange for their freedom to escort a witch to a remote abbey where they assure the monks present there will be able to sacrifice the witch which in turn will result in the end of the plague only after arriving they find out their enemy is bigger then a measly witch. Like i said not bad if you don't have high expectations of storyline and f/x."

Allow me to add to them: Dates are given in the form \"1232 A. D.\" Correct would have been \"A. D. 1232\" (\"anno Domini---in the year of our Lord\"). And people, even witches, are hanged, not hung.\n\nAnd one correction to another imdb reviewer: Tony Curtis never, in any film, uttered the words \"Yondah lies da castle of my faddah.\" A cinematic urban legend---but such a good one that I feel mildy ashamed to be puncturing it."

The star of the show for me, was the actress Claire Foye, playing the part of the (black) witch in question. Nicolas Cage is always a bit hit or miss and makes so many films, it's hard to keep track. In this though he's on top form and seems to revel in the role. Pearlman to was also excellent; so my advice is ignore the poor response, watch and enjoy it (for what it is). Simply an exciting adventure yarn."

We're talking here about medieval English knights on horseback, wearing the Cross of St. George. For the sake of authenticity, a filmmaker worth his salt would have given these roles to UK actors. I still shiver at the thought of Mel Gibson and his awful Scottish accent in Braveheart, when Scotland has such a wealth of acting talent. The historical blunders are of epic proportions, too. The coastline of Styria? It's a known fact that most Americans are geographically challenged, but the producers should have done their homework. The special effects were typically overdone and presumably designed with kids and young adults in mind. The plot was so predictable and derivative it merits an environmental award for recycling. Cage is one of my favorite actors, but he's in the wrong film here, in my opinion. If you've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Avatar or Harry Potter, you've seen more than enough. Despite the criticisms, the film is definitely watchable and has its moments, as long as you don't do go in expecting miracles."

Well, it's not, and that's one thing that already jump-starts this movie to 6/10 in my personal quality book.\n\nGranted,at the end of the day this movie is not subtle (CGI-morph anyone?), not historically accurate, not very well written. But damn, it works. The gritty props, the road-movie-esque setting, the dark landscape shots, plus the acting, especially the important suspension arc between the witch and the priest, is actually well done. The twist near the end even got me, it wasn't a huge \"oh my...!!?\" but a solid \"oh, okaay, didn't see this coming...\".\n\nEnjoy \"Season of the Witch\" as a Hollywood dark fantasy movie and it will easily be worth your money.\n\nAfter all, it's a LOT better than its 50%-ratings-rep."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every now and then, I'll take a chance on a critically eviscerated piece of schlocky cheese in hopes that some piece of the ridiculousness will click. That by some miracle, a \"terrible\" movie will deliver what it promises. 90 percent of the time, these movies fail to even match my rock-bottom expectations. And then, once in a blue moon, comes a movie like Season of the Witch. You have not been deceived. This ultra-dopey Nicolas Cage vehicle is very silly, and very... let's admit it... \"bad\". But it does something most other laughable cinematic black sheep don't. It delivers exactly what it promises. I go into a movie called Season Of the Witch looking for two things: Medieval action and a Halloween-like atmosphere. I got both in spades, and for that I am more than grateful I gave this disaster a try.\n\nSeason of the Witch follows two former Crusaders (Nic Cage and Ron Perlman) as they escort a suspected witch across dark forests and treacherous mountains in order to cure a plague that has overtaken the land. Yep, pure schlock. And yet, the biggest compliment I can give Season of the Witch is that I was never bothered, bored, or annoyed. In fact, I found its cheesiness to be endearing every step of the way. The cast avoids even a single obnoxious performance, and Cage and Ron Perlman are actually kind of lovable together as reluctant knights. The action is competent, the effects are just good enough to be entertaining, the costumes look great, and the locations are spectacular in their own way. There is not much in the way of sweeping majesty in these sets and exteriors, but they communicate the creepy Autumn landscape as well as I could've hoped for.\n\nSo Season of the Witch is not going to sweep the Oscars. I never expected it to. I expected (and hoped for) a reasonably entertaining midnight drive-in action film. It seems like such a simple request and yet time and time again, \"reasonably entertaining\" is too much to ask for in movies like this. It wasn't here. Haunted forests, clashing swords, killer wolves, witches, and zombie monks. This film by director Dominic Sena met and exceeded what I expected to see. It's a scrumptious Halloween treat I'll be glad to enjoy again. If you can stand the guilt, it's some pleasure.\n\n72/100"

The Catholic Church didn't have an official army you could not desert! The Crusades were over by 1272, way before the Black Death made an appearance. The \"infidels\" being killed looked very European, for instance the woman dressed western. The Witch Craze in Europe didn't really start for at least a couple of hundred years after the time period of the film. Becoming a Knight in the old days wasn't easy, you just couldn't become one, you had to really earn it or have a father that was one already. On top of that but knights had HORSES! We are not talking cute little riding horses of today either, these were mean WAR horses that were huge and could take the load of having armor on them and their masters. A great deal of money were invested in these creatures. I guess my whole issue is, if your going to spend $40,000,000 on a film, have somewhat big actors (not good ones) you might want to do a little bit of fact checking."

And the story by Bragi F. Schut isn't that bad. The direction by Dominic Sena is for the most part pretty good, staging some good atmospheric scenes (the attack by the wolves at night being one), and a great scene involving an old bridge, which is very tense.\n\nHowever, some of the CGI doesn't work as well as you hope it does, especially towards the climax of the film. Also, I get the impression the film could never decide what it wanted to be. I mention this as when the trailer first appeared for this film, it looked like a gripping medieval horror type of film. Then the film was pulled from the release date and months later, a new trailer appeared showing scenes from massive battles, which seemed at odds with the rest of the film. Having seen the film the battle scenes are okay, and do make sense in the context of the tale. But you do get the feeling the film has been re- edited, and possibly other scenes re-shot after it was originally done. There is a bit of a disjointed feel to some scenes, and perhaps this is the reason for it.\n\nThe cast it must be said are all good, if not great. Ron Perlman and Nicolas Cage are good as the knights, and seem to be having fun. There has been criticism of them both for using their own accents instead of trying an 'English' accent which seems to be the usual requirement for a film like this. But to me this isn't a problem. I'd rather actors, well, act to their best than trying to put on an accent that either doesn't sound right or gets in the way of their performance. There is great support from the other cast members, especially Stephen Campbell Moore. Claire Foy as the girl who may or may not be a witch is very good, keeping you guessing through-out.\n\nWhile it may not be regarded as a great film, and seems to have slipped out without much fanfare, I have to say Season Of The Witch is never dull, very entertaining, and well worth watching."

But, at the same time, this film checks a lot of boxes that put it high on the list of My Guilty Pleasure Films. I love sword and sorcery films, even if they're bad. I love dark fantasy worlds with untold of evils and heroic knights that sacrifice all to conquer that evil. I love stories of magic and mystery and weird freaking occurrences, and this film has all of those things. It doesn't do many of those things well, mind you, but it still does them.\n\nThe plot is pretty much indistinguishable from plenty of other grimdark or sword and sorcery film out there (troubled but ultimately good knights must battle some great magic evil and the only way to do it is to use a special object). The way the story progresses feels almost like a videogame, constantly pausing for needless fight scenes. The logic of the characters, as well as the character development, when looked at with any kind of scrutiny, immediately starts to fall apart. This is an undeniably bad movie... but it's also a ton of fun, and it's only an hour and a half long. As far as guilty pleasure movies, I feel as if I could do a lot worse..."

I expected a rather ordinary medieval movie with the usual clich\u00e9s and the boring same fight scenes at always the same places in the beginning seemed to prove the lack of imagination and tension in this movie. At least, the landscapes were particularly beautiful throughout the whole movie.\n\nBut then I got surprised. Instead of a battle movie in aesthetic perfection with the bad guys of the Church and the poor women killed for nothing, this flick turned out to be a very dark movie that orientated not only on the fight scenes but also on some horror and gore effects. The movie presented a very realistic image of the medieval times and its plagues even if the historical context was rather fictive and not important to the story. The movie had a dark story telling atmosphere.\n\nThe movie mixes then an epic journey with different characters that live moments of battle, suspense, fear and pure adventure. Sure thing is that this movie didn't reinvent the genre and that there were a couple of rip offs here and there from movies like \"Lord of the rings\". In fact, I found this movie very similar to the Canadian flick \"Le poil de la b\u00eate\" minus the humour, so you should get sure to check this movie out, too. Sure thing is also that the ending is quite predictable after a while and I found that the ending was too much focused on the rather unreal special effects that didn't quite have the magic I was longing for. At least, the ending was quite unconventional for a Hollywood flick with many dead heroes.\n\nBut from a positive point of view, the mixture of different styles made this movie quite worthwhile, charming and especially entertaining and I didn't see the minutes pass and could have continued to watch this movie for a while to know more about its diversified characters. The two main actors did a great job overall and had a good chemistry. Most of the important characters had a good presence maybe with the exception of the rather faceless father that has lost its child some years ago. With Nicolas Cage and Christopher Lee, there are also some really big names in this movie and even if they do not do the job of their lives, they do have fun and convince.\n\nAll in all, this is an interesting and highly entertaining mixture of genres but the movie did miss the chance to elaborate its characters a little bit more to really stand out and deliver a really great and more profound entertainment. That's why this movie is only of a good average quality but I would probably watch it again and was rather positively surprised after all."

        "review_title": "Mr. Cage is a wonderful actor who unfortunately, as he demonstrates here, persists in saddling himself up with projects unworthy of his attention",
        "review_detailed_main": "Shortly before the end of last year, a friend of my mother's asked me of my opinion of the popular actor Nicolas Cage. I replied with my sincere opinion that Mr. Cage is a wonderful, gifted actor who is especially good when he's got a good project, but unfortunately continues to saddle himself up with stories unworthy of his attention. Alas, my opinion is cemented and held up by his new movie \"Season of the Witch\" which I would describe as a Triple M: Mechanical Medieval Melodrama.\n\nIt takes place during the Crusades and the dawn of the Black Plague. Mr. Cage and Ron Perlman are hypocritical warriors who desert their command and wander the countryside as the Black Death claims the lives of half of Europe. They are eventually captured, but offered pardon by the church if they will escort a young woman, accused of being a witch, to monks on the other side of a vast wilderness. As plot mechanics require, Mr. Cage and Mr. Perlman initially refuse, but change their mind later. They saddle up with some other underdeveloped, plot-mechanics misfits and embark on a not-so-adventurous adventure across a stricken landscape.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" is not a horrible movie. It's not even a bad one...necessarily. It's harmless, it's not agonizing, and I will have easily forgotten about it by tomorrow morning. But that's not what I call an endorsement. The movie has several problems, the foremost being that its screenplay is utterly devoid of fresh ideas, imagination, or even, in a broad spectrum, a sense of adventure like last year's \"Robin Hood.\" Mr. Cage, Mr. Perlman, and the others are very fine in their roles, but they have nothing to flesh themselves out upon. The movie has some graphically and audibly gruesome deaths that strike no emotional impact on the audience whatsoever. Deaths are there only to make us wretch, and they don't even do that. The opening, poorly-executed battle sequences seem further from better medieval films such as \"Braveheart\" and more along the lines of \"Van Helsing.\" So what the characters embark upon is a rather predictable narrative. At times, I became so easily distracted and disinterested that I found myself imagining alternate versions of the scenes that had just passed. Alternate versions more fresh and imaginative. Last I checked, a movie was supposed to leave you encompassed by its own imagination or at least use your imagination as audience participation...not leave it all to us.\n\nLike many movies of this sort, \"Season of the Witch\" is shot in a not-so-bright photographic style and this also counts against it. The opening prologue is at times so dark and dull in its lighting that I found myself squinting, trying to pick things out. I think this might have been to better disguise the rather quirky and dicey digital effects that populate the back half of the movie in particular. There is a pack of CGI wolves that appear in the mid-portion of the picture, who are created via some of the most obviously animated computer imagery in recent movie history. The way their neck fur frills like a bearded dragon and their wrinkled faces resemble waxworks detracts from their credibility.\n\nNow to the movie's credit, it does have some good art direction (the stuff that was actually on the set, not added later with a computer). Victims of the plague are well-represented, the costume design is effective, and the makeup serves its purpose well and without much fault. And there are some good performances. I already mentioned my opinion of Mr. Cage. Mr. Perlman is his usual self: buttoned up, solid, and convincing. Stephen Campbell Moore is effective in the mechanical role of the panicky yet devoted friar who tags along with them. Stephen Graham is effective as the skittish guide. Claire Foy commands the screen with her persuasive acting and there are other good performances by Ulrich Thomsen, Robert Sheehan, and the great Christopher Lee.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Season of the Witch\" ends up diving nose-first into the new year's bag of forgettables on account of hampered, imperfect directing and a zest-starved screenplay. It's not agonizing to sit through, but it doesn't pass as entertainment either and results as being instantly dismissible."

To add to the isolation, Cage and his loyal sidekick also spoke like they were in 21st century America, not 14th century Denmark. To top it off, the screenplay was superb. I just love it when they rip off Jaws lines. Come on- I think they really needed more holy water.\n\nBut I have to give the movie some credit, here. It was filmed on a nice camera.

Clich\u00e9-ridden script is rife with anachronistic phrasings--the only thing saving it from absolute embarrassment is the benefit of the occasional unintentional guffaw. Aside from a couple of hammy outbursts, Cage seems sadly bored by the material, cashing a check amid indifference; Foy and (especially) Perlman have a few moments, but hardly enough to save this muck.

You love special effects and can only perceive movies in random four-minute increments, so the plot doesn't matter much to you. You'll see anything about witches.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Season of the Witch\" is a fantasy adventure film directed by Dominic Sena, starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. The story is set in the 14th century during the time of the Black Death and follows two knights, Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman), who are tasked with transporting a suspected witch (Claire Foy) to a distant monastery where monks will perform a ritual to rid her of her alleged powers.\n\nThe film offers a blend of action, horror, and supernatural elements as Behmen and Felson, disillusioned by the horrors of war, embark on their perilous journey. Along the way, they encounter various challenges, including deadly creatures, treacherous landscapes, and moral dilemmas.\n\nNicolas Cage delivers a committed performance as Behmen, portraying the character's internal struggle with conviction. Ron Perlman provides strong support as his loyal companion, Felson. Claire Foy shines as the accused witch, adding depth to her enigmatic character.\n\nDespite its intriguing premise and talented cast, \"Season of the Witch\" received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised its atmospheric setting and entertaining action sequences, others criticized its uneven pacing and lack of depth in character development.\n\nThe film's strengths lie in its visual effects and eerie atmosphere, which effectively capture the dark and foreboding mood of the Middle Ages. However, the plot may feel predictable at times, and the dialogue occasionally falls flat.\n\nOverall, \"Season of the Witch\" offers a decent fantasy adventure with some thrilling moments, but it may not fully satisfy viewers looking for a more nuanced or engaging story. Fans of Nicolas Cage or medieval-themed films may still find it worth a watch for its entertaining action and supernatural elements."

It's not all bad news though, the local lord's men have arrested a young woman and beaten a confession out of her to prove that she's a witch and they should burn her.\n\nDetermined to dot all the i's and cross all the t's, they plan to take her to a remote abbey where the monks will determine if she really is a witch so they can burn her with impunity.\n\nImprisoned as deserters, Behman and Felson 'volunteer' to escort her to the Abbey, joining the Priest who got the confession, a nobleman, and a travelling conman who knows the way. As everyone else is determined to stay home and die of the plague, there's not a lot of other people available. A young squire, keen to prove himself also joins them along the way.\n\nIt's an eventful journey, the girl, not expecting a fair trial naturally tries to escape, her efforts convincing the priest of her guilt, but having the opposite effect on Behman. The girl though is definitely not all she seems, accidentally or deliberately causing the gang to be slowly whittled down along the way.\n\nIt's a surprisingly strong story and Cage, Perlman and the rest of the cast are excellent. The film also includes Claire Foy as the girl, and she delivers a great performance convincing and confusing the audience as both innocent victim, and villainous manipulator.\n\nThe third act is action packed, delivering an unexpected and exciting conclusion.\n\nI went in expecting an entertaining Cage performance and left entirely satisfied with the entire experience."

It is a shame to see Dominic Sena going backwards in talent, as he creates a far more inferior product to his prior solid action ventures.

A brunette (with artificial breasts, breasts as generous as a pair of Christmas Turkeys) is nude and she's gobbling some random guy's privates like she's a snake charmer on danger pay. In a left- footed attempt to add eroticism, a blonde woman is on a computer monitor, and she is directing the 'action'. Lamely, uninspired, she flatly says 'oh yeah suck that cock.' She gives additional instructions involved in the taking of the male pudenda into a woman's mouth. I thought for a moment that this film must be a Nicolas Cage/Charlie Kaufman collaboration, but Kaufman's films do not (typically) feature so much saliva about an erect penis.\n\nIt turns out movie channel changed it's schedule at the moment, so I caught the last few minutes of some pornographic film.

Pass me some holy water, I need to cleanse my eyes from what I just watched. So, two knights decide to leave the crusade and are approached by a cardinal who is infected with the plague.

But they don't just talk and naturally communicate, oh no no. They. Talk. About. Their. Entire. Life. Stories. The whole narrative is a continuous requirement for forced backstory to the most forgettable and thinly written characters ever. An altar boy joins the brigade? Let's engage him in a role-playing sword fight that relishes in imitating a TV show-like quality and just talk. Setting up camp? Let's talk about our lives. The \"witch\" is crying on the floor after being lashed? Let's get to know her, I wonder what she's having for dinner tonight! An absolutely uninteresting group of generic actors that look like they've purposefully made their own costumes for a 'Game of Thrones' convention. Not even Cage and Perlman could save this drivel, although they clearly are the strongest cast members amidst the good production design. Accents were lost from Foy and Sheehan. Blatant green screen was utilised during dialogue exchanges, despite being shot on location. Then, a tediously unimaginative plot twist unveils itself and makes way for horrific CGI creatures, that turns a historical medieval \"thriller\" into a fantasy fricking mess. Actually, screw the holy water, pass me that crested sword. I'm gouging my eyes out instead."

Especially because, clearly some people think in this time we live in, film production-, distribution companies and studios would allow people to do that. This however, in my humble opinion is a movie that could have been better, but was done okay instead.\n\nEven though I never been much of a fan of Ron Perlman (outside of a red mask), I must say he did a great job on portraying a one dimensional, yet likable character. One who nicely accompanies Nicolas Cage as retired, yet vital knight. With Stephen Campbell Moore playing a face you love to hate, comes a promising Robert Sheehan and Claire Foy. The latter providing the only depth to such a steep plot and story. At times the movie gives you that 'Van Helsing' feeling, in some parts almost literally. Still, it's the parts of Cage & Foy that make the movie more interesting. Especially the ones together.\n\nSo I must say I enjoyed it, I just did not fell in love with it. Even though it felt more like an 'Introducing: Claire Foy'-feature, I still think it's a watch worthy movie.\n\nVote: 6++ (out of 10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Season of the Witch is a dull, lifeless adventure film with a dull, lifeless performance from its lead, Nicholas Cage. Set in medieval Europe during the Crusades, Cage and Perlman, playing deserting soldiers, don't even attempt appropriate accents and simply use their natural American accents. This creative choice is distracting and feels entirely at odds with the world the film is trying to invoke. However, the accents of the entire cast are completely all over the place, and not just with our two main characters. Unfortunately, this is only one of many issues this movie has.\n\nWhile a movie about witchcraft in medieval times should be fascinating, it is presented lethargically in this movie, making for a tedious viewing experience. The decision of Cage's character to abandon the Crusades after a decade of fighting seems weak and implausible. Witnessing the killing of civilians, including women and children, during a battle failed to convince me that this soldier would be shocked by such atrocities after years of similar conflicts.\n\nThe film boasts a talented supporting cast, including Stephen Graham, Robert Sheehan, and Claire Foy, in her theatrical movie debut as the suspected witch. Even Christopher Lee make a brief appearance, heavily disguised under prosthetic makeup. However, these actors are underutilised, and I was left indifferent to their characters, with any deaths feeling inconsequential. The film's attempts at humour through banter between Cage and Perlman's characters fall flat, as the dialogue feels anachronistic and out of place.\n\nWhile the prosthetic makeup used for Christopher Lee's plague-riddled Cardinal D'Ambroise is quite impressive, the digital effects in this movie are appalling. From poorly rendered battle scenes with large armies to an unconvincing action sequence involving CGI wolves and the climactic scenes featuring a computer-generated demon, the visual effects come across as laughably bad, leaving the film feeling cheap."

Its your standard prisoner transfer flick with things that happen in between. Cage as a crusader is actually somewhat OK in this. As for Ron Pearlman, the jury is still out for me on him. After years and years of seeing him in movies, I'm still unsure of his appeal. Is it that he's a good actor? Or is it that he's got such a weird face that you're left wondering how he keeps being offered roles? I'm not sure, but I suspect a bit of each. The beginning is your standard fare of setting up the characters. Cage and Pearlman have a moment of morality while crusading and tell the commander to go shove it, thus setting them on their way to cross paths with religious leaders at some European hamlet. Yada yada yada, next thing you know they're transferring a suspected witch / prisoner to some monastery where she'll be judged and burned at the stake. Along the way things happen. A decaying rope and wooden plank bridge must be perilously crossed, an attack by wolves / werewolves, blah blah blah. Finally act III arrives and here is where the movie really jumped the shark. In my opinion I think it just simply ripped off Army of Darkness. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell should have sued the producers. Finally, the end. I didn't really see the last 10 minutes of ridiculousness as I had better things to do, like make a chicken-salad sandwich."

The priest with one last request from the church tells them to take a witch to a far away castle where a bunch of elite monks would perform a ritual to take away the witches powers which they believed would get rid of the plague. When they get to the abbey, all is not what the knights thought it would be. Their trip ends up turning into a battle between good and evil. With everything they went through, they still kept their vows of loyalty to the church. Very entertaining. Cage and Perlman work great together and I hope they do more movies in the future.

They set out on the danger-fraught journey with a few other characters in tow, including Lee's inexperienced aide \u2013 obviously gullible to the girl's wiles \u2013 and another man of the cloth, who is more apt to execute her on the spot than offer the expected solace!\n\nThe film, therefore, falls between two stools \u2013 that of the 'revisionist' medieval epic and, once the girl proves not a mere satanic minion but effectively possessed, an effects-laden (if only mildly scary) EXORCIST rip-off! From the opening series of laboriously-if-redundantly annotated battles (ostensibly exposing the ruthlessness of Holy Wars, as well as the bond between our two protagonists), the movie features plenty of tough (yet never too gory) action that spills over even in the scenes dealing with the supernatural (awfully-rendered CGI wolves and, most ludicrously, Perlman \u2013 ironically, having twice played Hellboy by this time \u2013 head-butting an imposing horned demon!).\n\nAll in all, though, the film is pretty forgettable (apparently, reshoots were ordered and given to another director but precious little could be salvaged!) and, unsurprisingly, it exhibits little feel for either subject matter or period sense (the two leads' modern style of acting, for instance, coming across as distinctly incongruous). Incidentally, one has to wonder whether the outspoken Lee pulled Cage's ear upon meeting him for not only daring to remake his 1973 'magnum opus' THE WICKER MAN in 2006 but making such an ungodly mess of it"

A disappointing conclusion to an already disappointing movie. That I even endured the movie to its conclusion was my vane hope that it would actually become good at some point.\n\nThe film leaves a few loose ends untied, a draws upon clich\u00e9 to try and create drama and suspense. A few cleverly inserted lines could have turned this film into a humorous parody, in the vein of Evil Dead. Instead, it comes across as a very bad attempt at a movie by writers and a director who had no clue what they were doing."

Performances were complex and competent--especially those of Claire Foy and Nicolas Cage, the story held interest, and the technical work by a mostly Hungarian crew was very impressive. Happily, gore and sexual content are very restrained--I suspect we'll be seeing this one in airplanes a lot. My major issues are that the theology is a big cockeyed and the CGI at the end was unnecessary, distracting, and not up to current Hollywood standards. Let's have more like this, simply for their entertainment value (and no more Final Destinations!!!)."

Stephen Campbell Moore (Debelzaq), Stephen Graham (Hagamar) and Robert Sheehan (Kay) accompany the Knights.\n\nThis is basically the American version of \"Black Death,\" a European film released around the same time. Both movies are dark, gritty and brutal in their depictions of Medieval Europe, but \"Season of the Witch\" is more of a stereotypical blockbuster with modish protagonists, amusing one-liners and CGI-laden climax. \"Black Death\" is deeper, more thought-provoking and realistic, which is why I give it the edge in overall value (see my review).\n\n\"Season\" is the more conventionally entertaining movie and anyone who appreciates Dark Ages-based flicks are highly encouraged to check it out. Films which come to mind include \"In the Name of the Rose\" (1986), \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), \"Robin Hood\" (2010), \"Ironclad\" (2011), \"King Arthur\" (2004), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011), \"Tristan + Isolde\" (2006) and \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\" (1991). It's as good, or better, than any of these.\n\nThe colorful Medieval cinematography (castles, dungeons, villages, dark forests and breathtaking mountains) is mind-blowing and the two protagonists are great with their amusing rapport. Furthermore, Foy is easy-on-the-eyes. Look out for a thrilling rope-bridge crossing \u00e0 la \"Sorcerer\" (1977). Although the climax is over-the-top cartoony, the tone up to that point is quasi-realistic, similar to \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\"\n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Austria, Hungary and Croatia with reshoots done in Louisiana. WRITERS: Bragi F. Schut. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christopher Lee is almost unrecognizable as the plague-ridden Cardinal D'Ambroise.\n\nGRADE: A-/B+"

Cardinal D'Ambrosie (Christopher Lee) sets Behmen and Felson the task of transporting the witch to a remote monastery where she will face a trial and if she is found guilty her curse can be broken.\n\nThe film is okay, It delivers the required dose of plague pits and sword fighting. I found Cage hilarious doing a totally deadpan delivery of his incredibly overblown lines. One scene in particular that sticks in my mind is when they are approaching the monastery and Behmen and Felson are talking and their delivery is so plain and low-key that it's like they had just been given the script for the scene right before filming. I sensed Cage and Perlman could not believe the lines they were reading and nor could I. It is not brilliant but it's as watchable as a SyFy film\n\nRating 6/10"

TNOTR's attempt at showing how life was in the old centuries was actually more realistic and closer to what I think it would have been(many will agree, I am sure) and the Love vs religious-commitments in TNOTR is more heart-wrenching).\n\nWell, it is not fair to compare a movie to another, but there many similarities between these two. SOTW is not bad, but a few of Cage's films are better. I love both, I don't mind seeing SOTW the second time on DVD."

That is not really high praise considering the quality of his previous work, consisting of dull, run of the mill, \"action\" films such as Swordfish and Gone in 60 Seconds, which is coincidently the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep watching it. Season of the Witch probably won't make you fall asleep, but by the time it gets to the end you will be probably be ready for bed.\n\nThe set up is that Nicolas Cage and Ron Pearlman play a couple of Knights, fighting in the crusades, who suddenly have an epiphany that slaughtering loads of innocent women and children probably isn't the most godly thing to do, so decide to walk away from their lifestyle as holy warriors in a rather aimless manner without any real plan what to do next. On the way to goodness knows where they decide to stop off at a city for some supplies for their trip, to wherever that may be, and then get rumbled as a pair of deserters. News spreads fast in these lands. After being thrown in jail for a while they get roped into transporting a suspected witch from the city off to a monastery so she can be dealt with appropriately.\n\nBoth Cage and Perlman are rather convincing as a pair of grizzled companions and it is a shame that their obvious chemistry was underused. Throwing in a few more one-liners and witty asides would have made the story romp along at a bit of a better pace and injected a bit more humour to go along with the action. The rest of the cast just about did enough to earn their salaries, with Claire Foy going way beyond what was required of her with a wickedly smirky performance.\n\nThe actual action was fairly enjoyable, if not slightly clich\u00e9d. A ropey rope bridge is always a great set-piece for adding a bit of tension and that scene in particular was executed pretty well. The fights were on the whole exciting and the great thing was that you could actually see what was going on, a huge positive in my books in an age where tripods are harder to acquire than a sackful of diamonds. The thing that let these action sequences down, and the film as a whole was that the CGI was really shoddily put together and was a real distraction.\n\nOverall I would say that the film isn't a must see, but probably worth checking out if it pops on TV at some point. The overall plot is a bit daft and thematically agnostic but is made entertaining enough with some decent performances and enjoyable action sequences."

So let's talk about Season of the Witch for a minute.\n\nNicolas Cage and his haircut star as a knight in the 14th century, followed by his trusty companion (Hellboy, himself. Ron Perlman). The two of them are recruited for a mission to transport a suspected witch to a monk sanctuary. The witch in question is believed to be the cause of the dreadful Black Plague (A very real disease so poorly brought to life in this movie, it would make... well, Uwe Boll is still pretty horrid). They embark on a perilous journey against deceiving dark caves, unstable bridges, and packs of wolves.\n\nIn every level you can imagine, Season of the Witch is a failure. It'd be all too easy to mock Nicolas Cage for his tiring, \"Oh God! Not the Bees!\" bankruptcy pay off roles that he so shamelessly keeps accepting. Yes, he's quite terrible in this movie, as is every other member of the cast, but even the more competent Cage would have trouble carrying this movie.\n\nEvery piece of writing is inconsistent and sloppy. The characters are hardly developed, but that term is a stretch, because they're hardly characters at all. The direction lacks proper cohesion, and is aimless, sluggish and duller than a wooden spoon. Even visual eye candy is ridiculous. Everything about this movie is garish, ugly, and cheap trying to look expensive. Battlefield Earth, anyone?\n\nI'm leaving my final rating at half a star out of ****.\n\nI'd give it zero if not for a few things. Even as unintentional comedy, it lacks any entertainment value. So far, it's the worst movie I've seen all year. And I've seen Sucker Punch and Red Riding Hood, mind you."

The special effects don't get out-of-hand until a couple minutes at the end. The mystery is well played and not revealed until the end. Other people may see it before it's revealed, but I didn't.\n\nMy only real beef with the movie is Solomon's spell. When I'm fighting supernatural forces for my life or for the lives of my friends or family, I don't need some moron to exercise his Latin poetry. I need something short and easy to say in a language I know. \"Begone,\" or \"Scram,\" springs to mind.\n\nIf the magic spell needs to be long (I can't imaging why.), and if there are a limited number of copies of the spell, it might be a good idea to forgo all the decorations when creating more copies. The spell in the movie is on multiple \"illuminated\" pages. It might not have fit on one page even without the illustrations, but it surely would have fit on two. I would command my monks to forget the illustrations and just copy the magic words. When we had hundreds of copies, I might have relented and allowed the occasional flower, but not until the spell and the world were safe."

The rest of the characters I can't even remember, and I just finished watching it. Also, the buddy cop thing seems like it was just thrown in at the very last minute, at very strange moments. I don't think these two characters actually knew each other.\n\nThe only highlight was the witch, and that's only because she was creepy as hell.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Season of the Witch\" has Nicolas Cage playing a knight from the Crusades whose mission is to escort pretty girl considered as being a witch (supposedly) to her trial in a distant village. She's accused of bringing the plague to every city she's been into. Followed by his best pal, another knight (Ron Perlman), an altar boy (Robert Sheehan) who wants to be a knight just like them, an con man (Stephen Graham) who will serve as a guide to the difficult journey through the woods, and two representants from the Church, Cage's task will prove to be one of the worst he'll ever have, happening right before his wish to become an deserter, abandoning the knighthood after an tragic incident.\n\nA little bit hard to swallow seeing Nic Cage playing such character (and that wig!), or believing in many of the things presented here, but it's not that difficult if you have in mind that this film is made to entertain. That's it. Forget about the countless problems this film has, and forget about possible inaccuracies or anything related to the era pictured here; this is a fun movie with lots of action, good fight scenes (sometimes bad captured due to weak editing), plenty of adventurous and hilarious moments (intentional and unintentional funny parts, the latter being every time they mention the word 'witch', it just sounds funny).\n\nIt's a great for you to sit down, relax and enjoy this film in the best possible way. It has some amazing surprises to show being the best an twist at the ending, making of this adventure almost an supernatural horror, saved the film from being just an clich\u00e9d film). Cage and Perlman making the best buddies were awesome; the actress that plays the witch is very effective in showing two different personas, she can be nice and sweet, and in the next moment very scary.\n\nAn minor film from the director of \"Kalifornia\" and \"Swordfish\" but certainly a great way to spend the time. There isn't much better than this in terms of fun, lately. Go with no regrets! 9/10"

First scene that takes place is in 1235 A.D. and started off a bit lame and should not be taken seriously at all. But I had hopes that it would at least be stupid fun and for the most part it was only half right. Than the movie flash-forward to 1332 A.D with crusaders in the 14th century but the two main character are Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman. Anyways these crusaders look super hypocritical in this constantly getting drunk with women. Than go off killing more people in a brutal manner, now I don't know if crusades worked that way but it just seemed like the creator of this movie really don't like Christians. Anyways after a bunch of killings Nicholas Cage's character realize this is going the wrong direction. Which I found to be humorous how it lead to that scenario after the beginning few minutes of him drinking laughing and killing. Nicholas Cage doesn't seem to take acting or even himself seriously anymore, especially in this. His acting and actions are just laughable literally. This is a B-movie at best from Nicholas Cage and I don't know if some seems was intentionally suppose to be funny but it didn't seem like it, and yet it's funny. I didn't know this was suppose to be a comedy, from the trailer it isn't suppose to be one but sometimes it does seem like it. Well at least it's a fast paced movie that is close to a hour and 30 minutes. I don't know if it's because Nicholas Cage don't care much about his acting career or something, cause I have no idea how they convinced him to take this role. Maybe it was just the money issue. There is nothing much in the story either, the two main characters and a group of other are on a mission to transport a girl who is persecuted for being a witch or from just a intuition of being a witch, from point A to point B. Just watch \"Black Death\" which is a different story but similar premise and is a better movie.\n\n3.8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoy watching period films. However, my work as a historian gives me some antibodies to these films, for reasons linked to the lack of ability to harmonize creative freedom and strict respect for the historical facts and period customs. So, it was with some curiosity that I decided to see this film. After seeing it, I just wanted to slap director Dominic Sena and screenwriter Bragi Schut. None deserve any respect for what has been done here. The film is an insult to historians... even if it is not deliberate!\n\nThe script is the film's biggest problem, with a writing that seems to glue together fragments of several different stories: we start with the Crusades, we follow two knights in several military episodes and then, somewhat brusquely, they turn their backs on the Church (supposedly) and leave, probably for their homeland. It turns out that, on the way, they come across the Plague, and there is a woman, supposedly a witch, who was arrested, accused of causing the disease. Now, it's up to them the task of escorting the so-called witch to a monastery where some friars will judge her, in the light of a book that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.\n\nWhen you make a film with a historical background, at the very least, you should ask for the support of a consultant, someone who really knows History. No one should have the presumptuous arrogance to think they know everything, much less to take the public for an idiot, thinking that they will swallow everything that is shown to them! This film is an authentic case study in cinematic anachronism! How can the production admit the placement of clearly baroque decorative pieces in the midst of a medieval setting? How the hell can characters to disinfect their hands with alcohol if that was something totally unknown to medieval man? Since when is there a sea in Styria, if that ancient region is an inland part of present-day Austria and Slovenia? How can characters defect if this military concept simply didn't exist at the time?\n\nAnd if these small questions seem serious, there is something much worse: the Crusades were an entire religious, political and military effort that involved Christianity for about 300 years, but that effort had practically ended decades before the Black Death, and much before the dates that the film uses for the fights where the characters take part. There were, in fact, no serious crusades in the 14th century. The Battle of Artah, which is shown in the film, took place two hundred years earlier, in 1105. Therefore, the film deliberately delayed the Crusades two hundred years, in order to almost coincide with the Black Death, and the characters could participate in both situations! It's absurd! Another thing that simply didn't exist in the Middle Ages was the notion of a witch hunt! Of course, for medieval man, the Devil was a threat, and of course there was a relationship between diabolical art and the works and studies of many scholars, alchemists or sages who contradicted the religious knowledge. But the so-called witch persecutions only began to be more notable in the 16th century, framed in a clerical response to the Reformation and to ideas (all of them) that endangered the dominion that the Church had over knowledge!\n\nI pity Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. They are actors I respect, and seeing them participate in such a poorly made film is quite unfortunate, given that they have talent and are, as far as I've seen, almost the only positive things to highlight. Even if everything had been done in a way that respects history, the end of the film is so unbelievably stupid that it would spoil any previous effort. The rest of the cast, except for the two names mentioned, do not stand out in any way."

        "review_detailed_main": "'SEASON OF THE WITCH': Three Stars (Out of Five)\n\nNicolas Cage is a very talented actor who's kind of infamous for winning an Oscar at the peak of his career and then taking an odd path into B action movie stardom. Most of his films are critical and financial failures (at least at first) but he does produce a well liked and successful film every once in a while. I personally like most of Cage's films, even his bad ones. I enjoy a good 'bad B movie' and that's what Cage mostly puts out, 'SEASON OF THE WITCH' included. It's a campy 14th Century action thriller that's full of cheesy dialogue and acting, but it's a lot of fun. It'll go down as one of Cage's worst as far as the critics are concerned but it's actually received decent ratings from fans and I think it could find a place as a beloved 'so bad it's good' flick for many years to come, with some film nuts.\n\nCage stars as a 14th century Crusader named Behmen who, after witnessing atrocities committed by his fellow soldiers in 'the name of the lord', decides to desert his post and return home. He and his comrade Felson (Ron Perlman) journey back to their homeland only to discover it's been overrun by the Black Plague. The church in control there believes the plague is caused by wicked sorcery. When spotted as deserters the two knights are arrested and taken to the Cardinal (Christopher Lee). They're then offered their freedom if they agree to escort the witch (Claire Foy), believed to be responsible for the town's disease, to a monastery where monks can perform tests and destroy her powers. Behmen, having lost all faith, is reluctant to take the mission but does so anyway under the agreement the girl will receive a fair trial. The men are joined by a priest (Stephen Campbell Moore), a knight (Ulrich Thomsen), a thief (Stephen Graham) and a young 'want to be knight' (Robert Sheehan) on their mission.\n\nThe film was written by Bragi F. Schut and directed by Dominic Sena (director of 'KALIFORNIA', 'SWORDFISH' and another Cage film 'GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS'). The story is interesting enough for this sort of movie and it does have a nice twist. Like I said the dialogue and acting are cheesy (especially Cage) but it seems to fit the material. Sena's directing is a decent fit as well. It is just a bad 'B' action film but it's not that bad and it is an entertaining hour and a half. I don't really have a problem with Cage's career choices. I'd like to see him do a little more serious work and more of the kind of stuff that made him famous (like quirky comedies such as 'RAISING ARIZONA') but I think doing the fun 'B' action films is good for him as well. This film is of course one of the latter. It works for the most part.\n\nWatch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7EjRs-tOE"

Highly recommended for Nick Cage fans and fans of the days gone by when movies such as Dragonslayer and Excaliber thrilled us all."

I think even Vin Diesel could have maybe done a better job here than Cage... Holy molly, it was like watching a Saturday Night Live skit badly written. Mind blowing I actually made it to the end of the movie watching and writhing in Mad Magazine nauseousness. Nick Cage could actually be getting worse not better with experience if that is possible.

        "review_detailed_main": "At times you see movies that have huge identity issues. Season of the Witch is one of those movies. The tone of the story is the biggest problem of the movie, as it's an odd mix of golden era Hollywood swashbuckling action and more grim horror story. Now, those two can coexist, but balancing them is a delicate act, which is something Season of the Witch doesn't manage very well. And that is a shame really, as the more grim supernatural parts of horror do work better than the more adventurous segments in the first part of the movie.\n\nWith a different script, and probably with a different leads, as Cage keeps hamming it up as he always does these days, just like Pearlman, the movie could have been better. It has some nice set pieces and at places the cinematography looks very nice and bleak. But the way it all is pieced together just feels like an unbalanced mess that does what you expect it to do: fall flat on the ground.\n\nThe clashing of the styles hits in from the start. It has witch hangings, which turn into b-horror clich\u00e9s, where it goes to the holy land crusades, where Cage and Perlamn fight side by side cracking bad jokes, to a horrific realisation of the cruelties of war to a more grim setting of a sickness savaged land where the would be anti-heroes escort an accused witch to her judgement.\n\nThe identity issues are what break the movie. It doesn't know how to pick a style and stay in it, so it just flings stuff at the viewer and hopes that something sticks. This does lead into that nothing does really stick and what could have been entertaining movie just doesn't work."

        "review_title": "Not bad, but too heavy-handed, and guided to the wrong ends",
        "review_detailed_main": "There's always storytelling potential in the concept of witches and medieval superstition, uncomfortably misogynist and backwards as such notions and history are. To read of this production, however, should naturally lead to some concerns, I think. The very term \"green screen\" has sordid and unwelcome connotations, from the agonizingly wooden bonanzas of the 'Star Wars' prequels to the increasingly uninteresting extravaganzas of Marvel. Meaning no offense to filmmaker Dominic Sena, but that his name is most associated with 2000's 'Gone in 60 seconds,' and only slightly less so with 2001's 'Swordfish,' doesn't inspire confidence for a period piece, even one steeped in action-adventure airs. It doesn't take long after 'Season of the witch' begins to ascertain the reasoning for such consternation, as it feels distinctly troubled by a certain brusqueness, and a lack of tact and nuance. Mind you, this is just fine for an action flick, and a genre piece. It's surely less acceptable, however, when there are Big Ideas and Major Themes at play, such as in the central characters of Behmen and Felson, deserters from the Crusades who question religious authority, let alone the extreme hypocrisy, injustice, and cruelty of the Church in its pursuit of witches. Unfortunately, that's just the start, and one sees quickly that the title is a rather mixed bag.\n\nI don't think this is outright bad. Those behind the scenes put in good work, including production design and art direction, costume design, hair and makeup, and practical effects and special makeup. Props, weapons, fight choreography, and stunts are swell. I like Atli \u00d6rvarsson's music, and Amir Mokri's cinematography, and the filming locations are simply gorgeous. I also think there's strong potential in Bragi F. Schut's screenplay - on paper this is fantastic, if imperfect; the quips given to Behmen and Felson's dialogue, and to a lesser extent Hagamar's, I could do without, at least their regularity. But in the broad strokes the dialogue is solid, and the characterizations; in the scene writing and overall narrative I find no major fault, perhaps just a tinge of heavy-handedness. And by all means, it's worth observing that there are several reputable, respectable, recognizable names and faces filling out this cast. Just look at the credits: Nicolas Cage, Ron Perlman, Stephen Graham, Robert Sheehan, and among others, even a small part for Christopher Lee! They've all had their ups and downs, but so does everyone, and we know what they're capable of given the opportunity; in theory just to see such actors together in one picture should be a minor joy.\n\nHowever, all these advantages start to lose their luster in light of execution that largely comes off as forced and unsubtle. The acting is hit or miss; Foy is a delight, making the most of the devious playfulness of her role, and Stephen Campbell Moore handles himself fairly well, but this isn't one of Cage's better displays. Graham tries, but Perlman is Just Kind of \"There,\" and Sheehan barely is; even with his minimal dialogue and time on-screen, Lee is reduced to chewing scenery. I appreciate that the digital effects artists can only work within the dicta that are handed to them, but the fact remains that the CGI is excessive, less than seamless or believable, and certainly less preferable compared to the practical effects that could have possibly been more generously employed instead. Meanwhile, it's not that I specifically blame Sena, but under his direction the heavy-handedness that lines the edges of Schut's writing is significantly amplified, almost becoming one of the defining facets of the feature as a whole. All the best ideas are overshadowed, all the best possibilities are simultaneously dampened and become overbearing, and the excitement and investment that the tale should inculcate can only barely keep 'Season of the witch' afloat.\n\nI think what it comes down to is that this seems to have been approached with the same common, regrettable ethos of too many action films, which is to say mostly one of coolness and style over substance. There is weight and drama in Schut's screenplay that barely comes across at all in the end result as action violence takes precedence. And hey, I get it - this was slated for a PG-13 rating, so presumably there was guidance in some fashion toward appealing to the younger audiences who tend to appreciate the immediate and visceral over the deep and lasting. That doesn't change the fact that such an attitude sacrifices What Could Have Been in this instance, and coerces all those making contributions to the production into neat little corners. I don't think this is \"bad,\" I do think it's mildly enjoyable, and there was interesting potential in many regards. As it stands, however, the picture we got was less than exceptional, less than perfectly entertaining, and not nearly as engrossing as it might have been. Whatever your motivation is for watching 'Season of the witch,' there are a lot worse ways you could spend your time, but unless you for some reason have a pressing and urgent need, there are far more important movies that should take priority over this one."

Less than a year after release it comes up on TV and I should have taken that as a bit of a warning. I do like a decent sword and sorcery movie like the best of us, but I'm afraid this one is a pretty poor effort. Despite the presence of Nic Cage and Ron Pearlman and a huge budget, it just can't hold a candle to many better examples. I will tell you more of my dismay after this brief summary.\n\nHaving fought with great distinction in the Crusades, Behmen and his friend Felson become disillusioned with the cause. The leave and head for home only to find the land plagued by a pestilence. The blame is laid on a girl who has confessed to being a witch. The pair are tasked with taking her to a remote monastery where the last surviving copy of a book of spells that can render her powerless exists. Accompanying them will be a priest, Debelzaq, a local knight, Eckhart and their guide, a swindler called Hagamar. They are later joined by a boy, Kay, who wants to prove himself and become a knight. What dangers await this band of travellers on this perilous journey? Is the girl all she claims to be? Well, I guess I can't tell you that right now or the Spoiler Police will throw me in the stocks (again).\n\nIt's all quite well shot with some nice CGI, nothing that hasn't been seen before, but quite nicely done. As far as performances go, well, with a poor script (IMO) they all struggled to shine and so honourable mentions go to; Nicolas Cage as Behmen, Ron Perlman as Felson, Stephen Campbell Moore as Debelzaq, Stephen Graham as Hagamar, Ulrich Thomsen as Eckhart, Claire Foy as The Girl, Robert Sheehan as Kay and finally, it was nice to see Christopher Lee, albeit briefly, as Cardinal D'Ambroise.\n\nAlthough I quite liked the premise of this one the execution was woefully wide of the mark. Firstly, to have American accents in a film set in the middle ages I find totally wrong. If you're going to do that, set it in some fantasy land (I give you the 'Conan' films as an example). I have already alluded to the fact that the script was poor, well, the script and the plot both left a lot to be desired. I don't know who they think they're target audience is, but please give us some credit, we don't have to be spoon-fed the entire thing! I will, however, give credit for some nice CGI, costumes, there ware a couple of decent fight scenes and an acceptable musical score. Apart from that, there wasn't a lot to recommend this one, and so, sadly, it's another in the ever longer list of Nic Cage films that gets deemed\u0085 NOT recommended.\n\nMy score: 5.2/10.\n\nIMDb Score: 5.4/10 (based on 31,634 votes at the time of going to press).\n\nRotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 10/100 (based on 111 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 32/100 (based on 73,190 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

Though I'm not a Nicholas Cage fan by any means, I remember liking Ron Perlman in Hellboy so we gave it a chance.\n\nThe opening scene was thrilling! Half way through the movie I realised that I was still wondering how everything would unravel, which is a bit surprising for a movie of this genera. There were some good old fashioned spooks, which left me clinging to my Fianc\u00e9's arm, and the continuous chase effect had me at the edge of my seat. Near the end of the movie, the plot took a few twists, including a gender choice for a character that I will not discuss so not to give away the movie here... because you will see it won't you!? All in all I had a blast giggling about Nicholas Cage's hair, and the goofy parts of the movie fluidity that weren't meant to be taken seriously. We all know the plague doesn't look like that but who cares!!?? Very reminiscent of a good old fashioned 80's adventure movie and I loved it! So there!"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Season of the Witch' \u2013 put simply \u2013 Lord of the Rings, it is not. It is a (modern) Nicholas Cage film. And, as any die-hard fan (and I'm including myself in that bracket) will know, his modern films don't really rate as highly as those he made in his heyday.\n\nNicholas Cage plays... well, Nicholas Cage in a suit of armour. His natural charm and screen presence do their best to shine through as this time out he and Ron Perlman are knights returning from hacking a few dozen hordes of computer-generated barbarians to death in the Crusades. However, life in yesteryear was never destined to run smoothly and the Black Death only goes and kicks off, leaving thousands dead in whichever 'England-like' land this film is supposed to be set in.\n\nNow, you may be forgiven for thinking that a plague of epic proportions has nothing to do with a couple of battle-hardened knights. That's until the king tells them that they're charged with the task of escorting a witch across the land to be burned. Apparently, it's all her fault or something and she totally needs to be roasted in order to save the universe. Or something.\n\nAnyway, so begins the quest \u2013 the not-at-all-like-Lord-of-the-Rings quest. Nic, Ron and a few meaningless codpiece-wearing extras all trudge wearily across one grassy hill after the next, all the while defending against one computer-generated threat after the next. Um, and that's about it. It's hardly 'epic' \u2013 it's pretty much by the numbers. In the scale of things it's not that bad, but then it's not that good either. You can dip in and out of this film at your leisure and you won't really miss a thing.\n\n'Season of the Witch' is one of those films which has only one fault: its total and utter 'averageness.' You'll have seen it all before and, despite Nic and Ron doing their very best to raise it above being just another B-movie, they really can't do it with this script, plot or (not so) special effects.\n\nIf you really love Nic or Ron that much, you may get something out of it. Otherwise, don't really bother. And don't get me started on Nic's haircut."

The script is dull and not much of it seems to be spoken in a way that I would imagine Templar Knights saying it. There is no real excitement in the action scenes, the heroes are curiously unconcerned by the plague that they encounter everywhere, and evil creatures of various sorts are dispatched in a predictable manner.

After he's had his fill of killing people, he and his battle buddy--played by the underrated and physically intimidating Ron Perlman--get rooked into transporting a witch to a monastery where she is promised a fair trial. (Followed by a first-class hanging.)\n\nWhat I liked about the film: --Cage and Perlman. They play battle-fatigued/world-weary parts great. I believed the two could push people around like brooms. Men who have seen too much and could still joke like brothers. --The questions asked by characters; like \"we had a plague in my village and there was no witch.\" Who knows? Maybe people in the 12th century asked questions like that. --Plague makeup; disgusting. Didn't check if it was historically accurate. Also, the doctor's masks. --Scenery. Dark, haunting, beautiful.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the film: --All the main characters looked too pretty. And they had too many teeth for the time period. For soldiers, Cage and Perlman's characters should have had more visible scars. They didn't look like they had been through battle until the end of the film. --Why couldn't the real devil had been the one inside the human soul? Fear, malice, lust, power. The minute they introduced a demon it turned into a cartoon for me."

Season of the Witch wasn't one I was looking forward to, as it has a pretty poor reputation, and Cage and Ron Perlman as 14th century knights always seemed like an odd choice.\n\nTurns out, it was an odd choice. They're two actors I like but they didn't really fit here. For some reason I was okay with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as medieval French knights in The Last Duel, but couldn't suspend my disbelief here.\n\nAt the start this wasn't as bad as I'd been led to believe. Sort of just average medieval fantasy action adventurey stuff. But you realise the film doesn't have many places to go by the halfway point, and it gets a bit tedious. The okay but not great for their time special effects give way to some awful ones in the finale. It fumbles the landing pretty badly, and hardly even took off in the first place.\n\nMaybe there's a little goofy fun to be had in a few scenes, and Cage yells at least once, which is always good. And it's certainly not his worst movie, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone at the same time (unless you're like me and find value in the occasional bad movie. It helps me appreciate the good ones more, and brings an overall balance to a film diet)"

Granted I have only seen about 13 other movies from this year, but this is the worst by far.\n\nThe plot is nothing complex, Nic Cage and his friend have left the church, but they are called back to take a woman accused of witchcraft to her trial. That's about it, nothing special, but that's not my problem with the movie, my problem is that the movie is really boring. The action scenes are absolutely terrible, they're shot horribly, the cinematography is pretty bad, and it isn't as epic as the film thinks it is.\n\nAlso, the costumes, look bad as well, and even some of the sets look bad, I might forgive it if it was a straight to DVD or TV movie. And the CGI is also (beep). There is a scene with werewolves, or maybe their just wolves, and they go through some kind of change that makes them look more ferocious, and the transition is so bad. And the main bad guy was also pretty unconvincing.\n\nThere are a few things I liked, I did kind of like the beginning, it did have a pretty good jump scare, and it kept my attention. Some of the acting is OK, I like Nick Cage, even if I haven't seen him in a lot, only Kick-ass, Knowing, and the National Treasure movies. And it is nice that it doesn't completely rely on CG, having a lot of practical stuff, but that doesn't' stop the movie from being boring, I mean I looked at the time every three minutes just begging for it to end, occasionally just turning away and getting on the internet. When you make a one hour and 30 minute movie feel like 3 hours, you have done something wrong."

Cage stars in this film as Behmen, a knight who fought in the Crusades in the 14th century. As he returns home, he is forced to accept the perilous mission of escorting a witch to a monastery, where the monks would perform a ritual on her hoping to put an end to the Black Plague.\n\nI liked the premise of the film and the fact that it was set in the middle ages because it offered the ingredients for a good movie. While there were parts that were really entertaining, the film suffers from a poor script and a lack of chemistry between the actors. There were moments when I was given the impression that none of the people behind this film actually believed in what they were doing. Take for instance lead actor Nicolas Cage who is a very good actor, but he never manages to be truly convincing in this movie. The same thing can also be said about his costar, Ron Perlman. They were never believable in their roles as 14th century knights and it's sad to see such talent wasted.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" is a film that had great potential, but it is a misfire in the end. While it is not as bad as some might say, it is poorly executed and it is one of Nicolas Cage's most forgettable movies.\n\nMy rating: 4,5/10"

Why are the knights all fighting on foot ? Many of these battles happened years apart. Styria is in Austria, a country with no coast at sea.\n\nI can look beyond that however, few Hollywood movies (if any) are historicall correct. What is a problem however is the script.\n\nA bunch of knights return from various crusades in the middle east, one of them has problems with his conscious after all the killing and bloodshed. Upon their return they found that their homeland is ravaged by the black death and a witch persecution paranoia. One young woman is considered cursed and held responsible for the plague and the knights (along with a few friends) are ordered to escort them to a monastery to verify and possibly exorcise the young woman.\n\nWhat follows is your typical fellowship quest movie (a genre I normally love) full of silliness and inconsistencies. At one point the accused witch is helping the fellowship, in the next she's trying to kill them. One moment she's a helpless victim, the next she's a supernatural monster who can rip any armoured knight to shreds. There is very little flow in it.\n\nIs everything bad ? No, the production values are pretty high, there is some nice props and scenery and like I said, I always enjoy a good \"fellowship on an epic quest\" type of movie.\n\nEnjoy it as an appetizer, just don't expect anything spectacular."

While on the voyage they begin to wonder if the prisoner really is a witch. Has many of you know by now,I am not a Nicolas Cage fan at all. After the disaster that was \"Drive Angry\" I was less then thrilled about this one. While the acting was about what you expect from him, the movie could have been worse. That said, the movie was the most middle of the road, average thing I have seen in a long time. Besides the ridiculous battle scenes in the beginning there was really no constant action. They start on a journey to escort the witch, the encounter such dangerous perils as...a bridge (which is a ten minute scene). The ending comes out of nowhere (reminded me of \"From Dusk Till Dawn) but even that doesn't seem to carry enough excitement. There are some movies that leave you feeling with a strong opinion and you can't stop talking about them. Then there are some that you really like but only remember when someone brings them up. This is the kind that you mostly forget as you are watching and leaves you feeling like you have accomplished nothing. Overall, not a bad movie, but not a good one. Really just a nothing movie.

There they must take her to a monastery in the mountains to face trail and so the monks can stop the plague, but the trek offers up some surprises for our travellers. If it wasn't for Ron Perlman's humorlessly dry and comradely performance, it would have been a completely bland and dour experience. What starts off as rather suggestive and atmospheric with a touch of suspense (bridge sequence), goes over-the-top with its religious bigotry and in its second-rate CGI of demons and dead possessed monks in its nonsensical finale.

        "review_detailed_main": "Upon watching the trailer for this movie I was intrigued yet I did not expect to see the masterpiece I just saw. I have watched other movies starring Nicolas Cage which comment on the supernatural but I think this is the best one.\n\nSuffice it to say that Nicolas Cage won my otherwise wavering respect for him until now (solely based on movies he has starred in.) Not only was he very convincing in a very difficult part to play but he also delivered more emotion than I've probably ever seen by him. Kudos also to Claire Foy who was the most convincing witch I ever saw on screen.\n\nI also loved Ron Pearlman's performance which I found a very powerful, who also had great chemistry with Nicolas Cage.\n\nOverall, Season of the Witch is a very good story - very well told set in a very vivid and beautifully created historical landscape of the period of the crusades."

Cage and Perlman are a well matched pair and their acting is perfect for this movie. This is a great movie for a Friday/Saturday night. Don't expect an Oscar, it's not that type of boring movie :-). It's a well made medieval fare that holds interest and entertains The one short coming is the ending which while appropriate is heavily CGI'd and of poor quality at that, but the cheap CGI aside, I enjoyed the ride. Cage never disappoints."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am convinced that the rather small rating for this film can be mainly attributed to the current fad of criticising Nicholas Cage movies. Season of the Witch has very interesting ideas, many well executed, and I would deem it as worth watching. I will explain why.\n\nThe heroes of the film are Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman, two crusaders with a conscience, who disgusted by their latest conquest resulting in slaughter of women and children, decide to desert the cause and return home. The only thing that awaits them is the plague and a mysterious (sexy young) witch accused of bringing it onto the Earth. One must take her to a special place where a magical book is found that can dispel the horrible disease. Guess who gets to do that?\n\nThe beginning and end scenes were horrible. I would say they lowered the overall quality of the movie. What I found very interesting was the dilemma of Cage's character, who is doubtful that the girl is actually a witch and desires her brought to fair trial. Most of the other characters were also quite complex, escaping the cardboard clich\u00e9 of doom and enriching the script. The acting was good, the effects reasonable, without being much over the top.\n\nBottom line: if one can forgive the occasional scenes that are completely lame and seem seeded by a demonic presence in an otherwise decent film, the movie is quite watchable, certainly above the average of the genre. I've enjoyed watching it and may so will you."

Good story with a decent twist and one of the better fantasy/adventure films I've seen in a long long time. In fact I found it immensely enjoyable from start to finish. There is the odd bit of \"cheese\" and granted it isn't Lord ofthe Rings or Game of Thrones but nor does a 5.3 seem to be accurate. Toall their own I guess. I would ignore the ratings here though and give this movie a chance. It's one of those rare movies that actually goes against the grain of IMDb ratings in my opinion. IMDb is usually very accurate though I will admit and I've found that a huge percentage ofthe reviews are a very good depiction of the actual quality of themovie. Again this confuses me with Season of the Witch as the reviews on this movie seem to go against that grain."

Showing abnormal strength and sly smiles the witch is anything the innocent young woman she appears to be. The sweetess and innocence she exudes at other times meddles with your mind. On the whole this girl is someone not to get too close to because anything can happen and it usually does. The movie gets gory without being overdone. The horror is mild and based on surprise with the appropriate music to shock. I liked this movie there are no boring spots and the action does not stop. I was surprised to find this a 2011 film as it takes on more of a modern standard and makes great viewing."

It reminded me most of the kind of old movies you see on Mystery Science theatre, with bad dialog and bad acting, but still compelling enough to watch. Ron Perleman as Cages sidekick is outstanding, and worth watching. As I said, the story is good with two outlaw crusaders tasked with brining a witch to a monestary in exchange for deserting the crusades. Lots of twists andlots of fighting as you try and figure out if the girl is really a witch. There is also a lot of stunning alpine scenery. I say check it out, you may be surprised as I was. I say this strictly from a netflix perspective or 99 cent redbox. People who are paying 4.99 on cable may want to think about it."

        "review_title": "Fact or Fiction",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those films that is more of a message than it is a form of entertainment. Case in point ... when Nic Cage is being chastised by the Priest, in the beginning of the film, the average person had to be thinking ... kill that lousy creep, Nic! That is what I was thinking! And, actually, during that moment in the film you wonder why it takes so long for Ron Perlman to pull Nic away. Dead space exists in this film a lot. But more importantly, this film shows exactly how the power of the church corrupted so many people during that period, and, truthfully, is still doing such. Yes, I believe in GOD, I just don't believe in the church ... and this is exactly what this film is all about ... walking away from the church ... not GOD ... just the church ... and it delivers that message with perfection. Unfortunately, some reviewers of this film didn't get the message, so they did not see the point of the movie. Get a clue! Now, I am not a Nicolas Cage fan ... the man is not that good of an actor, mostly because he takes himself too seriously, and approaches acting much in the same manner that Troy Donahue use to approach his films ... as a scientist of sorts ... dissecting each and every role to the point of sheer boredom, while trying to out act everyone else around him. That makes him a pretty crappy actor with an arrogance that ruins his parts in most of the movies he takes on. The man is just too full of himself ... which showed, to extremes, when it came to Hollywood honoring his as some fantastic actor for a whole boring evening that was actually televised. One has to wonder how he pulled that off ... as he's not that likable! Maybe it was part of his contract for accepting some part, who knows ... all I know is that no other actor/actress has ever received such a tribute, and there are hundreds of actors that are a million times better at their job than Nic Cage! Hey, I said I wasn't a Nic Cage fan! The only talent this man seems to have is in his choosing the right movies to accept a part in, much like Tom Snooze! And ... Nicole ... get over it already, the marriage was doomed from the very first encounter! You are worth a million Tom Snoozes! Ron Perlman ... I am a fan, to a certain point, of Ron's ... because, like so many other women, I fell in love with The Beast, in Beauty and The Beast. But that is exactly what women were suppose to do. What a series that was! I need to buy those DVDs! Anyhoots ... when it comes to Ron Perlman, he can out act practically any actor due to his being so natural in any role he accepts. The camera does not intimidate Ron, which is a true victory for any actor. However, I have disliked most of the roles he has chosen, but that is because I didn't like the movies, or the subject matter, but I watched many of them, just to see a good actor do what a good actor does best! By the way, don't mistake being in love with a character with being in love with an actor ... frankly, far too many people don't seem to be able to separate the two. Its easy to separate the two once you've actually met, or spied upon, the actor in real life. No, not stalking ... just observing them in public places. Some of the greatest actors are some of the worse people you'd ever not want to meet ... trust me! Nic Cage, on the other hand is quite the opposite of Ron Perlman.\n\nChristopher Lee is also in the movie ... that was an extra treat to see such a distinguished Hollywood icon still doing what he loves doing best! Robert Sheehan was also quite good in his part as the altar boy turned hero. He should have a very bright, and quite lengthy, career as an entertainer. And, three cheers for Claire Foy ... not bad at all, Claire ... keep up the good work! The special effects of the film were unbelievable ... especially when it comes to how one of the actors is killed towards the end ... talk about cremation ... Good Job, guys! This movie could have been a real winner if the casting of its lead actor would have been more thought out, and if the story had ended when, the character, Behmen von Bleibruck died and the film faded to black."

They kill for Jesus until they figure out they killed a whole town of women and children. They desert, come to a town struck with plague, get arrested. Christopher Lee as the sick cardinal gives them a redemption task to take the supposed witch who is to blame for the plague to a far off monastery where the monks have spells to end it all. Already a perfect movie, right? On the way they tackle challenges like crossing a ramshackle bridge and fighting off a pack of angry wolves. I wanted their travel never to end, I loved it. The no homo chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman is brilliant, but there's no the so characteristic for the new movies bullshit where they hint about their adventure, laugh about it but we don't know what they're talking about. Their guide is played by Stephen Graham (Tommy from Snatch and one of the skinheads from This Is England), a the witch is superhot. I like the subtle sexual implications in the dialogues. The only thing that sucks was the ending, partly because of the CGI. But all in all an old school adventure, I like it, humour, action, adventure. I mean how can Dominic Sena not make a film with a heart after making Gone in 60 Seconds. I watched it in a theater, and the movie is so fun I didn't mind the retards behind me, bunch of arrogant kids in front of me and and a bunch of easily scared jailbaits at my side."

        "review_detailed_main": "10 November 2011. This fusion of psychological thriller and occult horror set in the Medieval times offers a fascinating plaguing plot outline that combines emotionally taut tension and a more layered action thriller. The script plays on the audiences cultural sympathies of beauty and innocence, the less than pure religious Crusades and religious fervor, and the ominous blackness of witchcraft. Using the imbalance of reality and fantasy, the slow twisting plot keeps the audience off balance as to who to trust, though the script twists seem to leak out perhaps too much in places. Unlike Stigmata (1999) or Constantine (2005), the action and pacing is more visceral as the setting and period of Feudalism plays as strong and immersive backdrop to the overall mood and emotional presence in the movie. There is more of an attempt to allow the lavish set design and historical fears and magical motions to infuse the movie with energy in a similar way that the historical period crime drama genre movie The Name of the Rose (1986) or even Saving Private Ryan (1998). Even though there are two-dimensional characterizations found in Season of the Witch, the action nature of the movie is put more secondary to the ultimate martyr portrayal that is the basis of this movie and the epic heroic man presentation of integrity and courage more in line with 300 (2006), Apocalypse Now (1979), Apocalypto (2006).\n\nThe translation onto the small screen, however, diminishes the haunting impact of the cinematography. And perhaps the storyline become too predictable, descending in a more traditional fight between good and evil by the end.\n\n5/1/2019. This movie retains an emotional and mental punch throughout with its creepy ambiance and serious and sweeping depiction of this ancient period along with its passionate embrace of evil's seductive embrace and the sacrifices it entails. Quite watchable, again. Revised from seven to eight out of ten."

In fact all of North Africa was originally Christian/ Jewish before the Muslims took over. I personally wish they had been more successful looking @ the Middleast today but I digress.The film is a straight forward good action flick but I do wish they had given more dialog to Claire Foy. She is a good theater/TV actress known for her TV role in the BBC series Little Dorrit.Also as other have mentioned to buddy characters of Cage and Perlmann worked for me and Sheehan as the young alter boy came across as he was supposed to scared but faced his fears in the end. True there could have been more/ better dialog but the scenery was great,the action kept moving and the twist at the end was nice.Movie took some knocks at the church but that just played into the troubled knight theme and actually was pretty supportive in the end.Overall not bad and the major movie critics who blistered it are way off.Good movie."

But the movie is stolen by the always excellent Ron Perlman who plays Felton his best buddy who has been through many battles fighting by his side & you believe it!!!\n\nRon Perlman is such a damn good actor that he completely over shadows the lead Cage & that's Awesome as Felton is a better character who has fun as much as he can in this dark medieval world they exist in & it's a great little performance for a role that could just be a silly B movie role but Perlman always gives more & elevates his performance!!!\n\nThe two buddy warriors have to escort a witch to another village far away for a trial & that's the mission it's our story nice & simple & it's about the dangerous journey across dark forests fighting off supernatural wolves & it's all good gothic adventure fun & very enjoyable. Cage & Perlman are helped out by a decent little cast in their group of monks & Mercenary warriors with Stephen Graham & others.\n\nWhat \"Season of the Witch\" has in bucket loads is spooky & gloomy atmosphere & the look is gothic & the Cinematography is gorgeous, we get a grim, gritty & gloomy ancient civilization of the B. C era with \"the Plague\" wiping out towns & on top of that we have terrifying demonic Witches & our heroes are mix up in the middle of it all.\n\nThis should definitely become a Cult Classic as it so deserves its status!!! Incredible production design & sets & an exciting adventure story with a nice friendship at it's core. The demonic Witches look fantastic too, great special effects.\n\nA good little Supernatural adventure with some Horror & humour but the ending could have been much better but hey it does all make sense & for a reason so not too bad.\n\nGood late night entertainment & an excellent performance by the tough rugged Ron Perlman who infact was so great here it's the best I've seen him since his HellBoy days!!!\n\nI've been a huge fan of Ron Perlman since Alien Resurrection (1997) that's when i really noticed what a cool tough hero this guy was & what a great screen presence he has he's rugged tough like another Tom Atkins or Charles Bronson that's how i see him & I've brought many films over the years just because he's in it!!!\n\nA great mix of Horror, fantasy & adventure."

The following: 1. Suspenseful- it constantly kept you guessing, wondering who was the bad guy and who wasn't. What would happen next and why it was all happening. 2. Brain Power- you actually had to think a little bit about this movie. NO the plot is not written out in the first twenty minutes, you actually have to wait till the END to figure everything out. I liked it, that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.\n\nThe only down side was... The Visual Effects. It was good up until the end, i wont spoil it. But the craziness was still there.\n\nSo I gave it an 8/10. Trust me it's WAY better than some of the movies they've nominated and given awards for."

Everyone here reviewing this seems to be taking the movie seriously, but don't make that mistake. Instead, go for the unintentionally comedic b-movie crapfest this is--you won't be sorry. It's a cult classic for sure.\n\nThe plot is dumb and derivative genre nonsense. There's a witch I guess, some knights who have to go somewhere. There's plague, and every other trope the assuredly stoned writers could dredge up. I don't remember how the movie ends, and I own it and have watched it probably 5 times through, but it doesn't matter. This is a late night movie when you just want something to laugh at. Nick Cage at his very worst. My god it's good.\n\nIt's as if they tried to make Monty Python and the Holy Grail serious for some reason, failed terribly, and ended up with something just as silly as the original."
