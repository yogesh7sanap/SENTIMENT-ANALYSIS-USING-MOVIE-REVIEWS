I'd seen the trailer and it looked good... and it was, until about halfway through the movie where, in my opinion, it went off the rails with a stupid plot twist. I understood the twist and everything that transpired after, but felt it unnecessary and worse, that the movie would have been better without it, sticking to it's original setup. The whole landscape of the film changes after that twist and not for the better - it feels like it exists just so it can exist, and not for the betterment of the story."

His ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) tracks him down despite his fake identity. She is willing to pay him $10 million to kill her husband Frank Zariakas (Jason Clarke) who abuses her and Baker's son Patrick.\n\nThe first half seems to be trying for Hitchcock but various mannerisms and unreality kept dragging it down. One could see the changes needed to keep this on track better. Then the skinny guy shows up with the suitcase. The story takes a left turn. I'm still no in love with the twist. I do appreciate that it made the movie more cohesive. This is not the best. I'd rather have it go straight but I'm willing to give the twist some leeway."

Not a good drama, not a good thriller, and so-so mystery/fantasy. I only recommend it to the fans of Matthew McConaughey, otherwise, save your time."

In fact, it may even be outright bad. But I'll be damned if there was a single moment in the film where I was less than entertained. I laughed more during the course of Serenity's runtime than I did at a good majority of last year's intentional comedies.\n\nThe performances were attempting to evoke a noir feel but came across more John Waters and the camp factor alone was a fascinating hybrid of cringy and hysterical. From Matthew McConaughey drinking during nearly every frame of the movie to Anne Hathaway saying \"daddy\" every other line, I won't forget their acting any time soon.\n\nThe plot is a convoluted mess and some of the turns it took won't be well-received but who cares? By the time the \"twists\" twisted, I was already so engrossed by this deranged piece of filmmaking that I didn't mind one bit.\n\nGo with incredibly low expectations, try to lose yourself in the strange spell Serenity weaves, and you might just have as good a time as we did."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the trailer for Serenity back in summer 2018 I was certainly intrigued. Then it was pushed back many months from its original release date but I still looked forward to finally seeing the movie. Well I can say now that after some thought, I enjoyed the film. It was spoiled for me mildly in the sense that I knew an off the wall twist was in the cards. Boy was that twist a wild one.\n\nSerenity starts out a little wonky with the first 20 minutes or so having some unintentional laugh out loud moments. However once it gets going it becomes very intriguing and had me fully engaged. When the left field insane twist is revealed, I was impressed by the sheer nerve of it all. Sure it's beyond over the top, but having the audacity to do it is a thing to admire.\n\nThe acting is both good and bad at times. The whole movie always just feels a little off and bizarre, which I somewhat appreciate. Make no mistake about it though this work is not a masterpiece. Serenity has its share of faults and the ending could very well be one of them in some ways. Besides that it's also a messy script with some big head scratchers and horrible lines.\n\nWith that being said we need more wide release movies with quality actors taking chances and giving us something original. In a way the film is throwback to the 70's and 80's when we saw wide released movies taking experimental chances.\n\nGo give it a watch, love it or hate I think this work is something any true film fan will tip their cap to."

Silent cinema. Subtitles. Foreign. The techniques employed become acceptable.\n\nI loved the sheer ballsiness of everyone's commitment to this movie. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jason Clarke give it everything. And that only comes about by having confidence in the film.\n\nThe plot twists aren't there to surprise the audience in the manner of something like 'The Usual Suspects', they exist to create the feeling of a troubled conscience. Perhaps, that's what everyone is snickering at? When one of the most popular pass times is shaming people on social media to whom we feel superior, the idea of self doubt and uncertain morality are things we need to ridicule?\n\nI dunno. I'll say this: I was never bored watching this film, which is more than I can for most films these days. Some day it'll find a proper following. It deserves it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here lies the unwanted, unofficial final installment in the Matthew McConaughty sailor/treasure hunter trilogy accompanied by Sahara and Fool's Gold. Steven Knight follows up 2013's excellent Locke with this more ambitious (sci-fi?) melodrama. Locke being a minimal \"Let's film Tom Hardy during a car ride\" effort that wowed everyone with its staying power. This film could've easily been \"Let's film Matthew McConaughey during a fishing trip\" and would've been a much more compelling narrative. The \"expansive\" environment of the film's world spreads the logic of the premise so thin that pores begin to appear as soon as the opening act.\n\nMcConaughey plays Baker Dill, a renegade ex-pat that takes tourists out to fish tuna. He's also harbors a Moby Dick-esque obsession with a giant fish he calls Justice. If that sounds like a painfully obvious thematic motif, then you would be spot on. Baker's fixation with the creature frequently jeopardizes his excursion business, which puts himself in financial potholes. Then enters the most elementary conflict possible: Our protagonist is broke, and needs to make personal compromises to become rich. Baker's financial salvation arrives in his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) who has married up to possibly a construction tycoon (this is my best guess).\n\nKaren reveals the history of abuse that her current husband Frank (Jason Clarke) has dished out on her and Baker's son, Patrick. She offers Baker a proposition that would rid her of a slave master husband, and award Baker the funds to avoid prostituting his body and skills ever again. The remainder of the plot has us stuck to Baker as he goes through the rose pedal \"I do it; I don't\" charade. The brevity of this review is a result of the most lazy twist in recent memory, that makes spoiling the otherwise unsatisfying turn all too easy due to its painfully early reveal.\n\nThe grand meta-plot crashes in the door midway through the second act, and blows its load suddenly and all at once. We are literally served up a character whose sole purpose is to break the twist to Baker. After some rough housing from Baker, this mysterious prophet spills the beans with zero nuance, and the film ruins itself at a blistering pace. Then (as to pull a rug over the vomit) the film has Baker questioning the prophet's proclamation for what seems like eternity (Eternity would've been a more apt title upon further thought) regardless of the blatant signs plastered all around him.\n\nToo often movies hide behind plot-twists to avoid scrutiny, and this one cowards behind a skinny palm tree rather pathetically. Knight attempts to cash in on a video game industry that he clearly has no understanding of (I promise that checks out after you *if you* subject yourself to this film). If it weren't for the spoiler-free creed I hold myself to, then I would detail in full all the cringe-worthy missteps taken by this revision-free script. I suppose Knight wins this round, considering he has created an inscrutable film. The only winners are the viewers playing a cheeky drinking game whenever McConaughty's ass appears on screen. Screw it. Spoiler alert: The buns appear in four separate scenes."

The critics need to give their heads a shake.\n\nAs a huge fan of the 'Black Mirror' series, this film is right up there in the writing category, and I hope all Black Mirror fans get a chance to see this one, as it's a brilliant masterpiece!\n\nThis film produced, written and directed (only his 3rd directorial film) by British screenwriter, Steven Knight. He nailed this film in the directing department, and hit it out of the ballpark with his writing!\n\nMost of the critics called the writing \"bad dialogue\" and the acting \"cartoonish, especially that of Hathaway, whose femme fatale comes across as a kind of live-action Jessica Rabbit\". That IS the point, and what makes this film genius!\n\nI had no idea what I was going to see, and at first, it was a normal film about a drunk captain trying to catch the \"big one\". As the film progressed, I noticed the characters started to act off - starting with when the guy from FONTAINE Fishing Co. is introduced. This was done tactfully and started to elevate my curiosity. Then more and more characters started acting weird, especially when Anne Hathaway's character is introduced. By now you are sucked into some type of weird conspiracy, you can't stop watching! I don't want to give any more away, but the writing is pure genius... you just have to take your blinders off and go along for the ride.\n\nThe casting was sheer perfection. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jason Clarke and Djimon Hounsou were outstanding in their roles! Animated? yes, and rightfully so, and right on script!\n\nAs mentioned, the directing was spot on, and the cinematography on point. I loved the island setting, and the back and forth to the child in his room.\n\nThe pacing was good and the films length perfect at 106 min. The score/sound was also perfect. I have nothing negative to say about this film! It certainly is a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood blockbuster films. It's sad this film was not promoted properly, and I can understand how some viewers felt misled, but I on the other hand, enjoyed being misled into a whole different film from what I expected.\n\nI feel people should go into this film without seeing the trailer or reading the ridiculous negative reviews, and without any expectations, and they will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nBravo to the all-star cast, and to Steven Knight for creating such a brilliant film, and he should hold his head up high in creating this gem. Given time, I'm sure people will come around to appreciate its genius writing.\n\nIt's a WELL deserved 9/10 from me, and if anyone questions my review as being fake, click on my username and you will see my almost 600 reviews and 1000+ ratings. Ignore the haters and wannabe critics and watch this film, I'm sure you will be as surprised as I was."

The \"Moby Dick\" reference is strong, but the story structure allows for theming to evolve as the story continues.\n\nEach arc is interesting as if it is a new story using the same characters.\n\nWhile the journey definitely carries some intensity with it, the end is a bit vague and may leave you questioning not only what happened in the movie, but questioning reality."

        "review_detailed_main": "Serenity is one of the most underrated thrillers in recent memory that doesn't deserve the unfairly harsh critics and reviews it has received. The film tells the story of a fishing boat captain and war veteran who lives on a Carribean island. Even though he has left his bleak past behind him, he battles serious alcohol problems, has financial issues and has become quite grumpy. One day, his past comes back haunting him when his former wife finds him and tells him that her new husband abuses her physically and mentally which has a negative impact on their son. She asks her former husband to kill her new husband to save their son and stage it as an accident. The femme fatale is also willing to offer a hefty sum that would seemingly solve the captain's problems all at once. He needs to figure out whether he should reconnect with his past and become a murderer to save his son or ignore the offer and live with a heavy burden on his conscience.\n\nThis movie convinces on numerous levels. The plot certainly needs to be pointed out since it comes around with an unpredictable and creative twist halfway through the movie that changes your perception of everything that has happened up to that point and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the memorable bittersweet ending. The acting performances are great and especially Matthew McConaughey convinces as tough war veteran longing for peace of mind. The locations of the film are phantastic as they portray both the stunning landscapes of an isolated Carribean island but also show the negative impacts such a small community can have on its different members.\n\nMany critics were disappointed by the twist which prompted them to give the film exaggeratedly low ratings. It is certainly a very unusual twist that might be perceived controversially. However, it's a turn that is very unique and makes this movie stand out among similar crime flicks. It gives the film an unforgettable imaginative dimension that already makes it an early cinematic highlight of the year.\n\nIf you are someone who likes to think outside the box and longing for some risky storytelling, this movie certainly is for you. If you simply want to be entertained and like things by the numbers, you shouldn't watch Serenity. Personally, this film has been a very positive surprise, I will certainly purchase it legally in the future and make my family members and friends discover it as well."

Due to the full hand being revealed a little too early.\n\nIt starts out well enough, but there's no chance for the audience to be beguiled. We see where it's all headed too soon, so we just have to wait it out, until the film catches up with our expectations. Then we're slapped across the face with it repeatedly. In its own way, that's the only truly original part of the film; that it shows its hand so early, but insists on playing regardless. Yet it doesn't make for a satisfying experience.\n\nAnd then ending with a surprisingly saccharin scene takes out any of the sting that might have given it some real oomph. Another wasted opportunity.\n\nI only started paying attention to Anne Hathaway after Colossal-an incredible film-and she's as good in this as anything else, I suppose. But her character is not-quite-likeable, and hearing her call her hideous second husband 'daddy' is nauseating. And I don't think it could have hurt for us to have had some deeper connection and empathy for the real subject of the film. There's no emotional payoff at the end, so we're kind of left wondering...so what? Sigh. Maybe next time. It was a nice try."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. A seamless zoom shot through a young boy's eye, a plunge into the deep blue sea, and up across the ocean onto a boat ... that's the very cool opening to writer-director Steven Knight's latest film. It can be described as a 1990's style noirish, murder-for-hire drama with a contemporary twist, and it features a terrific cast. Unfortunately, all of that somehow adds up to a film that never really clicks.\n\nThis is Mr. Knight's first time in the director's chair since the excellent LOCKE in 2013. He's best known for his writing in such projects as \"Peaky Blinders\", EASTERN PROMISES, and his Oscar nominated DIRTY PRETTY THINGS. A resume like that lends itself to certain expectations; something that makes the messiness of this one all the more surprising.\n\nOscar winner Matthew McConaughey stars as Baker Dill, a boat captain who runs a charter fishing business at the edge of the world - a sleepy little remote tropic village called Plymouth Island. We learn pretty quickly that Mr. Dill is a few pickles short of a jar. With customers aboard, he gets the hook in the unicorn he's been chasing - a giant tuna he's named Justice. It's a frantic obsession that the locals call the fish that lives in his head. On a boat named Serenity, Captain Dill's less appealing side is exposed as he and his first mate Duke (Djimon Hounsou) fail to reel in the mighty fish.\n\nWith the significant exception of his money woes, Dill leads a pretty calm and under the radar life on Plymouth Island. He drinks at the local bar, lives in a makeshift cliff side container by the sea, and enjoys periodic frolicking with Constance, a local beauty played by Diane Lane. We soon learn that Justice the Tuna is just the first of two things that rock the serenity of Dill's world. The other is his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) who magically appears one night next to the bar stool he is planted on. It turns out she has tracked him down for the sole purpose of paying Dill to kill her abusive and filthy rich and thoroughly obnoxious husband Frank (Jason Clarke). It's also during this time that Dill is being chased down by Reid Miller, a nerdy and suspicious little salesman played by Jeremy Strong.\n\nKaren's plot would stand no chance if not for the son they share. Patrick (Rafael Sayegh) is an odd kid whom we only see writing code at lightning speed from his home computer. It's the Reid Miller character who clues us in on the twist; but rather than shift the movie into a higher gear, it feels like the air goes shooting out of the proverbial balloon. As shaky as the film, characters, and dialogue were, this twist turns it into a convoluted mess that changes everything we have watched to this point.\n\nMurder for hire/love films have been done many times and in many ways. Some of the best include Hitchcock's classic STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and Lawrence Kasdan's steamy BODY HEAT from 1981. This film should never again be mentioned with those. Although the premise is interesting, this terrific cast certainly deserved better material. Filmed on Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, the little scenery we see are the film's highlights. Apparently all that Mr. Knight wishes to tell us is that life is a game ... and it might not end well. Not exactly breaking news."

He drives a fishing boat called Serenity and sails with his partner Duke (Djimon Hounsou) to catch a large tuna that he calls a beast. Day after day he goes after the tuna and returns empty-handed. As our protagonist Baker Dill has an extreme obsession similar to Captain Ahab with his whale Moby Dick. He has sex with his town girl, Constance (Diane Lane). However, his quiet life is shattered when his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) locates him with a desperate plea for help. She begs Dill to save her and her young son from her violent new husband (Jason Clarke). On Plymouth Island, no one dies... unless you break the rules!. There is a place where you can escape your past, as long as you follow all the rules! The truth lies beneath the surface!\n\nRenowned actors Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway star in this unclassifiable drama with shades of psychological thriller focused on the ghosts of a veteran sailor's past, meanwhile this fishing boat captain juggles to face his mysterious past and finds himself trapped in a reality where he swims. Is what it seems. The film was written and directed by Steven Knight, creator of the series \"Peaky Blinders\" and screenwriter of the famous film \"Eastern Promises\", and \"Amazing Grace\" and introduces us to a disturbing world of poignant situations and dark requests. Passable although somewhat exaggerated performance by Matthew McConaughey, - always showing off or showing his bizeps - as a tormented boat captain obsessed with fishing for a coveted, difficult-to-catch tuna, alongside the suspicious and abused wife played by Anne Hattaway in a very different role. To which we are accustomed. The cast is completed by the following actors who give adequate performances: Diane Lane as Constance, Jason Clarke as Jason Clarke, Djimon Hounsou as Duke and Jeremy Strong as Reid Miller. The film makes strong references to some famous literary works, including \"Herman Melville's Moby Dick\" , \"Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea\" and \u00a8Shakespeare's The Tempest\u00a8, among others.\n\nHere, the luxurious maritime photography and the colorful beach exteriors photographed by cameraman Jess Hall, shot on location in Mauritius, stand out. The film, with an exciting and vibrant score by Benjamin Wallfisch, was unevenly directed by Steven Knight. He is a prestigious writer and director. He has written notable films and television series: \u00a8Woman Walks Ahead\u00a8, \u00a8The Girl in the Spider's Web\u00a8, \u00a8Locked Down\u00a8, \u00a8Spencer\u00a8, \u00a8SAS Rogue Heroes\u00a8, \u00a8Great Expectations\u00a8, \u00a8Taboo\u00a8, \u00a8See\u00a8, \u00a8Peaky Blinders\u00a8 and has directed some films: \u00a8Serenity\u00a8, \u00a8Redemption\u00a8 and \u00a8Locke\u00a8. \"Serenity\" rating: 6/10. A better than average movie for Matthew McConaughey fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "Serenity (2.5 out of 5 stars).\n\nSerenity sure is something for a neo-noir thriller film that does mislead you on what the actual plot is about. Matthew McConaughey delivered a good performance. Sadly, the film falls flat as a mystery thriller that tries play smart but gives you an empty satisfying result. Kind of reminded me how the sci-fi thriller Transcendence film with Johnny Depp was. Delivered an interesting mind bending concept but an empty satisfaction of the results.\n\nThe plot follows Baker (Matthew McConaughey) who lives in a small town on an island. He is obsessed on trying to catch a large tuna fish known as \"Justice.\" So obsessed, he pushes aside his own visitors that pay him to take them out to sea. When his ex wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) shows up on the island. She asks for his help to take her husband Frank (Jason Clarke) out to sea and kill him. Cause he has been abusing her and her son.\n\nThat is enough what I can say about the plot without giving away details or spoilers. Besides, it is one of those movies were the plot changes gears in the middle of the second act. With a lot of people on the island being suspicious and not knowing a clue about anything. Or a stranger Reid (Jeremy Strong) that shows up in a suit and is creepily staring at Matthew McConaughey throughout. Or walking through the ocean in a suit. The film does have a great amount of mystery ideas. With Baker being obsessed with this tuna fish. Figuring out everyone's motive on the island. The twist is a game changer that turns the film into a different direction. It is not as surprising or shocking when it is revealed.\n\nMatthew McConaughey delivered a good performance as Baker. Along with Anne Hathaway. Jason Clarke was okay playing an abusive character. The direction is kind of dull. It tries to build some suspense and mystery. Instead, it is a tedious thriller that is forgettable.\n\nOverall, Serenity is a bad film. It started out great. It has an interesting concept of ideas with this mystery building of people being weird on an island. After the twist is revealed, it did not leave a satisfying shock factor besides it probably will be forgettable once the credits begin."

If we were supposed to feel some sense of \"Justice\" by what happened, I don't get it, there's no justification that makes it right. What the director seems to want the audience to feel Is some deeper meaning and connection, but all I was left with was a feeling of how creepy this kid is. An exaggeration, but it was made as much sense as it would have to hear some uplifting score playing while an axe wielding maniac was chopping through the bathroom door in the Shining. It just didn't sit well with me, and as the twist became more obvious, it felt like the whole town morphed into some Truman Show mode and got a little ridiculous."

They each usually display the depth and nuance of a coffee table. However, I gave Serenity a whirl, and I'm quite pleased that I did.\n\nI mean, this movie is no masterpiece, but it isn't the 2 star dud some reviewers here make it out to be either. Sure, Mr McConaughey makes good use of both his major skill points: Shouting At The Sky, and Gazing Furiously At The Floor. Obviously, he also waves his bottom at you. Anne Hathaway turns up, as usual, and leaves it at that. So far, so predictable. It's a little bit stilted, a little bit weird, and oddly...flat. But! Don't leave before the magic happens.\n\nAll things considered, I really liked this movie. Once you understand why the characters behave as they do, it becomes properly interesting. Motivation becomes clear, the demeanour of some characters makes sense, and it does tie most of its loose ends. I mean, it doesn't tie them very well - it all ends up a bit of a tangle, but, that too makes sense in the context of the story. I expected it to be risible, and I fully intended to hate it but it wasn't, and I didn't. Believe me when I say that nobody was more surprised at this outcome than me.\n\nI liked this movie, and I want you to like it too."

Without any exaggeration, I think this is one of the worst movie twists I have ever seen. It completely ruined the movie for me. You don't have to be a genius to see it coming either, the whole time I was thinking 'oh boy, I really don't hope they're taking this route'.\n\nThis was pretty dubious, as the movie trailer suggested something entirely else, so I think it's not weird if you feel a bit duped. With a heavy hitting cast like this, I doubt whether they chopped and changed this movie up during production. I can hardly believe that any of these actors would go along with such a bad script. But ah well, that's only speculation from my end. Still I think the cast tried to make the best of it.\n\nSince I enjoyed the first half of the movie, I still give it a 5.

I didn't like this movie and neither did many people. The trailer was really good and made it look so interesting. The cast was stellar and it looked to make for a good thriller. The script and plot was what actually ruined it. It was so boring. Oscar nominated Steven Knight has wrote some good scripts and directed a couple good movies (Locke being one of my favorite). He had the right idea with the plot, but made it lackluster with the most bizarre twist halfway through. That twist literally had me laughing in my seat because it didn't work and it was just so random. If anyone who contributed to the $4.4 million it made this past weekend (the budget was $25 million and it'll never make that back) they probably agree. The start of the movie made it look kind of like it was going to be a 90s thriller on water. Even the score, cinematography, and title looked like that which I thought was odd. Speaking of cinematography, every time a new character was introduced they did a fast cut from their back to their face which was annoying. I don't know what to say. I don't feel like spoiling the twist because I don't want to talk about that whole mess. It could've been interesting but the way it was executed and with the whole script and story it didn't work. The leads did fine with their acting and there were a couple cool looking shots, but overall this was a big mess that had so much potential.\n\nMy Grade: D"

I truely don't understand why this man is still being casted for movies. He also seems to be playing the same dude in every film he makes, drunk, scruffy and conflicted. Why are people not done with this one trick pony? I was exceptionally disappointed with Anne Hathaway. Why she decided to participate in this film is unclear to me. She also didn't act very well.\n\nThe story is very predictable although I don't think is was meant to be predictable. I think it was intended to be original, unexpected and refreshing.

Rarely has it seemed like said game of Mad Libs was still being played during principal photography. A film like Serenity (not to be confused with the 2005 Firefly film) has no business taking itself this seriously, let alone seriously at all.\n\nIt starts out with a clich\u00e9 tsunami; not a regular tsunami, ergo the tropical island we visit remains safe. Matthew McConaughey plays, or at least delivers the lines of Baker Dill, a man who fishes for a giant tuna known as \"Justice\" when he isn't visiting Diane Lane for a quick shag. The enigmatic Reid (Jeremy Strong) is following Baker around and fellow fisher Duke (Djimon Hounsou) delivers anvilicious words of wisdom.\n\nThen suddenly there's Karen (Anne Hathaway), Baker's femme fatale ex-wife who tells Baker she and their son are being terrorized by the horrible Frank (Jason Clarke), her current husband. In true Book of Henry fashion, Karen logically concludes that Baker should invite Frank on a seemingly innocuous fishing trip, only to then get him drunk enough to push him into the water, putting him at the mercy of \"Justice\". If Baker agrees, says Karen, she will give him a check for 10 million. Oh right, while this is going on, Baker seems to recevie telepathic messages of sorts from the son.\n\nThese characters are stereotypes of such cartoonish proportions (Hathaway was compared to Jessica Rabbit at one point, just with less going on in the bazooka department) that it becomes all the more fascinating that the movie is neither a parody of noir, nor self-aware. I suppose there is an explanation, but numerous other questions arise once it's been given (as mad as it is, it fails to make up for the dullness of the rest of the movie).\n\nI'm speaking of the twist; there are several but this one is the biggest. I won't reveal it but it does involve the son character and the scenes showing him playing computer games as a means of escapism. It is a prime example of \"Just because you don't see it coming, doesn't mean it's a good twist\", legitimately up there with such insane hypotheticals as \"Forrest Gump was actually a vampire all along\", \"Shawshank was really floating through space \u00e0 la Dark City\", and \"The Village takes place in modern times\".\n\nAn ideal twist makes you get the film, and if not, improve it upon repeat viewings until you do get it. This one was genuinely maddening (unsatisfying doesn't cover it) and will cause the film to make LESS sense. The last film I saw before this was Glass and boy does this one make me appreciate the typical Shyamalan twists a whole lot more.\n\nSo what am I saying? Oh God, wait for this movie to come out on VOD and see it! Bring friends, alcohol, and some Neil Breen to watch after."

Then of course there's the question of what do you consider entertainment and what kind of emotions you would be interested in getting involved with.\n\nI'll take door number two, the door that requires for me to talk about this movie without offering any spoilers. As impossible as this may seem for this particular movie, I like the challenge. Here it is: this movie is worth watching. It's probably not going to be remembered, unless it develops a cult following. But it's definitely worth watching.\n\nThe first half is when you begin to feel there's something wrong with this movie. You begin to worry that you wasted the ticket money. Then, slowly... you begin to wonder whether it's not that there's something wrong with the movie but more likely there's something wrong with reality. The clues are everywhere, even in the opening shot, but you don't begin to get it until the third act. By then, you more or less know where you are, but you still haven't figured out the kicker. I exclaimed the kicker to my wife about 14 minutes before the end credits and about 11 minutes before it was revealed on screen (pat on the back for me).\n\nBottom line, everything that instinctively didn't make sense while trying to understand what you're watching, makes perfect sense just before the end credits roll up. It was well done, the acting was great and, do consider, that if you thought it wasn't, maybe it was great in that the characters you were watching were actually supposed to act in a way that you would mistake for bad acting, or for cliche acting. It was great acting, after all. The editing made sense. So did the photography. Well done Mr. Director-Auteur, writer, producer man of many hats, and feathers and hooks.\n\nSo? Was it the kind of emotional involvement I would consider worth spending some money and 146 minutes to experience? For me... Yeah. But let's not go overboard, right? (that was a pun)"

I can see why so many have taken to Knight's film as an early contender for the years worst, but despite all its flaws and strange choices, Serenity is always watchable and a sometimes wickedly enjoyable thriller with a difference and a heartfelt message, offering a lot more than many of its other by the numbers counterparts.\n\n2 \u00bd bare buns out of 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nI will always respect and appreciate the will of a director/writer in trying to do something bold and bonkers. Whether that's a divisive plot twist, a double-faced character or even an unusual method of filming, it doesn't really matter, as long as it succeeds. Steven Knight delivers a story that doesn't feel right from the get-go. Everything feels strange and random, with weird dialogues and awkward hints at something underneath it all. Then, a somewhat predictable plot twist changes pretty much everything since our perspective is entirely different now. However, it sinks the movie even more and creates a whole bunch of incongruencies and plot holes.\n\nThe film wasn't near good before the twist, and it gradually transformed itself into something jaw-droppingly bad, after it. In addition to this, the final message that Steven Knight leaves the audience with, is probably one of the worst ones since The Emoji Movie. \"Doing the wrong things for the right reasons\" is always going to be a controversial statement, but in this particular case, having in mind what happens in the movie and who does it involve, it's 100% wrong and I want to believe that Knight didn't exactly want to transmit this in the way that he did.\n\nThere's an intriguing and meaningful story to be told deep down in this messy screenplay. Behind all of the unnecessary exposition scenes (there's no need to describe what's happening since the twist is quite self-explanatory) and cringe-worthy dialogues, there's a well-structured narrative and an extraordinary concept to be explored. However, I have no idea what happened to the script nor the production and filming stages of the film, but I understand now why its original release date in October was postponed to the traditional January's garbage. This was supposed to be an Oscar-bait movie: an Oscar-nominated director/writer plus two Oscar-winner protagonists, in a film that seems to be more than what it actually is? I guess the production companies saw this coming and they tried to prevent an even bigger flop.\n\nI'm always the first to defend that a movie without at least \"good\" technical attributes is rarely one of the best of the year. However, I'm also the first to affirm that if a film fails to deliver a captivating story with compelling characters, there's no magnificent cinematography or mind-blowing special effects that can salvage it. Serenity doesn't even have that. Despite me feeling pleased that it was filmed in one-location and that the set design is pretty sweet, the editing is incredibly choppy. It feels like Knight had to remove several cuts in order to reduce the overlong runtime, which wasn't performed in the best way possible. There are a lot of moments where a character is facing a side, and in the next cut, the former is already facing a completely different one (this particular thing really occurs often).\n\nRegarding the characters, Baker and his son are definitely the ones that we learn more about since their connection is continuously addressed. Like I wrote above, there's a relevant story behind all of this mayhem, but I did saw (even if briefly) the light at the end of this very dark tunnel. That light is instantly consumed by the darkness as new characters or subplots start to show up, and the hollowness prevails over everything else. Jeremy Strong's character is baffling ridiculous, Diane Lane (Constance) is one of the dozens of logical reasons why the twist doesn't work, but the one who annoyed me the most didn't even show up. You spend a whole movie talking about this one person, like it is going to be a crucial subplot, and then you forget about it. You merely end the film, and it's like that character was never even mentioned... Why? Why give even more reasons for someone to leave the theater frustrated?\n\nThen, there's the tone. It's weird until the twist and weirder after it. Not even Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway can save themselves from some awfully delivered lines. Nevertheless, it's the cast who saves this wreckage of being an F. McConaughey is a hell of an actor and he demonstrates his outstanding range throughout the runtime. Hathaway has less to do, and I felt that her lines were the worst, but I can't argue with her ability to deliver any emotion. Jason Clarke (Frank Zariakas) is perfect as the violent father/husband, and Djimon Hounsou (Duke) has some space to shine.\n\nIn the end, Serenity tries to go big and bold, but falls astonishingly flat. Plot holes, logical incongruencies, awful dialogues, terrible editing, hollow characters, and neglected subplots. Steven Knight had a great concept and a truly interesting thriller-mystery in his mind, but his execution is shockingly baffling, and the twist transforms everything into something way worse. The final message is the number one reason why I don't recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. Matthew McConaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and I know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. It's probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "It pains me to dislike a film like 'Serenity' because it is trying so hard to be original and unique. The sad fact about modern cinema is that if there's a good idea out there, chances are someone has already thought of it and done it. That doesn't mean there aren't ideas out there that haven't been explored - it just means they likely aren't good. 'Serenity' is one of those unfortunately. It had me intrigued for a little while, until the twist (or not even really a twist, just an explanation) is revealed and we realise what is going on. From there the movie falls apart pretty rapidly.\n\nThe cast of this movie is quite incredible. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Diane Lane and Jason Clarke. They must have all been sold on this being a great idea. It's lucky they're there though because their star-power combined is all that really carries this film and keeps it watchable. Hathaway phones it in a little, but McConaughey gives it his all as usual.\n\n'Serenity' is a very dark film that takes itself extremely seriously. I can't remember even one instance where they attempt to make you laugh. This can make for a pretty bleak experience at times. Combine that with the fact that the film isn't half as smart as it thinks it is and you are left with a pretty weak product. Don't waste your time on 'Serenity' I'm sorry to say, there are bigger and better fish in the sea."

At the time of the twist reveal, I was momentarily delighted--sort of a 'whoa' moment when all those little oddities throughout the earlier part of the movie begin to make sense.\n\nUnfortunately, though, that sudden whip around in the plot had the negative effect of erasing all the earlier tension that is crucial to suspense movies.

His ex then reappears in his life and asks her to kill her abusive husband. There is good in this movie. It is a fine performance by Matthew McConaughey, showing his range and intensity. Hathaway captivates as well, although the usually steady Jason Clarke's performance seems forced. The mood as setting are good, and the first 1/2 of the film works well.\n\nThen the problems start. You will immediately know when the movie is about to go into the toilet. I audibly groaned to myself, and shook my head. It didn't get better, with massive plot holes, nonsensical character interactions and just general 'who caresedness'.\n\nI would like to say the director does an admirable job in the attempt to do a different type of story, but I found it lazy and would have been way better if he left the si-fi element out of it. There is a good if not great story here, and he had the cast to do it.\n\nI didn't turn the film off, and it had moments which I can appreciate, but as a film it fails. The call is 4/10 - Sorry Matthew, your string of duds continues, but at least this one is not on you."

I was like \"Really? These actors really accepted to be in this plot?\" When Ann Hathaway first appeared, it was totally off for me. The whole role, the way she played - it was like any acting school student would do better!\n\nThe same with McConaughey: he was acting like the only reason he was there to get paid and then go home.\n\nSo I only kept watching as Netflix said this movie is suspensful. So I was curious why.\n\nAnd in the second half of the movie, I watched the story line by line. The twist really opened up several new perspectives so I was curious which direction it would lead.\n\nI love those movies where you don't really know what you can believe because these make you think at another level. You try to find some things that still make sense and restart thinking from that perspective.\n\nSo the second half was a lot more suspensful for me and overall I found this movie an awesome pick by the end.\n\nThe only reason I don't give a score over 7 is that to be able to deliver their roles perfectly, these A-player actors had to play in a way that a superficial eye could find low quality (which I did, too, in the first half of the movie).\n\nI wish we could see them change roles somewhere halfway so we could see how great actors they are!\n\nRecommended for people who like to read between the lines."

Knight has always had a keen sense of tone, especially in something like the aforementioned Peaky Blinders. However, Serenity has insanely divisive twists that turn the film into a farce of a story.

The cast is perfect; the paradisiac locations, the magical atmosphere, and the plot twists are great.\n\nOverall, we show here to Matthew McConaughey on the type of role to which we are accustomed. I would not say too much about the plot, or the evident holes or problems that the movie also have.\n\nIt is way better if you watch it with the minimum information possible; so, if you read this, watch the movie before read anything else and pay attention to the detail. There are some scenes in which the realizator masterfully and subtly introduced details that are very revealing (including blinks to gamers in several key scenes, The Old Man and the Sea, and other stuff).\n\nIf you liked Black Mirror, Inception and Interstellar, you probably will enjoy this little gem. Believe me: it is not a bad movie at all.\n\nI'm still thinking about the multiple interpretations of this movie (the script purposely does not clarify all, even giving the false impression that everything have been explained, leaving the viewer to discuss some possible options). Here, again, Matthew McConaughey, like in Interstellar, tells us about a father's love and redemption beyond the limits of space and time. Anne Hathaway, Djimon Hounsou and Diane Lane are here simply fantastic."

Matthew is playing a VERY dumb person all along the movie and Anne is excruciating to watch and listen to throughout the whole movie (and absolutely not believable in that role - an amateur actress could give the same result) ... the \"husband\" overacts and efforts are plentiful to try to make us hate the guy when in reality, we would be: \"Yeah sure man ... You're just dumb!!\" I kept watching because i still believed there would be an interesting twist with the similitude in look-alike between Matthew and the \"husband\" ... there is no such twist; the movie really is over after 40 min. It is just another movie that wants to be clever in its originality ... but that is not ... \"Stupidity\" really deserves its name !!"

The dialogue is very lazy and obvious (similar to naming the Moby Dick-like fish Justice), and the cast is completely wasted and too much of the dialogue is just telling a narrative. This could all be partially explained with the concepto of the film, but then again if the script was better and sounded more true to life, no one would complain.\n\nI won't spoil the concept, but you'll get it half way through the movie anyway. It's sad, because the film obviously tries to be mysterious and tense, but shoots it's load too early. While it admittedly doesn't work completely, the first half of the movie is the more potent half, and if the screenwriters didn't give us the explanation before there even is a mystery to be solved, it might have worked. This way, the later portion of the movie is a tedious will he-won't he, followed by a utterly predictable conxlusion.\n\nLiked: the choice of the actors (Kind-of) the concept\n\nDisliked: Just about everything else"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure if the busy writer, Steven Knight (Taboo, Peaky Blinders, Girl In The Spider's Web), created this project for a much needed working holiday! He also directed, which meant he got to hang with the cast and crew on the island of Mauritius (north of Africa), a most glorious location which was perfect for this dark and dreamlike neo-noir. When film crews are far from home and isolated from the studio's eyes, then there is a party going down (one of the many reasons for my bunged-up liver).\n\nSerenity feels like a pet project Knight had in a desk draw from his childhood days. It has that naivety about it with some ambiguity and plays out as an over-the-top neo-noir but ends up being something more deeper and interesting in a muddled sort of way! Technically it was brilliant, with plenty of drone shots and other interesting directorial touches of sensory-impact. And the cast was perfect and beautiful and had your interest. So there was enough in this movie to keep you hooked in a matinee serial sort of way. So what went wrong?\n\nIt was how Knight undersold it. At first you thought you were going to get a thriller of some sort. The acting was noir-like, a little hammy and sexy from the femme-fatale (who even dressed for the part). The protagonist, (McConaughey cast perfectly), was doing a dark Bogart who went hard on the liquor and had some deep regrets in life hidden under the tough exterior. Even the antagonist was pure evil in a comic-book sort of villain way. It then shifted into another sphere that threw everything off kilter, but made it more interesting, even if it was somewhat clunky. I took the bait and decided to go with it because I too wanted to believe this revenge scenario created by a hurtful fragile creature. Once you made the connection you understood why the first half was played out like... I should stop there and not be giving this much away. But if you are prepared for it then you might accept the shortcomings, and enjoy the trashiness."

        "review_title": "Serenity or Unclarity?",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are those movies we go for the stars, especially at the promise of some sex appeal that will get the theater steaming in delight. Tonight's review is one such movie, whose little to no trailers left me with no idea as to what to expect. Yet, sometimes those very movies turn out to be treasure troves of quality, and though you went for the steam you might have found more gleam. Robbie K is back with another review on:\n\nMovie: Serenity (2019)\n\nDirector: Steven Knight Writer: Steven Knight Stars: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Diane Lane\n\nLIKES:\n\nActing Tropical Island shots Twist Originality\n\nSUMMARY: As I said, the poster sells you into the film and the leads of McConaughey and Hathaway are the center stage. The former has the smolder, trashy looking grunge part down, diving once more in the darker roles that involve facing elements that are uncomfortable in this film. Certainly, much more serious than his earlier works, the man proves he is not afraid to take on the roles that others shy away from. As for Hathaway, the amazing woman played her part well, though the awkward parts may seem a bit flat, she works the role well, especially on the sexier side of things. With these two running the show, eyes will be glued to the screen in anticipation for the next trip to the bedroom. Of course if you are like me, seeing the island shots and aquatic world is quite beautiful to see, as you are transported to another world that makes you want to go on vacation. Serenity is all about sailing into a lot of unknowns and fortunately the cinematography and the views are a fine feature. Yet visuals aside, the story of Serenity is certainly an original one, or at least more unique than most. Much of this has to do with the twist, which once revealed starts to explain the strangeness of characters, dialogue, and performances. With this approach, the movie goes down a more psychological approach that will dive into a lot of awkward corners and engage your mind to see how deep this rabbit hole goes. There is little more I can say to avoid surprises, but definitely look to an original touch to the sea of blockbuster stereotypes.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nWaste of Characters Pace Editing Lack of Excitement Going Nowhere Too Bold On Twist?\n\nSUMMARY: Serenity may have some acting, a little bit of visuals, and one heck of a unique approach, but that doesn't make it perfect by far. It starts with a waste of certain characters, each intriguing in their initial introduction, but quickly dropped to mundane characters who appear at the oddest times. While secondary characters do little to expand the group they ironically are the smallest dislike I have. Instead much of the dislikes for me involve the pacing of the movie. Serenity is slow, no doubt, drawn out in a drama like film that starts to get lost in the director's vision. Because the editing focused more on the steamy, sex appeal or on the concept of the twist, the excitement was practically missing for this reviewer. Promises of deep mysteries, pressured decisions, and a few other usual excitement clich\u00e9s are quickly lost to the circular spiral of the same problems. Lines and scenes blend together as the stars get stuck expressing their disdain of their lives, which sometimes makes the scenes boring or repetitive. Why was this the case? I think it was going too bold on the twist. Trying to execute the original concept, led to lines and sends going very oddly, and by getting lost in the convoluted ideas, the other areas the movie wanted to go for fell short, sinking into the sea of the mundane. As they say, to go big you go bold, but going too bold can sometimes bite back harder and get lost to most audiences.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nSerenity may not be on most radars or fish finders, but within lies an interesting, psychological tale that surprisingly has the steaminess the poster promised. With acting to take the lead and a story to try and blow your mind, these are the qualities one needs to keep in mind when going to see this film, (use the mantra of There is a Twist, There is a Twist) Still by going on this twist, the usual components that people go to the movies for is loss to mundane tactics and odd approaches, alongside a repetitive collection of complaints and plot points that are difficult to swallow. Still while not the theater quality film, Serenity is best cast off from the port of your living room and worth it if you want to get a good headscratcher into the film. Otherwise hold out for something more exciting in the near future.\n\nMY SCORES ARE:\n\nDrama/Thriller: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0"

Sometimes plot is average but execution makes the average plot looks great, sometime the plot has something to offer but with a bad execution the entire plot is ruined. The same is the case of this movie. The plot had potential to becoming a great edge of the seat thriller but with immature execution the entire movie had fallen flat.\n\nThis movie is a victim of too much plot twists and this creates lots of confusion and even a hardcore mystery Lover can get confused. The screenplay is slow infact very slow and gets very boring, sometimes you might feel that the movie is not moving at all. Acting is probably the only solid part of the movie as with stars like McConaughey, Hathaway, Clarke and rest of the character had given their 100% to the movie. Music and background music is average.\n\nThe climax of the movie is illogical and acts as a final nail in the coffin. To be honest this movie is a pure example of wasted case of a hopeful plot. Please avoid this movie."

I feel like the movie could've been a lot better especially if the second half had more to it. It was definitely an interesting concept and while the ending doesn't really really leave you too confused or angry because the reason behind everything makes sense. The movie just makes you feel like there could've been more to it.

I say to myself \"oh, that's interesting\" but it;'s not interesting enough to make me give the film credit for it's attempts at original film making. By the time we get there, I'm far too bored to care.\n\nThe film does have a really good cast of actors to keep me interested. I think Matthew McConaughey is good at making the mundane seem interesting, and they nominated Djimon Hounsou for an Oscar twice for being able to support these \"movie stars\" while doing... whatever they are doing.\n\nJason Clarke was interesting to watch on the screen as a blowhard of an abusive husband and I wish that Diane Lane had a bigger role.\n\nPlus Anne Hathaway's turn as a \"femme fatale\" in this Neo noir is very pleasant.\n\nNone of the skills of these actors, however is doing anything to make the film itself a better watch overall. It's still (original but) dull."

It isn't one and watching it without preconceptions it is genuinely entertaining and thrilling until the last moments.\n\nThat, however, is when we learn a crucial detail literally in voiceover and then in a phonecall. Every other shot in the movie is ambiguous.\n\nRedo the voiceover and erase the phonecall, in an edit literally any fan could make in moviemaker and the movie is easily a 9/10 with great acting, conveying the confusion and struggle of the characters to the viewer, and with genuinely heartwrenching moments.\n\nBut as it stands, the ending is just wrong. It doesn't really fit the themes established by the movie itself, and more importantly is the wrong solution to the problem. It's a lesson actively harmful if taken seriously, and thus the whole thing can't be rated above 3."

He has to find Diane's cat each day in order for them to sleep together. He goes out each day and tries to reel in a tuna it happens until one day a mysterious woman approaches. Anne Hathaway wants her abusive husband dead and will pay him well. This throws a spanner in the works and everything seems to fall about around him.

It had no zippy dialogue, too much mumbling as is common now, washed out color saturation from filters I guess, and no building tension or suspense. Just a real let down of a film considering the nice setting and good cast. I'm at a 4/10 rating, not sure if it was even worth one watch."

I would rather watch Golf whole being consumed by Nicholas cage in a bear Costume covered in bees. If I wasn't already an atheist, this movie would prove there is no god. This abortion of a film rivals Triangle for catastrophic boat failure and makes the Titanic look like a fun Disney ride. If the deceased of that incident could somehow see this, it would automatically become the worst thing to happen to them involving a boat. The dialogue feels like it was written by a dirty monkey with the brain of Luka Magnotta. This abortion of a film apparently had a director who hopefully was tried and convicted of his war crimes. The \"plot twist\" comes way too early like a frat boy getting laid, and feels just as non-consensual. The movie is a scattershot if different genres all done better probably on YouTube somewhere. If I had made the mistake of seeing this abomination in theaters I might have been compelled to drive my car into the nearest wildfire. The cinematography is somehow both boring and offensive at the same time. If you want something good, watch literally anything else. If you want something so bad it's good, watch The Room or Trolls 2 or Birdemic. However if you need something to count down the time while you wait for the pills and alcohol to kick in, well you cane to the right place. Although you might just regurgitate on the lack of subtlety. Be warned he who enter. Honestly though if you watch this after easing this review you may be a mad. This movie exists unfortunately."

However Dill has an Ahab like obsession in catching a big fish called Justice, even if it means ruining the paid trips by tourists.\n\nHis ex wife and mother to his teenage son, Karen (Anne Hathaway) turns up with a proposition. She wants her new rich husband Frank (Jason Clarke) dead. Frank is a monster, he has been abusive to her and Baker's son who spends all his time on a computer. Karen will pay Baker good money, all Baker needs to do is get him drunk and toss him into the sea so he will be gobbled up by sharks.\n\nKnight has failed in his execution in Serenity. As a straight noir thriller it is dull and predictable.\n\nHathaway is not much of as femme fatale. Diane Lane who plays Baker's friend with benefits would have done it better.\n\nThere are constant hints in the movie of some other worldliness. Even the locations point to this. Plymouth Island looks less like something that is off Miami Beach but more like a Caribbean island. In fact it is filmed in Mauritius and we had fun looking at locations we had visited over there.\n\nThe film never hits its stride, when it pulls the rug under your feet; you never for a moment think that was clever.

Movies that play it safe are more likely to win an Oscar, but they're much less likely to become well loved for decades to come. Serenity plays a most aggressive game, and it nearly succeeds in becoming one of my favorite films of 2019. Based on the shockingly abysmal IMDb and Metacritic ratings, I doubt that this film will become a well-known classic, but I predict it becoming a cult classic all the same (and I don't mean the so-bad-it's-good sort of cult classic).\n\nThe scenery and cinematography is exceptionally well made. The film's events and characters all show an extremely well-written depth that somehow also feels shallow and one-dimensional, which is perfectly explained by the film's climax that takes every risk required for a movie to truly become unforgettable.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the film drags on far too long after the climax is concluded. I know that 1:46 already makes Serenity a relatively short film, but I do think that 1:30-1:35 would have been a much more suitable runtime that would present an excellently satisfying and thought-provoking film."

It seems that it will go on a very specific direction, but halfway there is the real revelation: and is something that you don't see coming, there are a few clues here and there, but you can't really understand until a specific scene comes out. The way they handled the plot is amazing, but in terms of originality, there is nothing new under the sun. For me the best moment of the whole movie is at the very end, when finally the mistery around Plymouth island will finally be completely uncovered. The movie needs to be watched more than once, in order to understand every single aspect of it.\n\nMatthew McConaughey comes back with a quality production, after the awful Beach Bum, but this is not his best performance: he could give to his character more personality, and we are very far away from the acting skills shown in True Detective. A real pity, considering that he is practically the character that has most on screen time. Anne Hathaway and Jason Clarke are good, but they are both side characters, and honestly did not have much room for a deep development considering the plot."

The inclined viewer will follow the main character on his grey area drift between reality, memory, perception, reason, onsetting lunacy and daze, all made up by a kid exposed to domestic violence for years. While this movie will not shake your belief system, its uncomfortability is certainly not rooted in the explicitness, yet, I do wonder if Millrnnials had been more open to this movie, had the main female cast not been their princess."

Whatever the creators were thinking will only seem clear to those who think because something is 'different' it must be good - while sometimes this can be so, it's not in this case. Here is an example of trying too hard to be 'different' and ending up simplistically off-the-wall, but not in a good way.\n\nWriter Stephen Knight won the day with 'Amazing Grace' 06, and seemed to perhaps be thinking he can blend some of the grand philosophy that graced that film into this concoction. Problem here is, the grotesque characters and situations are manipulatively designed to be so overly nasty as to make the viewer want to see the 'baddy' violently done in. That is never a good way to set up a convincing story but is very much a popular computer games scenario.\n\nThis swear, booze and sex-fest wears thin very early on with its obvious attempts at outlandish 'smart' pretence - it may have been halfway interesting if they had played it straight as it appeared to be at the outset. Initially looking much like a remake of the Hemmingway/Garfield 50s noir classic \"The Breaking Point' - it soon veers off-course into the now predictable land of Computer Game 'magic'. It's also unbecoming for mixing perverse situations involving an abused minor into a rather lame fantasy element. Some audiences will only see the supposed 'cleverness', while others will see straight through it! (as the box-office returns tend to confirm)\n\nMatthew McConaughey can be impressive (Free State of Jones '16) but also sometimes over the top (as here). Previously, he has also verbally praised God for his career, if he thinks God will look favourably on this mess, he needs to think again. The talented Diane Lane is sadly, totally wasted as his casual town 'play' piece.\n\nCold-hearted ugly nonsense."

        "review_detailed_main": "Writer/director Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, Locke) has brewed a film that, like the theme of the film, is not what it seems at first. The transition from reality to non-reality is unsettling - a sunny tropical island populated by interesting people becomes a computer game of rules involving death, or does it? That is left to the observer to decide.\n\nBaker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is a fishing boat captain leading tours with his sidekick Duke (Djimon Hounsou) off a tranquil, tropical enclave called Plymouth Island. He earns money as an escort for island lady Constance (Diane Lane) when his income from fishing is down. His quiet life is shattered, however, when his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) tracks him down with a desperate plea for help. She begs Dill to save her - and their young son Patrick (Rafael Sayegh) - from her new, violent husband (Jason Clarke) by taking him out to sea on a fishing excursion, only to throw him to the sharks and leave him for dead. Karen's appearance thrusts Dill back into a life he'd tried to forget, his service in Iraq and loneliness for his son Patrick, and as he struggles between right and wrong, his world is plunged into a new reality that may not be all that it seems. The strange unreal world seems to be known by the mysterious Reid Miller (Jeremy Strong) who follows Dill before his mission is revealed.\n\nWe are left to wonder if the confusion of the story is intentional - and if it is, the message is a bit too jumbled to make sense - or is that the intention? This is an odd movie with a very strong cast - it just gets a bit lost in the second half."

The trailer sells the movie as something completely different than it actually is. I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say that this has one of the worst twists I've ever seen in a movie that I can't believe anyone thought it was a good idea let alone gave them millions of dollars to make this.\n\nMatthew McCounaghey and Anne Hathaway are normally great in just about anything, but here both of them are laughably bad. It doesn't help either that the dialogue is very corny and unrealistic. It's such a shame too because I used to get excited when I saw McCounaghey's name on a film, but this is so bad I think it could really damage his career.\n\nLike I said, I can't really say whats so bad about this movie without spoiling the twist, so I'll just say the only reason you should waste your time with this movie is if you love bad movies and want to see one of the dumbest twists ever created. It's no wonder the trailers hid what the movie is actually about because nobody would have saw this."

No, no, no haha, it's just really, really stupid but it's executed with such sincerity that it won me over.\n\nI predicted what was going on almost immediately but dismissed it as just too daft to be true; Oh Lordy did I laugh in wide-eyed amusement when it all came together. There are pros: the production values are decent, it has an intriguing setup, it's never really boring and is lead by two major A-list actors which only adds to the amusement - did they read the whole script before shooting commenced?\n\nThis film is utterly ridiculous but I'm glad it exists - some people have taken it seriously and fair play to them too.

He daily takes tourists out on fishing trips, but he personally has a mission of his own to catch a large tuna fish who keeps escaping from him.\n\nBaker soon finds his ex-wife is in town (Anne Hathaway) and encounters her. She offers him a large sum of money if he will kill her husband (played by Jason Clarke) who has become unbearable to live with due to his consistent abuse. There is also a man in a suit who is continually trying to catch Baker in person but always misses him just by the nick of time. What does he want with Baker? And who is he? These are just some of the many questions in this film.\n\nAs the film progresses, Baker soon has to make some rather challenging choices. Along with this, the things that surround Baker in his everyday life aren't actually what they appear to be...\n\nThis review will be brief, as for the sake for spoilers, there's not much I can share about Serenity.\n\nIf you've seen the film's trailer, I advise you to simply ignore it. I found the film's trailer misleading as to what this film is actually about. If you ignore the film's trailer, you will find Serenity tries to gives the audience the set up to a major twist. The only problem with this is that I found the major twist incredibly predictable with the film basically giving it away far too early. Once the twist comes into play, we have to suffer through the leading characters adjusting to what the audience already knew. This hurts the rest of the film, with the twist dragging and becoming dull (not to mention extremely hard to accept).\n\nMatthew McConaughey does well on a performance level but there is nothing new or exciting here from the actor. He fishes, he smokes plenty of cigarettes, makes love to women and says a small amount of dialogue along with frowning and thinking deep thoughts. That there is nothing new or exciting from the actor could also be said about Anne Hathaway, who I feel is here more for star power and looks than being used for her true talent as an actress.\n\nAs far as the film's visuals, sure there are some points to praise, but this is only a minor element of the film. The film mostly feels bland, dark and gritty.\n\nOverall, Serenity is a complete surprise and sadly not of the good kind. This is a film that sets up a hugely predictable twist that is filled with flaws. Brilliant actors such as Matthew McConaughey & Anne Hathaway are simply wasted on the screen. The film's trailer is also misleading as to the end and final results. The whole film is simply a major disappointed considering the cast.\n\n3.8/10 Walkden Entertainment"

The movie is absolutely ruined because of unnecessary explanations.\n\nThis movie had everything to be good : good director, good actors, appealing setting, nice aesthetics, good photography, and a decent story. It starts really nice. The introduction scenes set up the background perfectly. The characters are slowly introduced, they are clich\u00e9s and that actually serves the story. Hints of a fantastic plot come at the right pace. And then everything goes wrong when there start to be some explanations about the real backstory. The movie gets clumsy and cringey. Too much fantastic elements, a lot being clich\u00e9s, lead to a total trainwreck. Worse : the ending with images from the \"real world\" and the voice-over news report is just like spitting on the public's intelligence. And the coup-de-grace is this extremely awkward feel-good last scene which is wrong on so many points : firstly it ruins what remained of a sad and fantastic tone, then on a script level it means that all that would have been a deep motivational fantasy story for the kid to find the courage to do what is necessary is in fact just the kid being totally insane.\n\nWhy does a movie like \"Enemy\" by Denis Villeneuve works and this one doesn't, despite the fact they share many similarities ? Because it explains absolutely nothing and leaves a jigsaw story, open for interpretation by the viewer. You end up feeling puzzled at first and then smart when you put stuff together. \"Serenity\", with all its explanations and its unnecessary and awkward ending does the exact opposite."

However, I feel I must speak my mind on this film, especially due to the harsh ratings and poor box office performance (thus far).\n\nSerenity left me with a visceral emotional reaction that I have yet to quite understand. Never before has a movie taken me on such an emotional roller coaster. The film had me laughing toward the beginning, and crying by the end.\n\nI wish I could explain why the film meant so much to me. From an objective perspective, I'm sure most critics and movie goers will find various ways to pick it apart. But it doesn't matter. All I ask is that if you are reading this, go see the film for yourself. Maybe you'll love it. Maybe you'll hate it. All I can say is that Serenity shook my world and left me utterly speechless. Thank you for this wonderful gift Mr. Knight. I can not wait for the return of Peaky Blinders."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a proof that movie \"marketing\" today can only promote familiar products and is not able to market true creativity and originality. This film is a heavily influenced by classics piece of post-post-modern mind, which is out of fashion today. So I'm surprised that it has even been made, I mean there's no superheroes, zombies or sexy bad guys in it. Now, I must admit story is not perfect, but I get what attracted the talent to it. I'm sure that even though it was a flop with critics and box office, this will not be a piece actors or producers will ever be ashamed of making. I suspect that maybe story seems a bit flawed because Mr. Knight is not a very good film director yet, perhaps if he let this be directed someone like David Fincher perhaps he'd manage to balance a tone change better, which occurs in the middle of the film. But what's done is done and it's definitely one of the more memorable movies of the last decade. If you are looking for originality (even though very postmodern) this is for you, if you are hooked on familiar products you will hate this."

Gratuitous nudity (Male, 'one for the girls' this time - or those who desperately wish to see Matthew McConachty's admittedly well toned backside) and an interesting play on the theme of 'wet T-Shirts'. All I can recall is MM smoking, drinking and generally being macho. Hathaway 'dials in' a decentish performance I rather think half way through production everyone went 'this ain't working, let's get it done and get outta here - stick in another scene of MM in the rain and we've ticked the boxes. TBH the theme probably makes 'plot lite' the only brief that could be followed. Shame."

Act one: powerful setting, great actors, it's all rich and intriguing. Act two: OMG the ride twists immediately taking the plot to a whole new level! Act three: this movie deserved a multi layered end instead of only one clear outcome but is still fulfilling. It is indeed a masterpiece for anyone looking for a good suspense and rather metaphysical film. Any high quality film that approaches to Vanilla Sky or other films of the same genre is worth watching and deserves better rating. Now seat, enjoy, and get that fish."

I went back and rewatched the trailers to see if my memory was correct about how it was \"packaged\" and it was. I really wish it was the movie that the trailers led you to believe it was. Sadly it was far from it. The only reason I even gave it two stars was because the acting was good in it."

A good blend of mystery, fantasy, and the conscience/morality struggle.\n\nI feel a lot of reviewers (both critic and audience) are hung up and overreacting to all the surreal aspects, which individually may be jarring (even downright comical, to which I can't deny having some laughs), but taken as a whole make enough sense within the nature of the story. Even though I easily predicted the big reveal, I didn't feel it was so \"out there\" that it ruined anything. I'm not saying you can just hand-wave stuff away as \"movie magic\", though, since there are a few questionable events that don't fit even within context (like why can't the businessman just meet McConaughey at his shack, even though he apparently knows all his locations?). But unless you totally zonked out, most things were clearly justifiable, whether you enjoyed the twist/ending or not.\n\nWhat I can agree on is that the movie isn't much of a suspense/noir thriller, despite some of the elements being there. But it did a decent job of building up anticipation so I remained hooked throughout. I also thought Diane Lane's character was unnecessary, but again, is somewhat excusable based on the complete context of the story.\n\nOverall, I had a good time. It's definitely not some award-winning powerhouse but it's far from the disaster everyone seems to make it out to be."

He's trying way too hard to always look cool and it doesn't look natural. He has become too full of himself and it shows on film. Hathaway was just generic like she always is. Everything else was just filler. Movie looked forced and rapid in the making. Story was crap and no matter how much you try to make the movie decent, if you start out with crap, you still end up with crap. When I saw this movie was with McConaughey in it, I had dice in my hand as I want to watch it, not knowing if it was going to be seven or snake eyes. It rolled out a solid snake eyes.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never written a review before but I must say, I felt compelled to say something after seeing all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed this movie. It was kind of like a hybrid of The Truman Show and The Matrix. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I'm a computer programmer myself and know that we are not many years away from creating virtual simulations as portrayed in Serenity?? It's very easy to believe that AI programs will be living inside larger programs created by humans and the AI will be completely unaware of the fact that they are in fact programs. Which begs the question, are we, as humans, already living inside a simulation? Elon Musk seems to think so. So yeah, I think this movie is super relevant for the times but I can see how some, especially if you're not a computer programmer, wouldn't get what it's about. I read some of these reviews and it's just patently obvious that many people completely missed the point of this film. Anyone that codes for a living, you will find this film very interesting. Trust me folks, we are probably only a decade away from what is shown in Serenity. The Singularity is coming sooner than you think."

If you seriously liked it and found it entertaining, you are quite possibly a very late learner and still entrenched in kindergarten getting your kicks from making strange shapes with plasticine. If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favour and take a toilet break and do some number two's. Before you flush it away though, take a look at it because I can guarantee you that your crap will have more substance, be more entertaining and keep you riveted longer than this film ever could. I am astounded when I see films this bad that someone didn't say somewhere along the way \"You can't be serious!\" when they were hawking the story around trying to get money. Maybe it was near the end of the financial year and they had to take a loss to make a profit. The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see if it could actually get any worse and that is precisely where this film did not disappoint. An utter waste of money, but more importantly, time because that's something your money just can't buy and you can never, ever get it back. It's BAD!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I always love when an original concept makes it to the big screen, but sadly, not every original idea will resonate with every viewer. In the case of Serenity, it seems as though many people have chosen to be detached from it in terms of relatability. I admire when filmmakers go out of their way to create a bizarre world that usually would not work, but goes for it anyways. Unfortunately, Serenity is one of the strangest films I have seen in quite some time and also one that I feel is quite terrible as a whole. Although there was an effort to impress here, it failed on many levels and here is why.\n\nAfter a burnout fisherman is approached by his ex-wife, his new mission turns into whether or not he is okay with murdering her new husband, due to his violence toward her and their son. That premise alone works as a movie, but that is about as much as I can say without ruining where the film takes a turn. This is where I admire the filmmakers for trying, even though it did not work at all. The twist that this film delivers may work for a handful of people, but I fear that viewers will most likely laugh once the film reveals what it is truly about.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is a fantastic actor and has truly proven his worth throughout the past decade or so. Nominated for numerous awards and appearing in Oscar-nominated films consistently, I always look forward to the next project he chooses to sink his teeth into. While I will not say his performance is fantastic here, he is definitely committed from start to finish. He carries this movie in a dramatic way, but his wacky character feels a little fake at times. He is quite over-the-top here and it almost stood out as a negative to me.\n\nOn top of this crazy performance, as I mentioned, the twist this film delivers is one of the best and worst twists I have witnessed in years. There is a sense of humour to it for the viewers, but the movie takes everything so seriously that it really collapsed as a whole. This film would have had a lot of potential if it winked at the audience, but it just asked you to buy into the entire premise as if it were real. This aspect of the film alone is what turned me off. I enjoyed watching this film in a weird way, but that does not mean I actually liked the film.\n\nIn the end, Serenity is a great film to watch if you are a film lover and have someone to watch the film with, while having a few drinks. There were times when I had to question how these filmmakers thought certain plot devices were going to work for the majority of moviegoers because it simply feels ridiculous when the true storyline kicks in. Serenity may end up being on my list of films to never watch from 2019, but it certainly is a memorable one, so take from that what you will."

        "review_detailed_main": "I coincidently watched two different movies in same name, Serentiy. The older one is sci-fi and latest is mysterious but not sci-fi ( as described its genre ). Because we do not see kid playing computer game of catching fish anywhere in the movie nor he is playing any other game which we know through conversation between various characters about writing situations in real life. Only we can see him before computer typing something every time. This is not sci-fi as me. Moreover the plot is very confused. We do not understand that which character lives and which is dead ? When was Baker dill in army by his name John? And he is not John then why Karen call him 'John'? Where was Patrick? Was he alive or dead? So confused! Either I did not see movie carefully or it was a mistake of plot. May be possible both. Okay. About acting part, Matthew seems dumb and not having much expression on face like a stone face. Other hand Anne Hathaway looking good and did well acting. Please beware of some bold intimate scenes, but is very usual thing in Hollywood movie. Photography work is excellent especially for Ocean shooting. .Overall movie will not entertain you much. Then my suggestion is avoid this if you can or only afford you have extra spare time and do not have any mean to kill the time."

He's a brit best known for their popular Peaky Blinders series, but that and nothing else he's done has translated to success here in the US. How Matthew M and Anne Hathaway got roped into this surely leads to a tale of fraud, either on them, us, or both. There is a decent nut of story in \"Serenity\" but it's buried in the film till past the first hour! And then it's presented in such a shallow and rushed manner that it's just lost on the viewer. Like so many films, this one had potential but it was squandered by a woefully inexperienced writer/director."

It is not a movie for everybody, it is very interesting from beginning till end... very involve... and very provocative... But you should watch this movie with open mind and heart , carefully observing details. And the movie itself is such a big message for the spectators - there is no borders for Love. We always get signs from Fortune and loving souls for right thing to do, but what we will do depend entirely on us. I enjoy it very much and highly recommended this title."

        "review_detailed_main": "My opinion of the movie while watching it and after watching were very different. Throughout the movie, and especially the beginning, I was like what is this mess? Is it going anywhere? The characters were stiff and didn't seem to make sense, until you keep watching. The clues were there from the beginning and thrown in frequently but the thing is that I didn't catch them until three quarters through because I didn't expect this movie to turn out to be something different.\n\nThis is the problem I had with the movie. Most of us watch a movie expecting it to be something. Yes, sometimes we get plot twists that make it enjoyable but in this case, it really wrecked it because it was like, you got hit on the side of the head because you didn't expect a ball to be thrown over left field. You don't go to watch a comedy to find that it becomes a serious drama. If they intended to give us this twist, they should have prepared us for it. To have them throw us a twist like this, I wasn't pleased. However, I changed my view after finishing the movie and thought about it a bit more.\n\nAgain, this is another movie that had some good names in it that I felt were wasted. The movie could have been practically as good or bad with lesser known actors playing. For the elaborate plot and the number of characters in the movie given the background of the plot, it seems a bit hard to believe but, this is a movie. If you start to tear it down, it really falls apart.\n\nYou can watch the movie for entertainment value and it could be enjoyable. Just don't get upset when the twist happens which brings me back to how the movie didn't give its audience a heads up on what kind of movie it was. I would have enjoyed it slightly more if I had an idea rather than having it hit me unexpectedly. Duh! Yeah, I should have seen all the clues and hints throughout the movie except I wasn't.\n\nI'm not sure if the ending could have been better but I wished they offered something else."
