I have to disagree, but there is no denying just how atrocious it is.\n\nIt tells the story of a mother and son who move into an open house after a tragedy befalls their family. As per the usual trope weird things begin to happen in the property.\n\nThe trouble is, well.................there are a lot of troubles but first of all the movie is..........wait, honestly I don't even know where to start here.\n\nAwfully paced, dreadful characters you simply can't care about, a billion unanswered questions, the film ultimately goes nowhere at all! Basically the only redeeming features the film has are marginally decent cinematograpgy and a beautiful setting.\n\nThe Open House is fully deserving of all the poor ratings, it's the absolute pits.\n\nThe Good:\n\nBeautiful location\n\nThe Bad:\n\nCliched to incredible levels\n\nUnlikeable characters\n\nServes no purpose\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nNothing, in fact I'm pretty sure it caused brain leakage so I've probably forgot some stuff"

Then you start singing the lyrics to YMCA while Eiffel 65 is playing 'I'm blue' in the background\n\nSo you must be asking yourself, What was the relevance of sinatra and why world of warcraft?

We honestly really enjoyed a good majority of this film, so many things that look like they're building up to a really good twist at the end. Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.\n\nHow naive and utterly wrong we were.\n\nThere is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made? It's like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head. By the last shot I was honestly screaming \"DO NOT ROLL CREDITS\" and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.\n\nThis review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.\n\nI urge you not to waste your time.\n\nI have to go cool off and try and forget the fact I ever watched this piece of rubbish."

The ending was probably done in that way to allow for a second, and I wouldn't be shocked to see an Open House Part 2 made.\n\nSolid performances, Dylan Minnette, who's always pretty good put in a solid performance, I thought the scenes where he lashed out in anger to his mother about his father's death were very well played out, films so often go way over the top, this had a sense of realism.\n\nWhen you think that the budget for this film was $100,000 I think it should be applauded, many films with budgets many times that size fail in so many ways, this was a good hour and a half of escapism.\n\nIt's not to be taken too seriously, and we didn't get many answers, but that's life.I quite enjoyed it."

Dylan Minnette definitely has a nice future ahead as long as he never does a film like this again. It's never a good thing when you want the main characters to die 30 minutes into the movie. Horribly written characters who were just mean and the story itself, if you want to even call it a story as it was completely plotless. At one point somehow the bad guy, or depending one how one looks at it the good guy, decides to take a persons contacts out, to conceal his identity. I guess he was to lazy to just wear a mask, instead he manually takes the guys contacts out. I have no clue how this movie ever got made, it is that bad. My twelve year old could come up with a better movie then this. I could pull out my IPhone, and randomly grab a couple of hobos from the rail yard and make a better movie than this drivel. This movie was so bad, and such a waste of time I'm considering canceling my Netflix subscription of 5 years, and filing a lawsuit for the time I will never get back watching this garbage. I've been watching horror movies for 33 years, and I can honestly say this is the worst horror movie I've ever watched, it is also the worst movie I've ever watched period. I've been an imdb member since it originated, and this is the first review I've ever posted. I don't want any other person to have to suffer through this garbage like I did.

The acting is pretty good too.\n\nIf you like endings where all the threads come together, avoid this one, but if, like me, you enjoy unresolved mystery,give it a go."

While it is definitely a bad movie, I didn't find it quite as bad as most IMDb users here have found it. The production values were good for what had to be a non blockbuster budget. Also, the first half of the movie does have a little mood and eeriness. But otherwise, the movie pretty much screws things up. I could live with the setup being somewhat familiar, but the execution of the setup is quite badly done. Most of the movie (especially in the first half) unfolds at a REALLY slow pace, with no real strong thrills or plot turns to keep the viewer actively engaged. The lead characters also seem very dim-witted, not seeing that something is seriously wrong before things turn very serious. Also, while the movie seems to be setting up for some surprise plot twists and turns, NOTHING about this setup pays off in the end. There is no real explanation as to what is happening and why, and what we have seen before the ending seems just to have been padding before the very unsatisfying conclusion. While I will admit that the movie could have been a lot worse, I really can't see it entertaining any particular viewer."

At least No Mercy had a beginning middle and end but The Open House has a beginning and middle but no end. It just leads you to nothing and you are left feeling \"What the F?!\"\n\nThe movie starts like out any C movie on Netflix, some tragedy and then the main characters have to make a decision they don't really want to but being financially strapped have to. Then creepy things start to happen and there is violence but then it just abruptly stops there. It makes no sense and is very frustrating. The viewer becomes invested in the characters. The actors actually do the best the can and the acting is not bad. But the characters are one dimensional. We don't ever really get to the know the wife and son.\n\nThe movie feels like it was edited with a guillotine. There are scenes put together that don't make sense. For instance the son complains they moved away from his friends and he didn't want to go but there are no scenes prior to that of him feeling this way. We straight up have a conversation between the wife and her sister about moving to the mountain home and then voila they are driving to the mountain home.\n\nDoes Netflix think because it is spending loads of money on several movies like Bright that it can just have really bad movies to fill the line up of movies? Don't waste your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw 'The Open House' on Netflix a while ago, being fond of horror/thriller regardless of budget (even if not my favourite genre) and being intrigued somewhat by the idea. Being behind on my film watching and reviewing, with a long to watch and review list that keeps getting longer, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it.\n\nUnfortunately, despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching, am going to have to agree with all the reviewers who hated 'The Open House'. A film that started off pretty good, but ran out of steam very quickly and rapidly got worse by a second half that makes one not want to keep watching. Never judge a film without seeing the whole thing and wanted to give 'The Open House', so gave it a fair chance.\n\nAs said, 'The Open House' started off pretty promising.\n\nDylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton give surprisingly good performances considering the material, especially Minnette. The soundtrack has some nice moments (i.e. \"Silent Night\"), when it isn't being intrusive and annoying.\n\nHowever, so much brings 'The Open House' down. The rest of the cast struggle to do much with so little to do and the direction is so phoned in and pedestrian, one gets the sense that the director showed no interest in the film at all. Too much of the soundtrack is intrusive and annoying, made worse by the excessive and obvious sound effects that just cheapens the mood. The film looks drab generally and like it was made in haste.\n\nWhere 'The Open House' most underwhelms is the writing and story. The writing is incredibly lazy, it's awkward in dialogue, very confused as a result of not tying things up or going into full detail and doesn't feel complete. The story suffers from a very limp pace, apparent early on and gets slower and slower until an interminably dragged out second half. It further suffers from feeling too much like a short film stretched out with a lot of useless padding. A few of the characters are reasonably likeable but the inconsistent and illogical motivations bring them down.\n\nFor a film billed as a horror, though it's more a thriller with horror elements, there is very little interesting and nothing remotely scary. They are too few and are far too predictable, anaemic and weakly timed to make impact, with the dull pacing and obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly. In terms of the thriller elements, 'The Open House' doesn't engage let alone thrill, the start intrigued by feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out of steam. Worst of all is the ending, which is so abrupt, unresolved and incomplete that one struggles to even consider it an ending, the film just ends and leaves one scratching their heads in confusion and feeling cheated.\n\nOverall, the potential was there but the execution far from was. Really bad, unless you're curious about seeing it it's best to keep this house closed. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

We simply don't know for sure and probably never will, unless there is a sequel. I've decided I'm okay with this and it's made me apreciate the movie in a whole new way.\n\nI have my own theory as to what happened. If you pay attention, there are quite a few clues throughout the movie that point to a very likely conclusion.\n\nI hate that I will never be certain, but there are a million other movies I can watch if I crave that kind of closure. This is clearly not one of those movies. It made me think outside the cookie cutter thriller/horror box. It made me question my expectations. It made me realize that the reason we get upset by these frustrating, anti-climatic endings is because of our innate need to control and correct imbalance and injustice. Sometimes life is just unfair, bad things happen and we'll never know why.\n\nGive it a chance. The movie is decent. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but well worth a watch."

As things started to get creepy, they set up a bunch of red herrings, and kept me guessing. I was actually interested to see how things turned out for the main characters.\n\nThen, in the last 15 minutes, the movie takes a hard nose dive and 'resolves' the plot in one of the most pointless, unsatisfying ways I've ever seen.\n\nTurns out, all the character growth, drama, red herrings - none of that mattered at all. They gave us a feel-bad horror ending that serves no purpose and makes me feel like an idiot for paying attention."

The movie stars Dylan Minnette, Piercey Dalton, Sharif Atkins, Patricia Bethune and Aaron Abrams. It was written, directed and co-produced by rookie filmmakers Matt Angel and Suzanne Coote (who also play small parts in the film), and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. The movie is well shot, and acted in my opinion, but it's also completely pointless, and a waste of time to watch.\n\nLogan Wallace (Minnette) is a teenager with dreams of being a champion runner. Then his father is struck and killed by a car, while Logan is watching. He and his mother, Naomi (Dalton), move into her sister's house, while it's in the process of being sold. They soon realize that there might be powerful supernatural forces there, that are unhappy with their presence. The movie is a pretty routine horror/thriller flick, but (like I said) the production values are decent, and Minnette gives a good enough performance in the lead. The story, and character development, isn't horrible, until the end of the movie. That's when I felt like the whole film was kind of a complete waste of time. Up until then though, I didn't feel that negatively about the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's pretty clear that 'The Open House' is failing to connect with people in a positive way based on its 3.4/10 score on IMDb. Seeing that I went into it expecting something pretty terrible. Now, while I can understand that this film has faults a plenty, I can't quite grasp it having a score that low. Let's get into some analysis.\n\nThe problems the movie possesses are as follows. Firstly, it's a bore. There are long periods of the film where it feels like nothing of significance is happening. Now that might not be entirely true when you find out what is actually going on at the end of the film, however the audience not being let in on this information is still going to be bored and uninterested. And therein lies probably the biggest flaw the movie has. There is a genuine threat to these people in the movie, but the audience has no idea about it. How can that ever be considered a good idea to have in your movie? Finally the amount of red herrings this film has that ultimately lead to absolutely nothing is absurd. There was a chance to be clever along the way, but the film makers just completely by-passed that option.\n\nSo why didn't I hate this film as much as everyone else? A lot of people are going to hate this movie for its ending and the path it chose to take. I actually respect it for it. At least, I respect the idea. The execution left a lot to be desired. The idea though was actually quite bold and attempting to be unique. I also liked that it didn't fall into the lazy category of slipping into the supernatural side of things, although there is at least one dream sequence is the laziest of all types of film making. So no this isn't a good film, but I also don't agree with its score being as low as it is."

If you like a slow creeping horror, that makes you analyze exactly what is going on in the then this movie is for you. I would say that Patricia Bethune performance was quite lordly, if you catch my drift, and that the main characters (mother and child) are quite good souls, that makes this film a crash hit!"

I found it to be story that left room for interpretation - somewhat like life - you don't know what you're getting but you know there's something you're to get from it. Yes, the mom was insensitive at times to her son who had more commonsense than she and yes, the story had no ending but that's where the interpretation comes in at. It left room for a broad discussion i.e. who done it, why and who was involved. Should every story have an ending or should we just allow ourselves as screenplay viewers to be open to personal or group discussion. It's not a question, it's rhetorical. It certainly leaves room for a sequel. :)"

And finally the ending leaves us completely in the dark. No resolution. We end up knowing nothing more than how the film started. Seriously Netflix? I know not every original can be a winner, but this film feels like a lousy cut and paste of an edit of a much larger film.

This movie could have actually been something had the dimbwhitted writer bothered to do the most important thing, finish the script to conclusion. What was the whole point of this, why, who, anything except to leave you with nothing whatsoever in the end except questions. The writer needs to get their convenience store job back and stay there!!!"

Later, it comes up again - as his running goals are significant to him - and YES, it IS a mile time! How is it that the writing-directing team, the lead actor, anyone on the entire filmmaking team didn't catch this major gaffe?\n\nBasically, this movie consists of a bunch of long shots pushing in ominously trying to make us scared, but it fails to deliver much of a story."

The ending was probably done in that way to allow for a second, and I wouldn't be shocked to see an Open House Part 2 made.\n\nSolid performances, Dylan Minnette, who's always pretty good put in a solid performance, I thought the scenes where he lashed out in anger to his mother about his father's death were very well played out, films so often go way over the top, this had a sense of realism.\n\nWhen you think that the budget for this film was $100,000 I think it should be applauded, many films with budgets many times that size fail in so many ways, this was a good hour and a half of escapism.\n\nIt's not to be taken too seriously, and we didn't get many answers, but that's life."

I expected the movie to ramp up and get exciting with the mother & son making the intruder wish he'd picked another house ... but no, there was no fighting back. They both die and he leaves. And he was no one. They didn't even show his face, which was kind of stupid. Make it the crazy Neighbors husband or something. Anything but the nothing you chose.\n\nAlso, hire some stunt people/stunt doubles. I know the film was made on the cheap, but that 3rd act needed some actual action and there was nothing. They couldn't even smash a table or have someone falling down the stairs - the basics. It was so dodgy.\n\nI'd recommend not watching. You'll just be disappointed."

No questions were answered, the plot had so many holes in it, and the script seemed ridiculous. I was not convinced with any of the dialogue; it all seemed canned and unbelievable. The music was good at times. But what in the name of all things holy was up with those scenes with the suspenseful music, where nothing even happened? For example, at one point, suspenseful music crescendoed while Logan walked in the basement. The camera focuses on a bunch of wood, and then the scene ends. What the hell? Was that wood supposed to be a foreshadowing of something? At another time, intense music builds up and ends with the camera just focusing on the woods outside. There were multiple instances of this. It's like the directors went to film school, learned about suspenseful build-ups, but completely fell asleep while the instructor covered how to use them. There has to be, like, a reason! I'm thoroughly astounded that Netflix picked this up. You mean to tell me that a Netflix executive watched this, liked it, and made the conscious decision to pay for this movie? I honestly can't believe that. My honest (but maybe a bit crazy) suspicion is that this movie was made by artificial intelligence. A crude, experimental AI algorithm designed to configure a set of factors such as sets of characters, plot points, sets of dialogue and such, into a set amount of time. And the Netflix community is unwittingly the user testing group. There's no other serious explanation. The dialogue was so forced and unrealistic. The characters weren't believable. The plot, especially, was incoherent. AI is breaking into everything, and it has to start somewhere. If this really was AI, at least in some capacity, calling the shots as a director, I'd say it was a good first effort. But if this was an actual human production, may God have mercy on these producers' and directors' souls and careers."

I feel like I was betrayed for getting hooked on the good acting and having anticipated a climax. I feel left hanging and my time was wasted.\n\nDo not recommend, chose a different horror to be entertained. There's so many other good ones."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not sure what all the hate on this movie is really about- especially considering the genre of horror movies that lives on Netflix is dismal at best. I am a huge horror fan, and I have seen some really bad horror movies. This is NOT one of them.\n\nNow on to my review about this movie. I will really focus on what worked, I won't even really comment on what didn't work since everyone is spewing it too much any way.\n\nI really enjoyed the initial sense of confusion the film brought, is it a ghost? Or is it a killer? Were they set up by the sister? What is with the neighbor? Will they live?\n\nThese are all great senses of confusion the filmmakers brought to the table in a horror flick, you shouldn't know where the film is going and it creates a great deal of confession as a viewer- which I really enjoy. These types of atmosphere for horror are rare, but when done right- can keep you watching it till the end since you don't have a feeling you figured it out at any time.\n\nMy favorite aspect is the unexplained backstory- Halloween (78) is a great example of why someone (or something) can be so scary- because we don't understand it. We shouldn't need backstories explained out for why someone kills people in scary movies. Again this is a horror movie, if you want that level of detail- check out MindHunter. This is about creating a villain that is so uncomfortable- you don't understand them at all. (Side note on this: this movie is riddled with homages to the original Halloween). And no- you as a viewer should NOT be connecting with a horror villain like this in order to enjoy the movie, you would feel confused and weirded out. That is how the filmmakers want you to feel.\n\nLastly- this movie did a great job making everything look and sound great. I think the score was fantastic and the locations were beautiful. Even down to the small shots of the basement tunnels.\n\nMy main and only complaint is this film does require a larger sense of need to suspend reality. Although- I can't think of how many times I lose my cellphone and \"swear\" I just left it plugged in. I think this movie tries to show you a sense of confusion within the characters that makes you feel bad for them. They are not in their \"right state of mind\" to begin with, however- most people don't call the police or move when you have misplaced something. How many times have you left a light on and swore you turned it off? It creates this sense of how do you even keep track of those things when large issues are on your mind? IE money and family death. I see it too often in people who don't usually watch horror movies: \"I would never go back upstairs\".\n\nOverall, this was decent. It didn't have any hype that I knew of, I just turned it on and watched it. It's fun and has a lot of moments that keep you guessing- until the end. I also didn't find the end confusing at all. I this the final shot made it pretty clear what happened and what will happen again."

When is the open house? 10 pm? Sure, that's a thing that happens in real estate...\n\nI normally can enjoy a bad movie that has redeemable elements (even if it is just campy fun), but this actually had me wanting my money back from Netflix. It was like the guy that knew the story died during film making, and nobody had the script, but they were too far along to just pull the plug or hire another writer.\n\nHorrible.

The noble premise, which I thought brilliant, is to take two utterly ordinary and defenceless people, driven by tragedy and circumstances to a huge rambling mansion, which, again by circumstance, they are forced to leave vulnerable and open to the public for long periods. This defencelessness is heightened by the lead's terrible eyesight, being effectively blind without contacts or glasses. This is very sophisticated drama, and the actors and director manage this with consummate skill. However, such realism, which by its very nature can be time-consuming to portray, may well not be everyone's cup of tea. And the length of the buildup does tend to immunise the viewer from a lot of the scares that repeat. It did for me, but not for my brother, whom jumped twice as often as I did. The tragedy mentioned is revealed only in the behaviour of the leads, a delicate thing, and why I give this piece a high score, with only one flashback late in the movie to make the circumstance specific. That was a plus for me. There is very little gore or splatter and certainly no special effects. It is an effective journey into an ultimate and very real horror, but it is also a very sad reflection on tragedy and vulnerability. I loved the message of this movie. This is an intelligent picture."

I hope if you're reading this, you will give this film a chance. Go in with no expectations and enjoy the ride!"

That way you keep waiting for some shock which you never get. In the earlier parts they try to build some supernatural tension and in the end it suddenly becomes a serial killer. U don't even get to know who it is, why he is doing this, any of this. In one of the scenes a neighbourhood guy goes into the basement to have a look at the house and there is no closure to that scene. That is the harbinger of what is to come ie the movie also doesn't get any closure likewise and ends. All in all don't waste your time on this."

The family has financial problems which prompts them to move. His mother's sister offers them an open house she has yet to sale in the meantime until they get back on their feet. As soon as they start staying there, weird things start to happen.\n\nThe first few minutes starts well, but then descends into a black pit of turd. Why do I find it so horrible? I mean, the actors are fine, the camerawork's great, the cinematography's beautiful. It's just the execution and the storytelling.are so unfathomably stupid, clich\u00e9d, and have been done to death. False jump scares; weird, possible red herrings; characters who are oblivious to what's happening around them, who does stupid things. By the end, I was just laughing because of how ridiculous the conclusion is.\n\nThe only saving graces are Dylan Minette and Piercey Dalton. They really tried to convince us with their conflict that stems from their grief. Their dramatic moments were the only highlight of this movie, which are so few and far in between.\n\nIt's infuriating to see such hackneyed work that looks gorgeous and has some great acting. If this were to be released in theaters, it would flop so bad. Don't bother wasting your time on this."

To be honest, I believed until the very last minute that the film would conclude differently, and it was quite a shock to see just how mistaken I was.\n\nWhile I'm not typically a fan of these types of movie endings, I find it refreshing to have one that deviates from the mainstream. It undoubtedly leaves you with a sense of unease, which I consider a sign of a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was so bad, I will not even spend any time writing a traditional review. it just isn't worth it. Plus, it seems like this movie is getting hammered by terrible reviews from everyone who is unfortunate enough to see it. So, instead of a review, I have a few questions;\n\n1. To the writers responsible for this abomination; have you ever seen a movie before? Do you understand basic story structure, and how every successful story has to have a clear beginning, middle and end? Where was your road map as to how this movie was supposed to unfold? I am just struggling to understand what the thought processes were here.\n\n2. The movie had everything going for it; Decent premise, a great trailer, an extremely talented cast, a nice soundtrack. How did it derail so profoundly, to the point of it almost appearing intentional? No one releases garbage like this and is proud to have their name prominently displayed in the credits, so what gives?\n\n3. If this is a suspense/thriller, why all of the jump scares? It's too tame to be a horror film and not smart enough to be a real thriller, so whom may I ask was the intended audience? There is salty language, nudity and some disturbing scenes, but everything rolls out like a Teen Nick special. Who were you targeting, and were you aware that you were going to fail everyone with this project?\n\n4. Lastly, what in the name of all that is sweet and pure in the world was the conclusion of the movie about? I would not even call it a real conclusion, as nothing is truly resolved, but were the film makers attempting to evoke a vastly superior film (Funny Games), failed miserably, and said, \"You know what? The movie is done. Just release it as is. Someone is bound to like it\"? I cannot for the life of me think of a single person I would recommend this film to. I just wouldn't do that to anyone.\n\nThis is one of those rare movies that doesn't accomplish anything, which makes it that much more embarrassing as it had all the cards stacked in its favor. The writers should be ashamed that they unleashed this dirty diaper onto Netflix, and Netflix itself should be publicly shamed for allowing it to soil their service. One of the worst movies I have EVER seen, don't even bother watching it out of curiosity. Please, do not waste your precious time like I have."

I figured, \"ooh, a scary movie on a Saturday night, starring Dylan Minette (13 Reasons Why), 'Don't Breathe' was good, let's go!\"\n\nThe trailer says, \"You can't lock out what's already inside.\" Maybe we'll get lucky and this will be sort of like the iconic 'Scream' franchise. We follow Logan and his mother as they are forced to move to his aunt's big house in a very secluded location. The only catch is they have to leave for the most part of every Sunday because there's an open house where potential buyers come in and out inspecting the place. Big house, out every Sunday, seems harmless enough, right?\n\nWhen they get back, strange things start to happen like doors closing, things getting moved, and noises from places where there shouldn't be. At this point, everyone becomes a suspect, the kooky neighbor, the over-friendly store attendant, the plumber, the cops, and even Logan himself. Halfway through the movie I confidently said I've got the invader figured out and was just riding it out until the movie ends. Boy was I wrong.\n\nI won't spoil it for you but you have to wait until the end credits to figure out who the invader is. Like literally, you have to read the cast credits. Then it's up to you as to how you will react. A Forbes review got pissed off, it has a 3.2/10 rating in IMDB, while I just laughed and figured to just charge it to Netflix's aggressive expansion for content in 2017-18 (see The Ritual, 1922, Gerald's Game and Hush.) As long as you don't have a lot of expectations and you have 90 minutes to waste, you might actually enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "We're in the risky month of January once again and when it comes to watching new releases in entertainment, it's usually a coin toss as to whether or not a movie will actually be good. Ever since Netflix began to release original films, I've found myself holding out hope that fantastic independent films will slowly begin to make their way onto streaming services, instead of failing at the box office. Well, if one of Netflix's most recent films in The Open House is any indication, then we're still a very long way from something like that ever happening. Not only is this one of the most non-scary horror films that I've seen in recent memory, but it's also one of the worst films in general that I've seen in recent memory. People talk about how bad a movie is, but sometimes it just has to be seen to be believed. Now streaming, here's why I think you should check this movie out just to see how bad it truly is.\n\nStarring Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton star in The Open House, a film that (after a tragic event) follows them as they work on selling their home. Shacking up in a family member's house up in the mountains while they set up open houses, creepy things begin to happen to them. What's disturbing them? Well, without giving anything away, literally nothing is ever explained to you throughout the movie. It's almost a joke that this film was even made because not a single portion of this movie is terrifying and not a single plot point is interesting enough to hold your attention for two seconds.\n\nLook, I've said this before, but it's really not necessary to make a horror movie to scare the hell out of someone because it's all about atmosphere and visuals. When the It hit theatres last year, it wasn't the kind of film that needed to throw scares in your face, because it focussed more on its characters and made you just care about watching these kids hang out and hope they all make it out of the film alive. So, when a movie like The Open House manages to simultaneously provide incredibly weak characters, laughably cheap set pieces, jump scares that you can see coming over ten minutes before they happen (and that's not even an exaggeration), and a conclusion that's pretty much a slap in the face to every viewer for even watching the movie, then I have nothing good to say about it.\n\nFrom the small films that Dylan Minnette has appeared in, to his larger role in last year's new series 13 Reasons Why, I've always enjoyed watching his performances, but even he was incredibly one-note here. Every time something would happen in their house that was supposed to trigger chills from the audience, it felt forced and quite honestly, every single set piece was a re-creation of another horror film. Yes, it's practically impossible to not draw inspiration from other movies these days, but The Open House just felt uninspired from start to finish.\n\nIn the end, I found myself chuckling if a character died, laughing hysterically at each jump scare, rolling my eyes when a new plot point arises that you already know the outcome to, or just plain being bored at the bland imagery. The funny thing is that this movie has an ending that I didn't exactly see coming, but the way it ends actually makes the movie worse than it already is. It's still very early in the year, but I'll be shocked if this doesn't stay my most hated movie of this year. The Open House is truly an awful film and unless you get a kick out of terrible horror films, then I would advise that you steer clear of this one."

If you like crazy overdone, predictable horrors, please don't watch it but if you like something new and fresh, ignore the low ratings idk what their issues are. It was a good movie, maybe bc there wasn't the everyday of the mill actors in it, Idk, but it was a good movie, try it."

If I were given the role, I'd beat the director and producer senseless which again seems synonymous with the movie plot.\n\nStarted out with all the makings of a good movie. But apparently 30mins in, the reins were handed over to school kids looking to get their feet wet in the movie business.\n\nCheap thrills and cheaper ending. It's a movie where dumbasses who don't know how to use a light switch or take a hint, waste our precious time with no concerted end in mind.\n\nHighlight of the movie is the Woman's butt. I humbly thank the director for leaving that in, it got you 1 star. Probably the most memorable part of the movie too. I'm sure if more was shown I would have gone up a few stars. Thats the only thing to save sh** like this which makes it's way on tv.\n\nAnother takeaway: There are idiots working at Netflix"

When you turn on a Netflix movie with your family you expect to get a little creeped out then laugh at the killer being exposed 20 minutes in the movie being the neighbor. This movie was not that! VERY similar to Stranger things. I was hanging in the edge of my seat the entire movie. This movie brings good acting, a aminous plot, and some close to home terror right into your home."

Dylan Minnette captured my heart in the Netflix original series \"13 Reasons Why\". When I saw he was in this movie, I watched it immediately. From the beginning of the movie to the end, I felt confused. Many, many things didn't make sense or didn't add up. Every time it seemed they were going somewhere, they wound up at a dead end with a dead plot. By the end of the movie, I was thinking I had missed something, but I had not. I rated this title 6 out of 10 stars because although the storyline was a bit confusing, the acting was still tolerable; the concept was intriguing, and it was overall a decent movie to settle for."

From ages four to 11 we bounced around among five different cities in New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. When you move a lot in a relatively short amount of time, you get used to some of the cultural trappings that come along with relocations."

And then it ended and I was left with the feeling the movie-makers really had no idea what the movie was about. Yeah, throw in some personal tragedy, some weird neighbors, a struggling mother-son-relationship, FINE. Don't invest in any thought completely and you'll get a.. wet sandwich.
