        "review_detailed_main": "Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.\n\nEmile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minutes\u0097with Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no license\u0097and it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.\n\nAll the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.\n\nHirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) \"Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,\" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.\n\nI think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man \"when you forgive, you love.\" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that \"happiness (is) only real when shared\", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.\n\nI loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: \"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...\"\n\nAnd at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: \"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.\n\nThis is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.\n\nThe feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.\n\nWhat it reminded me of...\n\n\n\n\n\n... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was \"too long\" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.\n\nHal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic."

Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great."

        "review_detailed_main": "For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.\n\nSean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in \"The Pledge\" and \"The Crossing Guard.\" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays \"Chris McCandless\" (a.k.a. \"Alexander Supertramp\" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.\n\nTwo people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (\"Ron France\") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as \"Tracy Tatro,\" who had a crush on \"Alex.\" This young woman is on her way to stardom.\n\nBrian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, \"Rainey\" and \"Jan.\" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.\n\nKnowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a certain irony to the story from \"Into the Wild\", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!\n\nThe story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were. Ultimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.\n\nI think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this. Overall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend."

He did something that brought me to something I never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want a movie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this is it, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. Its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what."

A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out?\n\nSean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naivet\u00e9 of youth.\n\nI am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized \"Grizzly Man\", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.\n\nI found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.\n\nRecommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment."

Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as \"if you only see one film this year\" and goes beyond the very notion of \"Oscar-worthy\". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.\n\nA rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. \"I'm going into the wild\" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.\n\nChristopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.\n\nTo simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.\n\nInto the Wild isn't an \"easy\" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many \"issue movies\" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry."

        "review_detailed_main": "How can you describe a film like Into the Wild? One of the greats & by far my favourite film of all time. The only film I have ever seen which manages to capture the true spirit of adventure. The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.\n\nEmile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.\n\nInto the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought. I highly recommend this film. It is one that will stay with your for a long long time."

Culture is the context for almost everything you do especially everything we do socially with other people. Chris Mccandless understood that consciousness is purely a solo activity. You can't increase consciousness through culture. Your ability to self-actualize will only come down to your inner work. Consciousness will not grow in a group environment because it produces all the classic mechanical symptoms of a cult. Fundamentally society is trying to take consciousness, and trying to distribute it to the masses through a culture mechanism, and that always makes it mechanical. It suffocates consciousness, and that's the problem.\n\nThe most significant cult you got to be afraid of is not those little cults it's the massive cult. The superset of all cults which is almost entirely transparent to you and it feels just like reality. It feels like it couldn't be any other way."

Instead, he gives the savings for charity and decides to travel to Alaska to live in the wilderness using the alias Alexander Supertramp. Along his journey, Alex meets persons that supports and like him. But he proceeds with his of hermit with tragic end.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" is a long and overrated film based on the true story of the tragic journey of a spoiled and selfish dreamer. After graduating, Chris McCandless decides to leave his life of petit bourgeois, his family, his possessions and achievements because he has two childhood traumas: he learnt that their parents were not married when he was younger and he witnessed their arguments. Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory explanation for such drastic attitude. Chris does not send news to his parents since he hates them. But his sister suffers with the absence of news from her brother and he is so selfish that he does not call or write a letter even for her. Another strange point is no reference to drugs in the hippie camps. Therefore, the story is unpleasant and weird as a drama. The cinematography and the locations are the best this movie can offer to the viewer. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Na Natureza Selvagem\" (\"Into the Wilderness\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see this film without reading much about it, driven by curiosity. It is an excellent film, although it is difficult to see, and the main character has ideas, attitudes and motivations that can be discussed. Very well directed by Sean Penn, the film tells the life (brief, since he died very young) of Christopher McCandless, a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp. As the film shows, he was from a wealthy family and had a good education, but he carried with him the revolt against his abusive father and his passive mother. Then, he acquired a lot of disdain for capitalist, materialistic, consumerist society in which he never saw himself: burning and giving his money, abandoning everything that was not essential, he left his old life behind and started to wandering, as a vagabond, in the middle of the wild, before moving on to his great goal: Alaska.\n\nMuch more than the film itself, it is the figure of Chris McCandless that proves to be fascinating: he could be seen as a utopian idealist in search of a dream, a spoiled young man angered against his family or a traumatized man, fiercely determined to purge his past through destructive self-denial. Personally, I admire his iron determination, the way he did not hesitate to venture out, against all odds and, not infrequently, against all good sense. But I admire that because I would never have the courage (or perhaps the recklessness?) to imitate him. In any case, he is a figure who will remain controversial and will certainly continue to raise questions and attract fans and critics.\n\nI really enjoyed the work of Emile Hirsch for the film. The actor worked hard and gave himself completely to the character, not hesitating to dispense the help of stunts and to lose weight until he looked like a war survivor. He truly embodied the character and gave us an excellent dramatic job. Beside him, there is a wide and interesting range of supporting actors who brighten up the film: Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener. In some brief but important characters, we have the easily recognizable names of Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart. Much more remarkable and interesting, Hal Holbrook's work in a philosophical character that only appears for a few minutes, earned him the nomination for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nTechnically, the film has several points worthy of praise and positive mention, starting with an excellent camera work, which makes the most of the natural beauty of the filming locations, and a great cinematography where light and shadow are magnificently used. It is a very long film, but the editing work was excellent, and I felt that the story told fully justifies the two and a half hours in length. The sets are good (especially the bus) and also the costumes, particularly that of the main character, with his hair and beard giving him an increasingly wild, sloppy look. The makeup team's work also deserves a note of praise for the way it left Hirsch's face particularly emaciated and pale for some scenes."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's too bad that I saw Werner Herzog's amazing documentary \"Grizzly Man\" before I saw \"Into the Wild.\" One can't help but be reminded of Herzog's film while watching Penn's, or the fact that Herzog's is so much better.\n\nBoth films have as their focus troubled young men who travel to the Alaskan wilderness to escape a society in which they feel they don't belong. Both men have persecution complexes of a sort, and feel that there's something noble in their efforts to commune with the wilderness. But \"Grizzly Man\" is an objective, journalistic account of Timothy Treadwell, and Herzog's fascination is with the obsessions that made him tick. \"Into the Wild,\" being a fictional film, is already once-removed from the real-life story of Christopher McCandless, and director Penn piles on so much bombast and padding, that the impact of the story becomes blunted under a veneer of pure Hollywood studio.\n\nMy biggest obstacle in liking this film is that I didn't like the character of Christopher, nor did I like Emile Hirsch, the actor who plays him. McCandless, who gives himself the moniker Alexander Supertramp once he's set off on his odyssey, is an arrogant 20-year old who thinks he has the world figured out, and woe be to anyone who tries to tell him otherwise. His psychological troubles stem from the emotionally (and the movie suggests at times physically) abusive environment he grew up in. His parents are played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as cartoonish caricatures of Southern aristocracy; his sister, played by Jena Malone, is the only one who Christopher believes understands him, and her character provides the film with one of the most thudding voice over narrations I've ever heard in a movie. We get it -- he shuns the materialistic world as a way of shunning his affluent parents. But a two and a half hour movie built around a kid learning a lesson that many of us already knew going into it makes for a mighty tedious movie indeed.\n\nThat lesson, learned too late, is that human companionship makes life worth living, and that happiness means very little if you have no one to share it with. Many recognizable actors show up throughout the film as strangers Christopher comes across and develops fleeting relationships with, and all of them have a chance to pontificate. The trouble is that all of them (especially Catherine Keener as a hippie and Hal Holbrook as a lonely old man) are so much more interesting than Christopher himself that we wish the movie would stay with them and let Christoper be on his merry way.\n\nThis movie really copped out as far as I'm concerned. Everyone Christopher comes across is gently understanding of his plan even if they try to discourage him. Not once does someone tell him that his actions represent supreme cowardice and hypocrisy. If he was so bothered by the state of society, why didn't he do something productive to help change it rather than run away and hide? Maybe this is the point Penn was trying to make, but I felt like Penn himself couldn't decide whether Christopher's behavior was foolish or admirable.\n\nI feel like I was meant to come away from this film moved by the tragedy of a life wasted. But I wasn't moved at all, nor did I find it all that tragic. \"Grizzly Man\" -- now THERE's a film that moved me.\n\nGrade: B-"

Penn is not only directing this beautifully, he also managed to write a screenplay for a three hours movie about a guy who basically just wanders around in the wild and then starves, without ever slowing the movie down so much that it becomes boring. Sure, you have to be in the mood for this (and it's best to see it in a cinema, I guess), but if you really let yourself in for \"Into The Wild\", you'll be deeply touched by the story of this remarkable young guy who chose to live by his own rules and by his own rules alone.\n\nThere's not one weak link in the cast and Sean Penn directs all the actors to perfection. Emile Hirsch carries the movie. His resemblance to the real Christopher McCandless is uncanny as evidenced by a self portrait of McCandless at the end. What Hirsch did for the role - losing 40 pounds - is reminiscent of Christian Bale's engagement for \"The Machinist\" and speaks for the soul he put into his performance. All the supporting actors - in fact everybody other than Hirsch is a supporting actor here - are great as well: Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and the wonderful Hal Holbrook. Last but not least Eddie Vedder's soundtrack adds a lot to the haunting atmosphere of the movie.\n\n\"Into The Wild\" is something that won't let go of you after you've left the cinema and it might actually make you rethink your principles in life. I applaud Sean Penn for realizing his vision so well and hope to see more of him in the future. By him, actually."

        "review_title": "An epic American adventure",
        "review_detailed_main": "Of all the animals shown in this movie: The Kodiak Bear, the Grey Wolf, the Bald Eagle, the Moose etc, only one has the ability to make dreams.... that animal is man.\n\nFrom director Sean Penn, Into the Wild captures in detail one of the defining features of the human species; to be able to have a dream, and the desire to fulfill it. Despite a somewhat clunky two and a half hour running length (which may feel loger depending on how old you are) Into the Wild is an adventure that becomes one with the viewer. It is a demanding project but the work has paid off nicely, and I'll raise my glass to it for that.\n\nInto the Wild is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. After graduating college as an A+ student in 1992, he chose to leave his materialist society and stuck up family behind. He chaged his name to Alex Supertramp, and embarked on a quest for Alaska. On his journey, he covered thousands of miles of American wilderness, on foot, by train, car, kayak, meeting a plethora of weird and wonderful people along the way.\n\nIt is absolutely vital for the movie that the character of Chris/Alex is one whose company we can enjoy. After all, his journey is ours. Emile Hirsh's performance is definitely sufficient. He is a little wacky but in a good way. He is also talented, bold, determined, and fun to be around. I suppose it is also worth noting that he has a pretty face.\n\nA movie like Into the Wild is also demanding on the crew. After all, the storyline covers about half the country, which of course means lots of transportation is needed, and lots of landscape imagery. The camera is all over the place, referring of course to locations (not movement). Into the Wild is a gorgeously photographed picture, which is backed up with a great song score from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. I remember a couple years ago during Oscar season being annoyed that his songs were snubbed, because of eligibility rules.\n\nMy one problem with the movie, is that the editing feels a bit tripy. Into the Wild frequently plays with time in a Pulp Fiction manner, and some of that time concerns flashbacks related to family melodrama. These scenes are conveniently short but they don't seem important enough to be worth showing. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the last half hour could use a few trims.\n\nNo movie is perfect of course, and no human being is perfect either, it is not until the end of the film when we realize that about Chris. But I'll say this much, the journey was worth it, and if you can spare an hour and a half for Into the Wild, I think you will agree with me on that."

I'm shocked at how many people missed the point and tried to find his bus in real life."

        "review_detailed_main": "The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.\n\nEmile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.\n\nInto the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought."

        "review_detailed_main": "I knew nothing of Christopher McCandless or the book of his life or even anything about this movie until I was sitting in the cinema. The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat, The Pledge I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.\n\nAlexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.\n\nHis dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.\n\nSean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.\n\nBut Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. If he doesn't earn an Academy Award come Oscar-time then there ain't no justice in the world. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.\n\nDon't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see. Since I live in the UK, the story of Christopher McCandless (which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America) is not well known here. I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level. Definitely something I will be tracking down on HD DVD when it's released.\n\nPS\n\nI broke my tooth while watching this movie. Just ordinary chewing gum took a big chip out of one of my molars."

I truly believe that you can feel when your in the presence of greatness... I felt it when I saw the world premiere of Crash three years ago, in the exact same theater and I felt it once again watching Into the wild.\n\nEmile Hirsh gives a gripping performance as John McCandess, at times it felt as though I was watching an incredible documentary. I never once though of him as an actor portraying a character but instead it almost felt life like! He deserves Mr. Oscar and so does Penn just for the stunning imagery alone.\n\nHal Holbrook melted my heart and his performance brought tears to my eyes- he is incredible, yet maybe shared 15 minutes of the screen time. I cannot say enough about him- sheer genius casting. Catherine Keener shined in her role as the hippie mom type, to which I think she deserves to be considered in the Supporting Actress category.\n\nEddie Vedder brings each scene come alive with his perfectly place music.\n\nGo see this movie it will change your life- the underlying themes and true life premise make you rethink what is possible in life. John Mc Candess was a hero in his own right and Emile Hirsh is trying to tell the whole world with this performance. Trust me you wont be disappointed!"

I enjoyed the Vedder soundtrack, and I thought certain cinematic elements were beautiful (though not always serving to the storyline) such as the night shots in L.A. However, there was a lot a didn't care for. The voice over narration by Carine McCandless (Jena Malone) didn't work for me because the story was not hers to tell, and the narration together with the rapid cutting within scenes and the frequent temporal shifts left me unable to identify with either Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) or the viewpoints of the characters that Chris met along his way as I was able to do with, for example, the supporting characters in Agn\u00e8s Varda's Vagabond (1985). Being unable to identify with any of the characters, I was left in the position of an outside observer and here Penn failed to make much of this position either. For example, Penn did not use the camera to show us anything that Chris failed to figure out. Krakauer's book makes clearer that the magic bus was not as isolated as Chris believed it to be, and that the seasonal river that cut off Chris's planned departure route could have been crossed upstream. Penn could have unobtrusively shared this information with the viewer, but chose to withhold it for the purpose, I suspect, of romanticizing Chris's adventure."

I like the music so much i bought it on cd.\n\nJune 21 2015 i left the Netherlands and went to America to do the trip that Alexander (Alex) Supertramp did. I visited the locations and ended of course in Alaska. During my trip in Alaska i met a girl named Sarah that looked very much like Tracy Tatro in the movie. She played guitar and could sing like Tracy. We visit together the location of the movie bus and we went to the nature three days walking from the real bus that still is in the nature. She left back to Anchorage to go back to San Francisco where she lives. I walked three days to the real bus that is stil standing in the nature. When i was at the location of the bus i slept in a tent for three days close to the bus. After that i walked more in to the nature to be alone for a week. It is strange to be alone for a week,i even started talking to myself. After my trip in the nature i lifted back with people to Anchorage. I had the greatest time there.\n\nWhen i left Alaska i went back to San Francisco to see Sarah. We started a relationship in the last three weeks that i was in America. In August 2016 i stopped working in The Netherlands and said goodbye to family and friends,because i was going to live in San Francisco with Sarah. August 21 2016 i left The Netherlands and went to Sarah. After three days Sarah told me that she lost her job and went back to her mother to live there. I stayed in a hotel close to her mothers house but after a while we realized the relationship was over.\n\nFrom that moment i thought what really makes me happy? The only thing that came up in my head is traveling around the world. I went from San Francisco to Las Vegas,Canada,Mexico,England,Ireland,And much more countries. I travel now for almost three years without seeing my family and old friends. Some people call me selfish for leaving my family and friends. I still have contact with family and some friends using e-mail.\n\nTraveling makes me happy now for almost three years. Christopher Mccandless quote is:Happiness is only real when shared. My quote is: You can only give happiness when you are happy!"

So I sincerely urge everyone to give this a go, if you haven't. This is a sublime experience which one can't exactly put to words but deeply relate to, anytime.

        "review_title": "Into the Wild: Uncompromisingly Brilliant",
        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild is Sean Penn's adaptation of the same-titled novel by John Krakaeur. Filmed, among other places, in the wilds of Alaska where a good deal of the real story it tells occurred, it is a faithful presentation of an interesting tale.\n\nThe film is the story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes disillusioned with the world of upper class life, and goes off into the wild to find something more meaningful in his existence. Meeting many interesting characters along the way and affecting their own views on life, McCandless aims forever toward Alaska, the final point of his lengthy journey.\n\nI found myself instantly drawn into this film. The primary element in this effect is the soundtrack. Eddie Vedder creates a beautiful score which chronicles this adventure and compliments the sprawling beauty of the unoccupied landscapes. The visuals of the film are incredible, the natural shots of this better, effulgent world spellbinding. Penn beautifully directs some of the most stunning images that can be captured. Undoubtedly, the film owes all to the main performance. Emile Hirsch creates a character so real, emotional and three dimensional that we cannot help but be pulled into his vision of the world. The voiceovers from Chris and his sister give us a deeper insight into his motivations as the film flickers between our hero in his perfect world, travelling to get there, and experiencing his personal hell at home. All comes together to create a stunning experience which left me breathless and amazed at its power. The strength of the film is impressive, staggeringly poignant and uncompromisingly brilliant. Especially touching, for me at least, was the performance of Hal Holbrook, a genuinely upsetting and tear-jerking addition.\n\nWith some of the best acting one can ever hope to experience in film, the natural beauty of the Alaskan wilderness forms a backdrop for the genius of this film. Straying from outrightly stating the moral correctness of its protagonist, Into the Wild poises questions which continued to haunt me for weeks and weeks after seeing it. Add a wonderful score, a deeply meaningful story, and a director who obviously believes incredibly in his work, and you have one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Literally a perfect movie. The storyline was good. Acting was good. The ending! Everything was just perfect. I didn't find any fault within this movie. Many people have mentioned in the reviews that the movie was better than the book. I don't know that for sure because I haven't read the book.\n\nThe story is about a young boy, who has just got graduated as a top student decides to leave everything behind and live his life the way he wants. Literally he leaves all his possessions, his family, everything, he leaves his entire society in which he grew up. In some way he was selfish to do that, to leave his family without a single note or a letter, to have his parents, his sister worrying over him for years. But on the other hand leaving with no traces left behind was the only way he could get what he wanted, only way he could get complete freedom, and live his life the way he wanted.\n\nThe annoying, wearisome behavior of his parents was one of the major reasons that caused him to take this decision. He was worn out, tired of this whole civilization thing, the society. So he decided to leave everything behind, his possessions, money, and even his identity. He donated all his money he had for his future education to charity. On his way of leaving the society behind, on his way into the wild, he meets new people, and he learns new things from them. And he gets to spend the life he wanted away from the materialistic society.\n\nThe story is about his journey. It's an awesome story. Very enjoyable. And so were the performances. Brilliant. All of the actors were very suited for their roles. The directing was also very good. And this movie also teaches a very important lesson, to learn that you need to watch the movie. This movie is not just another movie about survival it's more than that. It teaches you the greatest lessons about life. It is one of the very few movies that can have a a very big impact on you, that it leaves you a lot of things to think about, to argue about, after watching the movie. I think It's a must watch for anyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like most films based on a true story, I expected this film to be slow-paced, and I was not surprised in any way.\n\nWhilst the overall feeling of the piece is one of loneliness, I got the impression that the main character could and should have gone back home in the end. He stayed out there too long, in my opinion.\n\nIt was wonderful seeing all the people he met, and seeing how he affected their lives, and how, indeed, they affected his. But he didn't seem to learn anything from the people he met, apart from various trades and skills. If he'd only stopped to listen to them properly, he might have been happier than he ended up.\n\nEnough about the character himself, though. The music to this film is terrific. Eddie Vedder, of Pearl Jam, wrote all the music, and did a sterling job, as usual.\n\nThe ensemble cast is very good, and are directed well by Sean Penn.\n\nThis film really showcases the natural beauty of some parts of America, and indeed, the beauty of some of its people.\n\nOverall, this film is sad, beautiful, yet boring. It drags on a bit, and because the subject matter hardly changes (ie a lonely man travelling up and down the country, meeting people) it is very samey. It's worth watching, but do not expect to take any important messages away having watched it, other than the importance of family and friends."

The look of the film is absolutely beautiful. Think Hal Ashby directing a Jack London novel. Eddie Vedders voice echoes through the entire score which adds an emotional flair. This movie may be a snooze fest to some but if you can take what the movie gives. You can come out as a better person or maybe look at the world in a better light."

I just can't understand how the Golden Globe voters can be so dumb. Atonement sucks, anyways... \"Into The Wild\" is leading the SAG awards and the majority of Academy voters are actors, so I guess the future of the movie is bright...not that it really needs any more hype though,,,the movie is glorious, just like Brokeback Mountain...

Into the Wild was spectacular, breathtaking and compelling to say the least. I sat and watched it with my home girls and we were all three enthralled by it. The messages behind the movie, the acting done by Johnny Truelove, it was outstanding. The only thing I'd ever heard of the movie is that older gentleman was nominated for an Oscar, and it's a shame he didn't win it, I was pushed to tears at the end of his performance. I highly recommend this movie to anybody, its a movie to make you think about your life. I was shocked."

        "review_detailed_main": "10 November 2007. Until the overly, emotionally wrought-movie's ending, INTO THE WILD held little in the way of redeeming value. Though gorgeous and visually stunning, Sean Penn is pretentious and overly excessive in his use of photographic and cinematic techniques. He unnecessarily tries to impress the audience with his apparent ability and knowledge of all the variety of camera work available to him. Unfortunately, the diversity and various uses of his art become a distraction in themselves and sometimes become story instead of the background. This jarring distraction becomes particularly apparent during the scene where Christopher McCandless visits a love tourist stop. In this scene Penn uses an almost documentary-style visual approach to the scene that is completely different from other styles he used in the other portions of the movie. It's use appears to more for showing off than really contributing to the story of the movie. The frequent scattering and non-linear, flashbacks, flashforwards isn't always a pleasant trip, making the audience having to twist and turn in ways that really detract from the main themes of the movie. Instead of allowing the audience just to immerse themselves into the story, they are forced into a roller-coaster ride of almost dream-like snatches of experience that never truly gel into a satisfying experience. Never is the audience allowed to truly grasp the depth of the McCandless' parent's transformation, from their beginning to their ending. Vince Vaughn, probably, has the most authentic, and delightful role in the movie, where his acting is on full display that eschews any of Vaughn's typical character stereotype. The fascinating threads that Sean does present are interesting with their continual focus on relationships throughout the movie that McCandless is exposed to. But unfortunately, these threads never truly succeed in revealing McCandless' depth of relational experience. For example, there are lukewarm inferences of emotional tragedy or regard with respect to McCandless but in another scene from another movie demonstrates how much is lacking in Penn's presentation of McCandless as a character's own emotional trial and self-absorption. In Dr. Zhivago (a book that McCandless actually reads in the movie) the audience is allowed to linger in a haunting scene of Dr. Zhivago's love leaving his life forever in a sleigh that becomes smaller and smaller until it's just a dot on the horizon before fading completely away as Dr. Zhivago desperately tries to climb up into the house's top window and look out at the last glimmer of his love life. The jet airplumes in INTO THE WILD, are much more effectively used in 24 Days After, a movie where a biological contaminated Britain is wiped out and it is only the airplumes overhead that suggest (not as in INTO THE WILD of civilization to runaway from) but civilization that saves. There is the moose killing that is so disrespectful of nature and the land. There is the reckless disregard for taking responsibility of freedom, taking advantage to not conform to the rules of society. Most of the movie appears to be an over-glorification of the wild, rugged, individual man seeking his own identity and freedom, yet, it avoids the more harsh realities that McCandless also likely experienced along the way, except for the very ending. Six out of Ten Stars. Revised 2/14/08."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sean Penn directed and wrote an excellent film about a young boy named Chris (played by Emile Hirsh) who literally gave away all of his money and went off on an adventure to try to identify with himself and leave behind the world that he couldn't fit in. During the adventure he relates to many people that help guide him to his long journey to Alaska where he will live alone Into the Wild.\n\nPerhaps it's the fact that I can relate to Chris's character myself where I feel like I can't live like everyone else with the 9 to 5 lifestyle. The pressure of everyday beats down on you where you just want to leave everything but don't have the courage to do so. I consider Chris McCandless a hero and perhaps one day I can break out of this shell and be free just as he does in the film.\n\nEddie Vedder's soundtrack was perfect for the film. I'll admit that Pearl Jam is my favorite band (I wish I could see Rats live), but it doesn't mean that Vedder could screw up a film. In this case, he was completely on. The song society is my personal favorite. The lyrics are right on to the film's message.\n\nAll the supporting performances were great. Vince Vaughn (not being a fan) was the biggest surprise to me as he was very good for the role. You'll see other familiar faces such as Catherine Keener, Marcia gay Harden, and Kristen Stewart. Interestingly Hal Holbrook was nominated for an Oscar even though he wasn't in the film until an hour and forty-five minutes later.\n\nThis will easily make my top three favorite films of 2007.\n\nMy verdict, 9.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two types of people in the world. Those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and admire 'Chris' for living out his dream, and those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and see his actions as reckless, selfish and pointless. I fell more into the latter camp. I understand the burning desire some people have to do similar things to this, however as much as you may hate your family it is pretty cruel to intentionally put them in such a position. This is a good movie but I think it is based around flawed logic.\n\nI'd been meaning to see this film for nearly 13 years now. I always wondered how they had managed to spread the story of a man going into the Alaskan wilderness by himself into a two and a half hour movie. What I hadn't realised is that very little of the film is actually spent in Alaska. It is more about his journey to get there. Along the way he meets countless people who influence him in one way or another. This was probably my favourite part of the film. Seeing each little interaction and how it affected him. The final one with 'Ron' (played excellently by the Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook) was by far my favourite aspect of the film.\n\nThe things that kept me from flat out loving this movie were probably the runtime being about 30 minutes too long, a feeling of the story drifting on occasion and also a lack of drama or tension for extended periods of the runtime. Whether you see this as an inspirational film, or simply an interesting adventure that a man once took, I think everyone will be able to get something out of this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "(My Synopsis) Based on the true story of 22 year-old Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, gives his entire savings to charity after he graduates with honors from Emory, and begins his journey and great adventure into the wild. Chris believes that he can life off the land and that he doesn't need any money to do that. He had a goal of testing himself to the fullest by heading into the wilds of Alaska and surviving alone. It took Chris about two years to finally make it to Alaska, and along the way he meets a series of colorful people that he had never before encountered through his privileged life. His quest to learn more about the American culture took him from the wheat harvest in South Dakota to a kayak trip down the Colorado River into Mexico, and Slab City, California, before he finally makes it to Alaska. Once in Alaska, Chris must battle for his life against the harsh reality of nature in an abandoned bus.\n\n(My Comment) This isn't a happy movie, but it is an emotionally wrenching and thought provoking story that will make you think. It is about our society, family, idealism, and nature; most of all it is about the romanticism of youth and the tragic consequences of an unforgiving and dangerous wilderness. Chris left everything behind to find something pure in the world, or the meaning of life, or just himself by pushing the limits into the wilderness. During his two wandering years, Chris learns from every person he meets and adds something to his overall experience and the tools he will need to survive. The only problem with that is Chris went into the wilderness without ample preparation. Too little knowledge and experience will get you killed, especially, in Alaska. Considering Chris' intelligence and resources he had with him, it seems that he was very foolish, naive, and youthfully stupid.\n\nWhile Chris was in the \"magic bus\" the movie takes us back and forth in time and explains his dysfunctional family life and his earlier travels during his last two-years. I would have preferred the movie be shown in chronological order and not with so many flashbacks. Emile Hirsch gives an absorbing, completely believable performance as Chris. Hirsch deserves a lot of credit, because he sacrificed and gave of himself to the role. Hirsch lost a lot of weight during the movie to show that Chris was starving to death, and Hirsch will probably receive an Oscar for his performance. It is a long movie, so get ready for it before it starts, because you can't leave your seat until the very end. The story has a tragic ending, but it was beautiful and profound at the same time. At the end of the movie, they show a picture of Chris that was taken by him in front of the bus, and we see that Hirsch resembles him, which is uncanny. (Paramount Vantage, Run time 2:20, Rated R)(10/10)"

Maybe some viewers will find Christopher McCandless' story pointless\u0097I've heard the hubris arguments already\u0097but for those of us who have felt the lure of absolute freedom, the love of unspoiled nature, and the need to find our souls, \"Into The Wild\" is awe- inspiring. Penn's screenplay is succinct and smart, his direction is flawless. The performances\u0097 Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, and Marcia Gay Harden chief among them\u0097are superb and Oscar-worthy. But it is doe-eyed Emile Hirsch who is the heart and soul of this film. With so many grand performances swirling around him, he's easy to overlook. But don't. His joyous and painful portrayal of McCandless/Supertramp is a tribute to the real McCandless' innocent spirit."

The cinematography, location filming and art-house (but not too surreal) direction is perhaps the best I've seen, ever. 3.) The story is true which makes the film even more powerful and emotionally charging (cryable). 4.)

I will not digress on that subject because it is for each person to understand in there own way. Chris chose to live his life almost completely free of relying on objects that in theory are useless to finding happiness and being content with life. This does not mean those who do not live this life are wrong, but instead just shows that the human spirit, body, and mind are the true source of fulfillment in life. This story is a beautiful inspiration on how life can be perceived. Chris' journey INTO THE WILD was so, physically and emotionally and he stretched his limits past all typical boundaries and then some. I applaud his commitment and will. The book was profound and the movie was excellent!"

He heads, in a round-about-way, for Alaska where he can live alone.\n\nSupertramp's sister provides various narrations throughout the film trying to understand why he disappeared as he did -- and gets it -- after reflecting on their family life together.\n\nNot examined is the parental perspective -- worried and concerned -- at times fearing that Chris is dead, but not wanting to bear the fact that he wanted to disappear and they are or were at least partly to blame.\n\nWhile the film is enjoyable as we follow the adventures of Chris, it is unbearable to see this story from the parent's mindset. Chris is selfish, self-centered, and immature, and never thinks of how his parents may feel not knowing whether Chris is dead or alive, suffering somewhere alone, hungry or sick.\n\nChris makes some mistakes living alone which eventually kills him -- wasting his life, devastating his parents and causing a great deal of sorrow for his sister."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of the negative reviews around Into The Wild focus on two things. The merits or otherwise of Chris McCandless and the accuracy of the story. Whilst I can understand a degree of frustration at the addition of at least one fact to romanticise the story and the man, I feel sad that some people are so judgmental of others that they cannot enjoy what is a truly beautiful and thought provoking film.\n\nAt best the protagonist was brave and principled. A voice all too infrequently heard as society careers ever more headlong towards pure materialism. A man who understood that the health of the soul and the clarity of understanding his place was of utmost importance. At worse he was a selfish, ignorant and pretentious brat. A man who was so wrapped up in the tough cards life had dealt him that he unconditionally abandoned the one person who loved him and had been dealt those some cards. A man who failed to recognise that for all the relative pain he had gone through in his adolescence, he also had been given the intelligence and opportunity to really do something with his own life.\n\nThis is what makes Into The Wild first and foremost such a satisfying story. It shouldn't matter which side of the fence you fall, so long as you can appreciate the polarising nature of the character. My emotions towards him swung wildly with the narration of his sister and then seeing the positive effect he seemed to have an everyone he met on his travels. I don't judge him for his foolishness; I think life has judged him quite enough for that already.\n\nOf course none of that covers the beautifully captured scenery, pitch perfect soundtrack and wonderful pacing of the film. The two and a half hours flies by despite the episodic nature of the story, thanks to the inter cuts between the magic bus and what led to it. Emile Hirsch does everything he needs to as the lead and the supporting cast fall in behind up wonderfully. Of particular note are William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as the parents and Catherine Keener who maximises every second of screen time in her portrayal of the roaming hippie, haunted by the reminder of her estranged son.\n\nThere are few films capable of prompting debate quite like Into The Wild and that is a thoroughly fine trait to have. Plus it's a damn enjoyable watch."

Various flashbacks provide insight into his reasons, which are hidden secrets from his families' past. Along the way, he meets a series of colorful characters, who help to shape him, and create the crux of the movies narrative. He finds in these people what he thinks he's lacking, which is family; yet he never stays put for long. His heart set on Alaska. This film is a solid and fascinating road tale, but doesn't provide enough backstory to explain to the audience why he is so motivated to completely uproot his life, give away his possessions, and move to the wild of Alaska. So it's fun and quite interesting across it's run time, but we never truly understand this wanderer, Alexander Supertramp. Only brief glimpses into his past give us any insight, and we never escape the feeling his story deserves better. Fascinating, but incomplete. Emile Hirsch does well with a complicated role. The support is wonderful. Recommended, but somewhere in the middle."

I have read articles from those that knew him and from what I have read Sean Penn has portrayed this young mans life down to a tee. The acting, filming, scenery and Eddie Vedders fantastic soundtrack are all amazing but the story itself is what does it. A mans strict refusal to be lured in by the evil in society leads to an epic journey of Self Development, proving that real strength lies within. This film will not only entertain, it will inspire.

        "review_detailed_main": "Having not read the book, I can only take from Chris McCandless's experiences based on what I saw in the film 'Into The Wild'.\n\nAs a film I found many extraordinary things about it. The splendid cinematography is the first that comes to mind; many of the performances\u2013particularly Hal Holbrook\u2013who was a stand out and the interesting story/screenplay that director Sean Penn had to work with, which he painted over a broad canvas.\n\nI do have some issues with the way it was presented. The narration by McCandless's sister; the passages that flashed across the screen from Chris's letters to Wayne who we really didn't get to know much about in the film and the non linear representation of the story\u2014these things were too distracting for me too get fully immersed in the proceedings. It took me almost a restless hour before I began to settle in and my mind was constantly reminded that I was watching a movie. I feel this is due to Penn's disordered screenplay and self conscious directing style\u2014the actor mugging into the camera??? Being aware of who the director was, I feel that more of Sean Penn's sensibilities and politics came through rather than that of the lead character and has let the film down slightly.\n\nThe choice of Eddie Vedder to score some of the music and songs throughout the film and the structure of the screenplay appears to come more from Penn's own psyche rather than what could have worked better for the films narrative. I personally feel a more linear/mainstream structure to this film would have benefited the story more. The representation of the themes expressed don't appear tempered or balanced enough\u2014too anti this and anti that. Again it felt like too much Penn coming through.\n\nWilliam Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden had thankless roles as McCandless's parents and were wasted screen time. Any other lesser known actors could have portrayed these roles with what little they were given to do; as was with Vince Vaughn's character. Catherine Keener was perfect along with Hal Holbrook and I didn't have any issue with young Emile Hirsch in the lead role.\n\nThrough the events portrayed in the film I admire McCandless's tenacity and passion for pursuing the life and dream he desired. However, I found him arrogant and deluded not to mention hypocritical in denouncing the so called civilized world into which he was born. Alright! Chris had some childhood/upbringing issues but who doesn't. He was educated; intelligent and loved; but many of his actions\u2014 particularly those involving his family appear selfish. After the distressing incident with the Moose, Chistopher McCandless should have surrendered his ego and made an attempt to turn back home. To my mind he is not a hero and does not deserve to be martyred. It was a shame how this bright young mans life ended up - but perhaps his fate was deserved."

There is an important story strand as Chris discovered that his father had been married before and had a child from that relationship and his father had abandoned that family. He felt that his family life was based on lies as well as his parents having an unhappy marriage.\n\nThis might had been an impetus as to why he abandoned his present lifestyle and went on a journey of self discovery. It is based on a true story although one that has a sad ending.\n\nEmile Hirsch does well in channelling the spirit of Chris, his journey, the sense of adventure and yearning for loneliness and yet his character is so likable, mixes well with others, literate, intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate.\n\nThe film is a tad over-long and tries to be fair on his parents and his sister who felt abandoned. Maybe we needed to learn more about the side characters as they all were helping him, caring and looking out for him. There is only the one sore incident when he is caught jumping on freight trains."

        "review_detailed_main": "INTO THE WILD.\n\nInto the wild, a controversial art-house film about searching the truth in life. Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild which I read, tells the story of a 20-year-old graduate called Chris McCandlles (Emile Hirsch). Who donates his entire $24,000 savings account to charity. And abandoned his valuables and starts to live into the wild. Director/Actor Sean Penn prepared nearly 10 years before starting to actually shoot the film. Sean Penn's film adaptation stays close to the source. As a director Sean Penn exposes his ability in directing and absorbs the audience into a melodramatic emotional and truthful story.\n\nInto the Wild combines two popular genres, the road trip part where Chris takes distance from the achievement society to search for the real human being. And the struggle of man versus the ruthless nature in Alaska. Into the wild is narrated by Chris his sister called Carine (Jena Malone). Carine expresses the feelings from her brother in contrast with her parents. Chris heads west, and burns all of his identification cards. He is now known by his nickname \" Alexander Supertramp \". While hitchhiking Chris encounters a hippie couple (Catherine Keener, Brian Dierker) and gets in good company. He learns and shares with them, before moving on. By the time Chris is nearly out of his money. He meets Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) a grain harvester who gets in trouble about his suspicious activities. Chris heads west, his sights now resolutely set on Alaska as his final destination. He re-encounters the hippies and bumps into a young girl (Kristen Stewart). It makes me wonder about the sexuality of Chris. At his last stop Chris is asked to be adopted by a lonely, aging man performed by Hal Holbrook.Chris leaves the request with reference to adoption unspoken as soon as he travels towards Alaska. For Chris It's the journey, not the destination what matters. It's an admirable attitude to life, in what manner Chris creates a fellowship amongst the persons who come across his path while traveling. Every individual who knew Chris understood his notion and loved him. Aimed at Chris, the trip to Alaska is what giving him happiness and pleasure. Chris settled himself into an old coach and survives from what the wilderness dedicates. Emile Hirsch has a very difficult job of taking a character that has been wounded by his parents and the society. Searching for what contents life, but as a result he won't find what he's searching for, because \" Happiness is only real when shared \" as Chris wrote in his diary. The way in which this film is shot is absolutely wonderful, the cinematography represents the story magnificent. In some cases they broke the cinematography rules to provide the look for what it needs, to express emotions, circumstances and the right atmosphere as well as the editing.\n\nInto the wild is a long motion picture, clocking nearly 150 minutes. And is oriented on different subjects which makes it interesting but also exciting for what the next chapter will bring. I definitely learned a lot and I admire Chris in his belief, vision and strength. Emile Hirsch acted blameless even as the supporting actors, with a drowned performance by Hal Holbrook and not to mention director Sean Penn.\n\nWritten by Max Houtman"

The deepest connection with nature. The meaning of life. Along the road he'll find out many friends who took care of him and helped to go to the north. Alaska was calling.\n\nThe movie is interlaced with past scenes regarding Alaska trip, and scenes regarding Alaska living life. The interlacing gives rhythm to the movie and make it far behind a boring slowness that had could ruin the great atmosphere of the entire work that reaches an holy calm and sense of freedom.\n\nSince Seneca years (3 BC-65 AC) trip were used helping soul becoming healthy, and now more than then we need to find our selves, where society pushing everyday to control everything, many sensible human being could suffer lack of freedom more than others. I think that everyone have had or will have an experience like that. It is not necessary to go to Alaska, but wherever is good to find our personal light inside us. Our truly self.\n\nI think that the movie meaning is much below the appearance. Emile Hirsch sacrifice his self to make everyone has watched the story understand the limits of meaning research. \"Sharing happiness\" and \"reconciliation\", kinda like the gospel of the lost child. He didn't succeed in turning back to forgive, his path had a cruel and lonely ending...but probably we find ourselves when we forgive, and once we forgive, we can go back and solve our past. Forgiveness is related to Love, and Love is related to life. Just forgive and sharing happiness. That is what I learned from this movie, that I can tell...it made me pouring a drop at the end, an unexpected one by the way...\n\nI advice everyone watching it, better alone,in a calm and lonely place, you must feel into the wild! Hopefully this could be an inspiration for someone else future thoughts!\n\nRoberto, Milan (Italy)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was truly a great movie. It chronicles the life of Chris Mccandless based on the book with the same name.\n\nAs you watch the movie it's as if you follow Chris in his quest to understand the beauty of the world without being part of the world we know. As it goes on parts of his journal that he kept on his travels are read out and analyzed and attached to the meaning of his quest. It's a beautiful perspective on why we live and how to find true untainted happiness simply by being a part of nature and real life, as opposed to the social conditioning we have become used to.\n\nThere are parts that will make you think hard about your own life and how you can make yourself happy. In the end however, Chris is on the verge of starving, and he realizes that \"happiness is only real when shared\". This part nearly brought me to tears. It is an intense moment of self reflection and understanding of one's place in the world. It is in a way a reversal of the initial goal of Chris which is to find happiness away from society, and explains the fact that happiness is in fact created by society.\n\nSean Penn is a great director. This movie had some of the most beautiful cinematography and landscape scenes I've ever seen. At some points you may be awed by the simple beauty of the earth without even having to understand that this was what Chris wanted.\n\nThe acting is magnificent. Emile Hirsch is great, especially towards the end when Chris begins to be paranoid and disillusioned by his hunger. You can feel his joy throughout the movie and understand why he set out on the quest, as well as feel his remorse and pain when he comes to the realization that what he searched for may have been closer than he thought and not in the hills of Alaska or other locations.\n\nOverall, this is a great movie. It is pretty long so you may need to watch it in parts as I did. If you're looking to be inspired and get an additional perspective on the world as well as see some beautiful shots of landscapes, it is definitely worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's difficult and limiting to review such an emotionally engaging movie: it's a movie that can only be lived and lived again, the viewer just has to let it penetrate into his soul, mind and body. It's a movie that empties you in order to let you be reborn to a new life, at least to a new perception of what life and happiness are, and what has nothing to do with them. The depth and intensity of the experiences lived by Chris, as much extreme as the lands he visits (which provide an ideal and spectacular scenario for them), give evidence of such anxiety of life and truth, which go beyond the mistakes made by the young boy. Chris is, of course, a victim of an age which makes you believe the necessity to pursue the ideal, in an absolute way, never considering the opposite necessity to come to terms with real life, often hostile, misleading, which provides false values of materialistic happiness, but from which escaping is not always the most constructive attitude. However, his escape will prove to be almost therapeutic to him, since only at the very end of his physical, but also spiritual, and very painful, journey, will the young boy be able to understand the preciousness of true human relations, those which make you long for a human being you can share happiness with, as well as any other human feeling. The emotionally powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder helps to let the movie enter, gently but inexorably, into the very inner core of your soul, stirring such strong emotion inside, that the viewer finds it difficult to translate it into words. The word, however powerful and deep, fails when trying to rationalize the strong emotional engagement: you just have to allow yourself to be overcome by it and leave words aside, as too limited and limiting. It's one of those movies which really gets under your skin and cannot but alter your vision of life, forever. A pure and rare pearl within the cinematography of this century, and, I would say, of all times."

Also,Emile Hirsch did an amazing acting job.\n\nAny actor who gives so much of himself or herself as Sean Penn does, can be exciting to experience when he /she brings to a movie in the direction.I was very pleased to see the movie at the Landmark Sunshine Theater in NYC.\n\nTruth is that freedom is so personal and at the same time is in context with the community or nature where that person lives..Truth is often between the lines.\n\nWe live in a world which is said to be \"civilized\" and yet alienating . Many reasons seem to be the cause of this...thank goodness for films like these to help balance out things..\n\nIntimacy is also very connected to the notion of freedom. Learning to be intimate with one's emotions,body , spirit,etc....are a prerequisite to being able to be intimate with others...\n\nOthers or the environment are sometimes the catalyst that a person needs towards freedom and intimacy . Freedom or at least the notion of feeling free is the fuel to ultimate intimacy. A delicate balance is somewhat challenging but highly rewarding.\n\nThis movie reminded me of my life experiences ,when I was totally alone in nature, by choice, and what was revealed to me by circumstance... life is truly an amazing gift and the greatest gift is in sharing.\n\nThank you Sean Penn and wish you a continued success in your sharing.\n\nClaude Laniado actor/producer/psychiatrist"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a 1...at best. I will never, not ever, get the time back that I wasted watching this dreadful film. I am completely perplexed as to how this movie scored an 8?! I can only assume that no one else saw the film that I saw. Coming from Sean Penn, I should have known it would be filled with left-wing, anti-government bulls#!t. To be frank, the film is nothing more than the bastard love-child of Dead Poets Society and Grizzly Adams...except suckier.\n\nChristoper McCandless was not only a misguided, self-absorbed, self-indulgent youth, he IS the ultimate idiot. There isn't a single quality to admire about him, with the exception of his generous donation to charity. An action, I would suspect this misanthrope made with the sole purpose of pi$$ing his parents off. Simply put, this film is the \"whoa as me\" tale of a rich, spoiled, young man who was TOO determined to prove that the apple sometimes does fall far from the tree. He is completely undeserving of the accolades or screen time he managed to eek out of Hollywood.\n\nHis \"quest\" for the ultimate human experience cost him his life...and to gain what? I mean, seriously, what it the point of this movie?? It really only leaves questions, for which there are no answers. Most notably, how can anyone...especially someone as educated as he was...thrust himself into the Alaskan wilderness (one of the most remote places on the planet) without doing a little research?? Congratulations Emory, you taught the boy well!!\n\nSeriously, all of you who gave this movie higher than a 3, would you really put yourself in the position that he put himself? Would you not have spent some time in Alaska, maybe worked a job to acclimate yourself to the land? Would you not have gotten a little advice, perhaps taken a guided tour and survival courses? Would you not have learned about weather patterns and considered that after crossing a river before the summer thaw meant that you wouldn't be able to cross it when the snow began to melt??\n\nNo, this yahoo simply asks someone to drive him to the end of the road and drop him off on a trail. Smart buddy! The countdown on your life just began. In truth, Chris McCandless committed suicide and Hollywood pathetically glorified it.\n\nYeah, yeah, I realize he had \"books\" to help him out. Yet, we find out in the end what good they did him. I guess Tolstoy doesn't offer much in the way of how to preserve a moose. Any rational person would have realized they were in trouble months before this guy. \"Hmm...I keep taking notches up on my belt. I am eating every day...nothing but lean protein..but still, I am eating. Yet, I have managed to lose 60 pounds. Gosh, I wonder if something is wrong??\"\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this film is that it does manage to remind us that Mother Nature will always be there to strike you down when you begin to get a little too righteous for her taste. Or, in this case, she will leave you to die, alone, in the shell of an old school bus, surrounded by the philosophical b.s. that put you there in the first place, wasted away in a pool of your own feces."

The way McCandless viewed life and the world was amazingly done by Sean Penn. Emile Hirsch has grown in every role he has encountered and should be hitting that $10 million a flick pricetag if he continues to put out movies like this. I hope this is not the peak of his career though this will be VERY hard to top, and he has jumped into my top spot of favorite actors. The cinematography matched that of National Geographic. If you see one movie this year this is it. Might need to see it again."

I really felt like I got to know and understand his character- such a sweet and likable kid. Emile and the rest of the cast did a great job.

Part of that may well have to do with my expectations set by the gushing praise I've heard before, and the one review I read here before watching -- in which a girl said it was so moving she cried.\n\nI didn't think there was anything moving about this film. An interesting narrative, to be sure, and containing some very compelling scenes, but it hardly seemed like anything original, and some of the scenes were totally hackneyed. Man ascends mountain and reaches up to the firmament, camera pans around at majestic landscape, & so on.\n\nThere just seemed to be far too many clich\u00e9s in this film for it be called moving. The sister's voice over narration, full of tired praise for her brother's intelligence, adventurous & rebellious spirit, &c, became tedious. His parents were caricatures of the suburban American nuclear family. The 'nature good, cities bad' message was more than a little heavy-handed, particularly in the Los Angeles scenes.\n\nI found it annoying that in several instances the lead actor looked directly into the camera (for instance, when he is eating an apple early in his travels). For me it shattered the attempt at realism and the sense of isolation and freedom the character was meant to have.\n\nOverall, while not without a fluid plot, solid acting and shots of stunning landscapes, the message of the film itself wasn't anything new, nor was it particularly well put. It was ho-hum at best."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had read the book before seeing the movie and they are very different experiences. In the book you project so much into McCandless world, whereas in the film you are handed down more about what Penn understood from the book. This makes it more difficult to absorb because in some moments you gain a sense of empathy and identity and then it moves into another direction. It is difficult to understand if McCandless is a loner, adventurer or just internally angry. With this you lose a lot of what takes a film from being good to being great.\n\nEssentially it is one man's odyssey and personal journey. The narrative of the film drives a certain set of understanding about the character that could have been better addressed if the cast was more stripped down. Too many philosophical points are trying to be made when the only real point is why people choose to take the paths they do. At a level this films tells us what that is but on another level it doesn't add up. There is more to it that we don't get to see or fully understand I think the subject would have been better handled with a different director but Penn made it his baby. By doing that he allowed his own ego to tarnish a film that should have been about the complete absence of ego. Penn clearly would have loved the lead role if he had been 25 years younger so projects it onto Hirsch, who in some cuts looks scarily like a younger Penn - so as an actor Hirsch tries to live up to something he is not. Like a dad cheering a son at football whilst all the time berating him for not doing it how he would.\n\nThe supporting class don't have any depth to them because Penn ( and this is a good thing) over estimates the intelligence of his audience to fill in the gaps.\n\nIt is certainly an accomplished film with a difficult subject and kudos for the attempt but I don't believe Penn is of the caliber of Director to pull this kind of subject off - yet."

Let me make a few notes here: If the parents were such horrible selfish bastards, they could have just gone on with their lives.\n\nThe character, McCandless, has that \"forced smile\" that I see on everyone that is pretending to be happy in spite of the facts. I see the same look on the faces of Jesus worshippers, that they are DETERMINED to show themselves as happy. I am not talking about optimism, I mean a person that lives on a diet of spiritual poison (idealistic altruism) and smiles to convince themselves its OK.\n\nObjectivists scorn the idea of sacrifice. The term must be properly defined. A sacrifice is choosing something of lesser value over something of greater value. With this clear definition, sacrifice is an immoral act. When he gives the old man his quarter rather than call his sister, that is clearly a sacrifice, and clearly immoral.\n\nNature may on occasion be beautiful, but it is ruthless. When McCandless is gazing into the sky, he is not seeing the face of god, he is seeing the dispassionate sun and clouds, which will watch him live or die with equanimity. The lesson? Don't count on the sky, except to recognize it is only your mind which is beautiful, with its ability to reason. Your mind is more beautiful and complex than water vapor, or even the sun.\n\nSean Penn is certainly the guy to create this evil little movie. Surrounded by material things himself, he idealizes the anti-material lifestyle (though not enough to give up his own investment portfolio). He asks \"why can't we just love one another?\" and then forces Obama on us, so that we can made to sacrifice to the irresponsible at the point of a gun.\n\nFor more information, please read 2 short books - The Virtue of Selfishness, and Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal, both by Ayn Rand.\n\nAltruism rots the soul. Socialism kills."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having read many excellent negative reviews of this movie, I figured I should try to come up with a positive one. While I hated the movie myself, I can honestly highly recommend \"Into the Wild\" to certain people under certain conditions.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" would make an excellent teaching tool for film professors to show their students what not to do when making a film. It turns out to be a pretty comprehensive survey. The egregious overuse of alternative camera techniques is a good cautionary tale. Folks who want to see some nostalgic camera angles that haven't been used since the original \"Batman\" series might be particularly pleased. Also, since there is at least 60 minutes of unnecessary footage left in the film by the editors, you could use this as an opportunity to have students edit the movie themselves.\n\nThere are endless opportunities for party games you could invent around this movie. Have your party guests take a drink every time there's a cheesy camera shot or redundant voice-over or caption. You can also play \"mute the film and guess the dialogue.\" Whoever comes closest to the actual dialogue wins, and whoever can't predict what is being said at all gets thrown out of the party.\n\nOther reviewers have already mentioned the movie's potential as a sleep aid. I don't know if I would go that far, but I think \"Into the Wild\" would make a great background to working out. There is something about watching a movie make the same point over and over for over 2 hours, to bad music, that reminds me of the rigors of exercise. Repetition, pain, fatigue, and ultimately relief that it's over."

        "review_title": "Sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving",
        "review_detailed_main": "Chris McCandless, a young man of twenty four took his last breath in this world in August 1992 - alone. Found starved to death in an abandoned bus in Denali Park, near Fairbanks, Alaska, he had left his affluent home in the Southern U.S. after graduating from Emery College, tuned in to the call of the wild, turned on to the spirit of Jack Kerouac and Henry Thoreau, and dropped out of a society he rejected for its commercialism and greed. Directed by Sean Penn and based on Jon Krakauer's book about Chris' life, Into the Wild is a celebration of youth with its idealism, desire for adventure, and also its arrogance and short-sightedness. Penn, who seems deeply connected to his subject, consulted with Chris' parents after waiting ten years for their approval to undertake this project. The reuslt is a sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving film but, like its main protagonist, full of contradictions.\n\nThe debate over whether Chris was a highly evolved truth seeker or a vengeful and self destructive personality is not answered either in the book or the film. Ever looking for the real McCandless, Penn fills in the gaps with a semi-idealized version but since the only knowledge we have of the real person is from Chris' journals, letters, novels and poems, and the thoughts of his sister Carine (Jena Malone) narrated in voice-over, who he was remains maddeningly elusive. In spite of Chris' ultimate discovery about the true nature of happiness, Into the Wild is not a message film but a voyage of discovery in which a headstrong young man gradually acquires the wisdom to reach out to others, even to his parents in a fevered dream. More than a story about a return to nature, or a white middle class youth's protest against his parent's values, it is a search for authenticity in a world that has forgotten what truth looks and feels like.\n\nChris is engagingly played by Emile Hirsch who had to ride the rapids of the Colorado River and lose 45 pounds in the process of making the film. He brings a quality of instant likability to his role, though at times he skirts around the edges of the character without fully inhabiting him. The film is divided into four chapters that signal Chris's growing maturity. It begins in Alaska, then flashes back to the two-year journey that brought him to this point. Along the way, he gives away his $24,000 inheritance to charity, burns all of his money, abandons his car, changes his name, and hitchhikes across the country and up to Alaska, never once communicating with his distraught family.\n\nIt was part of Chris' contradiction that he rejected human relationships, yet was able to give of himself to those he met along the way. He makes a friend of Wayne (Vince Vaughn) his boss as a farm worker in South Dakota, an 81-year old retired veteran (Hal Holbrook) who offers to adopt him, a 16 year-old singer-songwriter (Kristen Stewart), and a pair of aging free spirits Rainey and Jana (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker). These contacts appear to be genuine but McCandless keeps his distance. When Jana tells Chris about her own son who ran away and hasn't been heard from in two years, he seems curiously unmoved and is silent when Jana tells him how children are often cruel to their parents.\n\nBacked by original songs by Eddie Vedder that never seem discordant, Into the Wild is a beautiful film that should be remembered at Oscar time, if only for Hal Holbrook's masterful supporting performance. Though it occasionally lapses into clich\u00e9s such as Chris telling Tracy that \"If you want something in life, reach out and grab it\" and melodramatic scenes where the sun emerges from the clouds just at the right moment, the film has a grasp of the grit of life and ultimately becomes transcendent. While we may rightly view Chris' short life as a tragedy, but as Albert Einstein says, \"the real tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives\".\n\nWhatever else could be said about Chris, and as a parent I am appalled by his cruelty in refusing to contact his mother and father or even his sister for a period of two years, to him life was a game that was only worth playing 100%. Those who refuse to take risks in life may stand in judgment of McCandless and call him stupid, yet some have forgotten what it is like to be young and some never knew. He made mistakes, serious errors of judgment, yet in the end I am reminded of what George Bernard Shaw says, \"I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no \"brief candle\" for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.\" Chris McCandless life was a candle that burned brightly on both ends, then flickered and died but what he has passed on to us is a splendid torch."

Your decisions, what you strive for. And Chris does it. He lives for adventure. Not cautions, not society, not materials. For adventure. If you have the chance, see this movie in theaters.

I read the books about the same true story. I became even more fascinated. I finally saw the film again, and enjoyed it even more the 2nd viewing and FIRMLY place it in my top 5 films in history (yeah I'm typically a mainstream guy ... Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings are also in the top 5, but this one even shines above those in many ways).\n\nThe acting, directing, and adaptation of a true story are wonderful. The real settings (not some studio back-lot) are apparent. You are really brought along for the journey. There is something primal in all of us, and this movie points that out better than any other movie out there. While I can't say I will ever have a journey like the one in the movie, I can say that it is something of a fantasy to shed the shackles of \"normal\" lives and just go out into the world and really live. Chris McCandless really lived, and to some degree he will always be a hero and inspiration to me thanks to Sean Penn's amazing film."

        "review_detailed_main": "As with Terrence Malick's 2005 film 'The New World' parts of Into the Wild come across like a poem on the screen, snowy landscapes, wild animals, flowing streams and breathtaking skies. I'm also a sucker for a voice-over and slow motion if used properly and here director Sean Penn does both to great effect which just adds to the poetic nature of the overall piece. Emile Hirsch should get an Oscar nomination for his role as Christopher McCandless the college graduate who gives away everything he has, college funds to Oxfam, cuts up his I.D. cards, burns his leftover dollars and embarks on the journey that will take him across America and eventually land him in Alaska. After graduating Christopher decides he want to leave society, find the true human spirit, and leave behind his privileged but stifling lifestyle and especially his overbearing and bickering parents. So without telling anyone he sets off destined to find himself. Told in chapters the film follows Christopher from the start where he re-names himself Alexander Supertramp to the final days in Alaska where he lives in the magic bus. Along the way he meets various characters that in some way help to shape him as he travels and as he grows from boy to man. As well as the stunning cinematography, great acting and fascinating story there is the soundtrack which is at times incredibly powerful, with original material from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder it hard to imagine some of the scenes without it as it is so integral to the plot. Cursed by intelligence and maybe slight madness Alex is documenting his time and when he's not writing he's reading Tolstoy and Kafka amongst others and it's not just his mind he needs to expand as he learns the skills he needs to fend for himself, collecting berries and hunting animals he soon discovers it's not as easy as it seems. But a firm sense of determination pushes him forward and sees him adapt to almost anything. The structure of the film is fragmented and jumps to different time periods which is what keeps you guessing right up until the parting shot which to me was unexpected and left me a little stunned. At two and half hours it is quite a long film but it never feels it and the best way to enjoy it is to let yourself go and immerse yourself fully in the experience. Into the Wild should stay with you long after you've seen it, who hasn't dreamt at some point of disappearing and living free from the shackles of modern life? It is both a memorable and moving film that should become an American classic."

Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.\n\nThe casting deserves mention. Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, needs to be in fewer films, and it defies logic that she somehow beat others at audition.\n\nVince Vaughn, Zach Galifianakis and a handful of others bring some star power to this (with all due respect to Emile Hirsch, he is not a household name). Their roles are small but effective. Great job. The Eddie Vedder soundtrack -- do we need two hours of Vedder? No. But we get it just the same.\n\nAlthough the film gets better as it goes (deeper \"in to the wild\"), its popularity and high praise are something of a mystery. If anything, it seems to have grown in stature since its first release. Why? While interesting, it never really gets to the meat of its subject. Why rejecting society and civilization was the right decision. Assuming, of course, it was... which is debatable."

        "review_title": "Even better than the book?",
        "review_detailed_main": "When film adaptations stray from their source material, even slightly, it usually irks me. That was not the case with Into the Wild, however. The film takes certain liberties with the facts and characters reported on by Jon Krakauer in the book of the same name, but the result seems to align so perfectly with the spirit of the book, and Emile Hirsch embodies Chris McCandless so vividly, that I find myself asking whether the film may even be better than the piece of nonfiction that inspired it. As deeply reported as Krakauer's book is, the film brings McCandless and his journey to life in a way that the printed word could not.\n\nThe acting, and not just by Hirsch, is excellent. People who encountered McCandless during his travels and were later interviewed by Krakauer are fleshed out with verve by the ensemble cast. We know from the book that McCandless and Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn), who hires him to be a part of a combine harvester crew, got along well, but their complicity comes alive in a bar scene that is both funny and utterly believable.\n\nThe film also looks gorgeous, as might be expected of a depiction of life on the road in the American West, and the soundtrack fits perfectly, mixing songs by Eddie Vedder that sound as if they could have been written by McCandless himself and classic Americana that never feels forced or kitschy.\n\nI must admit that I found it impossible to maintain critical distance from Into the Wild while watching it. I suspect that how one experiences this movie will depend on the degree to which one sympathizes with McCandless and his rejection of modern society (more than thirty years ago!). If you do not, then you may find yourself in the sizable camp of those who find McCandless to have been irrational, selfish, and immature, and Krakauer and director Sean Penn to be irresponsible for glorifying his misguided quest. If, however, you identify with McCandless and the way he felt, then he becomes a sort of patron saint of self-determination, a heroic example of someone who had the courage to go beyond the usual complaining and attempt to live out their ideals, in spite of the risks of doing so. I confess that I belong to the second group, and that the film moved me, remaining in my thoughts for days after I watched it and giving the vague feeling that a better life might be possible, if only one had the courage to seek it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild is a true story of Christopher Johnson McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp aka Chris, who, after his graduation, went on to live into the icy jungle of Alaska (inspired by Thoreau's Walden), leaving everything behind, including his family and all his money.\n\nDirector Sean Penn doesn't just show Chris' life in Alaska but his college life and the core reason of why he had this way figured out in chapter wise storytelling which adds interest and structure to the movie. Being a nature oriented cinematography, the visuals of trees, mountains, rivers, free birds are obvious but these images make powerful impact in the movie, especially when Chris looks at the mountains.\n\nCasting is good. Emily Hirsch is perfect for the role, young, full of attitude and firm on his opinion. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone played a good role as Chris' family. Kristen Stewart was beauty and sparkling as a young girl and even for a short duration, she added happiness in the movie. But, what took the movie to a greater level is the performance of Hal Holbrook as Ron. He just nailed it. A retired military old man, rich in experience and philosophy who connects easily with Chris and becomes a family bond.\n\nMovie is in good pace and tells us clearly how Chris' parents fought over the years, forcing Chris to live secluded. His love for books by Leo Tolstoy and Thoreau shaped his radical ideas and love for the nature and rebellious thinking.\n\nScenes of Chris diving into the river, adventurously sailing with his kayak into the flood river, walking into the Alaskan beauty mountains, running behind horses in open field and hitting the road symbolizing the ultimate freedom are shown beautifully, making you want to live like this.\n\nWhat makes Into the Wild a magical experience is the Eddie Vedder's music. Songs are just class. Perfectly in harmony with the scenario of natural living and happiness, these songs take you close to Chris' living. 'Such is the way of the world', 'No ceiling' are real pleasant to hear and 'Society' is as painful as the reality of life. The movie is easily a memorable experience and in my favorite list of movies. The quotes of Chris about career, life, nature are deep and it questions are lifestyle. If you are wise, you will understand somewhere we are wrong and lost as a civilization. Hats off to Chris!"

Each person can watch this movie and have a different take on it's subject.

At first, I thought it was a stereotypical movie about a young boy who travelled around the USA to escape his reality but learned a lot during his trip and then went back to his home. However, it was not such a story and deeper than I expected. It provoked me into thinking about materialism.\n\nChristopher McCandless takes a journey to survive in the wilderness by himself. Along the way, he encounters many kinds of people who shape his life. In Alaska, his final destination, he learns a lesson about happiness and comes to a tragic end.\n\nAs I said, the movie lets me think about Materialism. In our society, we can't live without things like money and everyday convenience like smart phones. I think we feel emotionally satisfied if we have them. McCandless throws away all his belongings including family, smartphones and money. However, he realizes he can't live alone and discovers the importance of things during his odyssey. Moreover, his tragic end emphasises his opinion about happiness. He learns and tells us that we have to endure our society even if we have complaints about that society and we should take care of our family without selfishness. I highly recommend the movie as a good opportunity to rethink our behaviours and thoughts."

On his way to Alaska, Alex meets several people, who gradually help him to shape his opinion about life & it's purpose, and what it truly means to be happy. Although unfortunately the protagonist doesn't makes it back to his loved ones from his \"Great Alaskan Adventure\", but the circumstances he faced & the decisions he took, is a great precedent of a man searching for his freedom to live and breath, away from this hectic & materialistic world."

He probably could've accomplished a lot of good in his life. He died way too young. Even though apparently his family life was not the best. I'm sure they were all traumatized by what happened. Longer than I expected, but worth a watch."

The acting is fantastic, utterly superb. The actors are incredible and perfectly cast. Catherine Keener as an aging hippie vagabond, Vince Vaughn as a wacky farmer growing wheat, William Hurt as Chris' potbellied suburbanite dad, Marcia Gay Harden as the type of mom who breeds children who wants to run off to the wilderness to escape from her. Hal Holbrook's contribution is profound. What an artisan. Emile Hirsch plays Chris, WOW - he does a great job of the character. Even when an real photo of the actual Chris McCandless comes on screen, we can see that Hirsch resembles him. Original songs by Eddie Vedder give this extraordinary movie the right feel as well.\n\nThis has catapulted into my top 5 movies of all time. Should be yours too."

This movie tells the story of a young man who after graduating in university with very high marks decides to abandon home, family and everything and go to live into the wild in Alaska like if it was his promised land. He is pushed into that not only but what they call the lies of modern civilized life and social hypocrisy but also because, thinking like that, he is particularly hurt by his parents lies about their past private lives. While the movie progresses we hear his sister's voice off stressing the most important moments and aspects of his life. In my opinion the message the movie wants to pass is that there is a mistake to show revolt against society by running away to live with Nature and alone. In his course to Alaska our hero (who walks and hitch-hikes all the time) stops sometimes here and there to get occasional works that can give him a little money to enable him to support himself on his course. In those moments he creates bonds of friendship and love with lots of people but always rejects any possibilities of staying with them in his stubborn march to Alaska where he wants to spend at least a great part of his life in contact only with Mother Nature. He leaves lots of people who have become very fond of him, very unhappy with his absence. Mother nature is not always paradisiacal and may also be very cruel sometimes and even violent. And for instance the wild food it provides can be poisonous. Adding to the movie's credit are the beautiful landscape images and the splendid background music and songs of the country type."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) \"Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,\" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.\n\nI loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: \"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...\"\n\nOne of the best for sure."

There are two ways to look at this. Maybe this film can be enjoyed alone and not with others OR as is the case with most movies you have to identify with the lead character.\n\nMuch has been said about how the book has been hollywoodized or how Chris was not a doomed romantic hero but a stupid cretin with a death wish. But that isn't what the movie is all about.\n\nInto the wild is about many things. It is about natures importance in our lives. It is about peace and love and human relationships. It is about solitude. But mostly it is a coming of age story.\n\nEmile Hirsch stars in this movie as Christopher Mcandless a 24 year old college graduate who ventures into the mountains of Alaska to escape from it all. His parent's treachery and the lies that surround him. Hirsch does a beautiful job of playing Chris. He completely inhabits the role and brings out a staggering performance. Since Sean Penn himself is such a great actor maybe it was easy to bring out a performance of this magnitude in another. The film is aided by a perfect supporting cast. Every single person in this movie has done a good job. Right from Vince Vaughn to Jena Malone who plays Chris' sister and she also narrates the movie.\n\nCredit must be given to Sean Penn. You can see that in the movie there is a perfect amalgamation of the filmmakers thoughts , feelings and vision with the subject matter and that gives us a truly wondrous film."

The plot revolves around a young man Christopher McCandless, a recent top graduate from Emory University. Instead of pursuing a prestigious career being forced upon him by his overbearing parents, he chooses a different path. Christopher donates his entire life savings to charity, rids himself of all possessions and hits the road on a journey of self discovery with the ultimate goal of reaching the Alaskan wilderness. Along his journey he encounters several characters who give him insight and sage. The plot is thought provoking, captivating, selfish, psychological, insightful, heartwrenching, sublime and so much more.

This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.\n\nAll the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.\n\nFor a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher McCandless, in a manner of existential terms, had it all really. He graduated from college, had $24 grand in tuition, and a possible future law career. He could do anything he wanted with his life. So, he followed his passions, mixed perhaps with some escapist connotation involving a wounded family history, and left on a solo trek across the 'wild' of America, eventually on a quest to Alaska. At that point, he used what little knowledge he had to live off the land, hunt for game, and be one with nature while camping out of an abandoned 'Magic Bus' vehicle. It's here that we see the story, told in a somewhat typical non-linear form, take shape around the intellectual scope of a quintessential Thoreau wannabe.\n\nIn Into the Wild, Sean Penn's treatment of this man- who, eventually, died of poison-cum-starvation- this is a quest that is made interesting by the people that Christopher (sorry, Alexander Supertramp) meets along the way, which include some hippies in a van (an earthy Catherine Keener one of them), a very young Joan Mitchell type (Kristin Stewart), and blue collar worker (Vince Vaughn), and the proverbial 'wise old man' (Hal Holbrook, easily my favorite of the lot). They help bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a guy, somewhat but not quite disillusioned by a particular American society, walking around in a state of being that calls one back to the discussion between Jules and Vincent over 'walking the Earth' in Pulp Fiction.\n\nIs he just a 'bum', or is a true risk-taker? Or is it just all, as Christopher at one point admits, for a possible future book to come out of this? These questions arise, and some others, as Penn tries to question himself what kind of audience is coming to see his film. Will they easily pass judgment on a kid in over his head and not prepared for full-blown saga out of Jack London, or as someone who sadly lost the good fight against all reasonable responsibilities as a common, law-abiding citizen? Luckily, Penn did cast just right for us to want to be with this character, as Emile Hirsch has the qualities of strength and vulnerability so that he doesn't make him unsympathetic (which, for this sort of character, could be easy to do), but keeps him grounded and strong and, simply, just right for the part in this context.\n\nThe only problems come with Penn, as a director, taking flights of pretentious fancy with his style. Part of the problem with taking on a tale of going out to nature is there's the tendency for the visuals to outweigh some of the narrative strengths. It's reminiscent more of his work on the Crossing Guard (though not as much), and there are some passages and montages and those chapter breaks and yellow words streaming across the screen that do mark it as original but not necessarily driving much with the story. If it's poetry he was looking for, it's not achieved with the utmost beauty or grace, despite the marvelous moments that he and his director of photography grasp the many landscapes. And, as the greatest asset, Eddie Vedder on the soundtrack- who's songs might even be better than the movie itself- compliment the nature of the character but also sounding fine as stand-alone songs or guitar numbers.\n\nSo, take a trip into this moral conflict that strikes up Into the Wild as a worthwhile effort, if not a masterful one, and see what it's like to be young and escaping and living life to the fullest, if not the smartest."

        "review_title": "Into the Wild gives you a different look on life through Chris McCandless, Sean Penn created a masterpiece and its his passion which makes it just that",
        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild was a film that left a mark on myself, both cinematically and on life. I watched it back in 2015-2016 and it was like nothing I had seen before, the realism of it. I took an instant liking to it and still remember specific scenes inside my head. It's based upon the 1996 non-fiction book of the same name written by Jon Krakauer and tells the story of Christopher McCandless (\"Alexander Supertramp\"). The film was written, co-produced, and directed by Sean Penn. He gives us a spectacular experience, both in entertainment and for fans of cinema. There's so many things the film does right, cinematography is one of them and \u00c9ric Gautier made a special and beautiful looking film. Another highlight is the musical score done by Eddie Vedder, along with Michael Brook and Kaki King. Into the Wild was nominated for two Golden Globes and won the award for Best Original Song: \"Guaranteed\" by Eddie Vedder. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Hal Holbrook.\n\nAfter graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.\n\nSean Penn begins Into the Wild with Chris McCandless' mother waking up from an nightmare and afterwards we get to see a montage with our main character traveling across the States to his destination where he's going to live and survive in the wilderness, there's two reasons why this sequence makes us immersed and it's because of the writing and text we get to see from his journals but also the visuals with for example the landmarks and signs which makes us get some bearings where he is. It's an efficient way of starting the film, both storytelling and to engage the viewer. When the montage stops and the car ride is over, Jim Gallien remains in the car and we get a wide shot of the car to the left and Chris McCandless beside it, the camera angle switches from wide to normal as McCandless steps closer to Gallien. We then get to follow our protagonist and see the nature which the wilderness has to offer whilst Gallien drives back to civilization. That's the beginning of the film and already, Sean Penn knows exactly what he's doing, with a brilliant and intelligent screenplay, and terrific direction and visual storytelling from him. Through flashbacks we get to see more of who Chris McCandless was and his reasoning to do the trip two years later, which shows him burning money and leaving his car behind after a flood in Arizona and thus began hiking. Here, he shows signs of his belief in transcendentalism. As you quickly come to notice, it's not Chris McCandless who's narrating the film but in another way he does through his journal, I'm of course thinking of Carine McCandless who's narrating it. Jena Malone's performance is quite good, giving heart to the role through the narration and dramatic performance. It's quite possible this is how much of the information was gathered, through Chris McCandless' sister and parents. Another scene which has some great direction and filmmaking is when McCandless is inside a city during the end of chapter 2, you see his frustration and nervous behavior through the editing and performance, how he just wants to get out of there. That sequence shows the theme of man vs society in its entirety, how everything he had done up to that point was just right for him, which he later on fully embraced in Alaska.\n\nThe film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless, Marcia Gay Harden as his mother, William Hurt as his father, Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Brian H. Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook. Although Hal Holbrook doesn't have a big role in the film, his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is well deserved and his scenes with Emile Hirsch are excellent, truly terrific. His character is possibly entirely fictional but so well written and realistic, a performance and character you can appreciate. During my first viewing I absolutely loved Emile Hirsch's performance as Chris McCandless, it haven't changed I just have come to respect it even more, most of the time he's acting beside himself and he's great in both those scenes and the ones he's acting alongside others. He captures the soul of Chris McCandless perfectly.\n\nWhat film can you compare Into the Wild with? I would say Wild (2014) which stars Reese Witherspoon, it's quite a similar movie/story but the big difference is how Cheryl Strayed survived and Chris McCandless met an unfortunate demise. At first viewing, I didn't expect the film to delve so much into McCandless' background which is very similar to Wild (2014). Now on my second viewing, I'm much more grateful for the flashback chapters. If they would have solely shown us what's happening in Alaska, the film wouldn't be as 'true' because of how little is known about Chris' time there and from his other travels, yet it's what we know of him. Lots of things are probably fictional but that's alright, it's part of the experience, the events might be fictional but Chris McCandless isn't. Everything he does in the film, I'm certain he would do in real life. The \"Magic\" bus became an iconic location, a landmark because of the book and film, having been removed from its location and moved to a museum. One thing I absolutely love about the film is how it's shot on location, for example the Alaska scenes was filmed 50 miles (80 km) south of where McCandless actually died, in the tiny town of Cantwell. It just makes such a difference for us viewers and the actors when the film is shot on location like that. Into the Wild is a cinematic masterpiece, a film I've wanted to rewatch for many years and it was finally the right time. The film remains entertaining and interesting, making you rethink life. The ending remains heartbreaking. Sean Penn created a masterpiece with Into the Wild, its cinema. I'll leave my final words for. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film four stars out of four and described it as \"spellbinding\". Ebert wrote that Emile Hirsch gives a \"hypnotic performance\", commenting: \"It is great acting, and more than acting.\" Ebert added, \"The movie is so good partly because it means so much, I think, to its writer-director, Sean Penn.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Sean Penn's film about Christopher McCandless who shed his college and suburban life for a fatal nomadic journey is a really disturbing and absorbing film. It is extraordinarily well made and acted by Emile Hirsch. However what struck and disturbed me more than anything was how cruel and self absorbed and selfish our hero behaved. He caused pain beyond belief to his well meaning parents and sister, he burned his money instead of giving it to a poor family who needed it, he squatted in self absorbed diary bliss, he rejected all advances of friendship that did not benefit his mood at the time, ... in fact a good moment to demonstrate how unconscious he was of anyone else's feelings is late in the film when he cajoles an old man to climb up and across a really rocky and difficult mountain blissfully unaware that the hike is physically beyond the old man. He simply has no clue to another person's feelings. So our hero does really silly and dangerous things in his Kerouac style adventure down rapids and on freight trains and hitching lifts and staying as he chooses... and causing heartbreaking grief for his family. I was appalled to find this was a true story and it is to Penn's skill as a film maker that the astonishing selfishness of McCandless' self absorbed pilgrimage is spelled out as clearly as it is. Our hero might have had some teen issues with his family, but the rejection and ignorance of their feelings is utterly vile. Only a rich white teenager could behave in such a rotten way believing in this self righteous bubble that his selfish quest is some misguided noble back-to-basics adventure. In a film of many great scenes the standout was his tortured despairing father collapsing on the road in the suburb where they still lived. The hurt this boy caused! the terrible agony of not knowing where he was, and this brat thought all that was OK because HE was on a selfish quest. Penn's film is a great one and an expose of the sort of ruthless inconsiderate cruelty one generation worries about for the younger."

This is so well written, and acted that it deserves more than it really gets. Hal Holbrook puts in what is probably his best ever roles, and only Hal could have done this so well.\n\nBefore really deciding to pan this film, read the book. Take a careful look at what Chris/Alex is really doing here. As I've said this is one more about a rebirth, and not so much escape, after realizing what his father really is. As his sister says, they were out of wedlock children, and the father only made that worse, day in and day out. The ending I would have liked to see is Chris/Alex finally squaring with his guilt and returning to the character Hal Holbrook played so well. If Chris had some survival training, he might have just pulled it off. Do give this film another look see before giving it your final grade."

It also brought back recollections of mistakes that were made during that era as well by us who dropped out and tuned in. Being a tramp is not a great adventure. Ask any of the thousands of families who lost loved ones during the Great Depression (see Grapes of Wrath). Usually, being a tramp is a gradual decline into oblivion. Nature is not free. There is a price to be paid for everything in life. Burning money is not symbolic; it is just plain stupid. There are millions on the earth who would love to have that money so they could eat a good meal. This young man's life was tragic, but there was a lesson to be learned from it. People born of parents who are not privileged would never attempt anything like this. But his final words were too late to save him; happiness is only worthwhile if it is shared."

So I will give you my interpretation of the story.\n\nThis movie is a modern version of the classic theme about the philosophical journey of a young man. The goal of the journey is to find total freedom, and along the way everything else must be sacrificed including relationships and material wealth.\n\nIn the end, alone on his death bed, the man realizes that while he has almost reached total freedom he has lost too much along the way and that as a human being you are dependent on other individuals, not only for survival, but ultimately also for happiness. To achieve happiness, you have to sacrifice some of your own freedom and goals. I, and I think many others as well, can certainly relate to the struggle to achieve this balance in life, and that's what makes the movie so beautiful and effective.\n\nBesides having a thought-provoking story, it's a beautifully made film with exquisite acting and photography."

Shortly after graduating college, Chris decides to give away his money and go on a road trip without telling anyone. His car gets washed out in the desert and from that point he walks everywhere. He lives off the land and gets a little help from others by hitchhiking. He travels everywhere and gets a job driving a tractor to make a little money for his quest to Alaska. He also meets two hippies a couple of times who help him. He breaks this old guy's heart by leaving since he was his only friend. Chris also takes a journey in a kayak all the way to Mexico. He finally ends up in Alaska and stays the winter in the wilderness. When he tries to leave, the river has flooded and he is stuck. Chris meets his demise in the wild due to eating poisonous plants.\n\nHe wrote down most of his journeys so that is how his family was able to piece together what he did after leaving them. I thought it was sad for his family since he never called them. He may have been angry with his parents but considering what he did, I don't think he's a sympathetic character.\n\nThere was nothing great about the acting. Only the outdoor scenery was about average. Otherwise, not a whole lot happens in the film.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: I guess if you like backpacking and camping, you may find this movie more appealing; however I didn't think it was that great. Not enough of a plot for me."

The tale is not so much depressing as it is encouraging; not so much the tale of a thickheaded pariah but one of a modern day Jesus (McCandless was even asked if he was Jesus on his journey).\n\nWhile some who read Jon Krakauer's bestseller deemed the youth a foolish outcast who needlessly lost his life because of a reckless overdose in idealism, the film paints his journey in a different, more thought-provoking light \u0097 seemingly the core of writer/director/producer Sean Penn's focus in making the film.\n\nPenn seemed to adapt the movie not simply verbatim from the novel, but by cherry picking some of the most appropriate passages of the book to highlight larger considerations of humanity's true place in modern society. It is much less a chronological tale of a young man's journey to Alaska as it is a film that appeals to some of our deepest fears and questions.\n\nThis redefining foray into life's big questions is why Into the Wild is a must-see, a film that not only tells a lot about the human psyche and our suppressed instincts, but puts it all in a context of a complete rejection of the overwhelming nature of modern society."

        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild is a road-trip/biography film based on a true story about an adventurer named Christopher McCandless. After college graduation, he decides to give away all his possessions and hide from society. He adopts the name Alex Supertramp and travels across the United States, making money from small jobs. At the same time, he finds time to experience the beauty of nature. Eventually, he decides to journey into the Alaskan wilderness alone.\n\nEmile Hirsch does a good job acting as Alex. Although I can't say I was entirely impressed his performance, I respect him because of the difficulty of the role. The fact that he was believable was one of the main things that made the film work.\n\nThe plot is somewhat convoluted, alternating between his adventure in Alaska and his previous experiences around continental United States. For much of the film, I did not feel like I was connecting with the events or emotions that Alex was experiencing. The pacing was rather slow as well. There were some things, such as the problems with Alex's parents, that were unclear. Toward the end, it did get better. The final scene was simply beautiful. Despite this, its difficult not to label the film as overlong.\n\nInto the Wild holds high standards in direction and editing. The environmental scenes are a clear contrast to the bland city or slum segments. They are beautifully shot and panned. There are some neat effects, such as slow motion or stylistic blurring, that add a nice touch.\n\nThe film fell short of the expectations that I built up from significant critical praise. Some parts were very well done, but as a whole it was too idle. But I did find value in it, even though I disagreed with several of the main messages. All in all, it was a solid but unspectacular adventure."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not nearly as good as the book, I commend Sean Penn's efforts as it must have been very difficult to adapt this tale of Chris McCandless's fatal Alaskan odyssey. Also worth mentioning is Eddie Vedder's superb acoustically-driven score, his first ever.\n\nAs one might expect from a Penn movie, he casts many notable names, including William Hurt as the stereotypical cold father, Catherine Keener as a nomadic hippie, Vince Vaughn, and a surprisingly energetic Hal Holbrook. Emile Hirsch plays Chris decently enough, showing noticeable dedication (he must have really lost weight towards the end) but still does not stand out as much as the more veteran-like supporting cast.\n\nPenn includes some nice subtle touches, such as actual black and white footage of apartheid and other social and political crises of Africa as Chris's sister names out his final courses and grades from Emory University. At times he goes overboard though, indulging in clich\u00e9s like an overhead shot of Chris swimming naked on his back with his arms stretched out like Jesus on the cross. I found the most powerful scene to be but a close-up photograph of the real Chris McCandless as he sat scruffy-bearded and grinning outside of the vacant bus he made his home, an enlarged and color version of the same photograph from inside the book.\n\nAs I was finishing the book I thought this would make for a fascinating Werner Herzog documentary in the tradition of \"Grizzly Man.\" McCandless falls into that same kind of iconoclastic realm as any one of Herzog's protagonists. Penn gives us the romanticized Hollywood version."

        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild is an alternately enthralling and wrenching portrait of a young man who ran from his problems and searched for peace and found paradise and, in turn, anguish and despair. Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.\n\nFirst and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.\n\nChris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets of on a trek around the country.\n\nChris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.\n\nSo what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.\n\nAlong the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.\n\nThe impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.\n\nHal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance. Even more so when you realize the guy later played Speed Racer and previously had been best known for being Judd Hirsch's kid."

        "review_detailed_main": "A beautifully filmed and well-acted tragic story of a man's struggle into the wilderness to escape from society. Featuring Sean Penn in the directorial seat, this is the true story of Christopher McCandless who took the name Alexander Supertramp as he hitchhiked across the country to Alaska in the early nineties. The film is over two hours long and a bit lengthy to watch when stuck in the middle but rewardingly good when finished. It is like The Motorcycle Diaries in a sense only without the political stance and the motorcycle and company. Emile Hirsch is a stunning discovery in this brilliant career move. Although opinions on the main character's views vary especially considering the conclusion to his journey, the important thing about this film is that it makes you think about your own humanity and precepts and whether or not life has become more than a game of survival for you. This film takes an aura quite like most road movies but it is one of a kind and certainly one of those films you'll never forget.\n\nhttp://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rarely upon viewing motion pictures based on trues stories/books, etc. do I come into the process with high anticipation. More often than not I've found myself leaving the cinema morose and let down by yet another Hollywood director who has chosen to glamorize the story for his own ego ignoring the facts and the truth that needs no help on its own. This film, however, is different. Seasoned, veteran actors, such as John Hurt and Hal Holbrook, who might not normally lend their talents to a movie released on a smaller scale such as this, remarkably excel in their roles. Marcia Gay Harden relishes her role as McCandless's mother and it shows. The numerous backdrops where Chris \"resided\" on his journey are breathtaking, and the screenplay by the great Sean Penn left me with a lump in my throat more than a few times throughout the film. You owe it to yourself to see this picture. Moreover, read the book first for the exact insight into Chris's adventure, by Jon Krakauer, and then see the movie. I dare you to leave without swallowing a few lumps."

However, I could feel with the main character, but not really identify with him. But maybe this is exactly the thing that makes this movie interesting. Chris McCandless reflects the part of ourselves that would be ready to follow his path, while our common sense is pretty happy to be situated in front of a screen.\n\nFinally, Into The Wild is a movie that you remember. Maybe not when you're on business lunch or on a shopping trip. But certainly there are this moments of time where you can see Chris McCandless walking in the distance."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a brand new masterpiece, the story is full of adventure and life, it brings us back to nature - the beautiful side of the world.\n\nWe got to recognize the society is getting interrupted by the market system. People has already forgot what they dream for. The ultimate goal of life is not about money, but about the value deep inside your heart. The film is well made with many different views about life learned throughout the grow-up of the boy, it raises the concern between sacrificing nature to get better development in city. We have lost ourselves in a blurred vision of society, and let the \"empty hole\" dominating us and motivating us to work and give up enjoying the nice pieces around us.\n\nLike \"Cars\", it gets us to know what time to stop and look around the things you have in hand. Everyone is stuck into a puzzle they cannot give up the social perception or the belief not to go away for a try to involve in the world. It does give us surprise if we learn how to makes friend with it. We don't always be jammed in car congestion, or being upset for a salary cut and unable to purchase food in high-class restaurants. Have a wider vision, the world is different to us.\n\nThere is always strong struggle between the operation of society and preservation of nature. Every human should be of the same status. Every one single man is valuable. What I have been touched in the scene that a guard has caught Christopher for taking the train, just because he doesn't have money or an identity even. In today's world, you have to take up every issues by the useless papers and some rubbish cards. Just one small paper can get you into paradise or to the hell. Identity cards, passports, cheques, ... from when on did people give so many limitations to themselves?\n\nThe theme of film brought about is what I enjoy and agree very much. It is the definition of happiness. Definitely of much deeper study in happiness than \"Pursuit of Happiness\". Happiness does not come from money, it also cannot come from independence. God creates the world and get people to enjoy, but not their own selves. From the movie, the most enjoyable moments are the time when Christopher meets every new people in a spot. \"Happiness comes true only when shared.\" It shows great Christianity and nature in the movie. The \"God Bless Us\" in the backside, the salvation village has got the characters and audience relaxed.\n\nThe superb landscape and marvelous natural world has fascinated me in the complete 120 minutes. It is fun and documentary-like, filming of animals and plants captured in the character's journey, recording of daily conversations with new friends met in his trip. Thanks to the cameramen and editors, shots on the beach or sea are so smooth and genuine, it is like a real travel show but brings meaning to life.\n\nIt could be named as \"No Country For Young Man\". The young guy needs to take risk and go everywhere he likes, regardless of the limit society has hanged on to him, regardless of his parents. He really does a \"jumper\" job: Everywhere is possible. In the world we find no place for a young and active person to go free, freedom should be the right to born with, however, life is not under control by oneself. All are obliged to regulations and instructions. Set by whom? God even would not stop us to go on our own way. The territories should not once be there.\n\nIt's time to change old men's rules. The world would get wonderful, only a few steps to walk out of our sight. Lead your lifestyle and don't lose control of your life by temptations brought in society. Learn to appreciate everything around, and sunshine is being with us always."

Unfortunately neither happened. It continued at an agonizingly slow pace and the only thing of consequence that presented itself was some attractive scenery. But I can watch scenery via virtually any of the thousands of travelogues which are available. I must echo that which another viewer observed, that this movie should have and easily could have been edited to 30 minutes or so, and have been offered by Sundance or a similar venue. Do I recommend it? Only to those who can't seem to find anything else to watch."

        "review_title": "\"Happiness is only real when shared.\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Into the Wild\" is the inspirational albeit heartbreaking story of a brilliant young man named Christopher McCandless who abandoned the premise of a wealthy existence to follow the footsteps of his hero Jack London and answer the call of the wild. He eventually died of starvation after two years of a journey that ended in Alaska where he spent 110 days in a bus lost in the middle of an ancient mining town named Stampede Trail. The bus is still there with Chris' remaining belongings, his diary and his aura.\n\nIt's a sad story but not a tragedy. Chris chose his destiny and gave it its full meaning. He didn't know what he was seeking but knew what he was rejecting, believing the journey mattered more than the destination. Such a story called for a movie and of all directors, it was Sean Penn who adapted the book of writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer, rightfully believing the material would still find a profound echo in people's hearts 15 years after Chris' death. His movie is not only served by a breathtaking cinematography and a haunting performance by Emile Hirsch, it also benefits from a clever editing, ironically the only category to be Oscar-nominated besides Hal Holbrook's supporting performance.\n\nThe editing matters because one can't look at Chris' odyssey as something linear, the film opens by swinging back and forth between the \"Magic Bus\" discovery and family flashbacks, respectively the \"beginning of the end\" and \"the end of the beginning\". The non-linear storytelling creates the same startling puzzlement as the people who met Chris the adventurer when they discovered where he came from: a wealthy family with two highly educated parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) who tried to shape his future with their \"present\" as a model. So when we see this young hiker barely accepting a pair of boots before getting in the middle of the wild nowhere, we know something failed in the McCandless' educational project.\n\nThe contrast is even more striking as Hirsch suffers from the same cruel syndrome than many young men who, beardless, look ten years younger despite the fact that the stories are set only two years apart. So we can see both the plant of rebellion growing and the roots in Chris' past. And Penn chooses the right way to relate the process, Chris couldn't be the narrator, he's a man of action and his actions speak for his rejections: refusing a car as a gift, gives his entire $24,000 savings to charity, burning money, cutting his credit card, everything that superficially defined him.\n\nSo it's through his sister's monologue that we understand what sowed the seeds of his non-conformist: his father's infidelity, domestic violence and the way his parents' materialistic achievements alienated them from their two children and painted a forever disgraceful portrait of success in the mind of Chris (the sister is played by Jena Malone). So Chris expressed his disagreement many times until it was time to walk the walk. So we can clearly see the initial motives and the end of the journey.\n\nAnd the middle-story is indirectly told by someone who only left behind him a series of encounters with strangers that Krakauer could track in order to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. Chris didn't write anything until he came to the bus because it represented the edge of his adventure, the real challenge he was seeking. During the last two years where he was still looking for himself, he met a couple of hippies (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener) a farmer (Vince Vaughn), a couple of Danish tourists and finally Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz.In every case, something immediately caught their hearts, they shaped his vision but so he did with his genuine sincerity, brave approach to life and optimism. And though Hirsch gave a great performance, bizarrely snubbed, the real Chris looked even more sympathetic.\n\nSpeaking from experience, I had my share of friends in business school who were acting like pseudo rebels, rejecting the comfort of modernity, career, family and wealth, only to get back in the ranks once the diploma obtained. Young privileged ones like Chris are numerous but a few of them dare to act according to their thoughts and that's why Chris immediately cuts to our hearts, he's a man of his word. And go figure why, I was thinking of Anne Frank while finishing the film. Maybe it's because I saw the film recently but here are the points of comparisons.\n\nBoth died in their youth and became universal symbols of a spirit resisting the pressure of the world and seeking honesty, purity and peace. Both had a diary they couldn't finish. Both depended on the kindness of people and it's a real shame for Franz who couldn't adopt Chris (Holbrook melted my heart in his last scene). Finally, both have universal posthumous legacies and we can only picture them with a smile on their faces. Of course, Anne didn't chose her life but she lived tragedy with her family while Chris lived happiness he couldn't share.\n\nHappiness indeed. Chris' last picture shows him with a smile on his face, looking gaunt like a Concentration Camp survivor but smiling nonetheless. He didn't want to die, he might have expected it when he realized he couldn't get back anywhere and never let enough hints to be found, but his survival journey into the wild made him a model for young people who felt an instant need to discover themselves while discovering the world.\n\nChris could learn a few things before getting back and coming to terms with his family but he didn't have time to practice what he learned. Still, what he lived taught the world a lesson, a practical one about survival, a universal one about being true to yourself and a timeless one about dreams and happiness, achieving dreams is important but dreaming alone can be dangerous, if not lethal."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sean Penn's film \"Into the Wild\" was based on true events and will haunt viewers long after the final credits fade to black. A recent college graduate, disillusioned by his parents' materialism and duplicity, Christopher McCandless heads off on a meandering journey with the goal of eventually reaching Alaska. Once he has \"disappeared\" by abandoning his car, burning his money, and erasing his identity, the young man wanders the American west in search of himself. The ensuing road movie details the various encounters that he has over the months and years of his journey of discovery. Although Christopher has lost faith in human relationships, he meets and seemingly bonds with a number of people, all of whom take to the engaging, often charming, young man and try to help him. However, he unsentimentally severs his bonds with each, although they apparently have developed feelings and care for him. Rejecting friendship, Christopher seemingly has no romantic feelings or sexual desires either, and he rejects the one overture that is explicitly made.\n\nMcCandless's wanderings eventually take him to the Alaskan wilderness where he takes shelter in an abandoned bus and manages to survive on fish and game. The film flashes back and forth between his time in the bus and earlier episodes. The words of his diary are quoted throughout the film, and his eventual realization that there is little joy in life without sharing it with someone comes too late. Emile Hirsch fills the physically demanding role of Christopher and plays it exceptionally well. Among the people Christopher encounters, Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook stand out as a mature earth mother and a lonely widower, respectively.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" was made with the cooperation of the McCandless family, who were brave to have exposed themselves and their feelings so publicly. Well played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the parents emerge as typical appearance-obsessed Americans who cannot understand their son and mourn and grieve at his alienation and absence. They are not villains, and the son's actions wreak more pain on his family than they ever deserved or inflicted on him. In fact, the young man leaves much pain behind him in his ultimately selfish journey. Not only do his parents and sister suffer, but a young girl, an old retired widower, and a generous middle-aged hippie couple all fall victim to his charms and eventual abandonment. Although Christopher seems convinced that he is on a noble quest, there is nothing noble about inflicting unwarranted pain on those who love you. The words of his final realization and the images that end the film will be etched indelibly in viewers' minds. With both the screenplay and direction to his credit, Sean Penn has fashioned an outstanding adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book and has moved beyond \"promising\" to \"accomplished\" status in both roles."

Apparently the producers did not bother about Alaskan conditions or the realities of \"living on the land\" before shooting this dog. We have an idealist who burns money and gives his college fund to Oxfam to feed others, but in his wending west seems never to turn down a free meal or a free ride, while turning down implied and implicit offers to adopt him by those who have lost children, and turning down sex from a 16-year-old (ethical, but a bit out of place in a hippie encampment). He gets good advice from all the nice people he meets (the only not-nice person in the film is the railroad guard who beats him) and apparently forgets it all on the spot.\n\nIn Alaska, it really gets silly. Apparently he is somewhere in the Tanana Valley, if his plant book is anything to go by, living in a steel bus hull lacking a window or two. I know a family who wintered in Tok (in that valley) in an insulated tent with no windows: they cut and burned a cord of wood _daily_ to survive (they did have a chainsaw). He apparently stops cutting wood entirely after gathering some sticks on a beach in California. Certainly, he lucks out in the matter of light--whoever abandoned the bus apparently left gallons and gallons of oil behind--he is never in the dark. Or without matches, for that matter.\n\nHe kills a cow moose, apparently with a .22, which is really wonderful shooting--moose have been known to pay about as much attention to .22 bullets as they do to yellowjackets. In good weather, he seems to spend his time mooning in the bus instead of hunting, fishing, or bringing in wood for next winter. When he gets desperate for food to the point of delirium, he eats the wrong plant and poisons himself.\n\nIt was depressing to learn that this was a \"real\" story, that a genuine kid apparently was this appealing and this dumb. I am sorry for his family who were, according to him, terrible parents. All of our parents were terrible in one way or another. Most of us get over it, at least those of us who live past 23."

It doesn't judge the hero, it judges ideas in a way we haven't heard of from American film-making for quite a while. That's interesting."

I think it takes courage to see a movie like this. Be warned, this is not your typical Hollywood big budget formulaic movie. I will be thinking about this movie for a long time. What I liked (no, loved) about this movie was its ability to keep you interested and at the same time let its message keep humming in the background. \"Happiness is only real when it is shared...\" This movie wanted me to embrace the world in a way that EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL. People's lives are a unique poetry all to their own, live yours like you're trying to say something, but never forget that JOY can be had by reveling in the idea that WE ALL SHARE OUR LIVES (in some way) WITH EACH OTHER..."

LIke many of us never do. Its just a shame it couldn't have had a happier ending. Looking forward to see this. ITs looks like it was amazingly done. Its looks as though it will capture everything I felt when reading the book. Honestly I coudn't book that book down. I wanted to bad to know what happened in the end. I still sometimes can't fully grasp what was so intriguing about Chris.His passion for life and to explore and learn and see more ahd like I said, having the courage that most of us don't, to actually get out there and do it. I hope his family is happy with the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read the book soon after it was published, in the mid-1990s, I think. It was an impressive piece of writing to chronicle the wanderings of the misguided Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) who finally decides to forgo all human contact in the wilds of Alaska. If nothing else, McCandless had the courage of his convictions, even if he was remarkably ill-prepared for his adventures.\n\nConvictions, however, can come back to bite you, unless you're prepared to learn from experience and change your ways. In that regard, the film fails to deliver the whole story. Hence, I'd urge interested viewers to get the book from a local library and read it \u2013 if not all of it (although, it's a relatively short non-fiction narrative), then definitely the end.\n\nThe photography, though, is excellent. The acting by all the characters is very natural \u2013 indeed, almost flawless and with special mention for Hal Holbrook (as old Ron Franz) who has scenes with Hirsch that are truly amazing in their emotional effectiveness.\n\nHirsch, of course, carries the film and story. I'd not seen him before in a film; without doubt, however, he is excellent in the role. Though, it would be instructive to see him in another story and context. Sean Pen produced and directed this and did a competent job for a pedestrian (no pun intended) story that some say is overlong. Perhaps it is.\n\nThe film is remarkable for me from another aspect, however: with a total of fifty-four film locations, I think this film wins, hands down, as the one that's traveled to the most. Even the epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) went to only thirty-two; and the other epic from that same year, The Longest Day, managed to get out to only a dozen or so. There is no Oscar for highest number of locations, though.\n\nOverall, though, I think, this type of film would have been better handled by Werner Herzog, famous for many fiction and non-fiction films \u2013 particularly Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary about another young man who thought he could live with wild bears. That's a better movie story than Into The Wild.\n\nHowever, if you want to see many barren and lonely parts of the USA, followed by the wild, forbidding beauty of Alaska, then do see this movie. Or, you could just see a National Geographic documentary, instead. For the whole story about Chris McCandless, though, get the book and read it.\n\nI recommend this film for Penn fans, mostly, and nature lovers."

        "review_detailed_main": "I might not see this film in the same light as many others see it, not because of anything technical, the acting, or the decisions Sean Penn made in adapting and directing.\n\nI simply think that the main character isn't the anti-establishment hero that he is perhaps made out to be, but a young man who let his blind yet admirable adherence to principle rob him of opportunities. Not opportunities to make money or meet chicks or garner admiration from strangers, (but at the same time all three), just a boy who never had the chance to see what he might become.\n\nEmile Hirsch is this \"boy\", Chris McCandless, later calling himself Alex Supertramp in a further sign that perhaps he wasn't the mature man he thought he was. I initially found it amusing that Hirsch got this role, thinking almost everything these days goes to Shia Lebouf, despite the fact that he is yet to be entertaining in anything and in fact is downright annoying in most films he has appeared in! The plot is simple because it is a true story, young Chris graduates and instead of following the American Dream and going to college he decides to drop off the face of the Earth and just exist. He doesn't tell his family, burns his money and trashes his car, so why does he keep his clothes and other possessions? Surely roaming naked and free through life is the purest one can be? Also if Chris is such a fan of the environment and is in a position to make a difference with his passion and superior intellect, why does he then ignore that opportunity and remove himself from the system? Regardless Chris and his clothes head off and just slum through life for the remainder of his, picking up odd jobs here and there and interacting with various locals and fellow drifters with the main aim of going to Alaska by himself with only his wits to protect him. There are many flashbacks to various parts of the last years of Chris's life for obvious reasons, as the final stages have a despairing sense of inevitability about them and they would even be more depressing if allowed to run their course.\n\nHints are given to Chris's decision making process by flashbacks involving his family, who while well intentioned appear to have high expectations as a minimum for Chris's future, which is an outlook I'm sure many parents would share. Given the fact that this is a screen version of real events a subtle variance in their demeanor could alter the viewer's perception significantly one way or the other. I would think the director might be prone to wanting a less forgiving view of the parents to further justify the actions of young Supertramp, as that is more romantic than the notion of a young bloke with a promising future dissing his parents, burning his cash and changing his name to Alex Supertramp.\n\nWell I'm just saying\u0085.\n\nOnce in Alaska Supertramp finds the Magic Bus, a deserted shell of a schoolbus that serves as shelter and home. While there he uses his accumulated knowledge and smarts to exist, though he becomes unkempt, unshaven and most alarmingly malnourished, and again it is more and more evident that there will be no happy ending.\n\nSupertramp has undeniable charm and the allure that rebels seem to garner, but the movie is kept alive by the many bit parts of those he comes into contact with along the way. Vince Vaughn plays an employer that sees what Chris has in store and vainly tries to talk him out of it. Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker play a middle aged hippie couple that are cruising through life without ever really truly roughing it, and most notably Kristen Stewart plays a young teen who would be Supertramp's love interest if he wasn't jest so damn principled! I have scanned a few reviews when I saw that on IMDb this is one of the Top 250 all time rated flicks, and while I don't disagree that this is a fine film I can't see where the extra point or so comes from. Into the Wild is a sad film, as Supertramp left the security of home to find himself, and overreached his abilities to tragic effect. It is worth noting that despite all the romance and high mindedness of young Chris McCandless the note that was actually left on the Magic Bus where his body was found was a desperate SOS message, not a noble statement of belief, it is amazing that a couple of minor decisions in editing and direction can perhaps elevate a tragic story into one of martyrdom.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 7 / 10. A fine film involving tragic subject matter made specifically to lionise Chris McCandless. Hopefully if nothing else it inspires someone to pause for thought before venturing out, rather than sending other young people on a misguided adventure to find themselves.\n\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

The main character seems very mean at the beginning and does things most of the viewers/the \"civilised\" world wouldn't dare to do. So is there even a chance for redemption to this character?\n\nWhile he doesn't really change in the course of the film (not in his overall believe), I think we find ourselves attracted to the idea of \"being free\", taking choices and not having to ask anyone if you can or can't do this and that. But what it also ultimately shows us, is that humans do need company. Even those who barricade themselves in their rooms and think they're better off alone ... aren't. There's always someone near you (not really tough, when you consider the world population), so that might drive (some of) us, into wanting to be alone, but ultimately that wish will never happen and maybe deep inside those people know it and that gives them comfort, while they think they are alone. That is what this is about (as I understood it) :o)\n\nPS: Hirsch (the main actors real last name) means deer in German, just in case you wondered!"

Not only was it done well, in every sense of the phrase, but it had something to say.\n\nEmile Hirsch was surprisingly good. He was really devoted to the role and that is the essence of acting. The rest of the supporting cast was well cast and put on great performances (ecspecially that of Keener, Holbrook, and Hurt).\n\nThe cinematography was masterfully done and I really praise Penn for making this film the way he did. The film really sparks a sense of thought in people that most never think about. I am almost happy that the Oscars snubbed the film because I feel its a movie that doesn't need or want praise. (just as the true life McCandless did not).\n\nI know a lot of people think that McCandless was an ignorant brat. I can understand how some might think this but perhaps him being put in that position is what caused him to do what he did. He realized that he was a spoiled rich kid and realized how unimportant being rich is. Money DOES make people too cautious and if you are too cautious you cant live to your full capacity. People should not let socio-economic status define them. I'm not saying everyone should jump ship and walk to Alaska but people should at least understand what he was trying to do and maybe take a lesson from him.\n\nOne other thing that really glued the movie together was Eddie Vedder's soundtrack. Ed, as a young man, had the same views on life that McCandless did. He really poured his soul into the songs and the fact that he can relate with McCandless made him the perfect candidate. At some points during the film, the scene almost complimented the music instead of vice versa.\n\nAll in all, and outstanding film and will stay with you long after you hit the eject button."

However, I have so many issues with this film.\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.\n\nThe film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.\n\nThere were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.\n\nBased on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.\n\nAfter more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film was a well-written, had great acting and great directing but this all went towards telling a mostly pointless story. Similar movies could have been made about any of a million emotionally troubled homeless people. I think that this particular troubled homeless man's story got made into a film for two reasons. He liked to quote literature, giving the writer a handy device for revealing the protagonists thoughts concisely and poetically. He also chose to be homeless in scenic locations which made for a pretty movie.\n\nThe movie is worth seeing for all of its good qualities, just don't expect to gain any insights into the human condition, or to see a character learn and grow in any meaningful way. For my money The Razor's Edge was a much more interesting film in the same genre.\n\nI'm not suggesting that the story of Into the Wild should have veered from reality to make it more interesting. I'm saying that the story wasn't interesting enough to make it into a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Into the Wild has a slightly student film maker feel to it. The editing, the music, the choice of camera angles, the constant constant cutting feels very experimental. After a slightly annoying title crawl we get into the film. The picture looks very clean, sharp and bright, we follow a lone character on his travels in Alaska, it's only him so you know there's not going to be much dialogue. When the dialogue does come it's pretty banal, it's quite realistic, the kind of thing an idealistic 23 year old would probably be coming out with. Despite being a film about the great outdoors we actually get quite a lot of tight close up shots. Also the early part of the film is much more focused on the people he does meet rather than his solitude and isolation. A nice aging hippie couple spend some time with him and we learn more about his background. The son of a rich but dysfunctional family, our character gives away all his money, destroys his ID papers and sets off on a trip across the country to explore it's wild parts. You'll have to make your own mind up about the character. Is this a spoilt rich kid off on a self indulgent trip, unwilling to knuckle down and take his future seriously. Or is he an idealistic, adventurous and open minded young man, keen to avoid the consumerism sweeping the country. The idea though he doesn't need any money is not really affirmed. He takes on many low paid jobs to help fund his travels, he's no doubt a bright boy with a bold vision of how life ought to be. He meets many other travels on his ways, all of them friendly and harmless. It's around his parents and in the big cities that he feels unhappiest it seems. There is an awful lot of voice over too, and after a while it gets a bit repetitive, quite a lot of it from his sister is mostly going on about how amazing, how clever, how talented, how advanced he is, it all gets a bit hero-worship like after a while. Some of the cinematography and editing too is really dated, I hate split screens in a movie, it doesn't feel very cinematic at all. The appeal of freedom and natural beauty though is understandable. Quite a lot of the story is told in flashbacks before we finally get to the end on the \"magic bus.\" At over two hours the film is too long. Kirsten Stewart is also in this film which is a nice bit of trivia now."

        "review_detailed_main": "Glorious or inglorious, that is here the question. Alex Supertramp is a down-shifter par excellence, who still needs at first the non-down-shifters for his gradual self-realization. He is an adventurer and freedom-seeker and he is not satisfied with little. He resigns materialism, the urges and lies of the American society and tries to break out into the wild nature, to experience \"real\" life. To late it dawns upon him that nature is no garden Eden and that some attainments, not so much of the civilization, rather of the socialization are reasonable. It is a surprising end that Krakauer describes with the help of the diary of the unfortunate. The movie is here not so much stringent. The end of Alex is cruel and shows that it is vain to romanticize nature. Unfortunate could be the wrong word. If Alex would not have renounced such reasonable artifacts like a map, which he intentionally left back, or at least if he had informed about the locality, he could have made it easily to survive. That he wanted it is shown clearly by his desperate struggle against death. Experienced adventurers always calculate with emergency cases when they plan their special tours. Idealism needs carbohydrates! Alex was sheepish, overambitious maybe simply silly. Yes, exaggerated idealism is sometimes nothing else than density. But it would be wrong to judge this young man. He made a decision and he paid for it. Did he find self-determination? No, no man can exist for himself, the freedom some are searching is nothing but an abstract and nature is not nice at all! She is like she is. Without man she is nothing at all. Nature is there for man, but she does not know it. But man has to know it. The sojourn in nature is a good opportunity for self-reflection. Krakauer implies that Alex could have reached the goal to live his idealism until the very bitter end. He is not different to mountaineers who notwithstanding the risks want to have their extreme experience. There is nothing left than the hope, that instead of the romantic transfiguration of a life in the wilderness or the intended union with nature \u0096 a thing that cannot exist \u0096 in the face of death the simple recognition prevailed that life, that loves and can be loved is the most sensible and praiseworthy. A lot of knowledge for a young man in our times. A recommendable film and book. Krakauer did not draw conclusions. He did not want to interpret too much into it. Perhaps because he is guilty himself of extreme adventures."

The atmosphere plays a big part to make the movie what it is, all credit goes to Eric Gautier for filming it with such grace and Jay Cassidy for doing a masterful job of editing.\n\nThe score by Michael Brook, Kaki King and Eddie Vedder does a good job of coupling with the excellent shots.\n\nAll the praise aside, the movie really fails to connect and feel coherent. Chris McCandless played by Emil Hirsch can feel relatable, at times everyone has felt overwhelmed by materials, the society and thought about just being one with themselves.\n\nThe problem is, you cannot help but feel the character just left his sister in a horrible situation with parents that are not really empathic. Also it is really off putting that the character never tries to inspire others to find the value in disconnect from the chaotic city life, instead he just magically always finds helpful people without seeing the other side of life.\n\nHow can you see the real world without seeing some negativity, finding some evil. How can the core of a man's experience expand if they have never experienced the worst of humanity or even seen a glimpse of it?\n\nMy favorite characters in the movie ended up being Hal Holbrook who is the only one who benefited from Emil's journey.\n\nA good movie with a decent message, but no really a consistent plot that makes all that much sense sometimes. Too pretentious and full of itself to feel endearing."

        "review_detailed_main": "I heard for years about this movie for the several reasons: it's on IMDB's top 250, it's directed by Sean Penn (an actor I usually like) and it was overplayed a lot between 2015 and 2016. A month ago I finally sat through it and I had to agree with nearly everyone else.\n\nIt begins in 1990. Jacob McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory University. He is disenchanted with modern society and decides to live in the wild. He destroys credit cards and IDs, donates his savings and goes with his Datsun on a trip in the wilderness without warning his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister. Unfortunately his car breaks and he goes hitchiking. From there on he will have some experiences; he will help a hippy couple rekindling their relationship, he will work for a while in an harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) until Wayne is arrested, he will met that couple again and becomes briefly friend with young country singer Tracy Tatro (Kristen Stewart), he meets Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook), a former General that lost his wife and works as a leather worker and asks him to be like his grandfather. After he leaves, he realizes that nature can be harsh and will end in a bad way.\n\nThe acting is good by all. Hirsch is a likeable lead despite his decision and Hurt and a pre-TWILIGHT Kristen Stewart are good. But who stands out is Hal Holbrook as the widower who proposes Jacob to act like his grandfather and Jacob tells him to discuss about it when he'll return from Alaska. The photography is stunning and it makes you want to visit the places where it was filmed, and Penn directs nicely.\n\nOverall, a great movie that truly deserves all the praise and that stands its reputation. Highly recommended as it's a bit unusual as well."

This movie, if viewed through the appropriate lens, should make you think, and think hard. This movie will change the way you view certain aspects of life (again, assuming you watch with the right attitude).\n\nIf you have gripes with this guy's life and choices then you should deal with that separately from judging this movie as a film itself. As a movie, this did all the right things. It sent me on an emotional rollercoaster, it raised questions about society, its cinematography was gorgeous, and it evokes a feeling of freedom in the viewer. I have never felt this way while watching any other movie.\n\nI suggest you watch this movie not through the eyes of a critic looking for things to hate, but as a viewer vulnerable to the messages the movie has to offer."

In this case, the character is Chris McCandless, a man who ventured out in a search for himself after graduating college in May 1990.\n\nOverall, a good story, but the film does move rather slow at times. Chris McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch, meets many different people along his journey. The film is basically a reflection of how McCandless viewed his adventure in the context of the people he meets along the way. The film is narrated by McCandless sister, played by Jena Malone.\n\nThe main criticism of the film is Sean Penn's interpretation is just that, his interpretation. I have not read the book, but research I looked up suggests the author takes a more objective look at Chris McCandless.\n\nI had heard about this movie for a long time, but until I read a news story about the famed bus in the movie being removed a few days ago I had never got a chance to watch the movie.\n\nOverall a good film, but one that left me wondering how much Hollywood influence was behind the story. The film's interpretation will leave you wondering how much came from Chris McCandless and how much came from the author and director who made a book and film about him.\n\nEven at 2 and a half hours, I recommend seeing this movie. Unfortunately I do not know if the movie needed to be as long as it was so you will probably only want to watch this movie once."

        "review_title": "Into Perfection",
        "review_detailed_main": "Director Sean Penn delivers the most beautiful film to enter theaters in decades, Into the Wild. Starring newcomer Emile Hirsch as Christopher, a recent graduate of Emory University who decides to pick up and leave behind the material possessions of the world and walk the Earth. Based on a true story, Christopher 's life ends in tragedy but alas, there is no tragedy in the film, rather the essence of exquisiteness of the world as Christopher shows us everything we should be in awe about, that surrounds us every day.\n\nOne of the best cast ensembles constructed this year, Penn gives each of his actor's a objective and draws it out of them like a needle. Hirsch's character, being the most examined obviously, carries the film on his shoulders as other great thespians have in the past like Adrien Brody in The Pianist and Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Hirsch holds no boundaries in obtaining Christopher's most sensitive areas and engulfing them in himself as if possessed by the man. As he travels the states, he meets a slew of characters along the way.\n\nVince Vaughn showing us his dramatic acting chops, embodies a quality not seen by the actor before. Performances in films like Wedding Crashers, which I thought was brilliant and The Break-Up has put him in a boat Jim Carrey can't seem to get out of. Vaughn is more than comedy here, he's performing a man who you love to love, a man who's flaws don't carry any weight in caring for him. Maybe Vaughn's transition will be better and smoother than Carrey's.\n\nCatherine Keener, who has been on my bad list as of late for her mediocre nominated performance in Capote, as completely revolutionized her acting game. With a sense of grace and splendor, Keener shows she can inhabit a character and let her ware on her soul. You can see pain and joy throughout the film, and when she's off screen you can't wait until you see her again. When she returns, you're overcome with joy because you knows Christopher is in safe hands.\n\nYoung talents, Kristin Stewart and especially Jena Malone are sensational. Stewart as the smitten young girl in need of love is heartbreaking altogether. Malone who has showed some promise in her earlier career with performances in Stepmom and Saved! shows something original and tender as Christopher's estranged sister. As she narrates the picture, you can hear the passion and desolation in her voice. As she tries to gives us insight into her family's world and the reasoning behind Christopher's exit, we're shown the tragedy of the American lifestyle everyone so desperately yearns for. Money, wealth, and materials cannot buy love, compassion, and safety. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden hold those images to heart as they give their performances as Chris' parents.\n\nIt's in the final twenty minutes in the film when Christopher meets his last major human contact. A old man exemplifying loneliness to the most potent degree and humanity in the most striking wonders. Hal Holbrook takes on this role and completely shatters all acting competition and gives on the best performances of the year and by far, his career. Holbrook, showing anguish in his eyes, layers the character with emotion upon emotion. Its in his finale encounter with Christopher he seals the award for Best Supporting Actor at this year's Academy Awards.\n\nAs stated before, Penn's direction here even though forceful in audience's attention, is no laughing matter. He ranks himself amongst the greats of other directors, Clint Eastwood, Sidney Lumet, etc. As powerful as he usually is in front of the camera, he's even more effective behind it. Into the Wild, is truly the most breathtaking and moving film of the year. All should experience it, and I myself, wish that I could live if a \u00bc of what this man did in his final years of his life.\n\nGrade: ****/****"

Sean Penn's directional outings have earlier been relatively dark stories unfolded, but he has never been near so connected to the story as he's here - Penn gets under Chris' skin with a beautifully shot movie, keeping a thoughtful pace through its 2 hours and 25 minutes. The journey is fantastic, cutting himself from his estranged parents, Chris lets his wanderlust take him anywhere, he puts millions of miles under his heels as he encounters people and nature with charisma and adventurous belief - Emilie Hirsch executes the character perfectly, his deepened thoughts of Byron and Thoreau are poetically bent and his motivations seems unclear, so Penn relates to the grasping of Chris' roots to find the dark wake of the young man's sudden disappearance. And Penn uses Chris' narrating sister, Carine (Jena Malone) to reveal why he suddenly broke free from his parents and relatives - and as the months go by even his understanding sister starts questioning Chris and his motives, but she always reminds herself that this had to happen sometime, one way or the other Christopher McCandless was a restless soul who found solace in himself. But the history feels tragic when Chris realizes that he was wrong; he is in need for human connection all the way, but especially with the moving sequences of widower Ron Franz, Hal Holbrook's great portray is introduced as Chris' achievement of wisdom. Because Chris never tried reaching out for something so spiritually or heartfelt or deepened that he would sacrifice himself for the beauty of the wilderness and freedom of no nothing; at the very end he wrote an SOS in which he was in serious injury, and needed help. Christopher McCandless had a unique courage, and you can't help feeling affected as the movie's whispers will come back to you days after watching it. Rarely we see an American film so refreshed with love for the US yet somehow digging for something even stronger, darker and thoughtful with Chris' rapid soul in the crucial revelation - and the soundtrack of Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs gives Chris' another voice than his own, haunted and strong, dark and bright. 'Into the Wild' celebrates Christopher McCandless, for everything he stood for and everything he did."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been anticipating this movie ever since laying eyes on the trailer, late November 2007. I'm a bit saddened by the knowledge of how insanely beautiful the nature scenes would have looked in the theater, the DVD experience is never the same at all.\n\nNow, let's get to it. 'Into The Wild' stirred up a lot of buzz being a Sean Penn direction and being based on the best selling amazing story of Christopher McCandless. I can't say I've had the pleasure of reading the novel, but a lot of comments deem to conclude Penn has done the book justice.\n\nThe first thing that's poignant about ITW is the narrative. Penn makes jumps in time and place, giving the story more variation and creating intrigue. It doesn't make it easier to follow, however ITW was never intended for a non-attentive audience. People who can't keep an open mind and identify or at least empathize with characters will not fully enjoy the experience (a word I don't use lightly) that is ITW.\n\nBesides the writing, there's lots of other stuff to rave about. The music and the performances come to mind. Eddie Vedder was not the reason I urged to see this, but it was, not a doubt in the world about this, a nice bonus for me. He's the vocalizer of my favorite songs and the perfect voice to guide the audience in this unique road movie. He also adds to the filmmakers' credibility, having strong political opinions ,similar to McCandless',of his own.\n\nOne glance at the cast should get every pure bred movie lover's heart thumping, William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Marcia Gay Harden,... Not only did the big names deliver, but the small names almost all surprised me with great to excellent performances. Even down to Brian Dierker, who isn't really an actor! Emile Hirsh, only seen in The Girl Next Door, a film I'm not proud of having seen. His performance in that movie belies his abilities. Even in interviews he comes across as a slick Hollywood run-in-a-mill actor, but his performance really radiates feelings of sincerity and dedication to his work. Another nice surprise was Vince Vaughn, he gives the audience a wonderfully natural performance, easily his best one to this day. Can't forget Catherine Keener, always solid, sometimes excellent. The latter applies for this movie, maybe an Oscar nudge wouldn't have been totally out of place here.\n\nITW is a movie that keeps on giving, as you may have concluded from the size of my review. It's filled with little bonuses. The dialog is not the usual Hollywood pretentious drivel. Some of the philosophies brought forward actually ring true in my ears, something which can't be said about most movies with 'clever' (sarcasm) dialog.\n\nOne of the nicest things about ITW (I can't believe I didn't mention it already) is the feeling you're watching a lot of different wonderful movies, all wrapped up into one (not overly long) movie. Each segment has their own curious and wonderful characters, but the movie manages never to become chaotic. And that alone is a testament to Sean Penn.\n\nAbout the plot/story: I was happy to know it was biographical beforehand, otherwise some of the events may have seemed to 'out-there', far fetched. And that, I believe, is a testament the real story, the level of amazement it actually offers.\n\nAs said in an interview by Emile Hirsh himself, the character really is a dividing line audience-wise. Hate him or love him, you have to respect a good film like this one. Extremely Highly recommended, especially for those who loved Eternal Sunshine."

        "review_detailed_main": "At first, I suffered the delusion that the main character was an annoying go getter who worried too much about people being selfish and materialistic. But little does the audience know, Sean Penn is just an A-hole and likes to shove family drama in your face till you're drenched in tears. However long it takes you to get over the fact that the movie has a message and that if you're one of those people to judge the character by his actions only, and not the lesson to be learned in the end, then just leave the movie theater and don't look back. Honestly, this film is what film makers should look forward to conceiving and retiring from.\n\nAlthough Emile Hirch doesn't put together an Oscar worthy performance, one that will turn heads like Cate Blanchett's winded and terrific Elizabeth, or Benicio Del Torro's addict antics, he sustains character throughout and gives a performance that is memorable in the fact that as the man he plays grows, you see him grow as well. And speaking of the character, he's straightforward but still very intriguing. Alexander Supertramp otherwise known as Alex Maccendless, needed an escape from his home sweet home, for reasons that seem to be on the surface, but are actually revealed to be deeper in the end.\n\nThe people around him, the people he meets and loves and changes are so real and a-typical, that the actors seem lost in some kind of delusion that they may actually be a hippie, or a man that just got busted for watching illegal satellite television. I'd go on but I woudn't want to spoil any kind of archetype you may be waiting for.\n\nThe movie, with it's much needed and refreshing meaningful shots of our protagonists point of view expressed through heavy nature watching and blunt nudity, is something that you do not see in cinema anymore, unless it's done badly by an indie or art director trying to be angst. It feels as if this movie leaps ahead of its budget and production and attempts to send you it's final message, revealed in its final chapter, as an actual morally defined and virtuous one. Though a big deal that Penn made with the main character was that he looked into the camera a lot which i fond strange, but oddly balanced at the same time. And I mean balanced as in the fact that it may have taken itself a little seriously at times, but it did loss en up a bit, god bold, and the fourth wall, though still broken, gave a realness to the character.\n\nThough the ending will leave you feeling sore and some numb, you will eventually come around to learn that the lesson that must be learned, must be lived first, and if it takes a cast like this to express it on film, then by damn, let it be learned and expressed.\n\n\"True Happiness can only be achieved when you have someone to share it with.\""

To use gutter language, he **really** shot his wad with this masterpiece. It's almost hard for me to put into words how good this film is by touching on so many different life aspects and yet melding them all together in order to have a resultant grand brush stroke.\n\nChristopher McCandless is played by Emile Hirsch. He acts well beyond his years. The remaining cast is too numerous to list, but they all turn in fabulous work. Christopher graduates from college, has some money saved, looks back at his past, decides a charity could use the money in a good way, gives one a check, burns all his previous ties to everyday ho-hum life after he recalled his upbringing and not necessarily wanting his children to have to be put through the same stuff. After eliminating the identifying markers from himself to the past, he wanders through South Dakota, Arizona, and Mexico before heading to Alaska.\n\nThis movie has too many philosophical points brought up and dealt with to name here or mar your own viewing pleasure, but I will boldly and forcefully say that any self-respecting movie lover will be in awe while leaving the theater afterward. They may well want to go multiple times like I did. Don't let this go to DVD or a second-run theater, or you will be forever kicking yourself. Hurry up--it won't be playing new much longer!"

The main character is so righteous and hypocritical, I found myself hating him more and more, wishing his demise would occur sooner rather than later.\n\nWhy, then, does this movie have such a high rating on IMDb? Clearly too many feel that if Sean Penn directed it, well, they MUST like it. Or, simply because it is so slow and boring (and it tries too hard to be deep and meaningful), it must be a good movie.\n\nIf you want something deep, meaningful, and life-affirming, yet fun and modern, go watch '127 Hours'."

I was really just astonished at the magnitude of the whole thing. This movie takes on a story and locations that needed to be huge and totally embraces it. Every scene is shot beautifully, with some really breathtaking moments. The acting is great, Hirsch is completely believable, Hal Holbrook is heartbreakingly wonderful, and of course Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are always great. The relationship between Hirsch and Catherine Keener plays perfectly. I was surprised at how long the film went on (2 and 1/2 hours) but couldn't think of anything that didn't need to be there.\n\nThe thing that I found so great about this movie was its relevance. Though I doubt many people are so eager to go put themselves in such dangerous wilderness, the sentiment hits close to home. In an age of devout commercialism I think most people can understand the urge to try to find something pure in the world. This movie makes you want to go out and look for it."

Chris wanders through a landscape of stereotypes whose only purpose is to provide a foil for Chris to react to, typically with something intended to be profound. None of these characters convey any sense of depth except perhaps the one played by Catherine Keener. It may have been deliberate on Sean Penn's part to present these people in this way so that Chris, by comparison, seems deep, but for me it made the film much less than it could have been."

Along with his Mark Twain effort. Holbrook deserves an Oscar. I was quite moved.\n\nThat being said, this movie is not judgmental. It presents the story in an even handed way. You the viewer, decides who is \"evil\" and who is not. The many critiques or kudos here are based on peoples own perceptions and filtered through their own time and place in their mental, ethical and chronological and societal place.\n\nYounger people may see the main character as stupid or wonderfully idealistic.\n\nTo me it was the story of a young man, who is idealistic, and genial, at the same time, who can not make any meaningful connections due to..youth, and trouble in his background. And makes some mistakes along the way as young people will.\n\nIn his travels he has opportunity to grow spiritually. Does he succeed? Watch and find out.\n\nHaving more than once..turned to nature and actually raised my hands to the heavens on a mountain or two (usually naked) I could empathize with his search for solace there.\n\nThe cinematography was good.

It's still all about HIM.\n\nSo here he is, struggling both to hatch into adulthood and to stay in his protective, selfish shell. In a fitting metaphor, he literally dies in that shell - cocooned in a mummy bag, inside an old bus. Yes, he is a fool, but he is our own uniquely American-made fool.\n\nIt is fitting that many of the characters in the movie save him, by feeding him and sheltering him, but all this does is delay his self-destruction. If he had survived, what stories he would have had to tell, what a life he would have had to live.\n\nKudos to the actors and the writers. Especially kudos for the cinematography. Ultimately it's the wide-open beauty of America that baited and lured McCandless to his doom. Finally many thanks to Ziggy in Anchorage for his excellent belt-work. The belt is a metaphor for the whole odyssey, tooled in leather, ominously becoming shorter day by day."

He is really a hypocrite. For this movie, I just see one person do some strange things,such as dancing himself, climbing the mountain and stretching his arms and thinking how beautiful it is. Be so ridiculous that drive himself into the 'nature' and whether is it a another forms of hypocritical escape. He abandon his life without do anything,just pursue spiritual liberation? I do not understand the movie want to tell us what completely.My English is not good, and I just tell my opinion about its bad side."

The camera work is beautiful and as innovative as any I have seen in a long time. Penn's direction has taken a quantum leap from \"The Pledge\" to \"Into the Wild\". The music, contributed by Eddie Vedder is astonishingly good and fits perfectly within the scenes. Arguably the finest example of American film in recent memory. Unquestionably the best work of Penn's career, in front or behind the camera. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are excellent, as one can usually expect, Jena Malone lends layers to the film with superb narrative work. I am not a polished enough writer to do \"Into the Wild\" justice but I am not ashamed to say I cried throughout the whole movie."

It's undoubtedly a thought provoking film, containing many moments of magic, and is very different from other road movies (moreover this is an ecological road movie..) because the story is really genuine, impressively directed, written and acted."

People who leave their critique at that are correct, but missed a lot of deeper meanings provided in this masterpiece. Sean Penn you are to be commended. I believe you did justice to the book and were honest to the story. The acting was superb. Hirsch, Keener, Holbrook make this movie sing. One person who I don't hear a lot of mention for is Brian Dierker(Rainey). For only being his first acting role, he was very good. Vedder's music and singing were perfect for this film. The cinematography was stunning. I've seen \"No Country\"... and in my opinion does not even touch \"Wild\" I have not seen \"There will be blood\", only trailers. But it seems to win the Oscar for acting you have to be over the top or over act in my opinion like Daniel Day-Lewis's role, almost like a cartoon character. The actors in \"wild\" did not over-act, but brought real feelings thru about real people. It is truly a shame that \"Wild\" did not get more nominations, as it definitely got snubbed."

Yesterday, I caught the last showing of this film... and I am glad I did. Based on a true story of an extraordinary person, it tells the story of Chris McCandless, an exceptionally intelligent person, who's on a journey of his life to avoid the \"system\" He doesn't like how the world works, where people die or get killed and in the world where politicians and parents (Chris' parents were always fighting during his youth) rule. He doesn't want any \"things\" in life: No watch, no car, no money, etc, because he believes things can't buy him happiness it's his want for freedom that does (in his case, nature). That's why he has a motivation to go on a journey, to Alaska. At the end, I think what Chris is trying to accomplish is to find the inner self and live in the most peaceful and purest place on earth, the place where everything is poetic, and the place where nature rules instead of mankind.\n\nI praise Sean Penn for a great effort in directing and writing and also Emile Hirsch for a soulful performance that truly captivated my heart. I didn't know he had it in him, a surprising turn and I will be looking forward to his future movies. And last but not least, Eddie Veddar, who expressed Chris' feelings through the power of music.\n\n\"I read somewhere... how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong... but to feel strong.\" - Christopher Johnson McCandless\n\nI guess it's true when people say there's nothing beautiful than nature itself."

I hate hunters and don't think the killing of a moose was worth his 'experience'. You wouldn't think so either if you were the moose. The scenery was beautiful and the music set a nice tone. The performances were all good, especially Hal Holbrook, a kind lonely old man with no one to love. But 'what's his face' didn't care about anybody or anything. He hurts everyone he knows with his childish \"the worlds a bad place\" attitude. As if it's something only he notices. Da grow up dude. It's the happiness you give others that make life count for something. How about just go save a dog. there's enough of those that need love."

It means that these scenes are memorable in their own way. For me, they are usually based on the dialogue.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" does not produce either of these traits. It produces the most important part of storytelling. It sucks the listener into the story so much that they lose track of what is real and what is not. The listener may forget they are watching, instead of living, the life of Chris McCandless. With every fall, you fall with him. You feel the gratitude and love he has for everyone he comes across on his arduous journey to find himself and his own vision of reality.\n\nPersonally, I do not have to watch this movie again because it feels like I lived it. Will I watch it again? I am on my way to buy it right now.\n\nThis film will touch everyone in a different way. Whether it be a family situation, an earning for a better society, or a struggle within themselves to find out what they are made of."

The music is also brilliantly made by Eddie Vedder and suits the movie in all ways. It is a very inspiring film in a very unreal way i.e. it makes you feel like going out there into the wild and finding the true meaning of life as a free man.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Into The Wild\" is not based on the astonishing true story of wild choral-child Britney Spears nocturnal escapades in The Bipolar Express. \"Into The Wild\" is not even based on the \"asstonishing\" true story of wild Governor-manchild Eliot Spitzer's nocturnal escapades in The Emperor's Club. \"Into The Wild\" is really based on the astonishing true story of wild child Christopher McCandless who abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity, and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Just like Britney and Spitzer, his \"assets\" get frozen because of his desire to roam free. Director Sean Penn's compelling film pulls into the heartstrings on the quest of ultimate solitary freedom. \"Into The Wild\" is more into the journey that McCandless took within the friendships he experienced on his hitchhiking route to Alaska. That roster included an affectionate middle-age hippy couple, a fast-talking farmer, and a lonesome geriatric widower. McCandless does reach the apex of solitaire euphoria when he encounters an isolated wrecked bus in Alaska which in turn he calls The Magic Bus. Chris becomes The Who of the Magic Bus by living in it until the song stops playing in his life. It is no secret on what happens to Chris so I am not playing spoiler when I say The Magic Bus becomes The Tragic Bus because he dies in it because of a poisonous fruit he ingested. Chris was eventually going to die anyway from lack of nourishment, so I guess Chris picked his poison. His fragile body was so emaciated that a slight \"McCandless in The Wind\" would have tipped him over. Emile Hirsch's courageous performance as McCandless was enthralling enough to be into the best male leading acting efforts of the year. Hirsch lost an enormous amount of weight for the role; I guess he must have eaten many \"Hirschy Bars\" to gain the weight back. Hirsch's roadie entourage were also into the acting: Hal Holbrook broke our hearts by effectively portraying the emotional senior Ron Franz, Vince Vaughn's \"vaughnisms\" talked the talk and walked the walk as farmer Wayne, and Catherine Keener & Brian Dierker's performances as the hippy Rainey & Jan were hip hip hooray! William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden as the desperate McCandless parents and Jena Malone as the philosophical McCandless also were into their supporting acting. Eric Gautier's gorgeous scenic cinematography was as cold as ice at times but warm at heart at others. Eddie Vedder of Peal Jam jammed it in with a high score by contributing a nicely-tuned thematic musical score for what \"Into The Wild\" entails. However, it was the Pennmanship of Writer-Director Sean Penn that revitalized Christopher McCandless incredible journey into cinematic reality! I hope I got you into the mood to go \"Into The Wild\". ***** Excellent"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed both the book and the film \"Into The Wild.\" Chris has turned into a polarizing character - I am confused by both ends of the spectrum. I am most confused by those who hate him. I mean, they really HATE him and why is that? They call him selfish and arrogant and they say he deserved what he got. I am appalled by that sentiment. My first question is: Do you know any kid at 22, 23, 24 who ISN'T selfish and arrogant to some extent? It's called growing up. I just don't have the energy to have such intense hatred about a person I've never met, and whose actions (selfish and arrogant or not) did not effect me in any way.\n\nBut I digress - what I really want to say is that Hal Holbrook's performance moved me in a very deep way. I have seen the movie twice and both times I wept for long after Holbrook has left the screen. He just absolutely NAILS Ron Franz's affection for Chris, and Franz's loneliness, in such a profound manner. I was recently retelling Chris's story to my parents, and when I got to the part where Ron and Chris part ways I broke into sobs again. Something about it just really touches me, and I think a lot of that has to do with Holbrook's performance. It is a beautiful thing and worth everyone's time."

Christopher McCandless, the main character, leaves everything behind but what he can carry and embarks on a journey across America that takes him to the wilds of Alaska. His journey is as much spiritual as physical. You could well take any single frame of this movie and hang it as a prized photograph on your wall.

The movie is so human-centric, so value-centric, it touches you right on your innermost conscience. I salute Sean & John for giving me not only a wonderful masterpiece, but also for giving me a lesson in life! Although this movie deserves all the accolades, but anticipating that in itself will be a dishonor to the movie. Its beyond awards, and all the materialistic notion that world has set as a yardstick to measure the merit of a movie. Its to be felt, deep within.\n\nIf every person imbibes little bit of Chris in themselves, the world will be a much better place. The fact that its a true story (which I didn't know until I saw it), affects you even more. It sure does make you more aware of the nature and people around you.\n\nI am most certainly going to watch the movie again. We all have a lot to learn from Chris' experience with life, nature, people! Wish the film has a positive impact on every person's life.

The movie hints at this motivation, but it remains somewhat unclear to the audience, as it would be to anyone as I'm sure it was to the man himself. Upon speculation some conclusions can be drawn, such as; the need to prove himself and make himself a better man (if he can survive with nothing in the wild he can survive anywhere), soul searching for happiness, perhaps running from something such as family problems (and probably something undocumented and unknown to anyone), the adventure and experience.\n\nCritics may claim, with some merit, that this is just a spoiled selfish young man. Why care for someone like this who hurts his family and loved ones for some egotistical meanderings. However aren't faulty characters the truest expression of humanity? Can't we see reflections of this person in others and even ourselves to some degree? The character is clearly seeking out something Grandiose, something bigger than family, friends and human interaction, some all encompassing meaning of life. As opposed to other movies seemingly attempting to satiate our appetites for these grandiose answers but just wets our appetite by feeding us vague tastes at meanings in order to purposely make us ponder, this movie satisfyingly portrays the young man's and story's subjective belief of an answer, leaving the audience fulfilled. The ending is very fulfilling as the young man attains his Wisdom.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful containing many shots of the most beautiful, alien landscapes I know of in the World, the West. The movie was a little slow and dragged. It was very poignant for better or for worse.\n\nI think this young man's quest is something we can all admire and make a part of ourselves in a lesser degree."

This put Emile on top as an actor, and this movie really left me speechless. this deserved best picture at the academy's by far. My comments are endless on how brilliant Sean Penn filmed this movie. this movie is a must see and must have. i absolutely love this movie\n\nif you haven't seen this yet, then you are missing one great movie and experience. it will make you look at life in a totally different way.\n\nalso, if you are a Thoreau lover, then WATCH THIS"

        "review_title": "Like Grizzly Man in his naive love of wildness",
        "review_detailed_main": "A disturbingly interesting film directed by Sean Penn, and very true to the original book. We all can relate to the true story lead character Chris McCandless(he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp for his sojourns), innocent, naive and youthfully stupid as we all were at that age, expecting the whole world and it's peoples to be our friend and nurturer and helpfully allow us to create a personal Utopia. Sadly, when we finally grow up, we see life doesn't turn out that way. It's filled with a lot of hard work and compromises, which we start to see realistically somewhere in our mid-20's or so. Alex didn't get old enough to see that truth, as he and Grizzly Man met the same fate due to poor judgement coming from just being young and dumb, and not seeing that their youthful utopian world view must be adjusted, compromised and modified greatly in order to live successfully later on in this world. Even most 60's hippies(the smart ones) who did the same vagabond thing saw that eventually. It seems to be human nature for the young to never seem to gain much insight from the previous generation's experiences even though they are basically very similar down through the ages.\n\nJust like those 60's hippies, Alex hit the road as a vagabond and fell into many interesting adventures with oddball characters along the way. The story had all the usual trite causative and motivational bells and whistles behind it....bad parents(bad I guess because they were rich and successful)who did fight a lot, a cloyingly close sister(Hmmmm)who narrated the story, a liberal college degree, and no money problems at all growing up that may have protected him from the more practical world and life views of the less fortunate.\n\nThus the eventual Supertramp wanderer developed a serious hate of our capitalistic system(anything better out there?), and decided to live his life as a road tramp, working temp only when he needed the hated dollar in order to live and travel, and eventually get enough savvy and $$$ to get to Alaska where all the best things in life resided(in his mind)........beautiful scenery, wilderness, living off the land, no people, no need for money.........but also, 45 below zero winters, little natural food, no sufficient shelter(an old, uninsulated school bus in the middle of nowhere?), no one to talk to or love(he seemed asexual anyway), flooded rivers hemming him in so he couldn't go anywhere else much of the time. As he went to Alaska mostly unprepared for anything bad that could happen, it's too bad Chris didn't see a film like this one to discourage him before he went there and paid for for it with his life.\n\nEmile Hirsch did a great job in the role of Supertramp, as he had the air of innocent confidence that Chris obviously had in order to undertake such a journey. Also, great road characters abounded in the film story, with Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook showing off as, respectively, a funny and sympathetic South Dakota farmer... a loving, aging hippie vagabond and flea market rat.... and an old desert-rat retiree who developed intense fatherly feelings for Chris and knew that Chris was headed for a bad ending. All helped and cared for Chris along the way as he prepared for his great and final Alaska adventure. The film had many beautiful scenes throughout of skies, deserts, rivers, mountains, tundra and ......of course......beautiful, but deadly Alaska for the unprepared.\n\nI read the book so I knew the ending..... and just as in Grizzly Man, a lot of naive and emotionally-driven mistakes can get you killed, even if they seemed good at the time. Penn showed all of this well in his film and I recommend it, but don't go if you want a feel-good Hollywood ending, as it definitely does not have it."

The travel of the main character is not that interesting and sone relationships with other secondary characters may be explored more. It seemed like no one really tried to convince christopher that he was wrong, only Ron suggested a different point of view but the conversation ended immediately with a laugh. At the beginning the movie talked too much about our economy and the value of money but luckily the focus shifted on the externalities that our actions have on the world that surround us.\n\nCan't give more than 7 because it is not as profound and entertaining to deserve an 8, but it is a full 7 (also a 7.8 if I could have used decimals)"

He gives away most of his belongings (including a sizable cash inheritance),takes up a backpack & takes to the open road to find himself. Along the way,he meets up with a variety of people (some good,others not so good,and some really bad). Does he find his proverbial nirvana? Well,you'll just have to see it to find out for yourself. The photography is a treat for the eye. The film is a bit long (140 minutes),but don't let that throw you. Even if this film doesn't merit so much as one Oscar, it's still well worth checking out."

So I would personally prefer the movie without all that popular psychology and put some more emphasis on his unique and special personality, that is an extraordinary sensitiveness combined with a beautiful and idealistic mind."

Hitch-hiking across the USA he eventually makes it to Alaska where he lives for some time longer.\n\nBased on the life of a real man this film tells a story that is already known by many. I haven't read the book it is based on, so I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not. The events depicted are clear enough though. On his way through life the main person is changed by the people he meets and the things he gets to do - and in many cases he changes whoever he runs in to. And as his tale grows longer his life becomes more complex and he becomes less of the person he was when he left his city.\n\nAs a film it was for me a combination of TV episodes of Jacques Cousteau, and a lot of elements from The Straight Story. Apart from the fact that this film is a dramatized version of reality it never raises far above the level of a \"good\" film. It is good, but not great. The main reason behind that being the way it distracts at some points from the real center of the film - the guy that makes the trip. I can't put a more solid finger on it, but at some points it just shies away from the main subject too much.\n\n8 out of 10 miles hiked"

McCandless an idealist because of necessity, not choice---because of family background. Very brave individual but as intelligent as he was in real life, he did not research or plan for Alaska thoroughly enough. McCandless searching and found the answer to happiness (you'll find out in movie) and wrote it in his log, after it was too late to escape wilderness.\n\nAcademy award nominations for Hirsch, Holbrook (supporting) and Penn (screenplay.) Hirsch very good choice for lead----his own youth and on-screen, wide-eyed innocence added much to the movie! Holbrook's age, experience and acting ability made the scenes he and Hirsch shared memorable. I did not read the book prior to the movie but will.\n\nNote: Sad point not addressed in movie is the fact that McCandless could have escaped over \"the river\" by simply walking 1/4 mile south of where he crossed in the beginning by using built-in cable cross!!!!! Don't know why Penn did not address that in movie. It would have had a great impact. Otherwise, very moving---tears in audience. Movie a reflection of true life----goodness and purity of heart means nothing when it comes to survival, especially survival of the fittest. Reflect and learn."

I have a lot of free time at work (ha!) so I decided to watch it. It didn't move me much. People seems to see here the realization of their own secret desires and dreams. I only see a young fellow who decides to escape his problems and, simply, be selfish. There's a trend: a \"normal\" person watches a film about a \"free spirit\" doing what he wants to do and the viewer believes that the story is great, regardless how easy it is to actually do what you want, to be who you want to be. The only problem is that it's even easier to follow society's rules and simply being frustrated and emotionally castrated. Sorry about the Freudian analysis. However, it's impossible to properly review this tile (any title?) without understanding why anybody would find it attractive. This is the story of a scared boy who chooses to run away from his social responsibilities. As simply as that. If people find this brilliant because they cannot do it themselves, fair enough. I won't base a criticism on my personal failures though. There's no real morality here, no big teaching, only common sense. That might be already too much for most of the people I guess, alright. Anyway, that's how it is. Beautiful photography nevertheless. Alas, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in this film and, honestly, couldn't care less if it's based on a true story. I can understand why this movie is so loved. And also why it's overrated. It's somehow easy to please the masses and \"alternative\" people unable to jump the gap between what they want to be and really are."

Tom Cruise may be completely insane and his constant pushing of his Scientology agenda can be excruciating, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a fantastic actor and that I won't watch and enjoy hi s movies. So Sean Penn may be sociopathic, and he may push his political agendas too strong, but he's also one of this generation's most intense and talented actors. I haven't seen The Crossing Guard, but Into the Wild certainly proves that Penn is an almost equally talented filmmaker as well.\n\nSurprisingly, Penn employs many unorthodox filming techniques and gimmicks characteristic of the much younger post-modern film-making generation of today. From shaky zooms to really creative use of camera angles and positions to jump- and flash-cuts to text scrawling across the screen. Notice how effectively Penn uses cheap-looking video footage to portray Christopher's brief fantasy sequence involving him reuniting with his parents, or Penn's shocking and very risky use of breaking the fourth wall. It is a kind of wild, loose and visceral style of film-making that is used skillfully to portray that kind of no-strings-attached wilderness that the film portrays in the first place.\n\nPenn smartly chooses to employ these elements, as they are exactly what his sprawling, epic, lengthy creation needs for variety and to keep his audience captivated. He certainly provides us with a lot to work with \u0096 his film is even divided into chapters, like a novel and less like a short and to-the-point story. The story of Christopher McCandless is one of epic proportions: encompassing two I'd imagine very eventful years, even after selecting a common theme to focus on Penn ends up with a movie scraping at a two-and-a-half hour runtime. But while the crux and initiative of the film is the true story of McCandless' fascinating and unbelievable ascent (or descent?) into spiritual freedom by ridding himself of his money and possessions and eventually launching himself into the wild to live completely off of the land, Penn instead chooses to keep the focus on very particular aspects of Christopher's journey, specifically his relations with other people.\n\nIndeed the only chapter depicting Christopher completely alone is the final part of his journey on the \"Magic Bus\" in the Alaskan wilderness, which Penn splices and intercuts with the chronological series of events that unfolds. The rest of the chapters depict Christopher's encounters with various people and characters along his journey, and although the chapters are named aptly emphasizing the change Christopher undergoes with these encounters, the main feeling we get is just how much Christopher leaves his mark on these people, and not the other way around. He helps mend the hippie couple's love life, he finds a new friend in Wayne, and finally he gives both the optimistically young Tracy and the near-the-end old Ron Franz something to hope for. Even Christopher's parents are drawn closer together by his leaving them behind. What's wonderful is that while Christopher's hokey material-free philosophy may seem immature, na\u00efve and perhaps a bit self-destructive, it is in these scenes where he encounters the various characters along the way that we can see his true selflessness, and it is awe-inspiring. The fact that Christopher's epiphany in his dying moments is that \"happiness isn't real unless shared\" just further goes to prove just what a lasting impression these encounters and relationships with various other people are what kept him going.\n\nOn a more superficial plane, Penn, perhaps employing the immense clout he has around Tinseltown, has assembled an impressive ensemble cast to fill these small supporting roles of the characters Christopher encounters along his journey. From absolutely devastating performances by Oscar winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as Christopher's worried but suffocating parents to intelligent turns from the likes of Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener, who plays a surprisingly sweet and happy-go-lucky character similar to the one she portrayed in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and which serves as a total opposite to the kind of manipulative femme fatales she usually plays, like her Oscar-nominated turn in Being John Malkovich. Kristen Stewart plays young, na\u00efve and desperate to its fullest extent, and Hal Holbrook gives the opus performance near the end of the film, providing it with a very important emotional axis. But the centerpiece performance is that of Emile Hirsch; embodying McCandless, he manages to perfectly capture his youthful wonder and perhaps even naivety and delivers a performance of immense power and intensity, including startling and gutsy physical transformations surprising for an actor so young. Indeed it seems like just yesterday that Hirsch was underage and starring in teen comedies like The Girl Next Door: I think it's safe to say that not only is Into the Wild Hirsch's unofficial transition to acting maturity, but also that it proves he is one incredibly talented performer.\n\nIn all, Into the Wild is a long, difficult but ultimately very satisfying and captivating journey. Penn takes us down a long road and populates it with interesting characters and unique, unorthodox film-making techniques. And it's all accompanied by a great soundtrack including wonderful songs by Eddie Vedder that perfectly capture the spirit of the film. It is a unique film that takes many risks, and it all pays off wonderfully. Penn has more than proved his directorial worth."

        "review_detailed_main": "A tale of self-discovery and caution. Life is a hard hand. Life is a forced hand. And more often than not, we are dealt cards that don't make sense to us. Such was the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless. His soul, that of an adventurer, had never belonged to the world he'd grown up in. And so, as the cage opened, the bird flew away. It's only mistake? It had never known the nuances of flying.\n\nThere's a limit to everything. Freedom, adventure and even extremism. And the story of McCandless, or Alexander Supertramp as he called himself, is a reminder to all of us that too much of anything, is really bad.\n\nWonderful settings, a fine account of the wilderness and of different exotic pocket worlds that exist independent of the conventions of our society, make this a fine picaresque tale. On the negative aspects, the movie is perhaps, on the whole, a little vague and the exact evolutions within McCandless are difficult to discern."

        "review_detailed_main": "As far as I can see, this movie was and is pandering to people with their heads in the clouds, who will think movie is great, and that Christopher McCandless is some sort of idealized, wilderness casualty. Christopher was a bad planner, a bad organizer, a bad hunter, and a really bad navigator. I almost believe he had a suicide mission, (which later I believe he changed his mind about, but it simply was too late, and he knew this fact with desperation), doing this trip without any of the things he needed. Christopher was educated, smart, so there is no excuse for his actions concerning this venture of his into the wilderness. Delirious starvation, led to not finding a river crossing. Bad circumstances made food in cabins nearby not edible. One of his last entries in his diary made it clear he was afraid to die, to die alone, and that he was desperate to live, but hopeless at the same time. He should have had a compass in his travels, but he did not have one at the time of his death in his possession, which does puzzle me. People will always go where angels fear to tread. One can only hope other people won't make bad decisions to go on trips unprepared, but some people always will, so one can only hope the best for those people, and hope no one follows their footsteps to their death also."

The main plot is for me actually the second one. All the time during watching the movie I had been rather thinking of the parents role and what had to happen in their live to be as they were in the movie. Is it really a doom and destiny of many people not to be happy after years of being together or you always have a choice? I think the movie forces to re-think you life, hopefully beforehand. .. and the Edi's soundtrack.. breathless.. A must see (!) for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a well-written tale which is a poignant and moving character study. It may not appeal to all fans of the survival genre but it is still an amazing movie which is an emotional ride.\n\nGraduated student Christopher McCandless donates all of his money to charity and begins to set out to live in the Alaskan wild. Along the way, he meets a series of people who change his life.\n\nIts story is very deep. It's a story of following a path that you choose for yourself. I always like it when movie's have deep plots which make you think. Christopher says that he feels career's are a 20th-century invention and he wants no part of that and I sort of agree with him. Its story is really important because it revolves around and talks about the opinion that many people have.\n\nThe acting is great from Emile Hirsch. Many of the other actors give superb roles as well. There weren't any actors who gave performances I had an issue with.\n\nI don't think it's flawless though. There were very few scenes of survival in this film. I likely would've enjoyed the movie more had it consisted of something like 50% survival scenes and 50% flashbacks. However, what we got instead was about 85%-90% flashbacks. Also, the film dragged a little.\n\nAlso, on a side note, I recommend you don't read the critic reviews because many of them contain spoilers. I usually trust the critics, but in this case, I'd say ignore them and read them after you watch the movie.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a great character study which contains great lessons and it may affect you greatly depending on what you believe. It could've been better, but it's still a good film."

I work in the second smallest store in Western Canada and we only have 30 copies of this movie for customers. Now after watching the film I wish we had a lot more. This is a very nicely shot movie with beautiful scenic shots. I am not a big Sean Penn fan but I thought he played a good role. Vince Vaughn is also in this for a short time and was also was very good as I enjoy his acting. Being a musician myself and a huge fan of Pearl Jam I loved the Eddie Vedder acoustic tracks in the movie. Great music selection in this film with other folk driven music as well. Very sad story which apparently is true. I just thought the narration was a little cheese but at the end when it says that the sister took care of his remains that struck a chord with me. I also loved how this film had a total hippie vibe to it. I loved Rainy and Jan and the nudist hippie's at the end are funny when the old guy is like \"How can you live beside those dope smokin' hippie's\" and Sean Penn says \"Well, they just keep to themselves\". Very Good Film. I'm glad I finally watched it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must say that \"Into the Wild\" is a great movie one of the most touching and inspirational films in a long time that will touch your heart and emotions. The film is done in such a beautiful manner for the way it shows how journey and nature spellbinds and becomes amazingly personal to a young man in search of escape and discovery of happiness. \"Into the Wild\" is inspired by a true story and the screenplay and directing both was brilliantly done by acting veteran Sean Penn, though it may seem long and drawn out to some the film moves at a pace that travels you along for the right amount of time for each adventure and discovery and the meetings of new people that this young man encounters.\n\nSet in 1990 after graduation from college straight A student Chris McCandless(Emile Hirsch)decides finally he must abandon his life of spoiled privilege and comfort from his wealthy and sheltered parents Billie(Marcia Gay Harden)and Walt(William Hurt)by making a cross country journey to discover freedom of life on the road that's full of adventures, rejecting reason, and meeting new people and most of all having new joys and being happy. All along the main goal of Chris is to reach and settle down in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way this film is told stirring and steady by the use of flashbacks and told by the narration of his sister Carine. Along the way the fun and enjoyment of natures beauty which was inspired to Chris by reading the works of Jack London fails in comparison to his meeting of new people and friends. Catherine Keener gives a good turn as a likable hippie and biker type gal Jan, and Vince Vaughn is a treat as Wayne the hard working common man farmer in South Dakota. Last but not least the most important encounter for Chris is in the California dessert community when he encounters wisdom and learns faith from an old man Ron Franz(Hal Holbrook is terrific here). Proving most of all that life is about new people, discoveries and learning to be happy and feeling good about sharing.\n\nWhen the journey finally ends and he deceases in the Alaskan wilderness in August of 1992 this young man had seen the light of life and learned faith and wisdom while he rejected phony reasons and the hidden lies of his family life. Overall \"Into the Wild\" is a very touching and moving film a great viewing to uplift your spirits and have you feeling the need for your own personal journey to discover new people and to find happiness. The pacing and direction of the film is top notch from Penn while the scenes of Hirsch and Holbrook together are touching and wonderfully emotional. Again this film proves happiness is best when shared it's a must view one of the best movies made in a long time."

He rejects material possessions and loves the life he is leading, but makes a key error in judgment. He claims to have had a good life, so all in all, the film cannot be looked at as a tragedy."

I was invested in was the personal journey: people met incidentally, experiences endured, and the culmination of someone living a life by their own hand.\n\nAs true stories go, it's an understated tale - one man going it alone, hitchhiking and traipsing across North America. It taps into a thought that has crossed every person's mind at some point, considering how they'd fare if they did abandon everything they consider regular.\n\nThroughout this journey, all the vistas of America's varied tapestry is on full display, from the immaculate snows of the Yukon to the desolate desert bowls of Mexico, but I don't know if they were employed to their fullest potentials.\n\nIt is, at its heart, a human story. Christopher (supposedly) wants to escape the rat race, disillusioned by his parents' over reliance on materialism and emotional restraint. I do, however, take fault with the very forced human interactions that were probably few and far between, particularly a romantically-inclined side arc that felt pretty obtuse.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" is a narrative on inner conflict. McCandless seeks solitude, but loves to help everyone he meets.\n\nBy the finish, I was more sympathetic that this was probably someone who felt deep abandonment, and succumbed to an interminable desire to disappear."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I begin let me just state that this film is based on a true story so I will mention the outcome of the film. If you know the story you will know the outcome and if you don't maybe you should stop reading, although I'm sure the outcome is pretty obvious.\n\nChris McCandless (Hirsch) is a young man who has just graduated from college and has the opportunity to move on to Harvard Law School, something his parents are extremely happy about. His parents seem to be of the pushy kind and the sort that believe that a career and money is worth more than humanity itself. It is shown that Chris has been lead down this path when he has dinner with his parents and he tells them he has twenty four thousand dollars saved up. His parents then go on to offer him a car but Chris' reaction to this, in that he rejects it outright, shows that he is a boy who wants to do it all on his own, so much so that once his parents leave him that is exactly what he does. He donates all his money to charity, chops his credit cards and ID, and burns any leftover cash in his pocket. He then climbs into his car and drives west as far as he can, before being wiped out by a flash flood. At this he sets out on foot in an attempt to realise a sudden dream; fleeing to Alaska and living in the solitary wild.\n\nThe film begins with Chris already having achieved his goal; he stumbles across an old bus in the middle of the forest and uses it as his home, he hunts for deer as food and ensures that the bus is in a good liveable condition. We then flashback to the beginning from when he set off to each character he encounters on his journey. All of this is intertwined with the present moment of him in the forest. Along his journey he meets hippies, farmers, travellers and a lonely old man who each give him something valuable for when he is on his own, be it an item or information. All believe that his dream is crazy and their gifts come with warnings. At the end each gift and each warning have a huge part to play.\n\nThe film does jump in the timeline. We see him meet a character, they give him his need, and then we move forward to the present and see him taking on this advice or trying to avoid their warning. The flashbacks build towards a happy dream that he is close to completing, and the present scenes in the forest show his depletion towards death. This man learns a valuable lesson of life as it drifts away from him.\n\nThis is the sort of film that I find frustrating; one because it is something I would like to do, I couldn't think of nothing better than getting up and heading across the country and winging it. On the other hand I couldn't stand it when he clearly begins to struggle but is too stubborn to head out of the wilderness and find a way to his parents who would happily pay for him to get home. This probably frustrated me more as I couldn't understand why he was doing this too himself. I really enjoyed the idea of his journey but he seems to be on a suicide mission.\n\nChris is not a likable character. I hate to say it as he technically was a real person, but he was selfish and willing to hurt anyone who got in his way. It is as if he gets him comeuppance at the end for following a stupid dream. The characters he meet all tell him this and all show good reason for him to stay with them but he won't. He has this idea that he will only be happy if he is alone. This is shown in a heart warming scene towards the end when he meets a lonely old man who sees him as a grandson, but Chris treads all over him and leaves him in tears. This was a huge problem for me in this film, I really disliked the character.\n\nThat is not to say that the acting by Hirsch wasn't good because he was great in the role. He showed his selfish, stubborn side at the same time as being likable to the people on first impression. He also lost a lot of weight to portray the role which deserves a round of applause. There is also a great turn from Hal Holbrook who plays the old man, Ron. There one final scene really is touching.\n\nThere wasn't enough in this film for me to say it is brilliant. Too much of it frustrated me and I didn't like the lead character. Some of the scenes seemed pointless which meant the overly long running time could have been slashed. It looks great and there are some truly touching moments, however it isn't enough to make me think it is a great film. It is simply about an arrogant, selfish boy attempting to flee his parents but all he really is becoming is just like them, bringing him to a worse off conclusion.\n\n3 / 5\n\nFor more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked the movie, not for the way the protagonist (Chris McCandless) lived his life but for the great lessons presented to us during the course of the movie. There might be different ways for different people to live their lives but movie showed what everyone should be looking for in their lives. I would like to mention a few lessons which I personally liked in the movie:\n\n1. Set yourself free to explore what the soul inside us wants to and not just succumb to a life of security.\n\nWhen Chirs McCandless says: \".. so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.\" \n\nTaken from song Society by Eddie Vedder from the movie: \"It's a mystery to me .. We have a greed with which we have agreed And you think you have to want more than you need Until you have it all you won't be free.\"\n\n2. Never let your mistakes be a reason to be not able to do better in future. Instead we should use the learning from the mistakes to do much better.\n\nTaken from Song Rise by Eddie Vedder: \"Gonna rise up Turning mistakes into gold\"\n\nAs for the way Chris McCandless lived his life, I just have to say this was the way he wanted to live. A different person might have done different things in the same situation but the heart of the movie lied in its teachings which I can sum up as \"One should learn, struggle, pursue his dreams during his life and do whatever it takes to find and fulfill the purpose of his life.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly I note that in this year of 2021 Hal Holbrook (Mr Franz) passed away at the age of 95. He was 82 while filming Into The Wild, and became the oldest male performer ever nominated for an Academy Award for his very touching role in the movie. Whilst the movie seems so much about Christopher McCandless who is in almost every scene, I sense this movie is as much about the other people we encounter along the way. Sean Penn does a fine job of showing that these people are also on their journeys, as indeed we the viewers are too. I have to give a ten as I believe it achieves everything it could have done. (Though I must say I didn't warm to the soundtrack of Vedder's song, but maybe that's just me)."

He's still a better actor.\n\nThis is the best role of Emil Hirsch, because the world was lucky and this mediocrity did not play much anywhere in his career.\n\nThere are a lot of meanings in the film, but either I'm not 14 anymore to think like the main character, or I'm not 60 yet to think like grandpa, who appears at the end of the film.\n\nThe ending is a liquid slush, but the film is biographical, so there's nowhere to go.\n\nSo-so."

        "review_title": "\"He's leaving home, bye, bye\".....the quest for IT....",
        "review_detailed_main": "ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac was published 50 years before this film came out. And then there was Voltaire's CANDIDE. Can the Enlightenment be so very far away? A lot of people get irritated with Holden Caufield when they read CATCHER IN THE RYE. A lot of people react the same way when they encounter Christopher McCandless and they WILL encounter his persona on screen for years to come, thanks to Sean Penn. Why this irritation? It's like asking why the squares got irritated with the gatherings of gentle people at Monterey Pop during that \"Summer of Love\" in 1967 Frisco : in essence, people like Christopher McCandless remind them of their own \"lives of quiet desperation\" of what 60s freaks called, \"the death culture\".\n\nChristopher McCandless is a well read guy. He pulls out his Jack London and Leo Tolstoy in order to be closer, to relax with his friends. He's had it with what Holden Caufield called,\"phonies\" and these include his lying parents. Generation gap redux, mai oui.\n\nChristopher McCandless wants to discover Truth. And to do this, he ventures out \"on the road\" as Dean Moriarity and Sal Paradise did in 1947, hitching and driving and being driven all over America and even down to Mexico, just as Sal and Dean did. And just as Dean and Sal were, Christopher McCandless is searching for IT.\n\nBut what is IT?\n\nChristopher McCandless only knows that IT isn't the narrow materialistic individualism of his parents or of people like them. He fervently believes in a \"spiritual\" path which might lead one to IT, but first he must divest himself of crass materialism-- most worldly goods . For, unlike the rich man/camel who cannot pass through the eye of a needle, Christopher McCandless will make it into his heaven because he refuses excess material. He believes in his vow of poverty. So did the Buddah and a thousand Beats and Hippies. He believes that he must make contact with the \"spiritual\" truth by living simply, living like a character out of one of Jack London's adventurous Alaskan adventures. It is a call of the wild which draws him, north, ever north to the Alaska outback. There, he reads Tolstoy's words on how to achieve happiness through simple living and he takes that advice on, living in his own \"Magic Bus\"...oh shades of Kesey may your spirit live on.\n\nIs it true? Can one find \"spiritual\" fulfillment this way? Perhaps. Especially, if one is inclined to try to find it standing on its head, as the priest in \"The Black Robe\" did in his 17th Century Canadian wilderness trek amongst the native heathen. Religious quests are almost always filled with suffering. Is this not why we were placed on this Earth, like so many chess pieces for the amusement of our Lard.\n\nBut, in material reality what hath Penn wrought? This is a lad with all the right instincts for freedom, still tied in knots with philosophical Idealism. He's trying to kick out the jams; but he doesn't realize that heading down the path of material deprivation will not get him home--free. As a result of his \"true believer\" mentality, poor Christopher McCandless doesn't recognize his real happiness when it stares him, lovingly in his face. Ah sweet Tracy... He sees the poverty of a future of dead time in the suburbs and he rejects it. Good move, Chris. This rejection makes a lot of the one-dimensional individuals hate him, especially when his disdain is magnified on the silver screen. He sees the wisdom of NOT \"taking more than you can use\" from the Earth, a fact that is brought home hard for him when he shoots a moose, he cannot possibly consume. Hooray for Christopher McCandless there!\n\nChristopher McCandless made some discoveries. Like Candide, Sal Paradise, Holden Caufield and the people of his own parents' generation, especially ones who can be seen on in docos like \"Monterey Pop\", he did glimpse IT here and there, only to lose it in the end. For it is in the social relations of friendship and love, all of which he leaves behind in order to live on his own, in a vain attempt to depend only his own, narrow individualism to find \"the truth\". The ghost of Dean Moriarity, walking down those railroad tracks in Mexico...yes, Dean More-E-air-IT-tee."

The randomly placed narrations by Jena Malone were laughable. The storyline is so bland that I felt like I ordered a sand smoothie at the concessions stand. After you see this film (if you can call it that) you have an insight into the spoiled kid mentality. Written by a privileged male who obviously yearned for a challenge, an adventure, something other than their actual drab, guided existence. The problem, though, is that this story is told as if it was a campfire tale. Complete with embellishments and drama to the point of being unbelievable and humorous. Like I said I walked out of the theater. I wish I had asked for a refund. Sean Penn owes me $16.00!"

He just shows his fascination, hurt or frustration through his eyes. As a big fan of the book I can honestly say that this film adaption is just so well done in all aspects, you really get a feel for what Chris McCandless was trying to accomplish (?) by abandoning his life of luxury and privilege and shunning society on his quest to live off the land in Alaska.\n\nI really enjoyed all the characters he met along the way (Hal Holbrook, Kristen Stewart, the hippie couple, Vince Vaughn) and all the amazing scenery. Eddie Vedder's original soundtrack is just awesome too.\n\nUltimately this is heartbreaking and frustrating and beautiful. 10.13"

        "review_detailed_main": "Re-Watched 'Into the Wild' today. I last saw it upon its release back in 2007 when I was finishing my masters and stuck in a job I pretended to like, and a persona I pretended to be. I saw it with an old friend, whom due to my fault, I lost contact with many years ago. But to get back to this film, the gravity of this personal story and its truthful nature to the person it was based on goes to the very essence of humanity and how powerful our need is to find ourselves within each other, even when we do our best to escape one-another. Particularly at this moment in time, when we are asked to be apart from one-another, the truth is we can dive in to the deepest voids or climb up to the highest peaks, but at the end of every sunset and beginning of ever sunrise, true happiness is our ability to share our experiences with one another in person. Whilst social media provides us with an instant means to share our experiences and virtually connect with each other, for many of us it is a convenient illusion of choice, which the character in this film ironically did not face in 1992, when he made his fateful journey into the wild. Like the character in 'The Alchemist', he ventures to find his personal treasure, and on the way he learns truths that compliment and challenge his ideals. A story I have come across so often in fiction and reality that this film captures so well in a person who dared to live it. If you haven't seen this film, I heartily recommend you do, it reaffirms ones faith in humanity, in being present, in forgiveness..."

        "review_detailed_main": "On August 18 1992, Chris McCandless died in the Alaskan wilderness and his body was discovered a month later. He was a 24 year old guy who was born in California and who ended up graduating high school in Virginia and then went to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a guy who eventually went to Arizona and South Dakota getting rides by hitchhiking, living only off the land and working only small jobs or no jobs at all. He then goes off to Alaska in the very harsh, cold wilderness and seemingly very unprepared for the journey.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting death stories around and it is still filled with many unanswered questions. The story was later made into a non-fiction book Into the Wild in 1997 written by Jon Krakauer which later turned into a best seller. The film adaption came later in 2007.\n\nA film adaption of this story to me would seem risky. It is a story based on thought and emotion and learning how to live out in the wilderness. He might have a fine acting career but it is little funny to see that Sean Penn directed this. Even more, Chris McCandless is more a mystery character to portray because we really never got many answers about him.\n\nWell Into the Wild is full of ups and downs but it comes out well in the end.\n\nI give credit to Sean Penn who picks the right Christopher McCandless in Emile Hirsch. Hirsch is an actor who can deliver all the emotions that this character needs to bring to the story. McCandless is hard to root for but at the same time, you should be interested in the character because he is like no other. Kristen Stewart plays Tracy Taro as a love interest who is ultimately rushed here and hers is a character you wished saw more of. Hal Holbrook plays Ron Frantz, an older generation guy who picks up Chris as a hitchhiker and forms a very strong bond with him. Even Vice Vaughn shows up as Wayne Westerberg, McCanndless' best friend in North Dakota. The cast is filled with old stars, current stars and unknown stars at the time but ultimately all play good characters.\n\nAlong the way, this is a film that works on atmosphere. From the seeing California nudists in the valley, to watching McCandless canyoning up the Arizona channel and to the Alaskan wilderness, culture shock comes into play here and that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nI don't see Into the Wild as high re-watch film because of it's sad subject matter. Still though, this works for fans of the book and also for people that didn't read the book for that matter. It is another way to look into one of the most interesting stories around."
