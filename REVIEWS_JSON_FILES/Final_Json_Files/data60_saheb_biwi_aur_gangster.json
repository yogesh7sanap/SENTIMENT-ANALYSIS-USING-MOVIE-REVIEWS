Mahi Gill with her sex appeal, Randeep Hooda's role as a young gangster, and Jimmy Shergil's charm as a Nawab are great. The movie is based in a village in Uttar Pradesh, where Raja families are losing their status in today's politics. The Nawab lives in a ancestral haveli with his rani. He is short on financial terms. Other powers(gangsters) are also rising in the area. Babloo(Randeep Hooda) is a young gangster. The story revolving around these characters, is an enthralling ride of love making and local politics. Acting is what makes this movie so irresistible. A must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw the trailers of the movie, I thought it to be a soft porn movie. But, wanted to watch it still because Jimmy Shergill is always a delight to watch, and because it was a Tigmanshu Dhulia movie.\n\nTrust me it is not a soft porn movie, all the intimate scenes are very tastefully done. Doesn't seem like they were unnecessarily added to sell the movie.\n\nMahi Gill, Jimmy Shergill and Randeep Hooda have acted amazingly well. I would watch this movie again and again for their performances. Sanjay Chauhan and Tigmanshu Dhulia have done a great job with the script and direction.\n\nTo conclude, I would say its a must watch for all above 18 years of age. Its not a family movie.\n\nPlease please watch it for the performances."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie is a story about a Rajput who has Honor for him in the city but lacks wealth. He then goes for the resurrection of his position in the city. This movie was not as I expect it to be. There is no character development, the story movies in a linear fashion which sort of feels like a drag. But owing to its quirky dialogs and the love scenes, you wouldn't be bored. There is nothing much to say about the movie it does not give you enough which you could linger upon. The troubled relationship between the saheb and biwi is just apparent, nowhere would you feel the tension between the two except a kite scene but it is mediocre. It is just a random turn of events presented like a news report but infused with some good dialogs and romance. I missed this point completely, Deepika Shaw as the daughter of Kanhaiya does a good job in the limited time she gets on screen. I felt she is highly underrated in the Hindi film industry.All in all the actors have done a great job in this movie. Not the kind I would like but could be given a watch to for the actors in it."

Nowadays most of the movies lack culture, folk dances and real character interaction.\n\nThis movie was complete surprise to me in a good way. I love Indian villages, simple but strong characters. This movie is going to be one of the good movies on my list. Jimmy Shergill, Randeep Hooda and all other characters are strong and nice. The dialogs, sets are in touch with reality. I think all the Bollywood movie Producers and directors should take inspiration from this movie as well as the movie called Eklavya: the royal Guard.\n\nI would like to see more king,queen..princess stories like this. Pardon me if I am wrong in any way."
