        "review_detailed_main": "Last year's \"Pride\" brilliantly demonstrated how far gay rights have come in the UK in 30 years. Selma does an equally superb job in showing how far racial equality has come in the US in 50 years.\n\nThe year is 1964 and racial tension is rife in the Southern states, with attacks and murders of black citizens going unpunished by the combination of a white-majority policing and legal system. Enter Martin Luthor King (English actor David Oyelowo) at the point of receiving his Nobel Peace prize. King insists at a Presidential level (with Tom Wilkinson playing Lyndon Johnson) that black citizens be allowed unfettered rights to vote in elections, with the aim of securing a more just and balanced society. Looking for a suitable location to mount a media-led stand, in an age before social networking and 'Arab-Springs', King centres his attention on the Alabama town of Selma, mounting a series of non-violent (at least on their side) protests and marches. The local redneck police chief, Wilson Baker (David Dwyer), and the state governor, George Wallis (Tim Roth), are not going to stand for this and the tinder-box reaches ignition point during a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery.\n\nNominated for the Oscar for Best Picture (but only that in the major awards, so winning chances are probably near-zero), Selma is primarily an excellent example of an ensemble cast that works particularly well together. There are a wealth of outstanding performances: Tom Wilkinson's Lyndon Johnson comes across as a surprisingly sympathetic character (jerking me out of my natural Vietnam-coloured perception of the politician); Oprah Winfrey (also a co-producer) provides a text-book example of acting without acting, her expressions doing all of the work; Dylan Baker (so fantastic in \"The Good Wife\") is chillingly sinister as J. Edgar Hoover; English-born Carmen Ejogo plays (extremely well) a similar role to Sienna Miller's in \"American Sniper\" as the wife alienated by her husband's calling; and Giovanni Ribisi (\"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Friends\"), Cuba Gooding Jnr and (a bizarrely uncredited) Martin Sheen turn up in great cameo performances.\n\nBut towering over all of this great acting is Oyelowo's performance which is simply outstanding: every death and injury is etched on his face. This is a Martin Luthor King that you can really believe in. I would have personally bounced Bradley Cooper in the nomination list for him, and it is astonishing (given his English background) that he was also overlooked at the BAFTAs. He must be feeling pretty aggrieved right now. Mr Oyelowo \u2013 if you are reading this \u2013 this critic thanks you for an outstanding performance.\n\nAs a relative newcomer to direction, at least for a movie of this scale, Ava Duvernay does a great job with some of the action scenes (with particularly the shocking opening to the film showing enormous style). Paul Webb (apparently with this as a screen writing debut \u2013 \u2013 how on earth did he get THIS job?) does a creditable job, with lots of memorable sound-bites that stick in the mind. Where the film ran into soft mud for me however was in the personal scenes between the married couple: they don't really provide enough insight into the stresses of King's serial adultery, and the plotting becomes slow and dull\u0085. I personally lost interest in most of these scenes and was desperate for the film to get back to the 'action' in Selma.\n\nAlso of note is the end title song \u2013 \"Glory\" by John Legend and Common (who also stars in the film) \u2013 which is also nominated for an Oscar and won the Golden Globe.\n\nBoth gay rights and racial equality undoubtedly still have much further to go, but this does make you proud that as US and UK societies we have come so far within my own lifetime. A recommended watch, particularly for those with an interest in sociology and/or American history.\n\n(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

        "review_detailed_main": "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie.\n\nI loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum."

        "review_detailed_main": "The words I best describe this movie are \"profound\" and \"intense.\" From what I've learned since my school days, equal rights among race was a very touchy subject when it came to American history.\n\nDavid Oyelowo's portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. was so spot-on that I was immediately drawn in to see every detail of the film play out. I was disturbed and further curious at the same time amongst every scene that unfolded during the key moments of the film.\n\nBasically, it featured how much King sacrificed and went through in the 1960s to maintain blacks rights to vote and eliminate segregation from all states. I couldn't believe how much violent injustice and racial discrimination were used to intimidate innocent people who were trying to have the same rights like many in America.\n\nOprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr, and rapper-actor Common brought out great performances as the individuals who stood up for what they truly believe in and they wouldn't let hate stand in their way. Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson was rather physically uncanny and his scenes brought out the angst of what he had to face at a time when violence was further escalating during the Civil Rights Movement. Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace made me feel to hate the man for his segregationist beliefs, but when confronted by President Johnson himself, it just got real.\n\nThe juxtaposition of real-life archive footage in the movie gave a nice touch to how very genuine these people of Selma endured plenty of horrible confrontations. Whether these usually ended in violence or even death, they just kept growing in numbers and overcome all who stood against their true beliefs in racial equality.\n\nMy only nitpick was that of President Johnson's confrontations with Martin Luther King himself. I've learned in the history books that they've had their fair share of disagreements, but nothing this intense as shown on screen. Nevertheless, it proved that being an American President was no easy feat at a very difficult time. Overall, this is a film that didn't require lengthy (moving) MLK speeches, instead it focused on tense confrontations black people had to endure and how one individual stood tall and fought back not with violence, but with powerful words and strong beliefs. I applaud David Oyelowo and director Ava DuVernay for providing a glimpse into how racism was overcome by one profound man whose legacy still reverberates to this day."

        "review_detailed_main": "Film critic Richard Roeper said it best. Selma is a film that provides a history lesson, but doesn't feel like a history lecture. Not one bit.\n\nI foresee a bright future for the director Ava DuVernay and actor David Oyelowo. For DuVernay's second or third effort, it's quite an achievement what she manages to do with this film. For nearly fifteen years she's been working in studio marketing and publicity and her film speaks for itself. She directs the film with flare and keeps the film emotionally grounded. Even though at times you think you know whats coming, DuVernay keeps us at bay and also provides us with some neat surprises. Also give Paul Webb some credit with his sharp screenplay.\n\nDavid Oyelowo truly embodies MLK. More often than not Selma tends to focus on something not many people tend to expect in a movie about MLK. The script showcases his doubts and insecurities. Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and compelling performance. He also nails Dr. King's speech patterns, voice, even his posture and shows that Dr. King has his flaws, but is a compassionate person. I find it hard that anyone will be able to take their eyes off him. What a performance. Shame that it was overlooked by the Academy.\n\nEveryone in the cast brings their \"A-game.\" I liked Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, but I wanted just a little more of her character, but she makes up the most of what she has. Oprah Winfrey is solid as Annie Lee Cooper. She has a very substantial role and has a nice subplot. Other particular standouts are Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace.\n\nSelma takes itself very seriously, there isn't much humor to be found, and any break from documenting its events are often downbeat character moments. However DuVernay's talent is in full blaze. This film is very heavy, but it always grabs your attention, often in the hands of Oyelowo's performance. The March 7th, \"Bloody Sunday\" sequence is brutal to watch, but DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young achieve and deliver quite an intense and impactful set piece. Literally, it hits you in the gut as we watch history forged in flesh and blood.\n\nI am still shocked that this film received so little recognition by the Academy. Oyelowo and DuVernay should have been nominated at the very least. I believe you can blame that to Paramount Pictures as I heard that they did not deliver the screeners on time for the Academy voters. It's a pity.\n\nBy the time we arrive at the film's postscript, revealing the fates of several people chronicled by Selma, it's almost impossible not to be moved by their courage and sacrifice. Selma to me, is not just a biopic, but rather a film that celebrates a community action through the eyes of Martin Luther King Jr. This movie sadly, could not be more relevant right now.\n\n9.3/10"

The young man who plays Martin Luther King, Jr., does a decent job, but there is something lacking. When we hear speeches by King, there is a power to his delivery. Something is missing here. While a British actor plays King and he does great with a southern American, his delivery lacks the punch. What makes the movie worthwhile is the portrayal of the marches, all three of them. The first is so graphic in its violence as those marshals block the area on the other side of the bridge. Also missing is lively dialogue among the leaders of the movement. They are so stiff where they should be fighting among each other, expressing their fears and bringing us into the process. Lyndon Johnson is seen as the bad guy (along with, of course, George Wallace), but his portrayal is stilted. Where is that Texas accent. He is so impressed in our minds. There should be more bluster and casual dominance in this figure. While this is a decent rendering of a major event in the development of man's quest for freedom, it falls a bit flat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Historical dramatizations can be a tricky business, as delivering both truth and entertainment value is quite challenging. There is always an expert quick to point out any artistic license taken at the expense of historical accuracy. Of course, most movie lovers have come to accept that even the best-intentioned Hollywood looks at history will be at least as focused on selling tickets as educating the public. Because of this, the swirling controversies for this film are neither surprising nor overly distracting from its message.\n\nMarch 7, 1965 is known as Bloody Sunday and marks one of the most despicable moments in U.S. history. It was also a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and can be viewed as shrewd strategy from Martin Luther King, Jr. and his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The movie makes it clear that MLK had a full understanding that Selma, Alabama and it's racist, redneck Sheriff Jim Clark provided the perfect opportunity for a violent reaction to King's demonstrations and protests. It also makes it very clear that there was boundless ignorance, hatred and racism on the part of many southern whites. If the subject matter is somehow not enough to grab your attention, the startling event that occurs 5 minutes in will surely leave you shaken.\n\nThe film does an outstanding job of focusing on two pieces of this most complex puzzle: 1. the boots on the ground \u2013 the grass roots movement of the people, and 2. the ongoing political debates occurring between MLK and LBJ, between LBJ and his staff, and between MLK and his lieutenants.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act had already been passed, so the efforts were in hopes of overcoming the obstacles faced by southern blacks who wished to vote. One of the film's best scenes has activist Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) trying yet again to have her voter registration processed, but being rebuffed by a county clerk through an impossible Q&A session. These intimate moments are where the film excels: Coretta questioning MLK on his love for her, MLK speaking with grandfather of Jimmie Lee Jackson outside the morgue, and MLK turning down the proposal of US Attorney John Doar (Alessandro Nivola).\n\nIn an odd twist of casting, four of the leading characters are played by Brits: David Oyelowo as MLK, Tom Wilkinson as LBJ, Tim Roth as George Wallace and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. All four are excellent, but it's Mr. Roth as the racist-beyond-belief Alabama Governor Wallace that is the most slitheringly evil, while Mr. Oyelowo gives what can only be described as a towering performance of the man many of us know only from history books and news reels (and a January holiday).\n\nThe supporting cast is vast and talented, and because the story spends so much time on the individuals, many of these spend little time on screen. In addition to Andrew Young (Andre Holland), Reverend Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce), J Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Lee C White (Giovanni Ribisi), we also see activist Diana Nash (Tessa Thompson), CT Vivian (Corey Reynolds), John Lewis (Stephen James), and Judge Johnson (Martin Sheen). The most bizarre moment has Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) in a quasi-Mr Rogers depiction as he discussed his new found approach with Coretta.\n\nThe original King speeches are owned by another studio so those delivered here by Oyelowo have been re-written and revised, yet the words and Oyelowo's powerful oratory deliver the message loud and clear. While it can be argued that the film delivers only one point of view (the FBI was no friend to the movement), it can just as easily be argued that previous films have done the same thing \u2013 only from the \"other\" perspective (Mississippi Burning, Ghosts of Mississippi).\n\nIn what can be viewed as the first serious movie on Martin Luther King, director Ava DuVernay announces her presence with authority. She will have no need to return to her career as a movie publicist, and we will be watching to see what type of projects appeal to her after this. In a brilliant move, the story focuses on a period of just a few months in 1965, rather than tackling the MLK legacy. She presents him as a man with strengths, flaws, doubts, and determination. It's clear why so many followed him, and it's all the more painful to know that so many resisted."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many times, films of a historical nature are hard to appreciate, as in most cases one knows the story and the outcome. All our lives we have read, heard of and some even experienced the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King. There are many hours of footage, countless recounts of his modus operandi and volumes of writings that give insight into his minds. However, this film delves deeper than the King Jr. of Black History month, and gives you an experience with his humanity as a man.\n\nSelma is quite possibly, the most powerful film ever to be made. It is very hard to describe with words, however, after leaving the theater I was obviously affected greatly by the depiction of the story behind the march from Selma to Montgomery. Director, Ava Duvernay, does an amazing job of capturing, what she refers to as, \"small moments\" that allows you to connect to the King Jr. character on a very intimate level. During a screening of the film, she spoke to this saying, \"I knew that by doing a movie on King, we would have to do speeches, and early on I obsessed about the speeches. However, when I got on set, I began to focus on how to best capture the small moments that showed King's humanity.\"\n\nIn the film, King Jr., portrayed by David Oyelowo, experiences many emotions, not generally associated with the civil rights activist, including guilt, shame and defeat. Oyelowo does a masterful job of bringing these emotions to light in the most subtle way. When asked about his preparation for the role, he responded, \"I always knew I would portray King Jr. I studied him, read and watched all of the video I could. I had been fortunate enough to play opposite of one of my acting idols, Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and see him take on the role as he did, so I did the same for King Jr. For three months, I became him. So much so that one night while looking in the mirror, I only saw King Jr., this may sound crazy, but I could not see myself.\"\n\nOther strong performances include Oprah Winfrey as civil rights activist, Annie Lee Cooper. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Andre Holland as Andrew Young, Lorraine Toussaint as civil rights activist, Amelia Boynton, Stephan James as John Lewis and Trai Byers as James Forman."

It was this focus on the one topic that we got to see more of the man. Showing people that it was not an easy task just shows us all what we can do.\n\nIn this time and age it was hard watching some of the images going on in this movie. Some things have changed so much and it's painful to see how people use to be treated. While some things have not changed, which saddens me greatly.\n\nI only wished this movie came out a few weeks earlier. The world needs to be shown again how battling equality should be done."

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma tells the story of Martin Luther King as he organizes the infamous marches during the height of the civil rights movement. To be fair, Selma is a good film. It isn't a great film, but it is good. David Oyelowo gives a great performance as MLK despite feeling like a bit of a miscast but it isn't enough to sustain interest in his character, which is shameful considering the great and brilliant man that he is portraying. All in all, Oyelowo doesn't pack the punch that we all want to see out of a MLK based film. At 122 minutes, this film wallows in cheap drama surrounded by some serious heavyweight performances, it creates an uneven balance between what is great and what is mediocre. Actor Tim Roth does great work here in portraying the ruthless and racist George Wallace. Roth delivers an evil performance that will turn your stomach with every syllable that spews out of his mouth. Roth does a great, outstanding job in making you hate him and I definitely give him high praise in this film. Another stand out performance is Carmen Ejogo, who portrays Coretta Scott King with such honesty and velocity that she's hard to ignore. Ejogo's performance is one that I continuously am thinking about even as I'm writing this. The supporting cast is huge in this film, featuring Tom Wilkinson, Cuba Gooding Jr, Giovanni Ribisi, Common and Oprah Winfrey. But just because the star power is here, doesn't mean they're all good. Honestly, the supporting cast outside of Tim Roth and Common are mediocre at best. Oprah Winfrey delivers a performance that we've seen multiple times over the course of her acting career. It is nothing new, especially because it feels she is just rehashing the same performance from last year's The Butler or from the much superior The Color Purple. Winfrey serves as more of a distraction than anything else. Common is awesome in this film in a small but crucial role to what Oyelowo's King wants to achieve. Common proved before that he can act, but here, he proves that he isn't just another rapper turned actor, he really delivers force to this film with blunt and swift justice. The screenplay here is Selma's downfall. Written by first time screenwriter, Paul Webb, it really feels like Webb's first rodeo, making classic first time mistakes between cheesy dialog and long drawn out scenes that, in retrospect, serve little purpose to the film as a whole. Despite these issues with the screenplay, it was in the most capable hands possible for this film...Ava DuVernay. While there are major pacing issues with the film, DuVernay directs this with a determined efficiency that oozes out of every second of the film. While this can't save Selma from falling casualty to a lot of clich\u00e9 scenes and cheesy dialog, she does make up for all of what's wrong with the film with a handful of great performances and awesome cinematography. Overall, Selma is nowhere near the Oscar contender that I wanted it to be nor is it the biopic that a man as great as Martin Luther King, Jr deserves but Selma is a decent film that reminds me more of Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X\" or Lee Daniels' \"The Butler\" rather than last year's instant classic \"12 Years a Slave\". It's a good movie, nothing more, nothing less."

While I expected it to still do well with the Academy, instead it makes an appearance similar to Pride at the Golden Globes. Sitting (almost) alone in the Picture category representing a minority. At least it seems it'll win Best Song. There's two aspects that sorely deserved a nomination, with all due respect to their peers. One is David Oyelowo's performance as Martin Luther King Jr., who nails his articulate speeches with an arresting passion. Sparks fly in his hands and you can't take your eyes off him. The second is Ava DuVernay's direction, whose delicacy, intelligence, and gravitas shine on screen. I marvel at how she wrote those original speeches yet still demonstrates a remarkable restraint. Selma takes itself deadly seriously, there's not a lick of humour to be found, and any break from documenting its events are often downbeat character moments.\n\nThere's a reason - the critics weren't kidding when they said that Selma feels like a mirror to society today with the violence and unrest. It's almost disturbing, but it resonates stronger than I ever expected. The film may be very dry, but every time it starts to lull it grabs you back, often in Oyelowo's hands. The most rousing moments of the film are when people are joining arms to do something together. Bradford Young's cinematography is the aspect that really holds it together. He relishes in the darkness, pushes objects to the edge of the frame, and holds so much tension in the air. At the very least, he makes this film such expertly crafted cinema. However, I would've liked to have seen King withstand a bit more damage. He may be courageous but it's difficult to have a truly compelling protagonist without taking some punches themselves. Perhaps Selma is too broad for its own good. It may not incite a fire in me like the filmmakers have, but I certainly admire the filmmaking. Lots of bright futures in this cast and crew.\n\n8/10"

Selma focuses specifically on the voting rights movement where Dr. King and his followers led an historical march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to peacefully protest Alabama's segregated voting rights in order to obtain equality across the voting board. It's a startlingly relevant film that explores a time in US history many would prefer to forget, and one that challenges us to look at our modern day society and draw some disturbing connections.\n\nAdmittedly it is a little bit sad that a film about civil rights can still have so much relevance in 2015, but such is the way of prejudice and bigotry in all of its ever changing forms. Selma does a fantastic job at making this fight as real and accessible as possible, highlighting this struggle on a personal level for King and his associates. These events were well before my time, but as far as I know this film paints a very realistic picture of the time, from the look of the sets, the costumes, and the emotions and tensions filling the air.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it's the portrayal of Dr. King that drives this film home. David Oyelowo is a powerhouse that carries this film with a startlingly accurate representation of the reverend; one that is filled to the brim with passion and poise, while also breaking down the larger than life illusion that surrounds the man, and bringing him down to earth as the very real and very flawed human being he actually was. His controversial decisions are touched upon in the film, as well as his infidelities which truly bring him to the human level.\n\nIt's a damn good thing that Oyelowo can carry this film, too, as the emotional prowess of the story relies solely on him. Selma is packed with a great supporting cast with everyone from Tom Wilkinson to Tim Roth to rapper Common, but there is no denying that all these supporting players play second fiddle to Oyelowo. If Oyelowo is at a 10 as the lead of the film the rest of the cast sits at an 8 across the board with no one character getting a lot of attention as the focus consistently remains on King. I would have liked to see some more attention turned towards the supporting cast, but with a biopic on one of the most influential names in American history you almost have to expect this.\n\nSelma highlights a grim portion of our history, one so grim that it needs to be immortalized in film so that we don't forget the troubled history we came from. This is an incredibly important film about an incredibly important man. It's not something you watch for entertainment value and not something you watch over and over again, but it is something you need to watch to gain some highly accurate perception of a crucial time in history it is imperative we never forget."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's been a lot of discussion over whether or not director Ava DuVernay should have been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Personally I would have to take the seemingly unpopular opinion that she was the one thing holding this film back. Admittedly the end of the film was very well done and even quite moving, but up until that point the whole thing just felt so clunky and unnatural. I see that she is quite inexperienced in the director's chair, and I feel that there was potential there, so hopefully she can iron out the odd flaw in her technique and become a really good director in the future.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is the other one stirring up some debate over his lack of a nomination. I do feel he was quite hard done by, giving a quite terrific performance. The voice and accent he used were absolutely perfect and a pleasure to listen to throughout. The rest of the cast was also excellent. I was very interested to see how Oprah Winfrey went in her role and I'd have to say she held her own very well.\n\nThe movie itself is good, but never enters in the realms of being great. As previously mentioned the ending is perfectly executed and will leave a good taste in a lot of people's mouths and even help them to forget some of the earlier indiscretions the film commits. Sometimes historically accurate films get bogged down by needing to be 100% in line with what actually happened. This is simply an unfortunate part of the genre which can't be avoided. Does it deserve its nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards? Just."

There are lots of production about racism in USA which is one of their biggest dishonors with atomic bombs. Yet, Selma is different from processors with telling not the life story of Martin Luther King but a short period of his campaign which has big impacts for the whole movement. King is already a well-known and appreciated person in world history. For people who didn't study American history in rest of the world, movie gives us a chance to know about Selma \u2013 Montgomery march which is a big milestone in Martin Luther King's civil disobedience.\n\nAfter opening with a shocking scene, movie keeps same harsh texture as same as historical conditions bring to the real world it tells. Actually it takes a general look to social struggles of American people with using a short period of time and with a specific right that blacks try to gain. Fire of tension is kept alive along the whole movie. Most shining part of movie is David Oyelowo who is not just playing but living Martin Luther King. Such a convincing performance shows how much he interiorized his role. Other salient point is the brave language at telling the ideas and beliefs of politicians at their time. From president Lyndon B. Johnson to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, from Kennedy to Alabama governor George Wallace many powerful figures find place in movie with their crystal cold renditions. Mentioning Malcolm X himself and responses of his acts in White House, also showing the tracing records and conspiracies about Martin Luther King are very brave choices with such clear language. I t is obviously a hard movie like a stone which is thrown to the head of narrow-minded societies.\n\nAs a costume drama, I can say that we have a successful result of devoted hard work. Scene settings, costumes and make up help us to feel the essence of time. If a movie pushes you to research what it tells after you leave theater I consider it as an influential one.\n\nThe movie gives us a good opportunity to watch a man who has all responsibility of one race in entire continent only at his thirties."

The acting was superb I really felt for the people and their struggle one can only imagine what they went through to achieve their goal.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of action but it moved very well and kept my interest. There were some funny moments as well as some heart breaking moments. People clapped with enjoyment at the end of the movie. I don't want to go into great detail since it is based on actual events there is no need to. I was disappointed in the limited release but I was lucky it was on 42 street which is walking distance from the Port Authority so it wasn't a bad commute from NJ. If you have an interest in movies about the Civil rights era this is about as good as it gets. I will be purchasing this for my collection when it is available."

Toward the end of the movie, his performance was so strong, if he was not actually shown on the screen, you couldn't tell if if was an old recording of MLK or David Oyelowo himself.\n\nAs for the story, yes, it was not \"historicly accurate,\" but it flowed well and Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb did a wonderful job of making it family friendly, which is very hard to do with such a sensitive subject. I would compare it to Disney's \"Remember The Titans\" on how they changed the story to make it more entertaining and also family friendly.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this movie. It did a great job of showing me a bit of the past that was before my time and I am grateful for that experience."

The movie was strongly fictionalized, unfortunately tarnishing its historical accuracy. This would have been a great movie even if it had stuck to the historical record but for Hollywood reasons (sensationalism; promoting racial discord; etc) the writer actively \"reimagined\" LBJs relationship with MLK to promote the idea of MLK fighting on all fronts - even against the all-powerful President who stands in his way. In fact (with plenty of recorded phone conversations, and MLKs words to back it up) LBJ and MLK worked closely in tandem to orchestrate the Civil Rights Act in '64 and Voting Rights Act in '65. This is not even debated - it's known and well recorded and understood. The fact that the film presented the opposite of the truth in this regard - for box office sales no less - is unfortunate indeed. For those who turn to Hollywood for history lessons they will see an entertaining movie but learn very little."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ava DuVernay's film Selma is a powerful cinematic telling of the lesser known chronicle of Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign for equal voting rights.\n\nThe tale told in Selma is not the narrative of Dr. King's fight for peace and societal equality, but the peaceful dispute for voting power and autonomy.\n\nAva DuVernay directs the powerful story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. towards the later years in his life, as written in screenplay form by Paul Webb. The man we see is an accomplished and ultimately successful advocate and recognized by the Nobel committee for his efforts in the civil rights movement. His work as a reverend and a leader is far from finished. In 1965 he is brought to Alabama to lead a dangerous campaign for equal voting rights amidst a racially vitriolic environment.\n\nDuvernay and Webb's film is not an idealistic portrayal of a humanitarian and his movement but a realistic representation of a man. For over a decade King has been fighting, and the man we see is justifiably growing tired as the crusade turns increasingly complicated. David Oyelowo takes on the insurmountable task of portraying one of the most respected activists in American history and succeeds gracefully. Oyelowo encompasses the silent power and commanding oratory skills of the famous African-American Civil Rights advocate. Selma also has close to twenty compelling supporting roles, each matching Oyelowo's dynamic performance.\n\nSelma is a mighty cinematic experience that seems relatively historically accurate and free from severe embellishments, though I am not a historian so I can not say for sure. The political figures are varying shades of gray in a complex political climate. Further, DuVernay does not shy from the horror in the violence, neither does she exaggerate.\n\nIt will be surprising if Selma does not elicit an emotional response. The story may not bring out the tears from a sobbing cry of sorrow but will evoke the catching and hurtful ache from the pain of the racial injustice of that generation. A truly effective film will make its audience relate and sympathize, and that is just what the filmmakers of Selma accomplish. As an evocative response from an artwork; that is a marvelous sentiment to achieve.\n\nPlease check out our website for more FULL reviews of all the recent releases and awards contenders."

MLKs speeches were so powerful, it overwhelmed me with emotion. The story of his journey through Selma was told so well. I was not bored for 1 minute. Everyone in this movie did an outstanding performance. I really felt like I was watching MLK. If you love history about the civil rights movement you'll love it. If you don't know that much about the civil rights movement but want to know more without watching some boring documentary you'll love it. This movie impacted me so much, emotionally, physically, mentally. I cant stop thinking about it. Man could that man give a speech! I recommend it to anyone but kids under 13. While it is educational, it is graphic images and deals with very serious issues. Definitely going to buy on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ava DuVernay's 'Selma' is an honest film, about a significant chapter in American History, but the tone as well as the execution is so ordinarily done, that it doesn't throw you in the power you might expect. It has its share of pluses, but overall, it has a very thin vibe, which adds up as a minus.\n\n'Selma' Synopsis: A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.\n\nLate/Great Dr.King's journey to secure equal voting rights, was nothing short of astonishing. He emerged victorious & made a breakthrough for all his people. And 'Selma', without a shed of doubt, is a earnest attempt to re-tell his story.\n\nBut, as I mentioned before, the treatment is plain ordinary. Be it sequences of those violent epic marches or moments of Dr.King's personal life, they all look as if they were shot with less enthusiasm.\n\nPaul Webb's Screenplay is good, but not gut-wrenching. Ava DuVernay's Direction is impressive, but only in parts. Cinematography & Editing are sharp. Score by Jason Moran is passable.\n\nPerformance-Wise: David Oyelowo as Dr.King, delivers a committed performance. He embodies the American legend & enacts the part with gusto. He's the best thing about 'Selma', hands down! Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson, is over-the-top. Tim Roth as George Wallace, is limited to a few scenes. Common as James Beve, is fair. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, is very good. Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, is wasted. Martin Sheen as Frank Minis Johnson & Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Fred Gray, leave a mark.\n\nOn the whole, 'Selma' isn't bad, but it isn't great either. One expected much more!"

This is not for everyone with its talk heavy dialogue but for those who like slower films then this is for them. It doesn't have the same power as \"12 Years a Slave\" does though. Still, it's good for a few viewings and it is pretty moving at some parts. I was pretty entertained by this. A couple of the boring or slower scenes lost me but there weren't too many of them and most of them were only in the first hour. It did a good job capturing the ugliness of the 1960's with the marches and some other sequences of violence. If you want to see a history lesson on screen then you'll likely enjoy the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Passionate, informative, and tenderly told, Ava DuVernay's vision of Martin Luther King Jr. and his fight for voters' rights is fully realized in her newest film \"Selma.\" Written by Paul Webb, the film is ambitious, moving, and features a performance fit for the history books from David Oyelowo. It's one of the single best things you can see in 2014.\n\nIn a time where the state of our country is in disarray over race and politics, \"Selma\" hits our doorsteps at the right time for both sides of the coin to indulge and see how far we've come, or how little we actually have. \"Selma\" shows the good and the bad, the perfect and imperfect characteristics of one of the most important figures in the fight for civil rights. There's respect, which goes without question, but there's an emotional and raw honesty that DuVernay and Webb choose to tell us about the man who was Dr. King. She doesn't paint the rosey picture you'd come to expect from standard biopics these days. She lays it out, leaving us to decide for ourselves if something outside of what he contributed to our country is great enough to look passed. DuVernay offers in many ways, the single best direction of the year.\n\nInvigorating from beginning to end, David Oyelowo owns every frame of the picture. You don't see performances like this too often especially of a real-life figure like MLK. I go back to works like Denzel Washington (\"Malcolm X\"), Ben Kingsley (\"Gandhi\"), and George C. Scott (\"Patton\") to find a more jaw-dropping or complex acting performance. Something like this only seems to come around once a decade. This may be our decade's. It's more than just the embodiment, it's the decisions in the silence that makes Oyelowo so amazing. You will remember this performance forever.\n\nThe entire cast does an admirable to amazing job in their respective roles. Carmen Ejogo is simply electrifying as Coretta Scott King. An impeccable example of wearing the emotions and feelings at the brim without letting go. Just sensational top to bottom.\n\nDespite some hiccups in the accent department, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth are serviced well as Lyndon B. Johnson and George Wallace. Both have their opportunities to stand out in their respective scenes but ultimately stand as reminders that we are eagerly waiting to get back to Dr. King.\n\nDuVernay's triumph comes from the extras and smaller name cast she utilizes as sprinkles in every instance that they appear. Stan Houston as the treacherous Sheriff Clark is superbly focused and embodies the mindset of every unfortunate person of hate during the time. Henry G. Sanders and Keith Stanfield in many ways become the heart and soul of the film without no more than just a few moments of screen time. Oprah Winfrey and Lorraine Toussaint also execute their roles proficiently.\n\nThe slick and vivacious manner in which \"Selma\" is assembled is thanks to the genius people behind the camera. Cinematographer Bradford Young is just too great at what he does at this point in his career. With another stunning framing form in J.C. Chandor's \"A Most Violent Year,\" he rises in the ranks to join Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki as one of the most exciting DP's. Spencer Averick's editing keeps \"Selma\" on pace, and engaging 100% of the time. Jason Moran's score is palpable and justified in every sense of its usage.\n\n\"Selma\" is just a joy to behold, a magnificent example of passionate filmmaking that lacked sorely in 2014. It propels DuVernay among the ranks of the best filmmakers working today. Naturally brought to tears, it's a gut-wrenching and honest look into our history. Fulfilling, promised, and profound. One of the year's best films."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was pretty interested in seeing this, mostly because this was the main contender for Oscar bait, (before the Oscar nominations anyway). I saw it opening day with my brothers, needless to say it wasn't packed, (probably too busy seeing Transformers or something stupid). The film wasn't as much of an impact as I hoped it would be. I was hoping it would grab me in the same way 12 Years a Slave did, but it wasn't nearly as moving as I thought.\n\nIt tells the story of MLK Jr. (David Oyelowo), as he fights to get voting rights from Alabama's African American restrictions through his pacifist ways and reasoning, assembling a march from Selma to Montgomery.\n\nThe cinematography, performances, and directing style are excellent. The cinematography was smooth, stylish, and it just looked good overall with the lighting. David Oyelowo was super convincing. He not only looked the part, but he acted the crap out of the part. His wife played by Carmen Ejogo is very supportive, and was probably my second favorite performance of the film. Other than her, the rest of the supporting cast is kind of weak. Opera plays the exact same character in every single film about race, the strong willed woman who doesn't tolerate discrimination by hitting people, it's a reprise of her role in The Color Purple, which was done better. Tim Roth as George Wallace is so over the top, it's just goofy. Martin Sheen is barely in it, so I don't see the point of him in the film other than just being a cameo. I didn't appreciate their portrayal of LBJ as Tom Wilkinson. Though his performance was good, they payed no respect to the man who reasoned with MLK in real life and was the one who suggested the march in the first place. It makes me feel like the director is testing the Academy on race.\n\nI didn't feel like the film spoke to me. 12 Years a Slave was my favorite film of last year, that film spoke to me and it told its story more interestingly. In here, it feels like they're just hammering in the white guilt in every scene. I know that's how it really was, but i'm sorry, its just been done to death, we don't need another one. There's preachy scenes that are well done, but it just keeps going back to constant scenes of race violence. 12 Years a Slave had that as well, but it had a stronger narrative for me, about how it's all about survival. In here, they just milk it way too much, especially with LBJ's portrayal. Again, it's not Tom Wilkinson's fault, he acts it well, it's the way he was written. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film, the performances and editing and what not, but it lacked a solid narrative, and it tried too hard to appeal to the \"don't be racist\" film lovers. I'm not against those films, but it's overdone here. Still would recommend, but just not for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, the acting in this movie is all first-rate. David Oyelowo, by far the most striking presence in the movie, will probably get an Oscar nomination for his understated but therefore all the more powerful performance as MLK. (My bet is that the Oscar for Best Actor will go to one of this year's performances of a man suffering from a disease, since that is what the Academy seems to honor most.) What makes this movie so deeply moving, however, at least for me, is 1) the script, which is a masterpiece of organization and character development, and 2) Ava DuVernay's direction, which pulls together a very complex series of elements into a single narrative flow that, though it moves slowly, never once in the 128 minutes loses our attention, or even lets down the almost constant intensity. Nothing is overdone. Nothing is unnecessary. Almost everything is understated. Brief scenes have powerful effects by the placement of a camera, the timing of the dialogue (waiting for MLK to answer his wife's question about whether he loved any of the women he has had affairs with, etc.). People will praise David Oyelowo's performance, and deservedly so. But the real star of this movie is Ms. DuVerney, who makes everyone and everything else look amazing.\n\nAt the very end, after all the credits - for which I found some of the music to be the only let-down in the entire picture - there is a statement that this is not a documentary, but rather a feature film that takes the liberties with historical fact that feature films take. And, certainly, it would be interesting to learn where this movie deviates from those facts.\n\nBut in the case of this movie, it won't, in a sense, make a lot of difference. This movie makes such a profound effect, using all the tools at the disposal of a first-rate director, that it will be seen by those outside this country as \"the truth.\" It may not be the most-watched American movie around the world during the next few years. But this I can guarantee you: it will, more than any other American movie of the last several years, shape how much of the rest of the world sees us for the next several years.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nA postscript: this morning I read a column by Maureen O'Dowd complaining about the largely negative portrayal of LBJ in this movie. She quoted presidential historians who maintain, evidently with good reason, that Johnson was more pro-active in moving toward civil rights reforms than this movie suggests. That is unfortunate for LBJ's legacy, because the power of this movie, one that is going to be watched over and over again for years to come, is certainly going to trump the work of presidential historians in the minds of the general public even here in the U.S."

        "review_detailed_main": "Something, hard to define, is missing in this important film. This film takes the viewer on a journey to Selma Alabama at the crucial time of the Civil Rights movement that took place during the life of Martin Luther King. It covers the important facts, describing clearly the sad situation that people of color faced in trying to register to vote in the segregated south. Even today, the efforts by white-dominated election boards make it more and more difficult for people of color to register and make their votes in the old south. The actor playing Dr. King, in my view, is one of the serious problems this film has. He seems to do a good job, but something serious is missing. The fact that he is not an American is part of this problem. There is something artificial about his acting. It is technically sound, yet lacks some deeper presentation of the driven, inspiring personality that defined Dr. King. Perhaps the problem is in the context. We don't really see any sense of the history that lead to this confrontation. The beat down on the bridge is, in my view, poorly filmed and does very little to capture the full outrage, violence and terror of that event. Certainly this is a difficult scene to set up and record, but Hollywood is very well-equipped to do things like this. A lot has been made of the so-called snubbing of Oprah in this film. She has a small part in the beginning of the film, a scene that could have been played by anyone. The scene where she tries to register to vote, while being questioned and intimidated by a series of crazy questions from the voter registrar is very helpful in telling us what this film is about. There is nothing exceptional about her small part, so I see no cause at all for her to imagine that for such a small part she should be nominated for an Academy Award. The very idea seems really childish. A lot of facts were left out, or glossed over; so an enormous opportunity seems to have been lost. Selma is a good film about the civil rights movement, but not a great film. It is flat, the lead actors are not very interesting and the script, in particular, seems half- finished. It comes across as a rough draft of an idea for a film rather than a finished product. I was very disappointed in this film. In particular I did not like the actors playing Doctor King or President Johnson. The photography, the camera work, as well was not very good...flat and dry. Perhaps we all have inflated expectations. This is such an important and dramatic story; yet it was created and presented in a very un-inspired form with to many missing parts. The part I absolutely did not like at all in any way is the \"song\" that closes the film. The semi-rap composition was very disrespectful and tried much to hard to be \"relevant\". And the fact that it is one of the few points on which it was nominated by the Academy, as \"best song\" is just sad."

This was to be expected given the context of the film, and there is no shying away from the horror of the events surrounding the march in Selma. The displays of violence are never gratuitous and always serve a purpose to powerfully deliver the films message and to accurately represent the events that unfolded.\n\nWe are treated to a fantastic leading performance by David Oyelowo, who had so much gravitas in this role. His speeches were captivating, really capturing the essence of King himself. The fantastic performances keep on coming, with not a single member of the supporting cast falling short in any respect.\n\nI loved how Selma had a dual focus on the macro and micro events surrounding this march. We were allowed to delve into personal motivations and stories as well as getting a sense of the impact of this march on the wider US civil right movement. The focus is very much on the march however, which it portrays in a highly accomplished fashion.\n\nThere are a few flaws with the film. We didn't really explore King in quite as much detail as I would have liked, and at times the film felt a bit choppy in its transitions, but none of this really matters. You will finish this film feeling hurt and wounded by the absolute lack of humanity displayed only a short time ago in our history. A lack of humanity that is still embedded in many parts of society today. It is an infuriating and heartbreaking film to watch, and is a truly moving piece of cinema.\n\nSelma is unwavering and powerful from start to finish. It may not be the most technically solid film, but it will be sure to leave a lasting impression."

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma has the distinction of being really the first Martin Luther King Jr. film. Released in 2014 to coincide with the then upcoming 50th anniversary of the events depicted in this film. The film itself had a budget of $20 million and made back over three times that amount. The film was a critical success and even managed to win some awards in the musical department. The film stars David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe film follows the events leading up to the March from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to help protest the fact that black people are being kept from voting.\n\nI am not very good when it comes to talking about biographical films, but I will try my best here. First of all, this is a good film. I think the whole message is important and something that should be talked about and even have a movie made about. It is about time that a movie was made for this film. The acting is great with David Oyelowo giving a great performance of Dr. King to the point that I actually believed it was Dr. King himself. Acting: phenomenal. The events depicted are important in history and really dark and can be uncomfortable to watch for some. The music is really good and rightfully deserved an award for best music. Cinematography and direction is really phenomenal. There are a couple things I have a problems with though. First, is the pace. This is a slow slow slow slow film and if your attention is not 100 percent there, you won't be 100% into the film. There are not specific scenes that this occurs but more so just happens throughout the film. Another complaint being that I think the film would be better had it had focus on other people and not largely focused on Dr. King. Yes, Dr. King is important but so were a lot of the other people in this film as well. The whole film is centered around the events in Selma and not just specifically Dr. King. Lastly, there has been some criticism around the portrayal of the President in this film. I was not alive during this time, but if it takes someone who actually lived those events to say that the portrayal of the president in this film was not right, then I got dock some points. Sorry for being such a snobish film pundit.........\n\nSelma is an important film albeit with a few flaws. Definitely a film that should be shown in schools in say, History class or something."

Go see the movie for the significance of the time, but don't get your hopes up for a \"Best Picture\".\n\nThe film is not as much about Martian Luther King Jr. as it is about the Selma March, even though it clearly delves into MLK's emotional struggles during this time. The Selma March, black people fighting for their right to vote in the south, is one of the most disturbing moments in history, and this film portrays that. Director Ava Duvernay wanted to focus on \"small moments\" and I believe that is what she did. But the screenplay had serious pacing problems and many long, drawn out scenes that were unnecessary.\n\nThe acting, for the most part was great. David Oyelowu, as Martin Luther King Jr. was surprisingly moving. Oyelowu has always been great in his many small supporting roles but here he steps out to the front and shines.\n\nTim Roth was creepy as hell as George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama. I always applauded all his acting efforts, but can't think of any as creepy as this role. He played it well.\n\nI was also surprised at how well Tom Wilkinson did portraying Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president. In my mind it doesn't seem to work but Wilkinson was flawless."

        "review_title": "One of the Most Powerful Films I've Seen This Year",
        "review_detailed_main": "Selma (directed by Ava DuVernay and written by Paul Webb) features Martin Luther King Jr. (played by David Oyelowo) leading a civil rights march in Selma because he is tired of African Americans being denied the right to vote. On top of this, he and his wife Coretta Scott King (played by Carmen Ejogo) are having marriage issues. All of these things combined results in an intense, emotional, and masterful film that stands as one of the most important biopics of the year and arguably ever made.\n\nMust I talk about David Oyelowo's portrayal of Dr. King? For an actor who I'd never heard of until seeing him play a principal for 5 seconds in Interstellar, and for the guy who played the unmemorable Doctor in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, he gives the best performance of the year. David is not playing Dr. King, he IS Doctor King. He talks like him, acts like him, looks like him, sounds like him, has his haircut like him, etc. I felt like I was legitimately watching Dr. King on screen. Some of the scenes that are extremely emotionally intense, I'd always pay attention to David's expressions, and in every one of them he'd be at the top of his craft. Unfortunately, David's performance is so spectacular that moments he isn't on screen results in the film slowing down. In fact, I feel that if the performance of Dr. King wasn't as compelling as it was, I'd be giving this film a 7 or an 8. Without David carrying the film, it would simply be an above average civil rights movie, in my humble opinion.\n\nLets forget about the acting and story for a second and appreciate the technical aspects of this film. Ava DuVernay is not a director I'm familiar with, in fact I've seen none of her movies. But seeing this one, I feel compelled to check them out. This movie is wonderfully shot and directed. Some cinematography is absolutely stunning and the film does a great job at depicting the time period. When moments are intense, the camera is intense. When it's time for a rousing speech by the Doctor, the camera is rousing. It's perfectly directed for the most part, besides a few scenes where a character is killed or beaten and the camera goes slow-mo for a straight minute holding onto the slow motion shot. I get its meant to give the audience time to grieve and be shocked, but it would've been more effective if the scene went by quickly. Also, the soundtrack of the film ranges from inspirational to downright intense, and scenes with the soundtrack playing are just as emotional as scenes without it playing.\n\nThe writing in this film, especially the dialog between Dr. King and his wife, and Dr. King in some of his civil rights buddies, is excellent. I think the best however is the speeches and monologues given by Doctor King. With the writing being delivered passionately by David, some scenes had me completely engaged with chills up my spine. It's extraordinary.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews of this film critiquing the fact that it is not entirely \"historically accurate.\" However, I must ask the same reviewers if they like Braveheart, and if the answer is yes, why don't they critique that film fore being historically inaccurate? Yes, the film may be inaccurate, but people have to realize that historical pics are only trying to convey the message of what was going on in the time period, they're not trying to recreate word for word what actually happened in that time period. Plus, some thematic elements need to be added. If I wanted to learn about the Civil Rights march in a short amount of time by watching something, I'd watch the history channel. This is meant to be a film depicting the rampant racism and violence that the African American people had to deal with, not a PBS special on Dr. King.\n\nOverall, this is a film that I will be picking up on bluray. Featuring a masterful performance from David Oyelowo, and a strong supporting cast, in addition to the brilliant writing and direction, this is a must see biopic. However, I can't say it'd be amazing without the inclusion of David (and it shows with scenes that don't include him, which slows the film down as a result), which is why I have to give this film a 9. Go see it."

I loved the gentleness and patience of Martin Luther King Jr. I loved the youthful energy and optimism of the amazing volunteers such as John Lewis. I loved the glamorous tributes to real life heroes from the entertainment world who made a difference, such a Harry Belafonte. (Best musical moment: The whole cast singing \"Daylight come and we want to go home.\") I loved the inspiring images of Americans both black and white gathering together at the bridge in the name of freedom. I even loved the way English actor Tim Roth (a hero of mine since RESERVOIR DOGS) played racist Alabama governor George Wallace as the ultimate Snidely Whiplash villain, relishing his extravagantly exaggerated Southern accent and his genuinely chilling lack of human feeling in every scene.\n\nI loved all of it, but . . .\n\nI wish that someday we could have a movie that goes beyond the early, innocent days of the Civil Rights movement. Dr. King to the end of his life was haunted by the way non-violence failed as a strategy in big northern cities like Chicago and Boston. Why did the movement fall apart? What went wrong in the cities? Why did white immigrants in the north (Poles, Italians, the Irish) resist integration with even more savage fury than poor whites in the south? Why did young blacks turn to violence instead of peaceful protest? Oh, let's not think about that . . . let's make another movie about Birmingham and Selma! I understand that Dr. King's adultery was shameful and inexcusable, but I wish that the outraged-wife scene (complete with Coretta's stony silence and lavishly recorded male moans) could have been less prim and judgmental. The movie gives too much weight to King's extra-marital affairs, in a way calculated to gratify the female audience. When a protester being beaten to death gets six seconds of screen time, while the wronged wife gets ten minutes to sulk and pout, it's hard not to feel that someone's been watching to much OPRAH.\n\nWho produced this movie, anyway? Oh, wait. Oprah!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Selma\" is 90% of a great film. It tells the true story of a three month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King, Jr. led his famous march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to secure equal voting rights against violent opposition. The period is skillfully recreated, generally knowing exactly what to center the drama on, wisely much more than on King himself but on the entire community and how so many came together to alter history.\n\nIn spite of the film's impact (especially in the violent scenes between the police and the protesters) and some great performances, the script by Paul Webb inserts a fictitious clash between King and President Lyndon Johnson in order to add a conflict to the film. This has drawn much criticism but, more than doing a disservice to LBJ (who reportedly did not impede putting forward the voting rights bill), it also reveals that Webb and director DuVernay did not feel there was enough dramatic conflict inherent in the story without it. One can legitimately argue either way, but in my opinion it would have been better to further emphasize the interaction of all the participants more without 'hyping' the LBJ conflict. Even if the film had been less 'dramatic' in a classical sense it would have been more accurate as well as effective. Still, this film is a must-see and a significant document of a crucial time in the history of America."

I didn't see an actor playing a role, I saw Dr. King. The supporting cast did well enough and I did enjoy the song by Common and John Legend.\n\nHowever, where the film fell a little flat for me was that, though this depicts true events, is that it followed so many of the Hollywood clich\u00e9s such as slowing down a shot during a violent scene, telling the audience what to feel and when to feel it and that annoys me, particularly in a historical film because it is so unnecessary. I don't dislike the film, its a well put together film, I was just a little underwhelmed. It's absolutely worth watching but anyone expecting to see something as good as say \"12 years a slave\" will be disappointed.\n\nAs for the Oscar snub, well, based on the film I've seen, it really didn't deserve that much attention from the Academy, regardless of the topic it deals with.

        "review_detailed_main": "Quickie Review:\n\nSelma chronicles a crucial moment in Martin Luther King's campaign for equal voting rights. In a time when civil rights movement was gaining momentum, M.L.K. still had many obstacles to overcome, both personally and politically. Despite the opposition that resulted in innocent casualties, King leads the march from Selma to Montgomery that would go on to become a significant victory for civil rights. David Oyelowo excellent portrayal of M.L.K. brings us the relatable human behind the icon and leader for peace. Selma is a deeply engaging biopic showing both behind the scenes of the movement and the burden of responsibility that M.L.K carried as a leader. This is a film that does great justice in depicting a vital moment in American history.\n\nFull Review:\n\nWho hasn't heard of Martin Luther King? Everyone has heard of him. He led the ambitious peaceful protests to give every American citizen the right to vote, regardless of their skin color. However, I wouldn't be surprised if many of you didn't know much about the man himself. I certainly don't and that's why I had to see this movie.\n\nIn history class we have all learned about the revolutionary leaders such as Gandhi, Mandela, and M.L.K. We know of all the freedom fighting movements they led in their countries and the seemingly unsurmountable obstacles they had to face. So we easily start seeing them as being more than human without any weakness or breaking point. The greatest strength of this movie is David Oyelowo because he showed us the vulnerability of M.L.K. Just in his silence he communicates the overwhelming doubts he had about his involvement. It wasn't only his life at risk, but also the lives of his family and his supporters. I liked seeing this side of him because it helped to understand his motivation to continue his campaign. Oyelowo portrays M.L.K. as a relatable human being with very real fears, but also his almost superhuman nature in the way he picks himself up and faces the threats head on.\n\nThe approach to biopic is rather unorthodox for Selma, when compared to others out there. It doesn't tell the whole life story of M.L.K. from birth to death. Instead it concentrates on a 2-3 month period during the civil rights movement. By concentrating on this singular event of the Selma march it refines the storytelling and provides us with a concise, well-paced flow to the movie. I should also mention the depiction of the racial violence in this film. It was definitely graphic, at times difficult to watch. Even when considering setting of the time I was left speechless. So if you are sensitive to that you've been warned. Still it was the extreme reality that thousands of people had to face every day. Hence I appreciate that the director did not hold back on showing the horrible atrocities at its most violent.\n\nFilming wise, Selma is well directed and brilliantly acted. However, bearing in mind the historical significance of the events covered, this movie needed to be more than well-filmed, and it absolutely is. This is an important film to watch to understand the man behind the movement, and by choosing to showcase the culmination of King's work, the Selma march, there is not a single wasted moment.\n\nCheck out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

Maybe this is why it missed out on the Oscar season as it should have been better and shouldn't get nominations because of the subject (as Oscars are about films not the subject). Given the life of Martin Luther King, maybe they should have picked a different part of his life but then again, this was a very significant story. Maybe sometimes the challenge to make a film about such a great man is overwhelming to the point that it makes the task impossible. This reminded me of Lincoln which while not as bad as the sleepfest drabness of the overrated Lincoln film, it is slow and does not grab you. The acting is fine and nothing close to pretentious like Day-Lewis, with his questionable Oscar for over acting while sending people asleep. They make the social commentary, they clearly get the point across of how reprehensible some of the characters are, how wrong all of this was, but maybe that is what happens, it's too much to make it into the product they wanted. Maybe it is a case of getting caught between making it entertaining and giving a true accurate reflection of these historic events in this great man's life in which he has to fix what Lincoln couldn't all those years ago."

That an African-American woman, Ava DuVernay, directed this story is surely praiseworthy and a long time coming, but one wishes she'd realized the picture with more subtle strokes. Yes, there are a handful of beautifully poignant moments, some unspoken, but those are nearly neutralized by scenes where the dialog is so stilted with the weight of self-importance that ordinary folks sound like they're making speeches during private conversations.\n\nVisually, the desaturated sepia look of the picture confuses. Are we watching a historical document, or are we present in the moment of 1965 with its arguably more vibrant palette? Superimposed FBI logbook entries (as scene headers) cheapen the movie and bring to mind 1970s televised crime drama. In these and other production decisions, DuVernay undermines her own noble effort.\n\nNevertheless, the story does move, and the inevitable violence that pushes forward the Voting Rights Act is brutal and affecting. The film's best moments come from Henry G. Sanders as Cager Lee, and between David Oyelowo and Tom Wilkinson as MLK and LBJ."

By and large, the conflict between the Civil Rights groups and those in positions of power is presented in a nuanced manner which adds depth and an increased sense of realism to the movie.\n\nCons: 1. Some of the camera-work, especially in regards to the physical confrontations, is obnoxiously reliant upon shaky-cam. 2. President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) is falsely characterised as a weak coward, even though he was the opposite, and Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) was presented as a white supremacist, despite the fact that he was just a segregationist. 3. The emotional manipulation, at times, is overbearing, especially with the illogical public execution of Jimmie Lee Jackson (LaKeith Stanfield). 4. Every white character that opposes desegregation is presented as a cartoonish racist. The actual conflict was, and still is, more complex than that."

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma, about the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and how Martin Luther King and his group faced adversity at every turn to get equal voting rights, is one of the better films this year (that is to say, it's just shy of my top 10 list, but it's still really really really good).\n\nOyelowo and director DuVernay turned in fantastic work. I can see why you'd say the filmmaking does matter here. What I loved about the movie were actually the little moments, quiet scenes where King is trying to figure out what he'll write or talking in hushed tones in a prison cell, or (what I didn't expect) the scene where the extramarital question is raised and done in brilliant drama between King and his wife - that is particularly a wonderful scene with so much weight in this room that is surrounded by the threat of death, but it still all comes down to love.\n\nIs it a perfect film? May be not, but it really is directed and presented with vitality and especially now it's more (sadly) relevant than ever between the cop murders and voter disenfranchisement in the south. When you're watching scenes that are really set pieces for the major events that unfold with people being beaten and killed ruthlessly, it's hard to watch - which is the point. DuVernay doesn't turn away, and gives it the harrowing edge of an action film. If she is at all manipulative as a filmmaker, it's for the right reasons for this story. Get people taking notice, not sitting there too complacent at a boilerplate story of black uprising. The way she shoots and executes the action, and how the actors play it - it matters.\n\nOh, and to briefly address this because it's come up: and Johnson doesn't really come off that well in the film. But you know what? He's not the main focus of the movie anyway. Selma is; even King is, even as the leader, still just a part of the puzzle. He doesn't seem like the most high-minded president, but as a CHARACTER, not a historical figure, he works well for the conflict of the film. If King could walk into the Oval office, ask for voting rights for African-Americans, and LBJ goes 'alright', there's no movie.\n\ncertainly has more conflict about him as a politician than George Wallace (both Wilkinson and Roth are good on screen, if over-shadowed by Oyelowo and Carmen Ojojo Coretta Scott King), and ultimately I was okay with his portrayal in the MOVIE. If I want more I can check out the Caro books or, when the time comes, Cranston as LBJ when the HBO movie comes out this year.\n\nThe filmmaking is just so charged and vital, but DuVernay knows how to make her film in tones of darkness - a room will be without light, but she has a way of getting us to feel the presence in a room, that weight that King carries is made cinematic as far as being a moral figure who still has to stay alive and keep his family alive. The filmmakers knew it was a subject that has 'Important' going in to it. The question is how to make the performances count - and almost all of them do - and how to make scenes move and flow dramatically speaking.\n\nEven supporting characters like John Lewis gets a strong turn and dimension, and one scene where an 82 year old man, who has lost a family member due to police brutality, has a hear-to-heart with King, it's impossible not to feel the emotion there, and it works. Selma works."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is highly recommended.\n\nSelma is a great film. It centers on that fateful symbolic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, back in 1965, and tells the back-story of its coming to be. We follow Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's dream of equal rights for all, amid the sacrifices, bloodshed, and death to many of those heroic protesters.\n\nSelma is a history lesson, but one told with clarity and compassion. (There have been some complains about historical accuracy, objections to President Johnson's hesitant involvement in bringing about the Voting Act of 1965 to end racism. This argument seem to be invalid as the film shows both Johnson and King being politicians foremost, both leaders a product of their times, caught in the quagmire of hatred and conformity. The film never pretends to be a documentary; it is a docudrama, a powerful one, with archival footage and factual documentation that uphold the times accurately.)\n\nAva DuVernay directs the film with an assured hand and an artistic vision that keeps the film riveting and emotionally grounded. There are some moments where the film gets caught up in the sanctimonious speeches and too much moralizing, but the poetic words in Paul Webb's literate screenplay make the film epic in scope and the director's visual images send home King's compelling message. DuVernay builds tension very efficiently, particularly in the clash between protesters and police. There are scenes of sudden violence that are never gratuitous (a bombing of a church, beating of innocent demonstrators, etc.) and are handled with poignancy and humanity.\n\nMaking the film resonant is the central performance by British actor David Oyelowo as the pastor King. He downplays the role beautifully, showing King as a flawed but passionate person, a common man thrust into the spotlight as a national crusader for civil rights. Oyellowo captures King's spirited line delivery as a persuasive orator and has many fine subtle moments as a caring husband. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King give ample support, showing her characters loyalty and inner strength. Their moments together bring about the personal story of this married couples' dependence on each other. The film is so well cast in most of the supporting roles, with special mentions going to Corey Reynolds, Stephan James, Tim Roth, Alessandro Nivola, and especially Tom Wilkinson as a foul-mouthed and savvy L.B.J.\n\nSelma takes its audience on the long harrowing journey for equality with such reverence and restraint. There are a few minor missteps along the way as the film does lose some of its its footing in reality when it uses famous actors like Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen and Dylan Baker, all impersonating real life figures, rather than using lesser known thespians for those roles, or when the film tries to connect the non-violent actions of Dr. King and his followers with the recent protests that led to escalating violence (as in the closing scenes with the song, Glory, mentions of the recent Ferguson unrest.) That said, Selma is a glorious undertaking that documents a historic time when a nation finally looked at the horror perpetrated on a minority and finally found its soul.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Selma\" tells the story of the Voting Rights Marchs from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama of 1965, led by among others, Famed Civil Rights Activist, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., played by David Oyelow. Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended Segregation and gave African- Americans the rights to vote, those right were being restricted, particularly in the state of Alabama. King, and other Civil Rights Activists were invited by the local civil and civic leadership to protest to repression. While King is the central figure, and the movie does some spend time on him and his wife Coretta Scott King's, played by Carmen Ejogo, relationship, and it's how it's effected by King's activism, the movie is not all a mini-biography o the late Dr. King's life at that point, and gives time to a number of the other prominent figures having do with the marches. As reported, the movie does indeed humanize King, perhaps as a metaphor that just as the way our country was flawed back then, Dr. King had his flaws as well. In the end, King is seen as the man who through sacrifices he and others made, endure to achieve the goal of the just cause of equal rights. I loved it \u2013 It was well shot, and well acted \u2013 you simply moved with it. Much credit to Director Ava DuVernay, and the production team, including the one and only Oprah Winfrey, who plays Civil Rights Activist Annie Lee Cooper in the film as well. Oyelowo, while performing Dr. King's speeches in the movie, doesn't try to do a perfect impression of the late Dr. King's voice (though that would have been fine if it had been the case), but does try to capture the physical movements, and powerful vocal style, and all around gives a very effective performance. I still have a few more I want to see, but for 2014 Releases \u2013 this is the best I have seen thus far \u2013 3 \u00be out of 4 Stars, 9 \u00bd out of 10."

There were just not convincing and kept slipping in and out of a mild southern drawl to a mid Atlantic anonymity and back again. Their performances were okay - but not wholly convincing and compromised by the accent issue.\n\nThe film itself deals with Martin Luther King Jr and the 1965 peaceful protest movement to enable legally enfranchised citizens to exercise that franchise - the issue being that black Americans in many states were denied registering to vote by a variety devious means.\n\nThe story moves along well - we see the tensions in and caused by Luther King's approach and it does raise some legitimate questions, for example can a peaceful protest ever be simply that if it evokes a violent response? It also makes the point that a free press is important, with nationwide broadcast of official violence promoting a positive response form across to the country.\n\nOf course any film about Martin Luther King Jr has a hopeless job of competing with the live footage readily available of the man himself but this film makes a good fist of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are looking for entertainment about the civil rights era (a real challenge if you know anything about the civil rights period), and you have no problems with the historical revisionism of the movie, then this is a film you might like. Although I find the idea of making an entertaining film about one of the ugliest periods of American history a fool's errand, I guess the director is entitled to make the attempt to entertain us. . On the other hand, given that the subject matter of the film is the pivotal, dramatic, and violent clashes involving the racist political structures of Selma and Alabama, and the key players of the civil rights movement, one would think that the directory and screen play would capitalize on these dramatic historical events in a compelling retelling of this part of American history. They failed to tell history truthfully. . I had heard about the problems in the portrayal of LBJ in the film, but I didn't realize that historical time lines were also tinkered with for dramatic effect.\n\n*** SPOILER ALERTS ***\n\nThe film starts with Coretta and Martin just before his Nobel award in October of 1964, and then the second scene jumps back more than a year to September of 1963 and the \"16th Street Baptist Church bombing\" where 4 young girls were killed (there is no subtitle to clue in the audience that these scenes were more than a year earlier). They used his 1964 Nobel speech to juxtapose against events that appear to happen at the same time.\n\nIt was clear right from the beginning that the writer and director were not interested in historical accuracy, they were interested in creating their own mythology around historical events. The historical inaccuracy characterizing LBJ as dead set against civil rights and voting rights for blacks is proof that the makers of this film have an agenda to lionize and then canonize MLK. The problem I with the film makers is that don't have to lie about the facts to convince us that MLK was a great man.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for entertainment, there are a lot of other popcorn films that are far better. For history on the civil rights era, better check out the PBS documentary series \"Eyes on the Prize\" (1987 six one hour episodes) and the follow up second season in 1990 of eight one hour episodes)."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?\"\n\nThese harrowing words of bravery in times of adversity truly define what Selma, the unforgettable tale of one of America's greatest leaders, is setting in front of its audiences. With immense power and fearlessness, this film breaks the barriers of what can be said and done on the silver screen, as it unfolds a tale of tragedy and triumph through the eyes of the man who witnessed it first hand. Telling the story of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., Selma does not stop at the simple tossing around of famous names and tragic events with a slight of hand, but digs deeper than most historical films in its quest to lay out the pungent and beautiful life of a man conflicted at every turn.\n\nAmong the great and powerful films of African-American struggles, depicting events from slavery to civil rights, stands Selma, confident in its stride towards giving the people of today a look inside what men and women faced during that time. As films like Lee Daniels' The Butler, Lincoln, and 12 Years A Slave take these conflicts and shed light on their indecent horrors, Selma yearns to do the same, as it focuses on not only the man at the front lines, but also the frightened yet inspired citizens who fight, with or without violence, towards their life goals. A fan of films of this nature, depicting the true lives of men and women who tackle their conflicts in the very real world, Selma was a harrowing delight to my eyes. Spilling out immense emotion and power at every turn, from King's many preaches to the shocking acts of violence thrown into the streets of Selma, this film is among the many films I will never forget.\n\nAccompanied by a fluent and emotional plot of one man's determination to make things as they should be for everyone, the performances in the film are some of the best I've seen all year. With David Oyelowo leading the pack of striking actors who deliver some of their best works here, Selma packs together a cast of unlikely proportions, but never fails to leave a character out in the sun. Starting with our leading man, Mr. Oyelowo, whom I've only seen in supporting roles in films like Jack Reacher and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, he shows us that he can obviously take the lead as he knocks Martin Luther King Jr. out of the park (figuratively, of course). Equipped with King's subtle facial features, as well as the activist's signature way with words, Oyelowo takes no prisoners with this amazing performance. With every word he spoke, from the famous speeches to the innocent conversations with Carmen Ejogo, who plays King's wife, Oyelowo suspends time and takes our attention with force to focus solely on him. With such an jolting performance as one of America's most influential people, Oyelowo is sure to be among the great men of film recognized this year as award season continues to ignite around us.\n\nThe rest of the cast is phenomenal as they play some of the top men and women who followed King in his daring quest. From Oprah Winfrey's Annie Lee Cooper to Tom Wilkinson's President Johnson, the cast does an amazing job portraying these influential people, not leaving a single character out of place. Whether it be a conflicted civilian or a political figure like Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), who appears only for five minutes, Selma succeeds not only in dropping big names of the era, but developing a complex story that intertwines each character with one another. Other powerful performances (some not on King's side) include Tim Roth's striking role as Governor Wallace, with his Southern drawl and all, as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as Attorney Fred Gray, who appears for only a short while, but still gives a great performance.\n\nWith a film full of seemingly dreary politics and long speeches, you would think there is little excitement in order to hold you over for two hours. However, I will tell you different. There is nothing more exciting and gripping than this tale, a tale of terrorism and heroism, adversity and bravery, deception and redemption. Selma may have politics and speeches, but they are not speeches forced onto you as a history lesson, they are more like lessons placed in front of you for you to ponder over, thinking of how they affect our daily lives. The words of such a legend as Martin Luther King Jr. are not to be forgotten, but treasured, as this film glorifies the role this man served in the lives of millions of people, black and white alike. Selma takes pride as it mixes the rush of protest with the voices of truth in a beautifully complex vision of how corrupt yet monumental this time really was.\n\nOverall, this was by far one of the best biopics I've seen in a while, packed full of emotion and wisdom. Centered on such an amazing figure in such a dark time, Selma tackles King's legacy perfectly, as well as letting us peek into the lives of some of the great people he touched with his words. With only minor flaws, like some jumbled dialogue here and there, this film is another near perfect biopic that I hope to see at the head of some of the biggest awards in film.\n\nI gave this film a 9 out of 10 for its unforgettable lead actor David Oyelowo (who I hope to see on the stage with an Oscar in his hands soon enough), its great supporting cast that delivers dynamic performances all around, and its moving story of one of the most influential eras in American history.\n\nCheck out my blog for more reviews: silverscreensynopsis.blogspot.com"

So she wrote King's speech lines for the movie. So there is some lack of icon but the personal perspective is where the movie shines.\n\nHistory is names, dates, places....

Duvernay delivers some jolting recreations that touch the heart.\n\nMartin Sheen appears as a federal district judge.

Particularly the portrayal of Lyndon Johnson. But this is not necessarily the point of a film... if it gets people to look into civil rights history more, good for everyone involved! The portrayal of King is excellent. Not just the acting (which is superb), but its fairness. It is all too easy to show him as a martyr or a saint. This film did neither. By avoiding his assassination and actually bringing up his infidelity, he comes across as very human, and someone who accomplished great things despite his personal failings.\n\nThis is also a breakout role for Tim Roth. Although best known for \"Reservoir Dogs\", Roth is a top notch actor and he proves it here as the villain. The Oscar buzz is around the failure to nominate Ava DuVernay as director, but perhaps Roth should be looked at again for supporting actor."

The flow of the plot was staggered and I found it difficult to really associate with the characters. It is quite 2 dimensional and, though good in parts, on the whole it was just not good story telling - which is unnerving given how good a story it was to start with.\n\nIn all, the only thing I found surprising was how such an important event, when dramatised, could fall so flat... a nice Sunday afternoon film when you are nibbling cheese and biscuits and chatting occasionally."

Above all, though, this is the film that bothers to take its research very seriously. As many of us, I have studied in depth the Rights Movement. The attention to historic detail, without glorification or hagiography is commendable. The attempts to use actors that look like the person they portray, excellent, and the tone and mood of the film is a truly fitting depiction.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement took the impetus and teachings of Gandhi (King traveled to India and stayed in Ashrams in 1959 in order to understand NVDA) and coupled that with the true spirit of Southern Baptism - and found their leader in King.\n\nThere has been nothing like Attenborough's Gandhi for King. Partly because of internal rights (and it is too complicated to explain here, but worth research) and partly because other attempts have not captured the true spirit of both sides. Where Selma succeeds massively is that it captures deeply what both sides believed in - the incredible bigotry is shown as is - the film shows that morality, justice, and the dignity of men lies in justice and fairness and that such freedoms are worth all; then and now. This is a film that inspires young and old people and reminds us all that we can do and do better.\n\nSelma is a clear and sincere historical account of the events of late summer 1965 that would lead to LBJ enacting the Vote Act - it is powerful tribute to one of the most important events of 20th Century American history."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every year, there has to be a civil rights/slavery film, right? Well, in case you hadn't understood the inhumanity of slavery and/or segregation yet, here's another history lesson to remind and make you cry. Selma focuses on a very, very brief portion of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life in his valiant march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama so as to protest and pressure Lyndon B. Johnson into finally passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Although African-Americans technically had the right to vote during this time, there was nothing stopping the white authorities from intimidating black people far away from voting booths. Martin Luther King, Jr. will not have any of it though, and David Oyelowo, in his remarkable depiction of King, certainly conveys this through his partially melancholic and partially fierce \"enough-of- this!\" eyes. Aside from the striking resemblance to the esteemed civil rights leader, Oyelowo absolutely brings everything he emotionally has within him to the platform during every one of his profound and furious speeches.\n\nAnd given the perfect timing of the film's release, relevant more than ever in the midst of relentless police brutality and continuing African-American injustice, the ferocity of the movement here is undoubtedly inspiring and rousing. The wonderful ensemble\u2014including the likes of Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, and Common\u2014all know what's at stake in the past and present, but Tom Wilkinson (as President Johnson) and Tim Roth (as the repugnant George Wallace) also add contemplation and determined vehemence, respectively, to the opposing side. The lachrymose 60's soundtrack plays to ferociously shot and edited sequences of the marches and the consequential police brutality that strikes back.\n\nIf you can't tell by now, my writing seems to be largely formed by sentimentality and closeness to the horrific predicament at hand in 2014 America. Frankly, Selma is a film that affects more through sentimental bias than anything else. Once everything is said and done\u2014 once a colder and more objective perspective that strips the relevance of the subject matter has been established\u2014Selma really is a standard biopic that actually doesn't develop King into that much of a compelling character. The picture does make sure to highlight the usual family drama that occurs behind closed doors in every biopic from Malcolm X to Lincoln, but I just couldn't see enough of the man besides the obviously glorious, saintly portrait in which he's painted.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of the few marches/protests that rivetingly transpire throughout the film's duration, the pacing is unexpectedly plodding, and that's in large part because of how little material the film has to work with. Conversations that drag on for far too long essentially focus on one element of conversation: the planned march and of its hopeful results. Imagine that continuing on for a 2+- hour movie. Add in the fact that Selma suffers from quite a bit of historical inaccuracies, including the more negative representation of Lyndon B. Johnson, solely to implement further dramatic weight and conflict as overly-dramatized Hollywood films typically love to indulge themselves in.\n\nOf course, it'll still be an overwhelmingly celebrated film in its year of release much like 12 Years a Slave was last year (even though The Wolf of Wall Street and Her come up in more discussions a year later). It happens every time with the critics and awards industry players. Ask yourself: will Selma\u2014a finely-crafted film that means well but is narratively and creatively forgettable/safe\u2014honestly be remembered more than fascinatingly daring content this year like Inherent Vice and Interstellar?"

Selma is the true story of Martin Luther King Jr., fellow African Americans, and even some White Americans as they fought to secure equal voting rights for all Americans. The performance given by David Oyelowo as MLK is reason enough to watch this movie. He was powerful and inspiring, just as MLK was and delivered his lines with strength and emotion. The screenplay by Paul Webb was amazingly written and ingeniously structured. He wrote without limits to reveal the actual pain and violence of the time. At some points, it was hard to watch, but that is the truth. That's what happened and there is no denying the truth behind this fascinating and inspiring story. Selma is truly a piece of history. I give it 8/10 stars and wish it good luck in the upcoming awards season."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is an old saying that art - even the glossy, fanciful stuff that you see written about in the all the fancy magazines and news articles - does have some bottom-line commercial concerns, as well as providing a form of entertainment.\n\nThere is also something to be said about motion pictures regarding real-life historical events. While they are made to bring attention to, or bring to life either long-forgotten or recent events in history, they are, at base level, concerned primarily with providing a form of entertainment, and will sometimes fudge the real-life facts for the sake of providing said entertainment.\n\nAny film based on true-life events will face this problem. I would guess that for anyone wanting 100% facts, then they should go watch a documentary or go read a book.\n\nI just got done watching Ava DuVernay's 2014 Oscar-Winner \"Selma,\" about the marches and demonstrations in 1965 in Selma, Alabama, that led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which extended voting rights to all people of color. The timing of the release of \"Selma\" could not have been more perfect, in my eyes.\n\nI first heard about \"Selma\" late last year, probably around this time, actually. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unceremoniously struck down a crucial portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - specifically Section 4(b), which was for the so-called \"coverage formula\" for jurisdictions, mostly in the South, with proved, documented histories of egregious voting discriminations, including, regretfully, my home state of Virginia - a moment in recent history that shamefully received very little coverage in the news media of the time and to this day almost three years later still infuriates me.\n\n(It both saddens and frustrates me to think about how with the stroke of a pen, how so much has been lost in the 50 years since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law.)\n\nAnd then, the 50th anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday\" was just this past March (March 7), an event which also did not receive a whole lot of coverage in the media, but I do remember seeing a few items on the news and on Facebook (of all places) of people, many of whom were there in 1965, walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge - just as they had done 50 years earlier.\n\nAnd \"Selma\" was released during the time between the two momentous occasions.\n\nThese events in recent history - and the current racial unrest and unease in this country - only serve to increase the demand that all Americans see \"Selma.\" I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time, but I only recently gave it a viewing today. I had heard long before I saw \"Selma\" that DuVernay's film was not entirely true to historical events, in particular the relationship between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo, who received a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, but was shunned by the Oscars) and then-United States President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). I know from my understanding of history that President Johnson was actually the greatest political ally of the Civil Rights Movement, but was still under enormous pressure to go through with his own \"Great Society\" programs and the escalating U.S. military conflict in Vietnam. In other words, they both wanted the same thing - the dismantling of Jim Crow - but just had different responsibilities and priorities.\n\nIn fact, according to one analysis of the picture and this slight by Slate earlier this year, \"...By hardening Johnson - and making him a larger roadblock than he was - DuVernay emphasizes the grass roots of the movement and the particular struggles of King and his allies. In the long argument of who matters most - activists or politicians - DuVernay falls on the side of the former; showing how citizens can expand the realm of the possible and give politicians the push - and the room - they need to act.\"\n\nIn other words, the film is mostly about the activists who drove the federal government into drafting and eventually passing the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law - and it is largely told from their perspective. In fact, the two biggest stumbling blocks encountered by both the activists, led by King, and the federal government, led by Johnson, are FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth); in real life, it was actually U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy who authorized the FBI wiretaps and harassment of Dr. King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders in an attempt to discredit his leadership and link him to the Communist Party (the film depicts Johnson authorizing this, not Kennedy), and George Wallace often used the police to violently suppress peaceful demonstrations in his state, like on \"Bloody Sunday.\"\n\nAva DuVernay's film isn't perfect; it's a little too wishy-washy in its liberal depiction of an extremely violent time in American history. But still, after seeing this movie finally (and taking into consideration recent historical events), I have now confirmed my feeling that \"Selma\" is the film that should have won Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year, but was shamefully overlooked by the Academy. That it only received one Oscar win (for \"Glory\" by Common and John Legend), which I suspect was done to placate certain members of the audience, is a real disservice to one of the greatest moments in American history that took place just 50 years ago.\n\n10/10"

I was also impressed with Tom Wilkinson as a President Lyndon Johnson who seemed reluctant to deal with the voting rights march in Selma as something to deal with head on but seemed on the way to all out support by the end. In summary, Selma was quite a fine historical drama about a very important moment in civil rights history."

        "review_detailed_main": "The directing for Selma was pedestrian but not terrible for a first-timer. The camera work offers no surprises nor innovations and there is nothing about the blocking of scenes, whether in churches, on the streets or on the bridge, that enhances the action and drama. The upshot is that Selma is mainly by the books directing but over use of camera gimmickry didn't distract us from the story. It's average and adequate, not terrible, directing.\n\nGive credit to the writers and director for showing the flaws and foibles as well as the successes and brilliance of Dr. King in his entirety. No man is perfect, and to portray him as such would have been a discredit to his legacy. Not only are his oft presented infidelities touched upon, but his doubts about his abilities and his leadership mistakes are also part of the film. What makes King and so many leaders in the film remarkable is that they overcame their imperfections to do great things.\n\nDavid Oyelowo put in an Oscar worthy performance as Dr. King but failed to get a nomination. His character wasn't mentally or physically challenged, and let's face, not White. Yes, and his name isn't Denzel Washington. But if you play a White man who admits to killing dozens of people, that earns you an Oscar nod. I haven't seen \"Sniper\", and I am sure Mr. Cooper is great. However, this is an unfortunate slight given the difficulty of playing the historical legend and the quality of the performance.\n\nOne of my favorite actresses from last year, Tessa Thompson of \"Dear White People\", plays the firebrand radical Diane Nash. She doesn't get nearly enough screen time for me. However, she probably got the time her character warranted for the story. Actors playing Andrew Young (Andre Holland) and John Lewis (Stephen James) are also excellent. Nigel Thatch in a brief appearance plays Malcolm X perfectly. And the always entertaining Tim Roth plays to his strength of portraying deranged men, this time, Gov. Wallace.\n\nOne unfortunate choice was putting a rap song at the end of the movie when there are so many period songs or spirituals that would be more appropriate. I assume it was part of the deal to fund the film and get Common on board as one of the actors. \"Glory\" is a good song, and Legend is a great singer. And if it got the movie produced, fine. It is, however, out of place.\n\nAs for the controversy about LBJ: Tom Wilkinson does a good job portraying the conflicted president. From what I know about Johnson, the portrait was fair and accurate. Carmen Ejogo played Coretta King with the dignity required, though her role suffered from inattentive writing and wasn't well flushed out.\n\nRating: Pay Full Matin\u00e9e Price\n\nSelma is entertaining though too long in moments. Tighter editing would have helped with the pacing. A bigger budget may have given the director more opportunities to be creative with the shots. The angles, lighting and pacing didn't match the gravity of the story. The dialogue worked well for the time and place of the movie.\n\nPeace, Tex Shelters"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is called Selma, NOT \"The Martin Luther King Jr. Story\", for a reason. The intensity and significance of the Civil Rights movement is captured all through one seemingly small, but ultimately huge, demonstration. And while King's a more than prominent part of this story, and is even the de facto protagonist, Selma was a victory for more than one individual, and DuVernay and co. know that. With a beautiful lead performance by Oyelowo, this is stirring and engrossing dramatic filmmaking that humanizes history and an icon, embracing every part of the ugly truth. Selma doesn't rely on lazy-biopic gimmicks to catch us up to speed. The filmmakers rightly assume a basic knowledge of King and his impact. This gives the story room to breathe, letting the depth of details and emotions hold the screen over dry facts. We get to see the heartbreak of the injustice up-close, the politicking of all reigning parties (including a fascinating look at the White House), the fear and difficulty inherent in true non-violent protests, and the ultimate hope of goals reached. The script has a few dull moments that could've hit the editing room floor, and some of the casting could be seen as stereotypes, but there is intentionality to director DuVernay's subtly dusty yet intensely personal film. Really, it's hard not to feel personal about Selma, given the state of current racial unrest. We are far from past the teachings of Dr. King, but a devastating-yet-forward-looking film like this can help us learn to see the complexity inherit and necessity in justice. Selma isn't emotionally manipulative; it is emotionally necessary."

        "review_title": "\"Selma\" explores the strategy of the Civil Rights movement and its mastermind",
        "review_detailed_main": "No 20th century figure looms as large as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and no film could possibly encapsulate who he was and what he did over the course of his short but powerful lifetime. But in \"Selma,\" director Ava DuVernay and writer Paul Webb find an ideal window of time through which to explore King's influence and not as a dreamer, but as a strategist.\n\nThe film examines the chess moves that took place leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a critical piece of legislation that removed many of the barriers keeping African-Americans away from the voting booth. In early 1965, King (David Oyelowo) arrives in Selma after being unable to convince President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) of making swift changes to protect the black right to vote. Knowing the only way he can make change is to double dow on peaceful protest and make more headlines in the news, he begins planning with members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and ultimately challenges Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth), risking lives in order to get the federal government to act.\n\nEmotion layers every part of \"Selma,\" but Webb's script has a definitive focus on tactics and explores the political maneuvering behind affecting actual change. Today, we regard the Civil Rights Movement and King's methods as one of the most effective efforts to enact social and political change and \"Selma\" shows just how calculated - not impulsive - those methods were.\n\nAt the same time, the film suggests King was riddled with doubt. The man we know to be resolute if not stubborn in his will was keenly aware of the consequences for his fellow man. Oyelowo's best work as King comes in emulating his incredible oratory skills rather than the behind-the-scenes moments, but he's compelling nonetheless and captures both the strong leadership and humanity of this legendary figure.\n\nStill, the film operates best when it explores King as strategist and the dynamics on both sides of the board trying to plot their next move. The little character moments with King and, for example, his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) don't hold as much weight or attention. On the other hand, the way King interacts with others in the movement, like the father of a young protester killed by Selma police, show King's pastoral nature and bring deep humanity to the story. Those moments, when human consequences converge with the top view of change-making are when \"Selma\" shines most. The film just needs more of them.\n\nDuVernay also seems like a director best suited with that kind of material. The actors carry the brunt of conveying all the dialogue-heavy gamesmanship scenes for her, but she does best with moments like in the beginning when Oprah's Annie Cooper goes to the courthouse and tries registering to vote. That scene is a mere microcosm of what's discussed in the film, but it stands out because we can relate to it and feel for the character.\n\nThe analytical side and the emotional side of \"Selma\" seem a bit at odds with each other through most of the film, but when they come together, they make for the kind of cinematic moments you want from a prestige picture like this. \"Selma\" is also pretty good when one side clearly overtakes the other, but admittedly it makes for a less cohesive finished product. Nevertheless, the film honors the pivotal piece of history it portrays and the key figure at its center.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

Even though I found this movie to sometimes be a little confusing and slow, I recommend it to those who enjoy history. This Civil Rights movie is mainly historically accurate and supplies the viewer with a better understanding of the demonstrations done in Selma. Including the famous march from Selma to Montgomery.

As multiple characters associated with each other, the feelings among characters became evident. These feelings played an ever increasing role in the film as families were broken up and friendships were lost. It was these dramatic events though, that led to an increasing feeling of despair, until a remarkable moment of triumph was witnessed. I found that David Oyelowo, the actor playing Martian Luther King Jr., was extremely powerful with his words, drawing me into the screen, and enabling me to envision that I was there in the moment. One thing that I found interesting, and frankly unbelievable, was that after multiple incidents with police and angry white men, Annie Lee Cooper, played by Oprah Winfrey, was still alive. However, this, in addition to a false relationship between Johnson and King (President Johnson supported the Civil Rights Movement more than was made evident in the film), was the only inaccuracy that I could clearly identify. Overall, the film was very well done. I would definitely categorize this film as an inspirational, yet historical, film. This is definitely a film that would inspire one to try to make a difference in the world. Happy viewing!"

Perhaps the most Obvious is that without a \"White Savior\" like President Johnson there wouldn't have been a Civil Rights Movement, as we know it. Johnson Pushed Legislation, therefore Sanctioning and Legitimizing the Concerns with the essential Backup of Federal Law.\n\nThe Cause would have Stalled and been Dominated by the Southern \"White Supremacist\" Dixiecrat Mindset of Governors (Wallace) and His ilk, Law Enforcement (Sheriff Jim Clark, Hoover) that were Racists Overlords carrying some mighty Big Sticks.\n\nThe usually Reliable Tom Wilkinson is just Awful with His Portrayal of President Johnson, in Real Life LBJ was a strong Supporter from the Get Go. Wilkinson shows no signs of Immersing in the Role and is an irritating Bore the way He is Acted and more Significantly Written. The Same Can Be said of Tim Roth as George Wallace. No Fleshing Out, just some Smirks and Line Readings.\n\nDavid Oyelowo as Dr. King is, when not behind the podium, a Gazing Ghost and seems Lost in an Etherland of Self-Reflection and Myopic Mental Meanderings. The Soul of MLK is Missing and the Great Civil Rights Leader is shown to be an Inanimate Introspect.\n\nOverall, the Movie is only sporadically Effective invoking the Struggle and the Film comes off as an Irrelevant Redundancy when put Next to the Verbiage and Documentaries on the Subject.\n\nIt Seems Hesitant, Reluctant, and often times Pouty about its Concerns and Historical Significance. Overrated, Undercooked, and in the End, a Big Disappointment."

This film not only boasts a strong cast and performances but gives a realistic showcase of the events that took place during the civil rights movement. In some scenes, it will have you cheering for the bravery of the characters and in other scenes it will leave you have you in shock. Overall, Selma is pure entertainment.\n\nSelma follows the story of Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, and his effort on garnering equal rights for African Americans. His efforts however, put the lives of people around him in danger. David Oyelowo's performance as King was amazing and definitely \"Oscar material\". I love scenes when King was speaking in front of everyone, his speeches were inspiring and interesting to listens to. The best scene is the march in Montgomery and the police attacks that it leads to. The scene was so realistic and probably the most powerful scene in the movie.\n\nI recommend this movie to everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie Selma, directed by Ava DuVernay is a beautifully realized reminder of the struggle for black voting rights half a century ago. Casting was so perfect that viewers who know the real-life characters can easily identify Andy Young (Andr\u00e9 Holland), John Lewis (Stephan James), and other era heroes. (As a Detroit native, I'm glad to see the movie remembered murdered Viola Liuzzo.) Some commenters have quibbled with the movie's historical accuracy\u2014especially the portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson\u2014but it isn't a documentary, after all, and the presentation is probably more accurate than not. In a personal conversation, a White House insider at the time told me he heard Johnson said to King, \"You have to force me to do what I want to do.\" The political risks were too great (and chances of success too small) for Johnson to act unilaterally on voting rights, but if the pressure and public outrage became strong enough\u2014as they did become after Bloody Sunday\u2014he would act and did.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is inspiring as Rev. Martin Luther King\u2014thoughtful but fiery when he needed to be, and he has King's oratorical cadences down perfectly. Tom Wilkinson is always good, but I missed Lyndon's Texas accent. Oprah, awesome. And Wendell Pierce could just stand anywhere, and I'd be with him a hundred percent. The whole cast, sincere and convincing.\n\nMy biggest frustration about the movie is the reaction to it. I hope leaders (black and white) use the triumphal feeling it engenders to remind people how important the courage and sacrifices of the Movement were. (And those of the Suffragettes before them.) But what's happening now? People\u2014black and white, men and women\u2014don't even bother to use their vote. They may vote for President every four years, but the person at the pinnacle has a lot less influence over our daily lives than the people in the state house, the mayor's office, the township committee, the local school board. Good or bad, those people get picked in the primary elections which have even lower voter turnout, except among extremists. When people don't vote in primaries, every extremist's vote counts more. Meanwhile, Johnson's big contribution--the Voting Rights Act--is being chipped away at in state legislatures. Perhaps the movie will be an educational and motivational tool, so that effective campaigns can be mounted against new voting restrictions and so that all Americans recognize that there's no point in feeling good about this pivotal struggle of 50 years ago if we let it lapse into meaninglessness through apathy today. As the movie so strongly suggests, Rev. King would consider this heartbreaking."

Before directing 'Selma.\" Ava DuVernay had directed several notable projects. Her feature film directorial debut was \"I Will Follow\" in 2010, followed by \"Middle of Nowhere\" in 2012. She gained critical acclaim and recognition for her documentary \"13th\" in 2016, which explored racial inequality in the American criminal iustice svstem.\n\nAva DuVernay's body of work demonstrates her versatility as a director, with projects spanning across various genres and subject matters. While she has directed historical dramas like \"Selma\" and socially relevant documentaries like \"13th.\" she has also explored other genres and narrative styles, showcasing her range and skill as a filmmaker.\n\nDespite being the first film to portray this historical event, this team has nailed it: The whole team of this film acts as convincingly as possible. It portrays the event so realistic that you think you are part of the film It cantivates vou and shows how hard its was for the African-Americans at that time\n\nIt really shows how important it is to fight for justice and freedom. The film notes that its is important to know, that you can't always trust the rolitirians It also portrays the success of non-violent protests The dark lighting creates this gloomy atmosphere, showing the emotions of the characters more precise.\n\nThis mood helps to understand the struggle of Martin Luther King even better.\n\nAll in all, the movie creates a fantastic experience and does great, in portraying the struggle of Martin Luther King and his movement."

In a time in which racial discrimination is still an important issue, this chronicle of events regarding King's fight for voting equalities in Alabama, presents us with a vision of how the tension between the two sides was even more intense during a period of controversy and change. The movie's goals are to give you this retelling of the struggle and hopefully connect with the audience, while also honoring the heroes behind the progress that was achieved.\n\nThe plot revolves around MLK's attempts to grant his fellow people the right to be registered voters in their town of Selma. It isn't without resistance that this movement will be met, and from then on the movie lays out the advancements and regressions that ultimately led to the achievement of the objective that was set. As our protagonist we have British actor David Oyelowo who proves he is more than capable of portraying this iconic figure. When it comes down to it, the character is without a doubt brilliantly interpreted by Oyelowo and throughout the film, one feels that the end result of the performance is a signature portrayal by the actor who owns the character from the moment the camera is on, and in return the character lives through the actor. All in all a mixture of characteristics that combine to give an extraordinary rendition of an extraordinary human being.\n\nThe movie comes together quite nicely and aspects such as the direction from Ava DuVernay and the competent script are all adequate for each other, offering a rich cinematic experience. I really hope Selma has a healthy staying power among liberating movies such as Glory, 12 Years A Slave, etc. It truly is deserving.\n\nRating: 8,5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma (2014) was directed by Ava DuVernay. It stars David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. The story of the film is based on reality--50 years ago thousands of brave people attempted to walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and were terrorized by local and state police before they finally succeeded.\n\nA disclaimer at the end of the film tells us that, although the movie is based on actual events, it isn't a documentary. Fair enough-- Shakespeare's History plays aren't based on strict facts and chronology either. What we want from this film is fact that is portrayed dramatically, and \"Selma\" delivers.\n\nIt's probably hard for young people to believe that segregation and race hatred were the norm in our nation just 50 years ago. (Yes, the South was worse than other parts of the country, but segregation was everywhere.) We now take it for granted that everyone has the right to vote, and that we can have an African-American President.\n\n\"Selma\" shows us how this progress came about. It came about because of the incredible bravery of African-American people, and because of the astute tactics of the leaders of the civil rights movement.\n\nBoth Oyelowo and Ejogo are superb actors, and very believable in their roles. Oyelowo looks something like Dr. King, so we can say, \"close enough.\" Ejogo looks exactly like Coretta Scott King--I found the resemblance uncanny.\n\nThis movie will repay your time by providing both history and drama. The story needs to be heard by young people, but, in my opinion, the violence is so terrible, and so realistic, that young children shouldn't be in the audience. That's too bad, because--aside from that caveat-- I think everyone should be in the audience. We need to hold on to this part of our history to remember where we were, where we are, and how we got from there to here.\n\nThe movie will probably work better on the large screen, but, if you can't see it in a theater, see it on DVD. Just be sure to see it!\n\nNote on the IMDb rating: As I'm writing this review, \"Selma\" has an excellent rating of 7.7. However, the distribution of votes is strange. 68% of reviewers gave it an 8, 9, or 10. However, 424 people--almost 9%--rated the film as 1. I'm going to start a thread asking, \"Why did you give this film a rating of 1?\" People who gave it a rating of 1 must have had their reasons. What were those reasons? We'll see who answers, and what they say."

The two people that left during the movie rushed out and hurried back to their seats, an indication they did not want to miss any part of this historic presentation.\n\nAs someone who is reasonably astute about the Civil Rights era, I found Selma to be a reminder of how far America has advanced as a nation in some areas, yet lacking in others. The movie's depiction of the relationship with police officers to the violence and racism towards Blacks of the Civil Rights era is remarkable similar to the relationships with the African American community today. Upon leaving the theater, my husband and I discussed the similarity of their actions to incidents like Mike Brown in Ferguson,MO and Eric Garner in NY and countless others. That mindset still exist today.\n\nThe casting and acting was impeccable with David Ayelowo who played Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King looking very similar to their real life characters. I also want to commend the background artists, some of whom are my colleagues who spent countless hours in the hot sun to help make this movie a success."

This movie will also be a great learning tool for educators. In addition, this movie will be a great way to bring awareness across cultures and generations. As we are not very far removed from this movement, only a few generations back. The movie Selma is uplifting, encouraging, well acted, great delivery, engaging and entertaining. We are all conscious of how we spend our money, spending approx. $13 for entertainment that will be educational, inspiring and thought provoking is well worth it.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe.\" Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been passed, African Americans are still struggling for voting equality. President Johnson isn't willing to help Martin Luther King Jr. (Oyelowo) in this movement until after the election cycle. When a group of African American's decide to March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama in order to raise awareness they are attacked and beaten. Left with no other option Martin Luther King decides to join in the next march while President Johnson and Governor Wallace are stuck in the middle of the ethical debate. Before I watched this movie all I heard about was how it was snubbed by the Oscars for Actor and Director. \"How can a movie only be up for best picture and nothing else?\" I went in with that mindset. After watching this I have to say I agree with the nomination. The movie is very good and very much worth seeing. The pacing of the movie was very jerky though. Just when the movie becomes tense it begins to slow down and loses the momentum it had going for it. Oyelowo did a really good job playing Dr. King, but he seemed to lack passion in the speeches and it felt like he was trying to just re-create what he watched the real Dr. King do. On the other hand though, when you are playing someone that iconic you are more or less not trying to screw it up and the tenseness of playing Dr. King really showed. All of that said though the movie is very good and I do recommend it. Overall, this is one of the better movies of the year, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. Much like The Butler it is not deserving of multiple awards even though the subject matter is important. I disappointingly give this a B."

        "review_detailed_main": "'SELMA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014, and another big Oscar hopeful, is this historical drama film about the 1965 voting rights marches, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.. It was directed by Ava DuVernay (who made history this year by being the first black female director to ever be nominated for a Golden Globe award) and written by first time feature film writer Paul Webb. The movie stars David Oyelowo as King and costars Tom Wilkinson, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr. and many others. It's drawn controversial criticisms, from some, for being historically inaccurate in it's portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson and DuVernay was also forced to write new versions of King's speeches, for the movie, due to another film studio owning the rights to them. While the movie is not one of my favorite films of the year, I do still think it's one of the most important.\n\nThe film tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (Oyelowo) three month long battle to secure equal voting rights, in 1965; alongside James Bevel (Common), Rev. Horsea Williams (Wendell Pierce), John Lewis (Stephan James) and other civil rights activists. The film details the historical march they led, from Selma to Montgomery, and the horrendous opposition they faced, from bigoted legal forces. Wilkinson plays President Johnson; who was eventually persuaded to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as a result of their heroic actions. Critics of the film say Johnson is displayed too much as an opponent to King, when he in fact was a compassionate ally. Historians are divided on the truth to these claims.\n\nThe film contains a Golden Globe award winning song, titled 'Glory' (performed by Common and John Legend), which references the current protests in Ferguson. I think the parallels drawn between the struggles of equality now, with the 60s, show how much King and other protesters were able to accomplish, while still illustrating how far we need to go today. This is why I think 'SELMA' is one of the most important movies of the year, despite it being far from perfect. Oyelowo is fantastic in the lead and Winfrey, Wilkinson and others give good performances as well; but I think actors like Ejogo and Common are a bit lacking, in their roles. At times the movie feels a little too melodramatic, and slow paced; it also doesn't quite feel like it reaches it's full emotional potential (it seems like the subject matter could have been even more moving and inspiring). I do think DuVernay did a great job directing the film but perhaps the screenplay could have used a little more fine- tuning. I don't have a problem with the possible historical inaccuracies of the story; it's an artistic interpretation of events, not a documentary, and it's impossible to say who's right or wrong in such debates. While I do think the movie could have been even better I still think it's a really well made film and one that needs to be seen, by pretty much everyone.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/fbw9P594Crc"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Selma David Oyelowo portraits the legendary historical figure Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The story joins Dr. King from his Noble Peace Prize award presentation in Oslo Norway in 1965 through his famous march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama. The film pin points several key moments and people in this violent and turbulent time in history. Some powerful moments include Dr. King's meetings with LBJ played very convincingly by Tom Wilkinson. This is a tour de force cast with Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Martin Sheen and Common to name a few. Let me start off by saying that this is a very important film that everyone should see, as a means to become more acquainted with this important time in history. Each actor with major roles in the film played actual people in history, not just random plot driving fictional vehicles. Tim Roth is phenomenal as George Wallace, the racist governor of Alabama. Dylan Baker does a very convincing J. Edgar Hoover, a better cast than Leonardo DiCaprio in J. Edgar (2013). But at the heart of this film is David Oyelowo, carefully playing one of the most iconic and important men in American history. A lot rides on the shoulders of an actor who plays that role. You don't want to be doing an SNL sketch type parody of Dr. King, despite how easy it could be to jump into his iconic speech patterns. Oyelowo, brings great heart and spirit to show us a deeper look at Dr. King. I think it's a more intimate portrayal that shows more pain, worry and self-doubt than ever before. Oyelowo's performance is the best part of this film. As for the directing, I feel the director Ava Duvernay was a little in over her head in a project of this magnitude. Her directing expertise has been limited to a few independent films, shorts and television episodes. In a recent interview on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, Duvernay pointed out that she is an independent film director. As she put it, a person who films people talking in rooms. Despite some amazing performance, Selma plays out like a History Channel or HBO miniseries. I think a more experienced director should have been called in for this project. Overall Selma made me deeply reflect on the rights I and most Americans take so arrogantly for granted. It's sad we live in a country that would rather vote for a TV game show winner than for State and Local officials. I think it's extremely short sighted to think of what Dr. King did only as it directly relates to African Americans in this country. Dr. King's message was about everyone having a voice, so that the powers that govern us reflect the wants and needs of the people. We are not living out Dr. King's dream without that voice.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"

Also there were times I wished it had sub-titles because I could not make out what was being said. This didn't help in fully appreciating the story. Nonetheless, a fascinating look at past events."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first IMDb review. I was so moved by this movie that I felt it was necessary to write one. I am a black male. My mom dragged me to this movie. I did not like the Butler -which she loved- and did not see 12 years a slave. Honestly, I am tired of these types of movies. But boy was I wrong about Selma.\n\n*Spoiler Alert The movies starts with a dramatic scene. You hear young girls in a church talking about Coretta Scott King's hair. I thought this was a very powerful scene. You could imagine that girls of a similar age might talk about our First Lady -Michelle Obama- and how and she wears her hair. They were talking about how much they admired her. Then boom you see the church blow up in the famous bombing. I wasn't expecting that. I knew about the incident, but it was enough of a surprise that it grabbed my attention.\n\n*End of Spoilers-- From there you see the main actor absolutely BECOME Martin Luther King. David's performance was nothing short of spectacular. He really embodied MLK. He sounded like him. He talked like him. He was him. Even though he does not really look just like him at times you close your eyes and feel as if you are hearing MLK speak. He was very strong with his sermons and speeches throughout the movie. I was also impressed that the director wrote the speeches because of copywrite reasons.\n\nWhere I thought the movie truly shined was that it gave you a behind the scenes look at the politics behind the march at Selma. *Spoiler - A lot has been made about supposed historical inaccuracies between MLK and Lyndon Johnson (LBJ). I couldn't disagree more. From what we know about LBJ he was a very complex man. The movie does not paint him as necessarily racist. It shows him as a POLITICIAN. It shows him as a man concerned with his legacy. I thought this was very believable. History has told us that yes Johnson did care about civil rights. And I thought the movie showed that he did with his conversation with George Wallace. But it is not inaccurate to say that he cared about playing politics. He wanted to create a legacy. He wanted to stand on the right side of history. To me it kind of seemed like how Abraham Lincoln receives praise for freeing the slaves, when really all he cared about was preserving the union. Does that make Abraham Lincoln a bad person or what he did any less commendable? I think not.\n\nThis quote from LBJ really sums up how the movie dealt with the LBJ/MLK relationship. \"These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference... I'll have them n***** voting Democratic for the next two hundred years\".\n\nTo me the movie painted LBJ not as a saint as some would like it, but as a complex man who did have some progessive views on race for a Southern Democrat, played politics, did not seem to be terribly racist, but wasn't the white saint/savior some people hope for. I digress sorry for this rant.\n\nAs far as Tom Wilkinson's portrayal seemed fair and he did an adequate job playing the character.\n\nAs for MLK he was not painted as a saint either. We see a man who has some demons. We get a very dramatic scene between him and Coretta where she asks him about his extra-marital affairs. It was very well done and the director was not afraid to go there and present a balanced view of who MLK was.\n\nThis movie really did keep me on the edge of my seat. What I think worked the best was the fact that it followed a short period of time. This allowed for more detail. We got to see those meetings between MLK and his inner circle. We got to see disagreement in strategy among the leaders. We got to see that MLK was tired and beat down from leading the movement. We saw MLK as a human being rather than the deity or legend that he has become.\n\nOverall 10/10. Unbelievable movie. I will be going to see it again MLK weekend."

        "review_title": "Fine Civil Rights Drama",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Selma\" (2014), directed by Ava DuVernay, is a snapshot of the US Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s and its attempts to get black Americans the vote in segregated southern states.\n\nDuVernay has crafted a film which consistently refuses to take an idealistic perspective, ensuring the movie remains on a human scale throughout. It takes King as a significant but fallible figure; the British actor David Oyelowo perfectly captures the rhythms and cadence of his speech, although one of the strongest scenes in the film is where he is confronted over his marital infidelities by his wife, Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo). This mixture of the historical and the personal is the film's most impressive asset, refusing to succumb to a hagiographic awe and thus bearing comparison in approach to Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" (2012).\n\nOyelowo embodies King throughout with admirable intensity and conviction; no better performance could be asked for. He's ably supported by a cast including Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson, Tim Roth as Alabama governor George Wallace and various other recognisable faces such as Martin Sheen and Giovanni Ribisi. However, it's clearly Oyelowo's film from the very beginning and is actually at its weakest when the film shifts it's focus, such as the scenes between Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), director of the FBI. Not only have issues been raised about their historical credibility, but they fail to have the same emotional resonance and momentum as the sequences showing how King and his associates actually go through the complex problems of organising the march. The infamous attack on the protesters by the police and civilian militia on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, shows DuVernay's skills as director, the fog of tear gas and the wounded, running people, shot and cut like a war scene.\n\nCinematographer Bradford Young shoots with a palette of warm brown and golden tones and DuVernay certainly isn't afraid of letting Young's camera sit unobtrusively in medium shot, letting the audience experience the actors' interactions and performances, most notably when King and another activist just cruise along the darkened Selma streets, reflecting on recent, tumultuous events.\n\nThe film is at its weakest when trying to cover too much, such as factional in-fighting in different civil rights groups or when it starts to resemble standard Hollywood biopics with the final triumphant scene at Alabama's state capitol: it's undoubtedly stirring but feels a little formulaic. \"Selma\" is at its best when it takes an alternative tack to the usual Hollywood formulations and delivers an intimate portrayal of a crucial moment in American history."

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma offers a look back on the attitudes of the United States particularly the deep south during the period just after the passing of The Civil Rights Act in 1964. At that time Negroes were granted the right to vote. But in those deep south States The film focuses on Alabama where although Negroes were given the right to vote the state government of Alabama put every obstacle in there path to prevent them from voting from Poll Taxes to test of Civics knowledge. We see how The Reverend Dr. Marten Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo- in a remarkable performance) led the marches into Selma over the Edward Pettus Bridge where the marchers were met with both a State Police and Armed Citizens attacking them so they could not march over that bridge . As the peaceful protesters being met with violence started showing up on the front pages of morning newspapers and nightly network newscast the attitude of the nation began swinging in favor of Dr. King and the protesters posed a huge problem for President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkson) who was going through a election season. It was tough watching some of those violent scenes with police clubbing and kicking protesters both black and white marching in a peaceful manner. Fifty years later those same scenes are playing out today on our HD TV Screens as police still are attacking and shooting unarmed citizens dead without retribution. It's a awesome film that moves a bit slow in segments of it's 128 minute length. AL Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) is portrayed as a out and out racist not willing to step in for what's right thus angering President Johnson. to the point where the President talking to Wallace on how history will look at both men in 1984 telling Wallace I don't want anyone putting me in the same light as you (not exact wording) There was one major error of one scene The segment in the film where President Johnsonis addressing a joint session of Congress on \"The Voting Rights Act\" (March- 15-1965) The House Mace which sits on it's pedestal when the House is in session is missing. (The design of the mace is derived from ancient battle weapon and the Roman fasces. The ceremonial mace is 46 inches high and consists of 13 ebony  rods \u2013 representing the original 13 states of the Union\u2013 bound together by silver strands criss -crossed over the length of the pole. Atop this shaft is a silver globe on which sits an intricately cast solid silver eagle) is missing"

This film isn't a complete biopic by any means as it focuses on one specific event in particular. What immediately caught my attention was how good of a performance David Oyelowo gave as MLK. He really stood out in the speech scenes where I could feel the passion and leadership qualities Martin Luther King possessed. I heard how the makers weren't allowed to use any of MLK's original speeches so Ava DuVernay had to write new ones herself and the speeches in the film are very well-written and powerful. I was worried that MLK would be presented as a godlike figure but there is an attempt to humanise him throughout. There are some compelling scenes with MLK and his wife that make us see how he was also a human being. I would've liked the film to go more in depth on his personal life in order to flesh his character out more. Apart from MLK, the rest of the characters aren't as interesting. The female roles especially are underutilised and don't have much to do compared to some male roles.\n\nThe marching scenes themselves are shown really well. They are shot well and capture the brutality African Americans had gone through just to have equal rights in an intense manner. The rest of the performances are also pretty good. Tim Roth does a great job playing the wicked George Wallace. Carmen Ejogo is also very good as MLK's wife and has some powerful scenes with Oyelowo. Tom Wilkinson, Oprah Winfrey and Lakeith Stanfield also do a splendid job with their roles.\n\nSelma has moments where it does shine. Ava DuVernay's direction is solid and the performances, especially from David Oyelowo, are great. I just wish there was more development given to the supporting roles."

This movie is difficult to rate as the subject matter is so interesting; I was about 18 when it all happened so remembered it pretty well. The problem is that so much of the content is a series of conversations set in a rather murky background (to make it look like 1960s?). Many/most of the conversations are frankly rather tedious... so much so that I actually fell asleep for short while, somewhere in the middle of the movie. I was never quite sure what they were trying to tell me about the relationship between MLK & his wife..some bits of the movie good, most of it not so good.\n\nTo sum up, pretty disappointing."

The movie focuses on a pivotal moment during the Civil Rights Movement, which focuses on Martin Luther King Jr. trying to march through Selma to Montgomery. Selma is told with with a solid amount of emotion, the events the movie portrays really gets your blood boiling because of how arrogant and hateful people could be back then. This is a powerful movie about a powerful individual who united thousands of people for one great cause and the movie itself truly captures the spirit of Dr King very well. The acting is of course phenomenal, some of the best of the year, especially when you hear David O's natural voice!\n\nBut what really held 'Selma' back was the whole LBJ storyline and how they made him out as more of a bad buy more than anything else. After the movie I went and read about the events and a lot of other people out there agree (or were upset) about how the directed made him look. He was actually the one who gave MLK the idea to go to Selma and protest there, not Dr King. He also was a very strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was constantly (but secretly) working on solving the situation on a legislative level. So if you are looking for a more factual movie about the events that took place, look for a documentary rather than this. Don't get me wrong, this is an eye opening movie, but it does have it's weaknesses, particularly the portrayal of LBJ and Dr King's personal life storyline, which is quite brief and doesn't really add much to the story. Outside of those complaints, the movie sends a very strong message and a great one at that.\n\nIs this movie the Best Picture of the year? No, it's a good movie with a heart at the center of the story, but it lacks to energy and gut punching ability that '12 Years a Slave' had last year to make it truly something special."

I think David Oyelowo played a version of MLK that showed he was a real person. While King is known for how passionate and soulful he was, there are more layers to people than what you see on the surface and I think Oyelowo portrayed that well. I also like that this movie narrowed down on one specific part of the civil rights movement instead of trying to give a broad summary of the whole thing. Overall, this movie is well done and I don't think it deserves hate for making an artistic choice. There are plenty of documentaries about the civil rights movement if you want historical accuracy."

        "review_detailed_main": "In any campaign good intelligence is always invaluable. My favorite scene in Selma is when Martin Luther King played by David Oyelowo is talking to the local activists in Selma. He tells a story of an action tried at a Georgia town where the sheriff might have been a redneck, but he was a smart redneck. He took the peaceful protesters away by stretcher without a single nightstick raised. No footage of brutality for the media to expose. So King asks the question, is Sheriff Jim Clark of Lowndes County, Alabama that much of an ignorant cracker that he won't control or want to control his deputies and 'volunteers' when push come to shove? The answer he gets is an unequivocal yes. And so it's decided that Selma is where we make our stand.\n\nI was all of 18 when the real events of Selma occurred. In the wake of the Kennedy assassination the Civil Rights Act was finally passed. Now in the wake of Lyndon Johnson's election in his own right as president part of the Selma story is how Martin Luther King and many others made sure Johnson didn't forget his commitment. Civil rights laws forbidding discrimination is one thing, but without political power because black people are ruthlessly and systematically kept from voting it means very little when no redress can be had at the polls.\n\nTom Wilkinson plays the harassed and beleaguered LBJ who truthfully did have a lot on his plate in 1965. He was about to start a war on poverty with campaigns on many levels. He also was about to escalate a war in Vietnam and that part of the story is judiciously left out, probably rightly for the purposes of this picture and its narrative flow. But it was there nonetheless. Lest Johnson be distracted by the good and bad things he wanted to do it was up to the Civil Rights activists to keep his feet to the fire and the flames well stoked.\n\nSo it was in 1965 and the events dramatized here I remember the media sending these images around the world to see. A dark side of America was exposed, an evil that had to be dealt with forthwith. What we get in Selma is both the public and private stories.\n\nDavid Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo play Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King and do a good enough job that we see their private lives. Tim Roth plays Governor George Wallace and interesting seeing two British players Wilkins and Roth in the confrontation scene between the president and the governor. Dylan Baker plays the serpentine and evil J.Edgar Hoover the closest thing we've had to permanent government. He fed spicy bits to 8 presidents and no one liked that better than LBJ. It appealed to the more prurient aspects of his nature.\n\nWallace to had his own Hoover and it was in the form of Al Lingo the head of the Alabama State Troopers. Lingo is a truly sinister figure and he's played here by Stephen Root and he has one scene with Roth as they decide what to do about the civil rights marchers. Lingo had his own intelligence service to report about Communists and his definition was those agitated for black people to not know their place. Later on he was active in Wallace's national campaigns and other ultra right wing causes.\n\nSelma got one Oscar for Best Song entitled Glory which was a blend of both gospel and rap styles. Not that I'm a big fan of the latter, still it was a deserved winner. Selma was also nominated for Best Picture. It should have won in my book.\n\nThis film is about one of the defining moments in American history, one which many like myself saw unfold and one where many participants of the march from Selma to Montgomery are still with us. Their story needs to be seen by generations to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "David Oyelowo was brilliant as civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That's a difficult role to play, because King is such an iconic figure to many, and especially because he is essentially a martyr for the cause, having been assassinated a couple of years after the events depicted in this film. But if Oyelowo was even remotely overwhelmed by playing King, he didn't show it. Instead, he captured King. His voice, his mannerisms, his passion. It was truly impressive - the best part of a movie that was generally very good, but at times a bit slow moving.\n\nBut more than just featuring a great performance (Oyelowo should have been nominated for an Oscar, I might add) it's an important movie. In fact it's a sobering movie, because it's largely so accurate. It's sobering for me to realize that these events happened in my lifetime. This wasn't the distant past - this was the south of just 50 years ago where racism was a way of life and keeping blacks poor and disenfranchised - through the use of state sanctioned violence if necessary - was accepted political policy. The movie revolves around the struggle for black voting rights in Alabama. In theory, blacks had the right to vote, but in practice various methods were found to prevent them from registering. King and his associates take on the cause and try to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery demanding voting rights for blacks - the first attempt at the march descending into sickening violence against the marchers by the authorities.\n\nIn the course of showing the march being organized, there are a lot of points made. The political machinations are revealed and believable. Alabama Governor George Wallace was played by Tim Roth, and President Lyndon Johnson by Tom Wilkinson. Personally, I found Wilkinson difficult to accept as LBJ. To me he just didn't seem right in the part - but the movie makes the point that Johnson had to be pushed to propose the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when he would have preferred to do something less dramatic. The movie also isn't shy about hiding some of the divisions within the leadership of the civil rights movement itself. The movie also notes the prominent place of faith in the civil rights movement.\n\nIt has a powerful beginning and ending - the beginning portraying the murder of four young black girls in the bombing of a church, and the movie closes with a gripping piece of music. I often don't bother with the closing credits of a movie, but I left them on to hear the song because I found it so moving.\n\nThere were a few parts of this movie that failed to really capture me, and it did seem a little bit inconsistently paced. But it's an important movie portraying important events - and still quite relevant, given many of the concerns today about voter suppression laws which seem aimed largely at blacks, and recent incidents of police violence toward the African American community.

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie starts with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) receiving the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) faces impossible hurdles to register to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) wants to concentrate on his war on poverty rather than voting rights. MLK decides to concentrate on Selma, Alabama. Opposing him are Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Sheriff Jim Clark.\n\nI love some of the behind-the-scene discussions like the two kids from Albany. In the same token, the president strikes me as a little off. The movie needs to raise up a villain for the story. The president shouldn't fill any part of that role. It is more fitting for Wallace and the Sheriff. This movie needs some more from behind their lines.\n\nIt's a mostly quiet movie and it doesn't always get the balance between sincerity and thrilling. Some of the really sincere scenes drag. The big exception is Jimmie Lee Jackson's father at the hospital. The power exists in that man's face and the pain is all too evident. Of course, there is the first attempt crossing the bridge. That is a harrowing sequence delivering the same shock that the TV viewers of that day must have felt. David Oyelowo does a very nice reserved job with some big moments. Despite a few off notes, this movie is a powerhouse."

I want to make it clear my criticism is not of MLK, Jr. or of the Civil Rights movement. I despised this film for being overly depressing and gloomy. Selma was so bad I walked out. I couldn't stand it another second. It was like I was watching a horror movie.\n\nCall it what you will, but you are preaching to the choir. Do you really expect racists - or the ignorant - or those who don't care - are going to race out to the movies to pay over $10.00 to watch Selma? I seriously doubt it! It's going to be liberals and others who are sympathetic to the Civil Rights movement that are going to watch this film.\n\nIf this is your audience, then why club us over the head with horror and fear? Was that really necessary to tell a such powerful story? The answer is \"NO!\" Watch \"King\" staring Paul Winfield and Cicely Tyson and you decide. It's obvious you can tell a good story without sugar-coating it or traumatizing your audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"White, Black and otherwise..come to Selma.\"\n\nSelma has taken America by storm. Ava DuVernay directs a film that proves both pivotal and timely to our nation. In typicality, I try to stay away from other opinions on a film before viewing it or composing my own opinions. I hate to borrow from people, and verbiage is no exception. However, with Selma, I found my usual mode of cinematic sequestering difficult in this instance, as the film is consistently lauded as the best film of the year across the internet and all of social media. For the week or so prior to me composing this review, it held a \"100% Certified Fresh\" accolade on Rotten Tomatoes. My hopes for this film were quite high, indeed, and I am pleased to share that I was not, in the least bit, let down.\n\nWe open on Martin Luther King Jr., played by British actor David Oyelowo (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Interstellar), speaking with his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) prior to his December 10, 1964 reception of the Nobel Prize at the University of Oslo in Norway. We follow him to Norway as he receives his award. As his acceptance speech is given (more on this film's depiction of Martin Luther King Jr.'s public speeches later) we view a portrayal of the gut-wrenching events of September 15th, 1963, in which four small children were killed when a bomb was detonated in Birmingham, Alabama's 16th St. Baptist Church. A sobering opening to a beautiful and important film.\n\nIn years past, the King family has been said to make depictions of Martin Luther King Jr. virtually a nightmare to pursue. King's speeches are copyrighted works and property of the King Estate, who have not been openly supportive of Ava DuVernay's production. Reason being that they already licensed the spoken works of MLK to Dreamworks and Warner Bros. in 2009 for a yet-produced, yet-to-be-titled biopic (Source: The Hollywood Reporter), and the studios were unable to make a deal providing a shared use of Dr. Martin Luther King's words. Stingy much? But I digress, the lack of cooperation or support from any of the aforementioned has obviously not stopped this train. The words in the speeches and sermons we see in Selma are made specifically for the film. This is a positive! They took what they had to work with and created sharp dialog; both poignant and uplifting moments in Dr. King's speeches. The sermons are exquisitely crafted to run parallel to King's actual speeches, whilst avoiding infringement upon the copyrighted works, themselves.\n\nDavid Oyelowo delivers every line with a vigor and passion that should launch him into, at the very least, a category nomination for Best Actor, come the Oscars (if not the win). The supporting cast, while often outshone by Oyelowo, is great here too. To name only a few: Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson, Giovanni Ribisi as Lee White, Oprah as Annie Lee Cooper, and Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace. The story's scope is much too large to truly spend a substantial amount of time with all of the supporting cast. Fortunately, there's so much authentic talent in the film, that there is never a lull on the screen.\n\nThis film comes at a time when our nation is struggling with understanding and peace, and for that matter, understanding peace itself. Selma endeavors to show us our error as a nation during the Civil Rights Movement, lest we not repeat it. Some sequences are an exposition of 1960's American Brutality, and thankfully, DuVernay pulls no punches here. The violence is visceral and true to the nature of the era. It is revolting, as it should be. Personally, I was sickened by the depictions, all of which occur within the confines of the PG-13 rating. Well done. Ava DuVernay has, with the help of her astounding cast, created a powerful and incredible biopic with Selma. It succeeds in it's goals, and in the end, it calls for unification and peace. Much like Dr. King would have wanted."

        "review_detailed_main": "The civil rights movement that galvanized people of all ages, races, colors, creeds, and religions in the America of the 1960s was one of the most important parts of our history; and at the head of all this was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. Even after the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, and the March on Washington in 1963, black churches in the segregated South were still being bombed; black people were still being lynched; and voting rights were still being denied to those who were neither White nor possessed of enough money. Meanwhile in Washington, even with the Civil Rights Act having been passed, President Lyndon Johnson was still vacillating over the issue of voting rights. To get the point across to Johnson that this was a moral issue, Dr. King and his people organized what became the Selma-to-Montgomery march in March 1965. That event and the things that led up to it are at the heart of director Ava DuVernay's powerful 2014 historical film SELMA.\n\nSELMA begins with one of the aforementioned church bombings that characterized the White Southern backlash against the civil rights movement following the killings of three Voting Rights workers in August 1964, and follows the efforts of Dr. King (portrayed here by David Oleyowo) as he attempts to organize a big event that would galvanize the nation. Even as he does this, with help from his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), he is constantly being dogged by hostile forces\u2014in a covert way from the machinations of FBI chieftain J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and in a more overt and violent way from Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Dallas County sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston), plus the brutality from the white segregationists and Ku Klux Klansmen. And there is the issue of Oleyowo's infidelity towards Ejogo at this crucial time in his life and in the life of the movement that he is leading. But once he goes through all these elements, he remains resolute, even through the attempts by Johnson (Wilkinson) to have Oleyowo stop the movement (and supposedly stop the violence), Selma soon becomes the new epicenter of King's quest for equality. It comes at a bloody cost, first with the Bloody Sunday incident on March 7th, and then the KKK-administered beating of one of King's white supporters just a night or two later. None of this deters Oleyowo's quest, however; and on March 21st, he and 8,000 of his fellow citizens, black, white, Jewish, gentile, Protestants, and Catholics alike, make the 50-mile march from Selma, across the infamous Edmund Pettis Bridge, and through two very dangerous Alabama counties to the state capital in Montgomery to press the case.\n\nWhile it can be said that we have made incredibly great strides to get away from the overt bigotry of the past, even with an African-American in the White House at the time of its release, SELMA depicts a time in our history that, though long past, is still relevant today. Racism and bigotry are always going to be parts of certain Americans' DNA, especially since the nation, in the 21st century, is becoming much more ethnically diversified and less White. But it was not always so in Dr. King's time, when blacks often made up the majority of rural counties in the South, but only constituted maybe two percent of the eligible voting population, hemmed in as they were by regulations drawn up by segregationists. Both director DuVernay and screenwriter Webb depict this in very stark fashion, with Oleyowo giving a very stoic performance as the great Dr. King, and Ejiogo equally fine as his wife Coretta. Wilkinson and Roth do very good turns as, respectively, the old guard LBJ and the uber-segregationist Wallace. SELMA also features good turns from Cuba Gooding Jr. as one of the young lawyers arguing the case for the march, and Martin Sheen as the Alabama judge who, though perhaps more covert in his racial views, grants the order allowing the march to go forth.\n\nHaving seen this film in a theater on Martin Luther King Day in 2015, it made me appreciate even more than I had before how big a part of the mid-to-late 20th century the civil rights movement was in America, at a time when we were going through the most turbulent period in our history since the end of the Civil War; and the lessons from that period are still being absorbed, even though more Americans of non-White ethnicity have entered the political arena in our time. In that sense, SELMA, along with the classic 1970 documentary KING: A FILMED RECORD\u0085MONTGOMERY TO MEMPHIS, will likely become required viewing in years to come in high school, community college, and university classes. While we have made great strides, America as a \"more perfect union\" is still a work in progress, and SELMA, one of the best films of 2014, illustrates why this is still true even in the 21st century."

Director Ava DuVernay doesn't fail to hold your attention with realistic and compelling depiction of the events of the Civil Right Movement which could have felt boring history chapter otherwise. The tone of the storytelling is outright serious and make sure you keep that in mind before deciding to watch it. The story mainly focuses on MLK's campaign in Selma and the historic march for equal voting rights in 1965. Despite the dry nature of the script, it holds your attention thanks to great acting and the resonating themes which it dwells into. With moments be it the energetic speech delivery by Dr. King or the arousing feeling you get while watching the campaigners march hand in hand, Selma really strikes the right chord. 'Glory' which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song is really soul- stirring. The cinematography is solid and captures the unrest among the people perfectly. The screenplay could have been a bit less broad and a bit more stimulating. Despite few of its shortcomings, Selma is a really good biopic and a well crafted film.\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]"

David Oyelowo plays a King who remained determined in his battles with President Lyndon Johnson, his right-hand man Andrew Young and Malcom X. In the penultimate moment of the Selma march, we find King not engaged in a fight against segregationists, but in a struggle to save his marriage. Selma humanizes King, which strengthens his legacy."

While this other movie is a bit more on the fictional side, I prefer the Disney production Selma, Lord Selma from 1999. It holds your attention much better and is even more emotionally impactful throughout the movie, and is something that even children can follow and watch. This film is fine and important for its subject matter but I still wish it had just a little more heart."

Stunning performances from the actors; all of them.\n\nI was not terribly interested to learn that MLK was a serial adulterer or a smoker... whatever... that's for his family to know and understand and deal with, not me. I got mixed messages from this. I think what the movie maker was trying to do was to show that even truly great men are flawed... wow... what a revelation... as if we don't already know that. So I was left less than particularly interested in this great revelation.\n\nI think that the approach was ordinary, rather sloppy, wasting a lot of good performances. Like I said, it may still be on the cutting room floor, we'll never know.\n\nI find MLK utterly amazing in what he achieved and I'm not religious or black. I think he showed extraordinary genius and bravery, whether he smoked, was unfortunately attracted to other women, or not.\n\nAn average movie made with wonderful actors that won't be memorable for me."

They were especially fascinated by his speech: I have a dream! There children eyes sparkled with hope about better future. Of course, kids grow up, and they see that it is not all black and white. I think my younger son is still captivated by him, since he holds his picture on his skype main page.\n\nThis film is fine portrayal of the part of that struggle for the black people in the USA in the 1960*s. I gave this film a high grade because it deserves it, since everything is excellent in it.\n\nIf you like historical films, this is a film for you, otherwise you might just watch it anyways. You might learn something."

        "review_detailed_main": "Overall, I liked Selma very much. The best part of the movie in my opinion was how the story flowed from one scene to the next. The film had great acting, and the transitions were quick, which alleviated some of the problems that plague other historical movies, namely boringness. Unlike other historical movies, Selma did a great job of explaining everything that was going on, which is good for the casual movie watcher. Other movies of this genre tend to not explain the plot as much, which somewhat tailors them specifically for history buffs.\n\nOne other thing that the movie does well is deal with the violent aspect of the civil rights movement. Selma shows the brutality that must be shown in any film about civil rights, but does a nice job of staying away from excessive blood and gore, which can turn some people away.\n\nThe one aspect of Selma that was bad was its fictionalization and some historical inaccuracies, which is the only thing that prevented it from having a higher score.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10"

        "review_title": "Engaging movie on Dr King's crusade in 60s for equal voting rights",
        "review_detailed_main": "A fairly well made movie on the civil rights movement of 60s spearheaded by Dr Martin Luther King Jr. The focus is on the march from Selma to Montgomery in Albama. Dr King ( David Oyelowo) is determined to get equal voting rights for black community and he organizes this peace march to show solidarity of blacks. Some like minded white members also join the movement. The political correctness of the events is another matter, and I have no comments on that issue. The movie is heavy on dialogue and is understandably serious in nature. Director Ava DuVernay tells the story in a simplistic manner. While Dr King is persistent on having the march, President LBJ ( Tom Wilkinson) tries to convince him to cancel or hold it in abeyance. LBJ also has a long talk to covince hardliner Governor George Wallace ( Tim Roth) to agree to Dr King's just demand but Wallace is is in no mood to give in. LBJ says he didn't want history to remember him as the president who kept saying \" Wait\" and \" I can't \". There is a confrontation between LBJ and Dr King where the latter clearly says he wants the bill and nothing else while LBJ unsuccessfully tries to make him change his mind. Another character though in the background is of Dr King's wife Correta ( Carmen Ejogo) who fears for his safety and eventually joins him in his crusade. The scenes of the march at the bridge are very realistically done. The intercutting of scenes of the actual march with those of this movie in the end leaves a good impression. A very well composed scene is where black lady played by Oprah Winfrey applies for a voter card which is rejected after a heavily biased interview. All actors have acquitted themselves admirably. No complaints there. Viewers may like cameos, though important, played by Martin Sheen as a judge and Cuba Gooding Jr as a lawyer."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1964 and 1965 Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) became heavily involved in a protest movement in Alabama designed to give all African Americans the vote. As with most of his campaigns, he advocated nonviolent methods, but was often met with violent responses from the white majority, orchestrated by Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth). Dr. King became involved not only with the local community but with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), who was intransigent at first, but eventually swayed by force of circumstance into passing a bill removing all restrictions on the African American vote.\n\nAva DuVernay's film tells a straightforward tale punctuated by memorable individual sequences. At the beginning Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) enters the courthouse in Selma in a vain attempt to register to vote; she is summarily denied by the white official. Nothing much is actually said but gestures signify everything; the humiliation experienced by Annie Lee set against the arrogance of the official. Later on, in the wake of the first abortive protest mounted by the African American community as they try to cover the fifty or so miles from Selma to the state capital Montgomery, three African Americans enter a diner and pretend to order food, in the vain hope that they will escape the pursuing white state troopers. The troopers enter and summarily beat them senseless, taking the life of Jimmy Lee Jackson (Lakeith Stanfield) in the process.\n\nThe film's moral stance is unequivocal; in a world still riddled by institutional racism, the African Americans have a justifiable cause to plead. As performed by Oyelowo, Dr. King comes across as a tenacious personality, unwilling to give up his cause even in the face of overwhelming odds. Every time the President protests his inability to help, Dr. King goads him; we understand from such confrontations just how scared the President actually was of allowing too many concessions to the African American community.\n\nBrilliantly staged, with careful attention to detail, SELMA deserves to be considered a modern classic, marred only slightly by Roth's rather artificial Southern accent as Governor Wallace."

The story is really interesting and gives the viewers insight of the events that led up to the march. The scene where the girls were blown up was kind of discomforting. The shots used in the movie were good too, and the sets used in the film. The sets are something that can either make or break the immersion of a film set in a specific time period. Overall I did like Selma, but some of the parts in the film was kind of discomforting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr infamously stood at the Lincoln memorial proclaiming \"I have a dream\" to over 250,000 people - but that's not what Selma is about. The film charts a specific period in 1965, with the civil rights movement well underway and segregation now illegal in the United States, but violent opposition in the south blocking black Americans' right to vote. King leads his peaceful army in an epic march from the town of Selma, through deepest darkest Klan country, to the courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama, to exercise their rights. The event is credited as having forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act - a portrayal under discussion for its authenticity, as Selma suggests Johnson was a road block to civil rights when historical fact shows otherwise. The filmmakers couldn't have gotten away from the endless hushed conversations between government officials and various activists if they'd tried, but unlike most political dramas, these instances are well-placed fraught scenes breaking up the noise and violence of the main story. King is understandably sanctified in this celebration of one of his most significant achievements but the film also places unexpected and artfully presented praise on the members of the press who put the story unfolding in Selma in front of the world's eyes, strengthening the movement to a tipping point, with the closing scene carefully honouring other lesser known heroes of civil rights."

I found it trite, full of stereotypes, overacted, and misdirected.\n\nAs a child of the 60s, who lived in deep Georgia, I was looking for an accurate historical representation, if not a reasonable hyperbole of the time. I got neither in Selma. It was painful to watch for the first few minutes and proceeded to get worse from there.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is a fine actor but I think he was done wrong by the director, Ava DuVernay, who is clearly over her head in this film. If I'm not mistaken, this is DuVernay's first time up as director of a major motion picture (if ever) and I get the sense this is a student film. Not only is the directing amateurish but the blocking and shot selection feels forced and from a neophyte.\n\nIts a shame, because I had so much hope and wanted so much more for this story of Dr. MLK, Jr. I guess we'll just have to wait for the next go around, if there is one. Hopefully next time, however, the studio will select a seasoned professional to direct."

I don't know everything that happened at that time, I'm not American, but I've read a lot of things even before the movie. I was curious. Everything I've read never suggested there was that kind of negative friction between the two. Maybe there was some kind of a pissing contest between the two, they are men after all, but who knows what really happened behind closed doors. Still, I never got that, vibe. Anyways it added drama, IT IS a movie so people should be open to storytelling, and most of the time storytelling includes drama and that includes a little fiction.\n\nAll in all, the movie is the only movie I've seen, so far, that got me interested with everyone.

He didn't get \"snubbed\" at the Oscars beause he didn't deserve one.\n\nThe story tries to do too much as well. It does a great job portraying the South, but then keeps shifting to long scenes with LBJ and a bizzare focus on the FBI surveillance of King. There are numerous undeveloped secondary characters that half the time the audience has no clue who the person is or why they should care about him/her.\n\nThe antagonists were also poorly developed. There was ton of background information on Jim Clark they movie could have used to really develop his character.\n\nOverall, a decent watch but could have been better."

These marches, led by Martin Luther King Jr., was integral in furthering the goals of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nQUICK PERSONAL REVIEW: Although I wasn't as emotionally touched by this movie as I was with 12 Years a Slave, this is still the kind of movie that could make anyone give it a standing ovation. Ava DuVernay and her team effortlessly recreate the marches that took place nearly fifty years ago - instilling them with the same look, spirit, and pain. Meanwhile, David Oyelowo accomplishes the difficult task of transforming MLK Jr. from the legendary figure we're all familiar with to just a regular human being who we can all relate to (this film shows many of his conflicts and flaws at that time period). However, when it comes down to giving his speeches and sermons, Oyelowo recites with the same visceral power reminiscent of MLK Jr. The supporting cast is great as well - Tom Wilkinson, Carmen Egojo, and even Oprah Winfrey (who has a couple of key moments to herself as Annie Lee Cooper) are among some of the standouts. To tie things up, the magnificent \"Glory\" kept me around for the end credits."

The epic march from Selma to Montgomery took many people's life's and the political and violent struggle between the white and black communities were extremely intense. It just amazes me how much things have changed! Anyway, the performances were great, especially from David Oyelowo who plays King and the pace and great storyline was a joy to watch. Its a bit weird that an Englishman was chosen to play such an iconic American, who was fighting for American rights but he did do a great job and the film deserved the nomination for an Oscar. Its just a shame that the movie only covered a period in Martin Luther Kings life because they had the right actors and crew to make a film that would have covered the whole of his life. Anyway, the attention to detail was impressive and I liked the way that the director covered other aspects of his life, like his personal relationship with his wife and his close, trustworthy team. My mind can't comprehend how intense it must have been during that period for a black man living in Alabama, so I have to commend the real people who had to risk there life's for justice and freedom. With that in mind, you can't help feeling quite angry whilst watching this movie because of the injustice and anger that was shown towards the black community. In all, it's a well put together movie with a lot of emotional scenes and great performances. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up: David Oyelowo, 39, has starred in some top movies lately, like Interstellar, Jack Reacher, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the Butler and Lincoln so the scale of this film wasn't new to him. The fact that he was playing such a huge, iconic figure, must have been a lot of pressure, especially as he is an Englishman, so I have to give him respect for pushing the project to be made. There are other top names in the cast like Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Oprah Winfrey and Giovanni Ribisi who also put in great performances and there's even a quick glimpse of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Martin Sheen, who should have been used more in my opinion. Anyway, the film was directed by Ava DuVernay who hasn't really made a big time movie of this scale before but it always helps when you have Brad Pitt and Oprah Winfrey in the production chair. This is definitely a period in history that needs to be told, especially if your an American in Alabama so with all that in mind, it's definitely one to watch.\n\nBudget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $67million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their epic dramas about Martin Luther Kings fight for black people to vote. 7/10"

Johnson tries to assist King with some platitudes and assistance, but King believes the next major step forward is securing equal voting rights for him and his people. In the face of relentless violence and intimidation, from both sides of the law, King presses on regardless, with an epic march from Selma to Alabama.\n\nIt seems to be the in thing these days, when making a film about an important historical figure, to focus on one particular event in their lives, rather than to make an all out epic dramatisation of their life story, like they would have twenty years ago, when the likes of Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard would have turned it into a three hour yarn of the sort I remember from my youth. For someone who remembers these types of films so vividly, this more condensed approach is a little hard to adjust to, but by zooming in on one important event in Kings life, Ava DuVarney has made a piece of art all the same.\n\nI always imagined who would portray King if ever a film was made about him, and it seems the honours have fallen to British actor David Oyelowo. Given the endless list of Hollywood candidates available, this is an achievement in and of itself, but that he nails it on the head so perfectly is something even better. Oyelowo captures King's speech, delivery, fluidity, mannerisms and general presence perfectly, and fits the role physically too. Given he's carrying the film, and his is the role it all centres on, this is a great thing, but it's not as if fine support from the likes of Wilkinson and Tim Roth don't help.\n\nIt seems the honours have fallen on me to do the 200th review of this film, and given how well everything was pulled off, this is no poor honour. ****"

It didn't show real events like when the protesters were marching to Montgomery it didn't show when firemen sprayed them with water to try to disperse them. I felt like this movie was very dull, it just felt very empty and not moving to me at all. I was left just wanting more from this movie, but I didn't hate watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.\n\nSelma stars David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King in the first official theatrically released biopic about the legendary leader. The question is how can this film be the first one? This is sad to have waited for so long and so this film is very welcome. It is a great movie. Firstly, I have to admit that I was a little worried of how sentimental or too romanticised those kind of movie can be, and that, because Biopics have to be inspirational. However here, Selma is not cheesy or melodramatic at all. It takes a very factual look at things that happened on this specific period of his life and more importantly MLK doesn't look God-like, flawless or perfect. The movie doesn't loose that Human focused centre. It doesn't shy away from some of the flaws of the real man that are well known. I found that really interesting because he was first and foremost a human being just like any of us. Obviously he is this iconic leader who march in order to make his point relevant for other people to understand but deep behind, he is just a regular man, with doubts. This is important to show especially when the legends are too big, so the people can identify with the character, he's just like you and me. David Oyelowo is amazing in this film, he really captured what MLK fight for and of all the speeches I've studied he embodies the man spirit perfectly. However, there is no other really interesting character beside MLK which is sad because there were a lot of other people around him who were equally involved with the movement; but Oyelowo as MLK is so damn good that all other characters suffered because of that. Finally, the \"normal\" scenes when he's home with his wife and children are equally as powerful as the speech scenes. Throughout the whole movie there is this political chest game happening between the government and MLK Civil Right Movement as they're not just marching, actual political issues were involved. Some scenes are hard to watch as that is what happened 50 years ago in Selma, Alabama. That was a really dark time in Human History.\n\nOverall Selma is a very factual and straight forward movie, filled with excellent performances and a very good directing/editing. A powerful movie."

David Oyelowo is the spitting image of the great Martin Luther King Jr however he may not have portrayed him to the full extent. When actors take on monumental figures in history they have very big shoes to fill. Having said that he manages to pull of a nice tribute and likeness to Dr King. The supporting cast did a great job in carrying this film. The film excelled in showing the brutality towards many innocent African Americans and the inhumane behavior of law enforcement. However it felt a bit slow at times and did drag on. Some will argue how accurate the portrayal of LBJ was. Also accusations against MLK being unfaithful were never substantiated and the rumors do not match with the reality of those times. Perhaps this could have been excluded. This was a good film but it could have been a great film. The best part of the film was probably the montage of scenes at the end and actual footage shown from Selma.\n\n7.8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It really is amazing that Selma is the very first theatrical biopic of one of the most important and famous figures in American history. Seems to me that Hollywood should have cranked out at least ten mediocre, Oscar-bait films by now...but I'm glad they waited. Selma is the silver screen debut that MLK deserved.\n\nThe story begins right as he receives his Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, which is thoughtfully cut with the 16th street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. From the get-go, the audience sees just how far African Americans have come and just how far they have left to go. From there, the focus turns to African American voting rights, and how although it is technically legal for them to vote, the strong prejudice against them in the south has made voting nearly impossible. MLK visits the White House to plea with LBJ, who essentially puts the issue on the back burner to concentrate on his 'War on Poverty' initiative. MLK then starts organizing black (and eventually white) protesters to march from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol of Montgomery. Despite the brutal opposition of Alabama governor George Wallace and his posse of racist troopers/policeman, and despite a direct order from the president of the United States, MLK took to the streets with hundreds of marchers for the greater good. What immediately separates Selma from most other biopics is an almost complete lack of sentimentality. MLK is shown as a living, breathing man, one with marital issues, one who isn't perfect. There are no cloying tidbits to tug at the viewer's heart strings, just a sober, honest depiction of the facts. One aspect that really shocked me was how the screenwriter decided to portray President Johnson. At one point, he actually says, \"Are you trying to *beep* over the president?\" Again, these are the words of a flawed man, not something out of a high school text book. Johnson, despite being wrong, wasn't exactly depicted as a racist monster, just a powerful white man who was wary of change. Bold choice for Paul Webb. Regardless of how realistic and powerful the script is, Selma still has some of the typical failings of any film chronicling history. Among MLK's group of black protesters, Martin is the only character who receives any characterization whatsoever. His inside crew is merely a poorly defined group of black faces, most of whom are only mentioned by name maybe once or twice. Also, some of the drama with Martin's wife, Coretta Scott King, could have been made more compelling. There were just one too many quiet scenes of domestic discomfort.\n\nAva DuVernay, whose only other films are a couple of low-key dramas, explodes into the big-leagues with a beautifully shot-and-edited period piece. Characterized by dark interiors, fresh angles, loads of brilliant tracking shots, and absorbing slow-motion, Selma is an uncharacteristically artistic biopic, one that isn't afraid of being creative with such sacred material. The score and soundtrack are pretty underwhelming for the most part, except for a few powerful musical choices during the more violent sequences.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is unbelievable as Martin Luther King. He looks just like him, he speaks just like him, and his screen presence is undeniably powerful. His is possibly my favorite lead male performance of the year, Academy be damned. The only other actor who comes close to his level is Tom Wilkinson as LBJ. Other notable actors include Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr., Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Root, and Dylan Baker.\n\nSelma, for better or worse, is probably the best MLK movie that will ever be made. I've never really liked the biopic genre because of its sanitization and lack of courage (see this year's bizarrely overrated The Theory of Everything), but Selma almost always comes off as honest and respectful. It's a film I hold in high regard, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again."

The movie started with long lasting impressions that stay in mind. The movie was indeed constructet interesting and also informative. And I think that is pretty impressive because it is historically mostly accurate. Also the actors where well chosen and they suited their characters pretty well. The Film was all in all not just about attention grabbing through a scandalous depiction of the characters it was moreover a suitable film to inform the people about what happened.\n\nTo sum up I can only say that I think this movie is a proper Material for Schools to inform their students about this important historical figure and movement. So I will rather recommend watching this Film if you have not heard of Martin Luther King."

I really felt the sense of fear and danger that one faced to be a Civil Rights advocate in the South. The portrayal of the violence of Bloody Sunday made me feel a great sense of injustice and shock. I also could really sense the bravery and intelligence of the activists who worked so hard to attain more rights for African Americans.\n\nThe film does a good job in showing what a great man that MLK Jr. was; the actor that played him really nailed the part.\n\nA very sobering film which draws comparisons to events like Ferguson, Missouri. Viewing a movie such as this allows us not only to see how far we've come from the prejudice and oppression of the past, but to open our eyes to injustices that are still ongoing today. 'Selma' is a very important film in this way and reminds us that there is still progress to be made. Watching a sobering (yet inspiring) film like this is necessary from time to time."

Even Selma was a noble movie with strong performances, is it going to be nominated for best picture? probably. Does it deserve it? No not really. Don't get me wrong I actually really enjoy sensitive movies with racism as one of the topics. But sometimes the Academy Awards have to move out of their comfort zones.\n\nBut setting all that aside, as a film Selma was executed very nicely and portrays the chronicle of Martin Luther king Jr quite well. Historically inaccurate at times but it still flowed thanks to its beautiful cinematography and precise direction. At first I was shaking my head to the dreadful miscast but somehow they were quite memorable. Especially on David Oyelowo's behalf, who delivered a stunning performance and an admirable portrayal on Martin Luther King Jr. The film was luminously written and the script holds brilliance. The only thing bringing it down was its excruciatingly slow pacing. The story was brilliant but the film was unnecessarily slow. Almost tedious at times during the first and second act but thankfully manages to balance things out with some incredible stand out scenes and the final speech. Not all the characters were developed to their full potential which made some seem weak and impossible to be emotionally attached to as an audience. Overall Selma was a stand out biography but defiantly not an Oscar contender for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "From a European point of view, it would be difficult to approach Selma without the knowledge that the film is causing a controversial stir across the water in relation to its apparent exclusion from this year's Oscar nominations. The argument from some quarters in the States is that this proves that inherent racism exists within the Academy, others argue the film merely isn't worthy of the Oscar nods that some feel it deserve and furthermore there is the argument, probably closer to any truth, that the film was released slightly too late to generate sufficient Oscar momentum. However, David Oyelowo's omission from the best actor category is as glaring an injustice as there's been for several years.\n\nOyelowo, of course, plays Martin Luther King in, Avu Devurnay's Selma which is astoundingly the first feature film based on King's life to garner a theatrical release. Paul Webb's concise script is far from a biopic of King, it focuses solely on his third great political and social triumph, following the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 and the March on Washington of 1963, in 1965 King and his supporters organised several marches in Selma, Alabama in protest against the discrimination suffered by black people attempting to register to vote.\n\nAs mentioned, David Oyelowo gives a moving performance as King, his interpretations of Kings rousing and poetic speeches hit all the right notes but it is the more sombre and personal moments in which Oyelowo depicts King's doubts and weariness that make it a great performance. Watch out particularly for the most painful scene in the film where King visits a hospital to console an elderly man whose son has been killed. Oyelowo says little in the scene, but his blood shot eyes depict a heap of emotions.\n\nThis is also true of the difficult scenes with his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) which depict the difficulties within King's home life. Indeed these difficulties lead him to vitally miss the first leg of the Selma march. Oyelowo is accompanied by a powerful supporting cast here from Opera to Cuba Gooding Junior, his supporters to his adversaries, specifically a despicable yet engrossing Tim Roth as well as Tom Wilkonson's intriguing take on Lyndon. B. Johnson. The script is impeccably tight, a steady and consistent beat toward the predictably triumphant and emotional finale. There isn't a scene in Avu Duvernay's film that doesn't need to be there, each sequence progresses the story forward at a timely pace.\n\nSelma is everything you'd expect from an accomplished film about Martin Luther King. It showcases the vitriol and evil that King fought against in the form of local Southern law enforcement and officials as well as the added difficulty in playing politics and negotiating Washington bureaucracy. It touches briefly but adequately on his marital difficulties and his own unfaithfulness. What we walk out of Selma with is a sense of King's bravery and courage in such a hotbed of hatrid. 'Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe,' he states at one point.\n\nIt's an enjoyable and gripping film, a tight script enhanced in its accessibility with the inclusion of infamous as well as courageous men of history. It leaves us with wonderment of how far we've come since 1965. It could be argued quite far, given how shocking the violent images of armed white police beating peaceful black protesters are today. However, recent events in Ferguson would lead you to question how far they've come in the Southern United Sates. Perhaps Martin Luther King's legacy still has further bridges to cross."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Selma\" is a movie that seems will remain prominent in popular discourse on history and race for some time to come, at least if screenings of it continue to reappear every Martin Luther King Jr. Day and February during Black History Month, Paramount continues to stream it for free when racial issues are front-page news, or school teachers continue to look for something that seems both educational and a way to keep students quiet while they hardly do any work themselves. It's not as though there have been very many biopics of Martin Luther King Jr., either, or even historical pictures about the civil rights movement. As original and always timely as \"Selma\" may be in that regard, it otherwise seems similar to another political biopic, if not hagiography, \"Lincoln\" (2012). Both focus on historical figures who've reached saintly proportions in the American imagination, both for their leadership in struggles against racist legal systems, and both movies largely avoid the simplistic good-vs-evil plot of the hero squaring off against the baddie in favor of focusing on the internal politics of the movement, whether in working the votes to pass the 13th Amendment or, 100 years later, in organizing the Selma-to-Montgomery marches to raise the issue of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nWith less focus on the likes of Alabama Governor George Wallace or Sheriff Jim Clark as evil obstacles to overcome, although that is still there on the margins, \"Selma,\" instead focuses on conflicts between King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and John Lewis's branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, but most prominently and controversially, there's the picture's battle of wills between King and President Lyndon Johnson. I'm not a historical expert on the matter and so won't get into the weeds on how accurate the portrayal of LBJ is here or whether the filmmakers veered too far in their avoidance of white-savior tropes towards historical inaccuracy. Indeed, it seems odd to me that a president wouldn't be eager to pass a bill that guarantees voting rights to a constituency that reliably votes upwards of over 90% for their party, but, then, this was the same administration consumed by the Vietnam War, so perhaps his priorities were at least questionable. Regardless, there've since been a couple bland biopics on Johnson since, for those interested: \"All the Way\" and \"LBJ\" (both 2016).\n\nBy focusing on the likes of King, Lewis and company, at least we get a greater sense of the grass-roots nature of the civil rights movement. One doesn't get the same view from privileging Washington, especially from a president whose FBI director was actively undermining the civil rights movement, including by attacking the marriage of the King family, as seen in \"Selma.\" These were rights achieved by activists and civilians, by shocking TV coverage of demonstrations and calls to action from the likes of King to galvanize people of all races to support equality. So, while \"Selma\" does partly follow a great-man-narrative with its focus on King, the trajectory of progress is from the ground up. There's a reason King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize shares the picture's opening with the tragedy of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and the everyday discrimination of Annie Lee Cooper (although casting Oprah Winfrey in this part arguably undermines the focus on common people somewhat) being denied the right to vote.\n\n\"Selma\" isn't perfect. Depicting the bombing in slow motion seems tactless. And the filmmakers don't entirely escape the pitfalls of the genre for grandstanding and speechifying even when characters aren't delivering speeches or in front of cameras. Nevertheless, David Oyelowo is outstanding as King--managing to appear forceful without being showy. The backstory of the internal politics behind the marches holds interest, and I like the inclusion of archival footage of the real event at the end. \"Selma\" is a palatable-enough treatment of historically significant events to be worthy of its prominence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)\n\nRating: 4.6/5 stars\n\nFueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, \"Selma\" draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. while also not ignoring how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied. The movie manages to beautifully articulate a pivotal moment in history \u2013 one that is hauntingly ironic in how it echoes our current times and society. It's a blast of piercing social insight expressed through exquisite craftsmanship by Director, Ava DuVernay (unpardonably robbed of a Best Director nomination at this year's Oscars), which makes it feel like art and not bald-faced messaging. On top of all of its many other virtues, \"Selma\" is an inspiring movie about politics and a large-scale human movement done right. A masterclass in directing, the film is a gripping, hard-hitting, and moving depiction of events in early 1965 as it chronicles Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nWhat's absolutely credible about the film is that it focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King \u2013 his doubts \u2013 and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance. He completely disappears into the persona of Martin Luther \u2013 diction, body language, oratory skills and all. Oyelowo's breakout performance should have rightly earned him an Oscar nomination (another major snub for this film). Nevertheless, it will be remembered by film lovers around the world for years to come. A number of historical dramas fall into the trap of sugar- coating the details of their subject matter in order to stress the qualities of their main protagonist. \"Selma\" does not display any such shortcoming as it refreshingly presents its main character as a flawed but inspirational figure. Cracking the civil rights leader and his associates from their plaster-saint cocoons, this latest offering on a one of Martin Luther's many emphatic triumphs presents a multidimensional portrayal of Dr. King, flaws and all, and succinctly demonstrates that we've both come a long way and have a long way to go. What makes the film \u2013 and a few of its shortcomings \u2013 such a vital work is how relevant its depiction of the events of 50 years ago are to today. While Oyelowo grabs this richly-scripted character by the scruff of its neck and leads the way, he's marvelously supported by a talented bunch of supporting cast members. The camaraderie and heated arguments demonstrated by the large and impressive ensemble of African-American character actors, beautifully capture the essence of the personalities and issues of those times.\n\nPolitics, segregation, and basic human rights, are just a few themes explored throughout this film, and all are done to pure perfection. Films about black rights have had highs and lows through the years, from being preachy to monotonous to breezily entertaining to just missing the mark to downright awful. \"Selma\" is among the few that falls in that rarest of rare categories of being truly incredible. Uniquely filmed, superbly written, and downright enthralling, this picture is one for the ages. I felt myself immersed in the lives of this group of individuals as they fought to earn respect and start a revolution. Inspiring, heart-pumping, and thought-provoking, \"Selma\" delivers the raw emotion many films lack these days, and for that, I can't give it enough credit. I was moved from beginning to end \u2013 the film is nothing short of being breathtaking. It's not just required viewing because it addresses issues that unfortunately exist in contemporary society; it's required viewing because it's a freaking fantastic film.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the events it depicts approaches, \"Selma\" feels chillingly contemporary, all too real, and monumental in more ways than one. Almost half a century since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill giving everyone the unquestionable right to vote, America and several other nations are still struggling with similar issues today. How is that even possible? It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much- needed wake-up-call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality. For this reason alone, such a phenomenally stirring production should be seen by everyone who believes in racial equality, and even more so by anyone who doesn't. Inspiring and impassioned, \"Selma\" has the power to enrage and enlighten while delivering Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's reverberating message of perseverance of the human spirit."

        "review_detailed_main": "The year is 1965 and every citizen in the USA still don't have voting rights. In the small community of Selma in Alabama, a woman tries to use her rights as a citizen to go and vote. She is unable to do so because according to the government of Selma, she doesn't have the right skin color. The political activist Martin Luther King Jr. hears about this and decides to do something. Selma is about the march that King initiated for voting rights for all African American people in the USA.\n\nDavid Oyelowo plays the lead role as Martin Luther King Jr. and the supporting cast includes Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo and Oprah Winfrey. Selma has been the topic of debates all over the USA, due to its political context, its historical view but also because it was overlooked at the Oscars. David Oyelowo does an astonishing job in portraying the political leader and I do think it is a pity he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Carmen Ejogo also did a great job portraying King's wife and was in my opinion also worthy of a nomination.\n\nSelma is very moving in many ways and also quite horrible from a human perspective. At one point or another, brutal scenes are mixed with a happy home environment, perhaps to say that there is happiness and hope even in all this madness. I think the weak spot of the film is the lack of focus. We get a glimpse of King's private life and the hardship he and his wife endured, but at the same time the film shows the political and the historical context of it all involving the governor, the local sheriff and the president. In the middle of it all we have the Selma march.\n\nThe film has also been questioned from a historical point of view because some critics feels that the portrayal of president Lyndon B. Johnson, isn't entirely correct. Personally I would have liked to see more from King's private life, and a deeper character development. I think a film more focused on the psychological aspect and not the political, would have made a greater impact.\n\nSelma is still worth seeing for what the march actually did for the USA as a nation. It is always important to look back and see where we have been, before we look forward to see where we are going. The film is an important life lesson for all of us, but I think it would have been more effective if it were a more personal film. The debates around Selma have mainly been focused on its historical context instead of actually discussing human rights, and I think that's shame.\n\nDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

Led by the great Dr. Martin Luther King, this march was a seminal moment in the '60s Civil Rights movement. This picture reverently and seriously recounts those days and does a strong job doing so. It is a GOOD movie, but it is this seriousness, this reverence, that ultimately keeps this movie from being GREAT. It bogs itself down, at times, under the weight of it's own seriousness.\n\nDavid Oyelowa plays Dr. King as a determined, moral man looking to drive change in his country. I need to give Oyelowa the highest praise I can for this type of bio-pic. He recreates the essence of Dr. King without being a mimic. I felt as if I was watching a real person and not an actor acting like a certain person.\n\nOyelowa is surrounded by a topnotch cast - Carmen Ejogo (as Coretta Scott King), Tim Roth (a welcome site as Gov. George Wallace), Tom Wilkinson (LBJ), Common, Wendell Pierce and Oprah Winfrey. Special notice should be paid to Lorraine Toussaint as Amelia Boynton. I've always thought that Toussaint was a fine, but unspectacular actress, but her performance in this movie has changed my mind about her. She was terrific.\n\nAbsolutely, SELMA is a movie that must be seen. It tells a story that needs to be told. Clearly, the filmmakers thought that as well and felt that importance, that weight as well.\n\n8(out of 10) stars and you can take that to the BANK (of Marquis)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The 15th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing all Americans the right to vote was ratified in 1870, and yet almost a century later (1965) when the events of \"Selma\" transpired, no more than 2% of African-American citizens were registered to vote in many deep-South counties. And as we see in the beginning of Selma, you practically had to memorize the U.S. Constitution to satisfy the county registrars, but that still might not be good enough. So, as depicted in this dramatically stirring film, Martin Luther King has to mobilize his marchers in Alabama and incur horrendous beatings from the Alabama troopers, and thereby dramatize the injustice of the voting impediments that are brought to bear on black Alabamans. This elicits the nation's political attention and white sympathy. All of this culminates in the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe British actor, David Oyelowo, seems to be the reincarnation of ML King. He looks remarkably like him, and even sounds like him, even when he's portraying King's masterful oratory. In Selma, King's tactical shrewdness is depicted to great effect. He protected the safety of his followers, to the extent he could, but he realized that the Bull Connor's (Birmingham) and Sheriff Clark's (Selma) were, in a macabre sort of way, the best arguments for the 1960s civil rights movement. I wonder how long segregation would have persisted in the south with national television.\n\nThere's a debate in all historically-themed films on how much scope to give to artistic / dramatic license and how much faithfulness a film should give to the historical record. I'm not a strict pedant on historical accuracy, and thus I acknowledge that films can appropriately push their dramatic momentum by slight or modest revisions in the historical record. But Selma goes too far in its unfairness to President Johnson. Sure, it makes for more dramatic tension to have an quasi-adversarial relationship between LBJ and King, but they were far more partners than adversaries. LBJ wanted a voting rights act as soon as the Democrats piled up huge Congressional majorities in the 1964 Goldwater election. Not a lot of things went right for LBJ in his 2nd term; let's at least give him some credit for working with King to get the voting rights law enacted.\n\nA final delicious moment that Selma reminds me of: in the special Alabama senatorial election in December of 2017, Doug Jones defeated the noxious Roy Moore largely with the votes of black Alabamans, especially black women, who had the voting power they sorely lacked in 1965."

        "review_detailed_main": "The great African-American poet Langston Hughes in his poem, \"As I Grew Older\" asks us to help him find his dream. \"Help me to shatter this darkness,\" he asks \"to smash this night, to break this shadow into a thousand lights of sun, into a thousand whirling dreams of sun.\" Though for many minorities, the thousand lights of sun are still a whirling dream, what it took to begin to break that shadow is movingly depicted in Ava DuVernay's Selma, a dramatization of the campaign in Selma, Alabama to end discrimination against African-American's right to vote, a right guaranteed by the constitution.\n\nThe protests, led by the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo), a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who embraced nonviolence to combat violent segregationists, became one of the major turning points in the Civil Rights Movement. Written by Paul Webb with input from the director, the film shows King as both a practical strategist with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a gifted orator. Thankfully, DuVernay does not try to sanitize him but shows him as a fierce opponent of the status quo who was willing to engage in confrontations with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, President Johnson, and Alabama Governor George Wallace to further his goals.\n\nLike Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, the film focuses on a specific period in King's life, the months in which he led highly publicized marches from Selma to Montgomery. After accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, a speech in which he referred to the 1963 bombing that killed four children attending church in Birmingham (shown in flashback), King brought his movement to Selma, Alabama in January, 1965. Although the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 outlawing discrimination, the practice of denying blacks the right to vote was still widespread in the South, demonstrated by showing Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) being subjected to absurd questioning in order to qualify, such as asking her to name all of Alabama's 67 judges.\n\nThough the registration campaign conducted by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) led by John Lewis (Stephan James) and James Forman (Trai Byers) was gaining momentum, it still had little success and King believed that the situation called for the kind of direct action that would capture media attention. On March 7, 1965, Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce) of the SCLC and John Lewis led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery (King was not present).\n\nOnly six blocks into the march, at the Edmund Pettis Bridge, state troopers and local police led by Sheriff Jim Clark attacked the peaceful demonstrators with clubs, tear gas, and bull whips, an ugly scene witnessed by the entire country. The beatings, though brutal, are shown discreetly, as is the depiction of the shooting death of young protester Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) by an Alabama state trooper and that of James Reeb (Jeremy Strong), a Boston clergyman, murdered by white racists.\n\nThough the marchers made a second attempt to cross the bridge, this time with both white and black supporters who came from all parts of the country, it was aborted by Dr. King who feared more violence, even though the police had cleared a path for the marchers. In the face of angry criticism, King said that he would rather that people hated him than be beaten or killed. The film also shows King in consultation with President Lyndon Johnson to help push through voting rights legislation. DuVernay has been criticized by former Johnson associates of attempting to falsify the full extent of Johnson's cooperation, but, in response, the director points to an article by Louis Menand in the New Yorker.\n\nIn that article, Menand said that though Johnson had directed his Attorney General to prepare a tough voting rights act, he waited, worried that more civil rights legislation would endanger support for the War on Poverty and divert his attention from the then escalating Vietnam War. Johnson eventually decided that the time was right and is generally portrayed as a reasonable man who saw the error of his ways, a dubious proposition since Johnson was a life-long segregationist who, as Vice President, opposed Kennedy's civil rights agenda and repeatedly cautioned President Kennedy to wait \"until the time is right.\" Likewise, his response to Dr. King's 1967 speech opposing the Vietnam War is unprintable. To its credit, however, the film does not hesitate to call out Hoover who, with LBJ's approval, attempted to silence Dr. King through wiretaps and anonymous phone calls to his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo), describing her husband's infidelities.\" Selma is a welcome breakthrough in its candid depiction of the Civil Rights Movement, a subject mostly avoided for fifty years.\n\nThe British actor Oyelowo delivers a convincing performance, one in which he clearly mastered the inflections of Dr. King's speech, though no actor can truly provide more than a shadow of the spiritual power of the man. While the dialogue at times sounds more like speechifying than natural conversation, Selma is a strong film that sends a clear message to a new generation about what standing up against intimidation in any form is all about. It is a passionate work about a towering figure who left an enduring legacy, but one that, as recent events in Ferguson, Cleveland, and New York may indicate, is sadly still short of completion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whenever I see a movie about a historical figure, certainly one as famous as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I have two questions a) What new angle is this movie bringing that makes it worth watching in addition to all of the previous footage, documentaries and films we've seen already and b) is the movie good on its own merit, or does the quality of the story reside entirely on the fact that what happened was true, and that history has proved this person to be right in the long run? In the case of \"Selma\" I am excited to say that not only is the film worth seeing even if you are familiar with the events that are being portrayed on-screen, but the performances and the angle at which the story tackled are so strong and so powerful that it's one of the best movies of 2014. This film is similar to 2012 \"Lincoln\" in that it's about Martin Luther King, Jr., but it's not about his entire life, it's about the events that developed in the small town of Selma, Alabama around the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches.\n\nI suppose I should begin by saying that this is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy. Even if you're white (like myself) you're not going to be offended, you're not going to feel guilty about the racism being displayed in 1965. Not unless you're racist and you've done similar things to others, at which point either I commend you for being brave enough to see a movie that will hopefully change your views, or you're not even watching this film because you're a fool with Cro-Magnon era beliefs. The reason you will not feel guilty watching this picture is because you are intelligent enough to see past the color of people's skin; you are going to be putting yourself in the shoes of the protesters, not of the racists who attack them. It's a powerful emotional experience, that is often troubling, but it's meant to be. You will feel upset, but it's the good kind of upset. It's the type of emotion that you are glad to have felt because it enriches your life and makes you understand your fellow man better.\n\nMy understanding is that, like every movie that's \"based on a true story\" they take some liberties to make the film more coherent and dramatic, particularly during the moments between King and then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. I didn't care, and you shouldn't care because you shouldn't be basing your history reports (or book reports for that matter) on films. If you want the facts, you go to the library. If you want to be entertained, go watch the movie.\n\nWithin \"Selma\" are some powerful and scathing reviews of the politicians at the time. The people in power at Selma, most notably Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) are very satisfyingly exposed for the brutish trilobites that they were. Are the portrayals exaggerated? I don't feel like they were (Except as I mentioned before when it comes to the President). The facts are that crimes against African-Americans were being committed and that no one was doing anything about it until the people who were being oppressed rose up. Even then they were met with senseless opposition from devils who hated them solely because of the color of their skin. I found myself feeling white-hot hatred towards the spineless, dust-brained sons of jackals who dared to stand up against people simply trying to exercise their rights as ordinary citizens. Fortunately for me, and for those that were being oppressed, we are having the last laugh by seeing this film. History will remember them for what they are, and their legacies will only be one of hatred. Their names have become a curse to be thrown at the lowest of bottom-feeders and the most ignorant half-wits that barely qualify as \"living\". In that sense, I have gotten my revenge against them and boy am I glad.\n\nI love watching a movie with powerful emotions because it makes me feel alive. It's the opposite of watching something as awful as \"The Boy Next Door\", which made me want to cease existing out of embarrassment for the human race. This is a movie that makes you feel. It will shock you, it will make you feel sad and angry, but it also makes you feel empowered. I left the theater invigorated, ready to take on the injustices of the world and determined to do something with my freedom to give the rest of humanity the same joys that I experience and take for granted every day. A big portion of the power of this piece is due to the transcendent performances on display. David Oyelowo as King is particularly powerful and nearly out shadows everyone else involved. It's the kind of powerhouse display of acting that knocks you off your feet it's so good, because it feels so genuine. I want to stress that this movie would have been good solely because of the subject matter, but it's the performances and the tangible dedication of Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Keith Stanfield, Lorraine Toussaint and everyone else involved. There is not a moment where the film feels artificial or false, and for that I give praise to director Ava DuVernay.\n\nI can't think of anyone that shouldn't see this movie. Even if you extensively researched the events portrayed in the film and wrote a book about them, I think there are some things here that would powerfully resonate with you (you'll have to forgive the exaggerated events and character though). \"Selma\" is easily one of the best movies of the year, and it still would be if it was just David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King, Jr. ordering a slice of pie at a diner. He is that good. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 3, 2015)"

This film is depicted in detail how he stirs up the world little by little. When he speaks out in public, he is just viewed as an eloquent and brave figure; however, the film tells us that King Jr. is at times afraid of resisting his antagonists. In addition, some of the core members of demonstration decide who should be in the very front in marching by scissors-paper-stone. If I were in this situation, I would hope not to be the one in front to death. They are of course fearful for their action, but they end up with overcoming the fear.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first heard of Selma, I didn't exactly know what the movie was about, other than Martin Luther King Jr. so I didn't expect much out of it other than the usual recap of history. But Selma went above and beyond my expectations,\n\nSelma is a masterpiece, and I don't use that word lightly. Powerful doesn't begin to describe this movie. It seems every year we get some sort of film that touches on racism but no movie I have personally seen has effected me quite like this. This tale of Martin Luther King Jr. doesn't follow his entire life, but it doesn't need to. It follows a very important moment in his fight for equal rights in Selma, Alabama to give blacks the same rights to vote as whites. While the story was indeed engaging and had me in it from start to finish, its the respect they give the characters that really shines. David Oyelowo delivers a tour de force performance as the great man himself, but it was his interaction with his followers and the grand speeches that really made my jaw drop. Few performances can actually leave me speechless, this was one of them. He undoubtedly needs to receive some attention come award season. You could fight about what is accurate and what wasn't, but at this point I have come to accept that no biography in cinema will ever stick completely to the true story. If it means a more entertaining experience, I am all for it. This film had me involved emotionally, it didn't shy away from the truths of violence, it delivered its messages respectfully, and best of all it gave us the best portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. to date. David Oyelowo should be commended, as should director Ava DuVernay for giving us a real depiction of bravery and what a true hero really looks like. Selma is a work of cinematic art in my opinion, and it never once backed down from the reality of life and the life of a great man."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there's one thing Americans are really good at, it's making films about their own history. There are countless interesting films about important periods in the history of the US. This thought crossed my mind, because in 'Selma' we see both Malcolm X and J. Edgar Hoover, about whom excellent films have been made in the past, enabling me to put everything in the right context. To have the history of your country documented with excellent films, is a great thing.\n\n'Selma' is an outstanding contribution to this tradition. It documents an important period in the civil rights movement: the march from Selma to Montgomery, a protest march to obtain legally sound voting rights for the black population in Alabama. It concentrates on a rather short period in the life of Martin Luther King, and doesn't include too many side-stories. That's a wise choice: the viewer doesn't get the chance to lose attention or to be distracted. The screenplay intelligently switches between the goings-on in Alabama, where the black population stands up against the suppression by white racists, and Washington, where King puts pressure on president Lyndon B. Johnson to start the necessary political process.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is impressive as Martin Luther King. He convincingly shows all aspects of King's personality: the preacher, who is able to inspire crowds with his speeches; the politician, who knows how to play power games if necessary, and the husband, who realizes he has disappointed the woman he loves. By the way: a peculiar detail is that four major parts are played by British actors: King, his wife, president Johnson and governor Wallace."

        "review_detailed_main": "This drama about MLK and the fight for voting rights in the south is notable for a few things. One is how well it establishes the stakes. Violence is a small part of the film but every violent moment is a gut punch that tells you how real and often indiscriminate the danger was. The forces of darkness gave no quarter.\n\nIt also gets into the strategy. This is less MLK the inspirational leader than it is Martin the strategist. His strategy includes putting people in danger and playing hardball, and at times he shrinks from the necessity of what must be done, but you see how effective that strategy is. (Oddly the movie doesn't explain the strategy of a certain retreat, although I found an explanation online).\n\nWhile movies of real events often try and shrink participants into one or two, Selma isn't afraid to show how many people were a part of the movement. Many characters don't have much to do, but they're all in there, giving you a sense of a movement that's more than just one great man.\n\nAt the same time, David Oyelowo is good at the thoughtful part of MLK but falls short on the charisma, failing to capture that preacher cadence and that soaring rhetoric. I appreciate the egalitarian view, but still, MLK was often electric and Oyelowo just doesn't have that electricity.\n\nOverall, this is an engrossing movie that offers a lot of historical information yet never falls into the educational-film trap of movie's like \"Lincoln.\" It is effective both as history and drama. I recommend it for both."

The cast did a magnificent job in portraying their characters with believable gripping performances. The best portrayals came from David Oyelowo (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) Carmen Ejogo (Coretta Scott King) Tom Wilkinson (President Lyndon B. Johnson) and Tim Roth (Governor George Wallace). What I liked most about this film was that although you knew what was going to happen and while watching it you might think that a film like this is full of clich\u00e9s it was still overall a good film. I wasn't disappointed and I don't think you will be either. It's definitely a film that is worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are certain people and events throughout history that are so obviously in need of a cinematic treatment, that their absence from the big screen leaves audiences wondering what on earth took so long. Such is the case with the one of the most recognizable and referenced figures in Western society, Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. This larger than life individual whose life and accomplishments are far too grand for a simple studio feature film, has luckily never been subjected to an impoverished movie. Instead, Dr. King is assimilated as a key figure in Ava DeVernay's re-telling of the events in Selma, Alabama. DeVernay illustrates the movement organized by Dr. King which brought to light the fact that although African American's (predominantly in the South) had the constitutional right to vote, they had not seen a registered vote cast for over sixty years. Just like the events that unfolded throughout the worldwide broadcasting of Bloody Sunday, the march in Selma was a fair catalyst to the establishment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a bill that gave all Americans equal opportunity to exercise their democratic rights.\n\nIt is without a doubt that MLK is an influential figure who sadly suffered the same tragic fate of other great American figures including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. This doom alone could easily make for an explosive and easily appealing studio film for large audiences. Though, what detaches Selma from other biopics and sets it up amongst the greats, like Steven Spielberg's recent Lincoln, is its focus on a specific period in time; allowing the events and characters to unfold in fine cinematic fashion around these prevalent historical shifts on the world. Biopics may not be the go-to genre for spoilers, twist-endings, and large box-offices, but movies like Selma reaffirm the fine tailored approach of filmmakers looking to retell the milestones of world history and offer exceptional character insight on the visionaries we have immortalized.\n\nSelma may seem too daunting to many, serving more of a history lesson with real violent historical events\u2013that is Bloody Sunday, than an entertaining piece of film discouraging potential viewers. Instead, the film chronicles both the violent and peaceful moments of the period with COMPLETE eloquence and patience, allowing Selma to become one of the most vivid and colourful history lessons we have seen on screen in a long time. More than anything, Selma depicts an important piece of American history for a time that needs reaffirmed confidence and faith in the goodness and changes people are willing to make everyday.\n\nTimely in its fashion for the current events plaguing the United States today, the film is a heavy- handed, dramatic and necessary piece of cinematic awareness for a country whose civil views have not changed much for almost fifty years. Scarily mimicking the events of Ferguson, Mo. and the current issues circling America, Selma becomes a contemporary mandatory viewing for all people\u2013of all race and colour.\n\nDirector DuVernay, approaches a monumental cinematic achievement with many obstacles. Wishes of Dr. King's kin that DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb not incorporate any original speeches left the film's representation of the most pivotal character with the potential lack of authenticity.\n\nOvercoming this, DuVernay and Webb stray away from the monumental \"I Have A Dream\" speech, as well as the obvious tragedy of Dr.King's assassination, instead displaying a relatable leader with humanistic flaws: characteristics many would otherwise be oblivious to. On top of the film's apparent issues of gaining rights from Dr. King's family (similar to All Is By My Side and the music of Jimi Hendrix), the film also endured a strenuous identity crisis, with the possibility of being helmed by the likes of; Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann, Spike Lee, Paul Haggis, Stephen Frears (attached with Oyelowo to star), and Lee Daniels fresh off of his other civil rights film The Butler. Yet, easily foreseeable by her previous delicate work I Will Follow and Middle of Nowhere, no one seems more qualified or destined to bring life to the events of Selma than DuVernay; a- once resident of Alabama herself and a director whose voice and view of the eventful day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge changed the United States and its people forever.\n\nNever constraining itself to the obvious location, Selma also offers insight to the importance of ego and its development into its own character in the lives of the Selma marchers. Shutting great men down permanently and unequivocally through scenes of extreme prejudice, racism and struggle, characters such as President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), CIA founder J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), and Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) give depth to the many facets of politics and the agendas of men throughout that time, and their priorities to the American people. Seeing such amazing talent in one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Dr.King's interactions with elite politicians (most specifically those with Wilkinson, who offers some of his best recent work since Michael Clayton) shines.\n\nYet, no matter how big the name or actor is, some of the best scenes of the film are those with the less recognizable figures during the civil rights movement; including a scene between a grieving Cager Lee Jackson PLAYED by Henry G. Sanders (father of the slain Jimmi Lee Jackson PLAYED by Short Term 12's Keith Stanfield) as well as a quietly insightful yet tremendously uplifting scene between Dr.King and a then John Lewis (played by star-in-the-making Toronto native Stephan James)."

        "review_title": "David Oyelowo finally grants Dr. Martin Luther King the cinematic justice he deserves in \"Selma\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are moments in \"Selma\" when I felt like I was watching Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (played brilliantly by David Oyelowo) himself speaking on screen. Moments that made me want to clap my hands and stand up and cheer in approval of what he was saying. Moments when I was having to hold tears back. And these moments have stayed with me a couple of days after watching the film. These moments prove how timeless the story and issues are that \"Selma\" presents to us and although it would be difficult not to get these across, \"Selma\" does so in a way unlike any other biopic.\n\nDavid Oyelowo, a British actor, is fantastic and it is an absolute scandal that he has not been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar this year. Perhaps the Academy is still tapping themselves on the back for giving \"12 Years a Slave\" the Best Picture Oscar last year. When Oyelowo is making those speeches that King made to the Selma black clergy it was like I was watching King in the flesh. Oyelowo looks and sounds like King, effortlessly capturing his manner, grace and style and arguably most importantly his faith. Oyelowo simply pioneers the film in regards to performances, obviously helped along by the fame of his real-life counterpart, the other actors and actresses in the film simply revolve around him. This is especially obvious in the scenes where we get to see King and his colleagues deciding how to proceed in Selma. These backstage scenes seem just like how they would have been, providing an interesting viewpoint considering there isn't a lot of material detailing what happened. In these scenes King's colleagues also shine through, Colman Domingo (playing Ralph Abernathy) and Wendell Pierce (playing the Rev. Hosea Williams) are both worth mentioning for their performances. These scenes though do not focus on King and thus do well to emphasise that he was both not alone nor was a God of sorts, but just simply a great man, making him even more relatable and deserved of my sympathy.\n\nOf course \"Selma\" is a true story and the film sticks to it throughout ultimately doing it a perfect kind of justice. The fact that the film chose Selma as what it was going to cover was a good choice. There was the \"battleground\" that King decided to use as a means by which to end the struggle blacks had experienced in regards to registering to vote. It's ultimately the moments which have been well documented that are where the film thrives, \"Bloody Sunday\" for example. But where the film begins to waver is in its half-hearted commitment towards King's personal life and I believe this comes from how we obviously know less about King's personal life then what we know about him as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. It's those scenes where we see King giving speeches or leading the marches through Selma which are the film's best, whereas the hypothesised conversations between King and his wife, and meetings between the C.I.A. director J. Edgar Hoover and President Lyndon B. Johnson really bring the film out of focus.\n\n\"Selma\" though is ultimately the best biopic I have ever seen. Although I've mentioned that King's personal life for me got in the way of the film, you have to see \"Selma\", not only because of how, as critic Richard Roeper put it, it's a film that provides a history lesson but certainly doesn't feel like a history lecture, but also because of how the film finally grants King the cinematic justice he deserves with a brilliant performance by Oyelowo."

You could hardly go wrong in telling this story, a microcosm of the broader civil rights campaign: in this drama, you have many of the major figures in the wider battle: George Wallace, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, and of course, the charismatic Martin Luther King, who naturally takes centre stage in this movie. He's quite well brought to life by David Olelowo, who certainly looks the part and acts it convincingly (though the film mostly elides his private life). Tom Wilkinson is slightly less successful as Johnson, a more generic politician than the larger-than-life figure who emerges from Robert Caro's biography. Even though the narrative is straightforward: a fierce and violent struggle, then the good guys win, there's still something very moving when the story reaches its conclusion. But in the age of 'Black Lives Matter' and the presidency of Donald Trump, maybe also shocking at how much still needs to be done."

Like Dr. King, DuVernay prefers to work with words rather than depend on visuals and the result is a series of quiet, well-reasoned arguments (the articulate screenplay is by Paul Webb) that bring out the dignity of the topics and of the performers; when the necessary counterpoint of violence is shown, it only serves to underscore the importance of the discussions and DuVarny smartly keeps these sequences short. As a director, she makes good choices, preferring to film in the familiar sepia tones that we seem to associate with the civil rights movement (the cinematography is by Bradord Young); and she knows when to closely involve us (with the use of hand-held cameras) and when to wisely stay out of the way in order to let her performers shine--which they do, particularly David Oyelowo as King and Carmen Ejogo as his wife. They get so lost in the characters you can't help but be pulled in; one focus of the film is on the stress that the movement places on their marriage and the actors' convincing ability to unify on every level is one of the film's quiet triumphs. \"Selma\" is a labor of love for DuVernay and while her facts may be questionable, as a filmmaker, she gets it right."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes you have to hand it to Oprah Winfrey. She can be preachy, she can pull your heartstrings so hard they nearly snap, and her sentimentality at times rivals that of German kitsch. But with \"Selma,\" she has given us a moving and powerful morality story about the power of perseverance. Do not miss this film.\n\n\"Selma\" tells the story of a high mark in the career of Martin Luther King, Jr., the famous march from Selma, Alabama to the capital in Montgomery in support of equal voting rights \u2013 something we badly need reminding, given Republican efforts at voter suppression and a Republican Supreme Court which supports that suppression. I suspect that King today would be more vocal than ever were he alive.\n\nWhat \"Selma\" tells us is that things haven't changed very much. Yes, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did grant equal protection for all Americans, regardless of ancestry. And, ever since, conservatives have been trying to water it down; they just can't be blatant about it anymore. It's not just insane requirements of the sort the Act sought to strike down resurfacing. When you consider that one in three black men will go to jail at some point in his life, and that convicted felons lose the right to vote, it adds up to a significant dilution of the black vote. It's clear that the fight is not over.\n\nAs King, David Oyelowo is truly astonishing. He doesn't attempt to imitate King; a classically trained stage actor, he finds the man's character in all its humanity, and it shows. His King isn't an inspiring Superman leading the movement without a slip. His King connives with the best of them, and he makes mistakes. One marvelous moment is the fear evident in King's eyes as one of the marches is about to start. You can almost see the words \"What the hell are we doing?\" in his eyes. In a scene that could be a textbook for actors, King and his wife, Coretta (the pitch perfect Carmen Ejogo) face a marital crisis, and in that moment, King is as humbled as the rest of us when faced with the choice of losing his wife and family or fulfilling his mission. In fact, there is not a single bad or weak performance in the entire film.\n\nI've got to give some credit to Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth as President Lyndon Johnson and Governor George Wallace, respectively. Both men are very accomplished actors. Wilkinson plays Johnson as the wheeler- dealer he actually was, the man who (almost) always gets his way. There is considerable irony when King visits Johnson in his office; a portrait of Andrew Jackson, easily America's most racist president, looks over Johnson's shoulder much of the time.\n\nIn real life George Wallace was a hateful, repulsive leech, but Tim Roth gives him some humanity. His Wallace just can't understand why black people are demanding their rights. In his view, they've gotten along just fine without them for hundreds of years. It's not just racism; Roth's Wallace really can't understand what's going on.\n\nI'm surprised I had not heard of Ava DuVernay before this. According to IMDb, she has spent most of her career as a publicist and documentary director. But she is the only black female director to win Best Director at the Sundance film festival (2012). DuVernay is now a front-rank film director. If she continues in this vein, she has a great career ahead of her.\n\nI guarantee you won't easily forget the first five minutes of this film. The scenes actually filmed in Selma are uncanny, as if these events were taking place today. DuVernay obviously knows how to get the best from her actors.\n\nThat there are no acting or directing Academy Award nominations for \"Selma\" is an artistic crime. How can you pick a film for Best Picture without acknowledging the people who made it? The sad thing is, I don't think it was conscious on the part of Academy voters. The Oscars are as political as anything else requiring a vote, and I think the mostly white Academy voters voted for their pocketbooks and their friends. Merit does not win as often as it should.\n\nAt its best, \"Selma\" shows what we can accomplish by simply never giving up and standing resolute. Given the craven nature of the human soul, this is a valuable reminder."

        "review_detailed_main": "We still need these films. I have heard the arguments of \"this was so long ago\" or \"racism is gone, we don't need to see this film\". I will tell you as a white man that neither of those arguments are valid. These events were only 50 years ago. In fact some people who took part in these events are still alive. It baffles me that people don't think Selma is an important film. Selma is the most powerful film I have seen this year. I saw it by myself, and it took me places emotionally that I don't think I have been before in a theater.\n\nFirst of all, major props to everyone involved in the making of this film. I know the Oscar nominations caused controversy on whether or not Selma should have been nominated for more awards, in particular, David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay. Out of all the performances I have seen this year Oyelowo is definitely in the top 5. He embodies everything we know about Martin Luther King Jr, and even gives a little bit of spin on it. That's the other thing I loved about this film, I cant tell you how many very famous actors took these small parts, so they could be a part of this incredibly important film.\n\nI also liked that this wasn't necessarily just a Dr. King story. It told the story of the Selma march, and even quite a bit about some of the other important people involved in this famous event. Wilkinson played Johnson perfectly, as he was torn between changing the voting rights or not. But there were so many other incredible performances that could have been recognized. Even Oprah did a really nice job. But the film took it to another level once I saw the Selma march. Reading about such events in history books is one thing, but when you see what man is capable of in a graphic way was another thing completely. These people were just asking for their voting rights to be recognized and they were brutally beaten and murdered. The way DuVernay shot the film made it that much more devastating. Seeing shots of white men riding horses with guns and batons just wiping the bridge with the blood of these people was one of the most brutal things I have ever seen. I'm getting choked up just writing about it. I was literally shaking my head ready to yell at the screen when this happened.\n\nI don't think I have been that impacted by a film in a long time. The fact that it was only half a century ago is unbelievable. Oyelowo gave us some extraordinary speeches and the supporting cast was impeccable. DuVernay perfectly directed this and gave us one of the best films of the year. It's true though, schools should be required to show this when they go over the civil rights unit. It's a story that I was aware of but not to the extent that occurs over the course of these brutal 2 hours.

David Oyelowo did a good job portraying Dr. Martin Luther King in his fight for the civil rights every man should have, regarding his color, race or religion. It's a touching biography where I had a couple tears running down my cheeks at some point. It's a shame that some humans are such disgusting people, especially in the South of America at that time. It was not good being colored and living in the South in a not so distant past. To me Selma was interesting to watch even though I don't totally agree with non-violent protests. It's sad to say but without violence the high society, if you can call them like that, will always be stomping on your head. Dr. Martin Luther King was a great man, despise his stupid belief in a God. How you can believe in a God with all the injustices in the world is a thing I can not understand. Well, that's my point of view. Anyways, Selma is a good touching movie to watch."

His strategy of peacefully protesting while not giving Johnson a chance to rest and ignore the problems of African Americans is truly genius.\n\nThe actors in the movie did well. The casting was really good in regards to physical similarities and their ability to portray dramatic emotions. MLK's actor did a really good job bringing the energy. His speeches were motivating.\n\nThis isn't exactly a watch for enjoyment kind of movie. This movie is to teach and reflect. As shown in the title of the movie, this film is about the story of Selma, not MLK's life. If you are going into this movie wanting to learn about MLK specifically you may be disappointed but it's still a really good story."

I think this movie did a good job portraying the climate of the time and how the different sides conflicted and tried to resolve things and most of the time it never worked, but eventually, for the better side, it did. And how lengthy and how much of a push-back the white house was about all of this. Overall, I think it was a great movie that portrayed the time and people in an interesting light."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never been so ashamed of the human race as I am right now, writing this review after seeing history depicted in Selma. It is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen, so much so that I struggle to find words to describe its amazing work.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is mesmerising in the role of Martin Luther King, completely vanishing into the part. Not only does he have King's voice and appearance locked, he carries such a magnetic presence that he could very well be channeling the spirit of the great man himself. Not since Sean Penn portrayed Harvey Milk have I seen such a respectful and authentic performance. The supporting cast has strong performances - Wilkinson as LBJ for one, and a devastating turn by Robert G. Sanders for another - but for the most part they are subtle and allow Oyelowo and DuVernay to craft the tale.\n\nDuVernay is superb in the directors chair. All of the artistic choices are executed so well and Selma contains some of the most devastating cinema ever put to screen. On a small personal favourite, the CIA logs as captions for historical events is a fantastic idea that works splendidly with the story.\n\nTwist my arm for a flaw, and I'll point to the script. There is so much wonderful stuff in here, its terrible to point to it as the flaw, but I must. Selma does a wonderful job of depicting MLK as a normal man, but there is one too many scenes of him in self-doubt (especially where its placement makes no sense) and one too many scenes of Coretta Scott King and her marital problems with King. At one point I felt like the film was beating me over the head saying \"LOOK! SEE? HE'S NORMAL LIKE YOU!\" That subplot looked to feature prominently, but was promptly discarded halfway through and never revisited.\n\nBut I will not dwell any further on the flaws. With Pride and Boyhood, Selma forms a might trio of 2014's profoundly affecting films, and deserves all of the praise it can get in the years to come."

I honestly expected a bit more from the film and instead ended up watching every other Martin Luther King movie ever.\n\nNow this movie does have a few things going for it\n\nAn amazing soundtrack- One that really goes with the impact of the story A few deep and emotionally gripping scenes. Yes there really powerful in many ways.\n\nHowever we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy.\n\nBut I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all.\n\nI never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned.\n\nThere are just other movies that do Martin more justice\n\n-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to China\n\nThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe.\n\nOverall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "The historical Drama film Selma which was directed by Ava DuVernay, written by Paul Webb and published in year 2014 chronicles the three-month period in 1965, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his Southern Christian Leadership conference colleges led a dangerous campain to achieve equal voting Rights in the Face of violent Opposition. Eventually the march from Selma to Montgomery led to President Johnson signing the Voting rights act of 1965. The movie tells the Story of how Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and other activists in the movement Change history.\n\nThe drama film presents an historical earth shattering event from the 1960s. The Director of the movie is Ava DuVarney who is known for her stories based on African American society like other movies that she dedicated to Martin Luther King.\n\nThe lead actor and his Co-Stars in Selma gave great, authentic, convincing performance and mostly were appropriately cast, which corresponds to how many awards the movie got for it's rendition.\n\nA feature that sticked out to me the most was the reference to original video material from the actual historic event in 1965 as it gave a convincing and moving touch to the Action, as well as the music which was only present in significant moments and the theme-Song Glory by John Legend.\n\nTo sum up, in my opinion Selma is a very successful piece, which is suitable for both personal interest and study purposes. This is why I enjoyed watching the Drama Film in My englisch class."

The film looks incredible I mean I think the shadows and how the camera plays with lighting, especially in the church scene. I like watching historic movies because then I can go \"Oh wait I know that guy\" and it's Malcolm X. I think the casting was also great. All the actors did their best when telling the story and props to David Oyelowo for taking on the daunting task of trying to recreate MLK onscreen. I liked how whenever Oyelowo was on screen, it didn't seem like it was someone trying to be MLK. It felt like \"Oh that's supposed to be MLK, but this guy is just his own\". Overall this was a great movie with incredible elements going for it."

I think he might have enjoyed putting on that character, his mannerisms were realistic. I'm sure the role was nerve wracking since he had to fill such big shoes. That being said, the overall aesthetic of this movie captures (I think) the widespread emotion found in the black community at the time. It was horrific, scary, and nothing was for certain. The cinematography really captured that and I appreciate it. I dont find myself having gripes with this movie. I'm sure some scenes were randomly added in, or dramatized just to have the movie filled or more interesting, but if I wanted a cut and dry reenactment I would watch a documentary.

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems a film like Selma, could not come out at a more appropriate time than now. I am sure that everyone who reads this review and has paid attention to the news this past year, whether in print, online, or on television will be familiar with all the murders that have been going on and labelled as racially motivated. These stories (and there were quite a few of them), dominated the news headlines because of the uncertainty and ambiguousness of the killings as well as inciting people to create riots and marches and in some ways showing that even after all these years with the march in Selma, Alabama as well as the work that Martin Luther King, and others have done, will perhaps still not fully be realized, or come to the dream ending that they were originally hoping for. Were all these recent events across America, based solely on racism? I am no expert in criminology, or anything like that, but it certainly makes one take notice and consider such options for a moment. The film is an interesting testament to the racial times during the mid 1960's and the battle for integration and segregation no longer as well as the right to vote for all African Americans. The thing about this film coming out as timely and at such a time as this, is that it shows that in some ways we have accomplished a lot, but in other ways not so much. The message and the theme behind Selma, is certainly an interesting one and it is a very well made film, but I just wished I liked the film better than I did. While, I still enjoyed it and found a lot to admire about it, I did not find it a perfect film, or a masterpiece. I find it quite hard to actually pinpoint the negatives about this film because I really did not have too many problems with it and it was a well made film, both on the sides of work in front of and behind the camera. I liked how the film was more of an independent production and that everything in the film was more low key, subtle and gave a more authentic feeling and look to the events. As with any Hollywood film dealing with real people and subject matter, I often feel that the smaller you go in scope, sometimes the better your film will turn out. If this had been a film made for a lot of money with a lot of big names and actors in it as well as a lot of pomp and expenses poured into making it a big, huge, epic film, than I think the simple yet subtle tone the director went for, would have been destroyed and I don't think the film would have come out as well, or had as lasting an impact. The film is also a little slower in it's pace with no major action sequences, or anything like that, but instead thoughtful scenes involving dialogue and good acting and emotions to further emphasize everything that Martin Luther King, was trying to achieve and the various setbacks and racial overtones that were preventing him from achieving his dream. While the film was very interesting, well acted, written and directed, I did not feel I could connect with it on an emotional level like I was hoping for. At the same time, I did not wish for the film to be overly dramatic, or even melodramatic in either it's acting, tone, or music. That would have felt forced and ruined the film for me completely. I was also glad it did not go the route of Lee Daniels' The Butler, which could have been a really good film, had it avoided all political bias and manipulation that I felt completely ruined the film. Fortunately, Selma is not like that. Back to connecting on an emotional level, I just felt that often times the film and the characters and people in it, often felt distant to me and I could not connect, or emphasize with them as much as I wanted to. Yes, I certainly got the feeling that everything that was going on back then with the racial attitudes as well as some of the violence that erupted from it was terrible, but I often felt that Selma, looked at and addressed such issues at a distance and at times I found the film to be not quite delving deep enough into the character study, or the feelings and emotions that were happening to these people. The film certainly is not a bad film and I am still giving it quite a good rating, but it was one of those films that didn't affect me the way I wanted it to. Take 2013's 12 Years a Slave for example. That was an excellent film dealing with slavery and racial attitudes at a different time period, but it still felt just as relevant today and while the film was very brutal and sometimes hard to watch in it's depiction of such brutality and horror, I felt that it hit me hard on an emotional level and really made for an unforgettable movie experience. I could connect to that film and felt more of an impact with it and unfortunately, I could not say the same for Selma. Selma, did not need to resort to brutality to get my attention, but I just wished that it did not seem as stark, cold, or distant with the characters, or subject matter at hand and I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I could have connected to it in the same way as 12 Years a Slave."

        "review_detailed_main": "Selma got nominated for Best Picture. Of course it did. It's a story focussing on an important issue and the main character is an important historical figure who had to overcome lots of obstacles to change the world. If that isn't Oscar bait, what is? Selma didn't look like much. It's just the same type of drama we get every year, which the Academy will love while the public rightly prefer better movies that just get ignored by the Oscars. It only got nominated for 2 awards, and it's admittedly good theme song Glory beat Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie, which was not the right choice. However, with this film prepare for a pleasant surprise. Selma is a very good film. Not a masterpiece, but miles better than The Theory of Everything and Whiplash. This is what every Oscar baiting movie should aim for: a worthy, powerful movie which is also entertaining and focuses on being enjoyable to people who aren't Oscar voters or critics. Selma is something of a triumph, and a film where I genuinely wasn't bored at all throughout.\n\nDavid Oyelowo is excellent as Martin Luther King, and was certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Ava DuVernay's direction is flat, but in a good way. She uses style sparingly (When it's used, it's very effective) and intelligently, and keeps the film grounded in realism, letting the surprisingly strong script and memorable performances tell the story instead of a lot of flashy visuals. Selma is admittedly going the motions through historical events at times and is somewhat predictable, but its characters are believable and its dramatic moments are genuine, rather than forced. Selma is quite a hard hitting movie at times, and it manages to keep you invested throughout. It is still pretty formulaic and you know what's coming much of the time, but rather than selling a message and shoving it down your throat, it's a walk through history which sells the dramatic side of the story well without being overly sentimental. A really good film overall, and far better than I was expecting.\n\n8/10"

This movie was about how Martin Luther king had to go through that whole process of segregation and honestly overall this movie was a 8/10 because they honestly could've done better. I would recommend this movie to all the people that love historical films but overall the movie was pretty good I just wished I would've had more time to be able to watch it properly and actually enjoy the film."

It's kind of unengaging, by-the-numbers, and doesn't draw you in like I hoped.\n\nThe casting isn't quite right. Oyelowo doesn't seem to know how to pull off MLK's restraint and leave the drama for the words and the voice. Doesn't look like him. Doesn't sound like him. Doesn't act like him. Randy Quaid was also a better LBJ.\n\nCostumes were even a miss. Selma's re-imagined 60s mens suits have stupidly-high notches and/or Parisian lapels. Oliver Stone films had far more accurate clothes compared to this Hollywoodized version.\n\nMy favorite aspect about Selma was probably the FBI stuff that, in my opinion, is never out of place to talk about."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a powerful script and an equally powerful lead turn from the next to unknown David Oyelowo, Selma is a fascinating look at a single period of time in the life of revolutionary Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that shines a light on a perhaps oft forgotten moment in history that defined a benchmark moment in the history of the United States.\n\nWhile we wait for the eventual straight up biopic of the beginnings and trials of King Jr, Selma acts as the single most powerful big screen incarnation of the larger than life figure we've yet seen and it's largely due to screenwriter Paul Webb's on point script work, promising female director Ava DuVernay's keen eye and the aforementioned turn by one time supporting actor Oyelowo.\n\nSelma is a powder keg of explosive moments and scenarios yet with the restraint shown by all both behind and in front of the camera, it never overacts into melodrama or cheap emotional payoffs, every bit of emotion here is earnt by hard work and a clear affiliation for what all are a part of in this retelling of the movement. It's a credit to the film also that a film largely based around dialogue exchanges and small character moments feels so big in scope and by the films finale, you know what you've witnessed is quality Oscar worthy material.\n\nIt's hard not to talk about Selma now in the aftermath of it's much publicised Oscar appearance that saw it walk away with a solitary Best Original Song award for the quality John Legend/Common collaboration Glory and in the months that have passed there is still no real clear reason as to why in particular Oyelowo was not at the very least nominated for his turn as King Jr.\n\nCapturing both the man's mannerisms, speech and appearance, Oyelowo transforms into King Jr in an outstanding fashion and displays a soul in his character that many actors can only aspire to when taking on such well known figures of history. Thanks to Oyelowo's turn we feel the heat of the battle King Jr finds himself in and his desire for what a march through the racially rampant backwoods of Alabama would mean to his peoples cause, its powerful stuff, fantastically played out.\n\nSelma is not flashy or perhaps even overly cinematic but it's an important retelling of a moment in America's past that helped transform a nation into what it is today. With a raft of solid acting turns that is powerfully fronted by Oyelowo, DuVernay's film is a worthy dramatization of the events that took place in 1965 and a timely reminder to all about the struggles that many in the land of the free once, not so long ago, had to endure.\n\n4 unlucky clergyman out of 5"

But I really like how at the end of the day they get what they always wanted ,the right to vote. After all the beating and patience they were successful and it was all worth it, I like how they stayed together as a race, best part for me was when the white people joined for a stand, loved when they walked down the bridge well and united.

That's may be only one part of the civil rights protests but still important nevertheless. It does show the prospectives of Lyndon Johnson and the governor of Alabama. They show some conflict with King Jr throughout. Their opinions help bring persistence to the protests. The movie does good at showing persistence and the hardships of the march and how it ultimately led to change in the long term. I would recommend it to you if you want to know more about the civil rights protests or black history. I liked it overall and I feel like it is a good visual representation of the march."

Two other British actors Tim Roth play Governor Wallace and Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B Johnson.\n\nThe film takes a tough and gritty look at the civil rights era. An era that does not deserve to be sugar coated. Some of the people who stood up to be counted were killed including King and its easy to forget some 50 years later that rights were not given but had to be fought for and some paid a heavy price.\n\nThe film makes good use of archive footage and is enthralling although some scenes might had just be a tad overlong with a few cheesy lines. There are a few star cameos and the film has a strong drive that does bot feel too preachy."

Prior to watching this movie, I knew of the Edmund Pettus Bridge massacre and had even seen the black-and-white video of the incident. Watching it before, I had cried, but watching it in this movie, I cried worse because it was in color, I could hear it, and the movie just made the incident feel so much more real. One thing that I liked about the movie was seeing Martin Luther King Jr.'s life as he worked for the civil rights movement. This movie was also educational in the aspect that when the group had a talk about the barriers they faced when voting, they listed and defined all of the barriers. For example, if an African American registered to vote, their address would be posted in the newspaper, which could lead to their debt; they needed to pay the poll taxes of the year and prior years not paid, and African Americans during that time were much more likely to be poorer; and another requirement to vote was a voucher from someone who could vote, which was going to be hard if not impossible because no other African Americans could vote and they couldn't get a voucher from white people. I would recommend this movie to everyone, as this is history, and it must be learned in order to not be repeated again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Martin Luther King Jr's march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights was one of the seminal moments of the Civil Rights Movement. Ava DuVernay's \"Selma\" looks at the events that led to the march. David Oyelowo makes sure to bring to life King's strengths as well as his flaws, and it's a masterful performance.\n\nThe movie drew criticism for its depiction of Lyndon Johnson. In an interview on \"Democracy Now!\", DuVernay said \"Look, this is my movie. It's not a documentary.\" It was one of the sad ironies of Johnson's presidency that as the Selma march happened - which he supported - he started sending US troops into North Vietnam, which eventually soured MLK's relation with him. A criticism that I have is that the movie underplays Coretta's role, depicting her as more of a wife than an activist. Otherwise it does a perfect job looking at the various people involved in the Civil Rights Movement. The footage included at the end adds a sense of realism.\n\nWhen John Legend and Common (who plays James Bevel in the movie) accepted their Oscars for Best Original Song for \"Glory\", Legend noted that the US leads the world in incarceration. To be certain, the song mentions Ferguson. This shows that we have a long way to go in terms of justice, and there have even been retrogressions (such as the Supreme Court's invalidation of the Voting Rights Act). In short, Legend said exactly what needed to get said, as did Patricia Arquette (about the wage gap), Laura Poitras (about surveillance), Graham Moore (about suicide) and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (about immigration).\n\nA 50th anniversary march got held recently, retracing the original. The Obamas participated, as did original participant John Lewis (played by Stephan James in the movie). \"Democracy Now!\" covered the reenactment, and Amy Goodman's interviewees explained the significance of popular movements in the 21st century (\"Glory\" even played during one of the interludes). As the movie shows, justice is not an easy goal, but it is an attainable one. As one of the best movies of the year and of the decade, this is one that should be required in every history class. An absolute masterpiece."
