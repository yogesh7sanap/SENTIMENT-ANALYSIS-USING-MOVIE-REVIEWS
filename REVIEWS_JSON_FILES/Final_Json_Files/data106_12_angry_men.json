Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.\n\nThe tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.\n\nThe audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.\n\nOn top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.\n\nI started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.\n\nHow a film should be made. Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.\n\nIn the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.\n\nAlthough the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a \"stubborn, pig-headed\" conservative versus \"righteous, just\" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.\n\nAlso what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.\n\n12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of \"reasonable doubts\", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.\n\n12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!\n\n10/10"

Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word \"go\". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone."

Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.\n\nBut back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.\n\nNow that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.\n\nThere are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.\n\nThe underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.\n\nThis film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed."

I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!\n\nI must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?\n\nLeaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie.

As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!\n\nIf You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it!

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.\n\nUltimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film."

Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.\n\nI love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,\n\nIt scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.\n\nIf you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.\n\nIt's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.\n\nI won't highlight a single performance, each is as remarkable as the next.\n\n10/10."

        "review_title": "So Simple, So Brilliant",
        "review_detailed_main": "So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.\n\nOne of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.\n\nYet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.\n\nAs sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.\n\n12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved."

We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human."

The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.\n\nThe morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some \"lesser of two evils\" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.\n\nDon't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson? Especially when Hollywood isn't any better than the rest of us."

We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold.

Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.\n\nAnd if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say.

        "review_title": "A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system",
        "review_detailed_main": "... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.\n\nHere you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.\n\nWriting this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not \"set up\" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.\n\nAnd yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated."

As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .\n\nMade for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre \"Courtroom Drama\".\n\nThis Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role .

        "review_detailed_main": "However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.\n\nOne thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.\n\nI will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer."

Cobb. His performance was very impressive. The story of the movie, despite its simplicity but it was wonderful, made me wonder if the person is able to do justice or if he could not understand it, I would advise any cinema lover to watch the movie and my rating 9.6"

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.\n\nOne is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?\n\nThe second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.\n\nIf you want to experience the power of cinema, regardless of your age, gender and cultural upbringing, watch this - you won't regret it."

        "review_detailed_main": "At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.\n\nThis film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of \"doubt,\" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.\n\nThe dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is \"everything,\" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their \"civil responsibility,\" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.\n\nRose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.\n\nIt would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity."

The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. A movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.\n\n12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as \"the boy\", and the witnesses as \"the old man\" and \"the lady across the street\".\n\nIn 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made."

This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.\n\nI do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?\n\nThis movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).\n\nThe storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.\n\nThis movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it."

I really do like the touches like how the camera zooms in gardually over time. With really nice actors with somewhat conving diolog it makes you want to watch till the end.\n\nIt's simply brilliant. But it doesn't have anything to make it exciting or something that I would want to watch again, or being able to watch over and over again. But I do understand that some people really like this movie, hard to explain."

Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development."

A truly American film."

In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself."

The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!\n\nSomehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).\n\nI would recommend Andy Warhol's \"Empire\" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil."

        "review_detailed_main": "Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): \"Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech \u0085 it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need \u0085uh \u0085 the thrills \u0085 and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe \u0085 I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller \u0085 I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): \"I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): \"I told you why this movie is great, it's just \u0085 thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me \u0085 GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): \"First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: \"12 Angry Men\" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): \"What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): \"A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): \"Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well \u0085 I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): \"This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. \"12 Angry Men\" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): \"This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching \"12 Angry Men\" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): \"I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button \u0085 you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): \"No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE\"\n\nJuror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): \"Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know \u0085 you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C \u0085 let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why \"12 Angry Men\" is a GREAT MOVIE\""

Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.\n\nSet in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy."

Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed \" Know what I mean \" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO .

There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.\n\nIf you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.\n\nSidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur \"detective\" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.\n\nJuror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for \"years\" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.\n\nThe Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.\n\nFor instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;\n\nSince the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.\n\nWhat year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.\n\nTrains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.\n\nThen the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.\n\nA juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.\n\nThe entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.\n\nApparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.\n\nThis is a manipulative and poorly written film designed to sow doubt where none exists and to instead have you believe in emotional reasoning over logic."

This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.\n\nWhen I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.\n\n\"Twelve Angry Men\" is a \"trail film\" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.\n\nOne of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre."

Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long. (Joseph Sweeney)."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.\n\nThe film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an \"open and shut case\" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.\n\nOf course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an \"open-and-shut\" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls \"reasonable doubt\", then the verdict changes.\n\nEach character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment \u2013 and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds \u2013 one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways \u2013 for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote \"guilty\" without hesitation.\n\n12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing \u2014 he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.\n\nAs the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.\n\nThe happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is."

Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).\n\nThis film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system.

        "review_detailed_main": "Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a \"guilty\" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone \"Not Guilty\" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.\n\n12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.\n\nThe movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.\n\n12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason."

I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.\n\nThis movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.\n\nAn important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.\n\nGrade: A+"

Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is \"reasonable doubt\" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.\n\nThe movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.\n\nIf this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.\n\nRegards Simon\n\nPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

        "review_detailed_main": "Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.\n\nStarring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.\n\n12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.\n\nObviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.\n\nThe whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.\n\nTo detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.\n\nJuror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.\n\nJuror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.\n\nJuror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.\n\nJuror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.\n\nJuror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.\n\nJuror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.\n\nJuror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.\n\nJuror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.\n\nJuror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.\n\nJuror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.\n\nJuror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.\n\nOverall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.\n\nHighly recommended."

The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. Did they really make the correct decision?"

        "review_detailed_main": "For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.\n\nWhile I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.\n\nThe truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.\n\n6/10."

The film takes place in real time and deals with important issues such as human morality and the fact that our decisions are shaped by our own experiences, prejudices and even selfishness. Each of the 12 men is different, has a unique profession that reflects his personality, and has had his own experiences in life. As a viewer, it's just exciting to see each perspective and how each one tries to argue. If there's one thing the film taught me, it's that our society only works as a whole, and only together can anything be achieved."

For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.\n\nThe characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities. The script is also excellent, a masterpiece in itself.\n\nThis is one of the simplest films ever made, but it's also one of the best.

I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.\n\n5/10"

We see 11 men who change their opinion by the power of strong arguments from Juror #8, and thats exactly what the democratic conversation is about. The idea that conversations and arguments from conflicting sides led to the best possible outcome is a cornerstone of democracy.

Even though it was made in the 1950s you can easily apply this film to today's society as its overall message and values it conveys to the audience, such as prejudice and how everyone will interpret a situation differently. I love the cinematography in this film especially the opening scene as the credits are rolling as it is one take and it just adds to show us the claustrophobia these men must be feeling as they are all cramped together in a small hot room for hours. The performance these actors give are impeccable and layer on top of each others to increase the tension. I easily give it a 10 as I can see no flaws in it, I recommend it to everyone to watch and I highly doubt you will not love it too."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous. The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints. In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split. Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle. Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote. Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty. Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting."

Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case. Honestly the only thing that bugged me about the film was the unoriginal soundtrack/score. It didn't fit very well and sounded clich\u00e9.\n\n9/10 - Amazing. Just watch it."

        "review_title": "Legal philosophiser to appeal to any intelligent person",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.\n\nWhich is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one.\n\nI have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system.\n\nThe moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.\n\nOne of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.\n\nSolon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet.\n\nIn any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.\n\nI would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree.\n\nBut the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury.\n\nOne of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. I guess for all its faults the Anglo-Saxon version of justice is the better."

        "review_title": "*A Masterclass in Ethical Dilemma and Human Nature*",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"12 Angry Men,\" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless courtroom drama that transcends its genre to explore profound themes of justice, prejudice, and the moral responsibilities of a jury. Set almost entirely within a single room, the film unfolds as twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. What begins as a seemingly straightforward case quickly evolves into a gripping exploration of bias, doubt, and human integrity.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its exceptional writing and directing. Reginald Rose's script masterfully navigates the intense dynamics within the jury, illuminating how personal experiences, emotions, and prejudices can cloud judgment. Each juror is richly characterized, with distinct personalities and backgrounds that shape their perspectives on the case.\n\nHenry Fonda, who plays Juror #8, stands out as the lone voice advocating for reasonable doubt. His performance is both poignant and resolute, embodying the ideal of justice through his unwavering commitment to truth. Fonda's character serves as a moral compass throughout the film, challenging the other jurors to confront their biases and reconsider the evidence presented.\n\nThe ensemble cast features remarkable performances from actors like Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and Jack Klugman, each bringing depth to their characters. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the claustrophobic setting of the jury room creates an atmosphere of palpable tension, expertly captured by Lumet's direction. The film's cinematography, with its clever use of close-ups and varying angles, enhances the emotional stakes and keeps viewers engrossed.\n\n\"12 Angry Men\" not only serves as a gripping narrative but also acts as a profound social commentary. The film highlights the fragility of the justice system and the importance of civic duty. It poses critical questions regarding the nature of guilt and innocence, the impact of socio-economic backgrounds, and the significance of empathy in decision-making.\n\nDespite being over six decades old, \"12 Angry Men\" remains remarkably relevant, as the issues it tackles-prejudice, accountability, and the morality of judgment-continue to resonate in contemporary society. It invites audiences to engage in introspection while examining their own biases and the importance of standing up for what is right.\n\n\"12 Angry Men\" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines brilliant writing, stellar performances, and a compelling narrative to create a thought-provoking experience. Its exploration of justice and human nature is as relevant today as it was at its release, making it a must-see film for anyone interested in the complexities of morality and the ethical dilemmas faced within the justice system.\n\nBest courtroom drama film ever made 10/10."

The cast does a great job with the portrayal of the various jurors and the complex reasons they lean to one verdict or the other presenting us with twelve massively different characters each with his own flaws and his own views of morality and human nature. An amazing feat of cinema rightfully considered on of the crown jewels of Old Hollywood."

The actors, each with their various characters, were excellent and the acting superb.....One of my most favourite films of which I never get tired of watching....if you have not seen it, watch and you will be impressed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see. Well before you see the remake. Just for some laughs."

The only reason this deserves at least some rating is because it is good for such old times for which I have less expectations, because it shows something serious like how a lies can affect somebody's life and destiny, and because it teaches us some law terms. But the actors, location, events are so boring, nothing to see. Talk dominates, and more like political ones. Maybe good only for law lovers, workers, students who love it or learn about it or it is their career."

This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience. This is one picture that deserves it's place in the books of cinema history and in my opinion, a great 1957 masterpiece."

To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head. That being said, it is enjoyable for the acting and a must see for those who have missed it so far."

Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so \"open and shut\".\n\nHere, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.\n\nMy criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.\n\nFonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said \"It's possible\" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.\n\nTheir use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!"

It could have been shot in any decade.\n\n* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography\n\n... and that's about it.\n\nBut, just like the jurors in \"12AM\", we must look beyond the 'facts'.\n\n* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.\n\n* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the \"Kaiser Sauze\" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that \"mind blowing\" at all.\n\n* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to \"Song of the South\". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics\".\n\nIn conclusion, your honor, I think we need a recount here.\n\n5 sounds perfect: did i like it? Did I not? You'll never know."

If you like seeing how people logically deconstruct a case in order to prove/disprove the defendants guilt this is the right movie for you. At first the whole case appears to be pretty \"black and white\" but as the jury (the 12 men) discusses details about the night of the murder new conclusions are being drawn. Conclusions that ultimately make them question their original standpoint. \"Is the boy really guilty?\" Watch the movie and find out."

Alongside being a masterfully crafted film, the most important aspect was how this film was way ahead for its time being released in 1957.\n\nIt follows the tension between 12 jurors locked in a room who must arrive at a unanimous decision to convict an 18 year old who is accused of murdering his own father that at the first glance looks like an open and shut case. However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas. The screenplay is sharp and the tension between the characters keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. What results is a rare courtroom drama that takes outside of the court but creates more impact than a lot of new age courtroom films."

The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here."

        "review_detailed_main": "A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.\n\nSet of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting \"the simpleness\" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.\n\nThis is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life. This film tells us that must be a logical explanation for everything, despite all of the prejudice that appears in the whole case. The script success to make us think whether the boy is guilty or not and makes the intensity of the movie felt so real."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.\n\nI'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.\n\nIt's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.\n\nThere is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.\n\nThere was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.\n\nI have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.\n\nIn summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was."

The characters really grab you, and you hang on every word.

He dismisses the old man's account and makes assumptions about the female witness's eyesight all based on personal experiments and conjecture, not verified evidence.\n\nJuror 8's tactics and amateur detective work, created bias on the jury with emotional appeals rather than sticking to the trial facts, and undermining the judicial process. Thank goodness this movie is a fictional, account using dramatic license, and should not be taken as a real case study."

Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know. But this film demonstrates that the current system (bear in mind this was released in 1957) is anything but foolproof. A thought provoking yet entertaining 8 out of ten"

To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things."

        "review_detailed_main": "I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la \"You volunteer\" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair).\n\nIt is only when one says \"I am not too sure\" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.\n\nOn the lighter side. this movie is strangely devoid of feminine presence. In the whole movie, leave aside jurors, there are not a single member of the fair gender credited or un-credited. In fact only two women ever get referred to, first being one of the star witnesses and the other one of the juror's wife."

People were, are and will always be stubborn and narrow-minded because they are a majority and one can only guess what will happen when that changes.\n\n1957's \"12 angry men\" is a splendid courtroom drama which was a directorial debut for Sidney Lumet and starred an ensemble cast of great actors - Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and many others. The film is set almost entirely in one room where the jury must decide whether a man on trial for murder is guilty and it showcases all there is to love about the art of cinema: tensions, eloquent and well-thought out dialogues, outstanding performances, masterful camera work and most of all - the presence effect.\n\nTogether with the jurors we examine every piece of evidence, every statement, every witness so that not only they can come to the unanimous conclusion but also to put ourselves in the shoes of a person convicted and admit that there is a reasonable doubt and to state so in our final judgment, and it's no easy task. It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.\n\nThis motion picture tells us not to rush to conclusions despite how convinced we are of our rightness because there's always more than meets the eye and truly good things always take time."

This is 12 powerhouse performances, ensuring that there isn't a moment's lull despite being filmed almost exclusively in one claustrophobic deliberation room.

Great dialogue that gives you an insight into these characters without showing you any of their backstory, fun back and forth talk between characters. You feel enclosed in the room the characters are in since the majority of the movie takes place in one small room, but it completely works, this movie is essentially perfect, high recommend."

It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients. I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted. Also, some of the \"evidence\" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best. It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.\n\nI might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk. The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given \"just one more shot at 'rehab'.\" The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him. This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.\n\nRating: 2/10"

This movie should be even shown in film schools as a textbook example of how to make a movie without special effects but only with a good script and talented actors. That's it: a movie shot in black and white and for almost all the time the film is set in a small room.\n\nThe direction (by Sidney Lumet in his debut) is top-notch and the actors' performances are all career-bests. Henry Fonda has never given a better performance than the one he gives in this movie, and all the other actors - Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Robert Webber, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler for naming a few - who were still unknown at the time, are great here and give great support to Fonda. All in all, an exceptional movie in all ways."

How each person sees the world from their own unique viewpoint. We will all recognize ourselves in one character or another and we see people we know portrayed on screen.\n\nNow I did read a review about the high morality and feel-good vibe., but that is not really the essence of it. We will have to admit that, even though we want, we are unlikely that one person willing to stand up against everyone else. Probably most of us are like the majority of the group. Only willing to speak when we feel we have been granted safety by someone else willing to stand up against the loud people that overwhelm us. That makes the story feel real and engaging. It shows how quick people get drawn into the argumentation of those who simply are loud and confident. Most people are willing to listen provided they are granted the chance to be heard themselves. You have to dive deep and give them a chance to draw their own conclusions, within their own viewpoint. Forcing your argument only lasts as long as the receiver allows it. There is much to learn from this story, even after almost 70 years."

While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.\n\nThe ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an \"actor's director\" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.\n\nPractically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey."

This movie proves, that if you have a great cast and a good written story, you don't need all that fancy stuff that's on movies nowadays. Simplicity sometimes is the key. I was involved and felt the high energy between these men. A must watch, if you ask me."

Well that's what my perception was for years and was determined not to bother regardless of the strength of the reviews both from critics and fans.\n\nBut films that are mad as among the best have good reason for their reputations (usually). Like Citizen Kane I had to eat humble pie after watching this one. Even though I had already read how the film ended the journey was never less than fascinating and intense with some interesting points raised about class privileges and prejudices against people one might look down on based on their type. All the characters were fully fleshed and there were a lot of shades of grey to work through.\n\nI love modern action extravaganzas such as The Avengers as much as the next guy but the beauty of film means that there is a full spectrum of diverse stories to be appreciated. I think if I had a bet with anyone who said this film \"sounds boring\" I'd make a profit if people gave the honest truth after watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.\n\nThe film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.\n\nThe movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema."

The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.\n\nThe story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.\n\nYet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives.

It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets.

Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.\n\nThe jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.\n\nIt's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.\n\n12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.\n\n12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.\n\nBy the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!\n\nFor a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.\n\nI now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much. This is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. It's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. This is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!"

        "review_title": "A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room",
        "review_detailed_main": "As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.\n\n12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.\n\n12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.\n\nFurthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.\n\nDue to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.\n\nAs one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made."

It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it. It is a trip of understanding, of doubting about everything and a lesson about the truth that usually is not something that can be seen at a first look. A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position.\n\nIf you like thrillers, justice films and you like interesting dialogues, this is your film. However, it is going to ask you for your concentration and tenacity."

The are maybe a couple dozen movies I can say that about.\n\nTo be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts \"every single\" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says \"You said we could throw out all the other evidence\" Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.\n\nA fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious. Sometimes to a fault."

Whats so breathtaking or even attention-drawing about this storyline? Really nothing.\n\nBut as they talk, we are amazed to see how people could take different views over a same thing. Its also amazing to see, as a movie, the strength relies on the story and how it is told and not on characters,photography etc! The acting is just so cool and everybody gets a good share.\n\nAlmost ninety percent of the movie happens inside a room where these dozen men do nothing but talk. Perfect drama-thriller with no nuisance characters or scenes."

All story goes on in one room and the thing is almost everything seems as mystery, but real. The case which our jury have to decide about, jurors, their actions and judgement is so well considered. One of the most interesting parts of the film is that no name mentioned until the very end.\n\nAlso it is very hard to shot the whole film only in one place, one room. So crew had done great work. A piece of art. So I think it is the best film to start old and gold films."

Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda."

Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance. Sidney Lumet, does an excellent job of subtle direction, delving into the very depths of human existence and civilization, keeping the highest entertainment value, succeeding where all the Bergmans and Tarkovskis have failed miserably. A triumph of American cinema, a movie that everyone must see before they die."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.\n\nIt is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted \"Guilty\". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).\n\nIn light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask \"WHY?\", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the \"Guilty\" side, a range of interests was noticed \u2013 where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to \"get out of here\", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others.\n\nAt the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships."

I was watching with a group of friends which included some teens, and adults in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. We were all captivated. Maybe the first five minutes I heard a few comments about boring black and white movies but that went away as soon as the initial vote was taken in the jury room. Each actor does a superb job conveying who his character is. Of course Henry Fonda's character stands out because, like the cheese, he stands alone. ;) Others may surprise you. There is no comic relief in this movie. It is hard core."

        "review_detailed_main": "I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the \"reasonable doubt\" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.\n\nIn essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?\n\nOne aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.\n\nStill, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor. There was enormously stiff competition in that 1957 category, and all the nominees were truly winners."

        "review_title": "Reasonable Doubt...",
        "review_detailed_main": "The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.\n\nIt is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.\n\nThe acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).\n\nAnother aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.\n\nThe screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.\n\nI can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.\n\n4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so. Strongly recommended."

No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.\n\nJuror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole \"Not Guilty\" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.\n\nAward winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.\n\nA story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.\n\nUltimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.\n\n10/10"

The film flows perfectly and makes you feel as if you are there, like you are Juror #13 trying to come up with arguments to convince everyone else. One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets. It makes you realize how easily can people, who have nothing to win or lose, go over important details when there's a lot at stake. A true classic."

I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white. With this movie being so old, the audio and sound system had very poor quality. I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling. This review shows what I enjoyed about the film, what I found interesting and lastly what I disliked about the film and written play 'Twelve Angry Men'."

I don't understand the appeal of this movie at all. All it is revolves around twelve angry men yelling at each other for the entire movie, in one room. Sure, it tells the story (and I'm seriously stretching the term for this particular live action reel) of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. This works well as a play and I like the acting and dialogue in this, but does not translate well onto movie at all. That's what Parliament Question Time TV show is there for. This movie is so boring, forgettable and torturous that this is the third time I literally fell asleep a half hour in besides Transformers: Age of Extinction and the new version of Independence Day. Because movies are meant to entertain people, even Tommy Wisseau's The Room and the animated Titanic movies are watchable compared to this torture device. This movie is generally studied in English (lucky I never had to do that, even though there was no way I could escape seeing this movie), and I feel for the high school students who have to watch this for study, and fans of this movie who would throw their money at everything they see."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.\n\nThe thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.\n\nI also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.\n\nFor a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.\n\n12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating. I loved that as soon as it started raining the fan started working. And I loved that it stopped raining as soon as they left the court building. To put it simply, I loved everything about this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's absolutely amazing how entertaining it is to witness twelve men in a single room, arguing and specifying for 90 minutes straight. Do not judge this movie by it's age, because it is an unforgettable and truthful black-and-white classic that's always worth checking into.\n\nMartin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are phenomenal in the film. To call the cast excellent is quite common, but 12 Angry Men's cast manage to pull off a stunning jury system and keep us all engaged and impressed. So don't start the film with extremely low hopes. The first 10 minutes is just settling you into the story and once the conversation, arguing and yelling starts, it'll latch your attention and hold you until the end. It's pretty simple, but is a fast masterpiece to be classed as one of history's best films.\n\nAlthough it's appropriate and clean from adult elements, it's honestly worth having the younger children wait until they're older kids. Unless your young kids are genuinely interested, save this black-and-white masterpiece as a must-watch for when they're older. Young children will likely find the film boring and old, but older kids may have more fascination.\n\n12 Angry Men is a perfect example of just needing a simple script, a terrific crew, and a decent setting. Don't focus on how old it is and definitely go and see it if you have not watched it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a \"reasonable doubt\" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.\n\nSlowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.\n\nFor this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.\n\nSidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Title: \"12 Angry Men: A Timeless Masterpiece\"In an age where the allure of modern blockbusters often overshadows the cinematic treasures of the past, Sidney Lumet's \"12 Angry Men\" stands as a testament to the enduring power of classic cinema. Released in 1957, this timeless masterpiece continues to captivate audiences with its gripping narrative and timeless themes. At first glance, the premise may seem simple: twelve jurors are tasked with deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder. But as the deliberations unfold within the confines of a claustrophobic jury room, the film delves deep into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. What sets \"12 Angry Men\" apart is its masterful storytelling and impeccable craftsmanship. Shot almost entirely within the confines of a single room, the film relies on dialogue and character development to drive the narrative forward. Each juror brings their own biases and preconceptions to the table, leading to heated debates and intense confrontations that lay bare the flaws and foibles of the human condition. As the tension mounts and the stakes grow higher, the true brilliance of \"12 Angry Men\" shines through. Through the lens of the jury room, the film holds a mirror up to society, forcing viewers to confront their own prejudices and assumptions. In doing so, it transcends the confines of its era, offering timeless insights into the nature of justice and the power of collective action. But perhaps the greatest strength of \"12 Angry Men\" lies in its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. Despite being over six decades old, the film remains as relevant today as it was upon its release. Its exploration of themes such as systemic bias and the importance of due process continues to strike a chord in an age marked by social and political turmoil. Moreover, the performances of the cast elevate \"12 Angry Men\" to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Led by Henry Fonda as Juror 8, the ensemble cast delivers performances that are as nuanced as they are compelling. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their role, breathing life into characters that transcend the confines of the screen. As the credits roll and the final verdict is reached, \"12 Angry Men\" leaves an indelible impression on the viewer. It is a film that challenges conventions and defies expectations, reminding us of the power of cinema to provoke thought and inspire change. In a world inundated with flashy special effects and CGI-laden spectacles, \"12 Angry Men\" serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of storytelling in its purest form. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice - values that are as relevant today as they were in 1957. In conclusion, \"12 Angry Men\" is not just a movie; it is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire audiences with its powerful message and masterful execution. If you have yet to experience the magic of this cinematic gem, I urge you to do so without delay."

        "review_detailed_main": "This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.\n\nMost of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.\n\nThis drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.\n\nThe film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.\n\nJuror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.\n\nAs the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.\n\nThe movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.\n\n'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.\n\n12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.\n\nThe movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lee J. Cobb singlehandedly could have ruinsed this film with his yelling and overacting and supremely annoying nature. Ed Begley doesn't help out much either with an equally over the top redundant presence. All the other performances are actually quite good although Jack Warden tends to get on the nerves occasionally as well. The story is original and excellent, and despite some flimsy arguments used to acquit the kid, the movie is compelling in parts. Actually it's pretty obvious they let a guilty go free because they looked through rose colored glasses at the facts but that's not the issue because stuff like that happens every day in our system. The exchanges between the jurors were ridiculous at times and believable at others. Inconsistent yet enjoyable. The 9 rating is absurd, especially since it really doesn't hold up over the years as good as some others of the era. I'd put it at a 7 but am gonna rate a 5 to counterbalance the inflated rating here."

Of whom what more can say other than they're all excellent.\n\nThe film and play its adapted from is a masterful work in writing and why it is what it is. However, don't let the impressive script and performances prevent you from noticing what a fine job Sydney Lumet did.\n\nIt's nice to see this film receiving the recognition it deserves from so many, here it's rated #5 (a bit high for my taste), and those doubtful of how intresting a dozen guys yelling at each other can be, will probably be in for a surprise."

They traveled me to '50 America and i learn about their ordinary lifestyle. I learn to not judge everyone from the cover and give a try to learn from them atleast something. I suggest evereyone to see this movie atleast one time at his life. I wish one of our days one director to create a masterpice like this again and i am hopefull about it. At the end i want to tell once again that this movie was extrodinary and a man can create such a good movie with using only one room if he really want it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This marvelous story from the late 50s, is about a juror(Henry Fonda) who along with 11 other jurors, try to come up with a reasonable verdict for a murder trial. He believes that the accused in this case is innocent and in the beginning, he is the only person who has this particular opinion. Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was this: Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.\n\nThus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas."
