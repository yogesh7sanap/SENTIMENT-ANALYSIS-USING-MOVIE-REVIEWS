Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.\n\nAs for the plot, I enjoyed the way the Amazonian women's back story was told, as well as Diana's (Wonder Woman). The visuals and photography are incredible! This is a visual spectacle. I loved the humorist dialogue, which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick. Gil Gadot is just fabulous.\n\nThis superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion. There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of. The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies, and that's what I honestly loved about the film."

I really like the period in which the action of the film takes place, during a real war is not something usual for a movie with superheroes. The actors are good, so is the action, maybe act 3 is a bit weak, but it works."

She is unconcerned with her looks and trying to impress others, and way more concerned with saving the world as she was meant to do. This film really showed the process of her becoming a true heroine! She loves, she protects, she saves. Wonder Woman is a great character and I think she was cast beautifully! She looks \"other-worldly\" beautiful and fit the part so well. The film was written well to show her innocence of the \"real\" world, her joy of seeing it and it's people for the first time, and her passion for saving us all!\n\nTeam Wonder Woman Forever!\n\nThis is a film I could watch over and over. :D"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a pretty good movie, as you probably have already heard if you follow the reviews. I was a bit worried. DC has shown a.... shall we call it tendency? -- to darken every comic book character, to the point where Suicide Squad had everyone with a sad backstory. It made me miss the cheery disposition of Caesar Romero's Joker. Yes, I get it that you're a sociopath. Can't you enjoy it?\n\nWonder Woman avoids that. In the midst of the horrors of the Great War, there are real jokes, and moments of kindness and great deeds inspired by naive morality.\n\nVisually, the movie combines the splash panels and covers of the Dark Horse era of DC, with some canny casting choices among the secondary characters. Lucy Davis looks like Etta Candy from the late WWII comics era; Ewen Bremner looks like Charlie from the same era; both push the comic book look to the edge, without falling over.\n\nMiss Gadot turns out to be a very capable screen performer, with dark, expressive eyes. Chris Pine restrains himself as her leading man. If the screenplay sometimes falls into the current hackneyed tropes, it plays nimbly with others, like Chekhov's Gun. If the final battle is another round of Rock-Em-Sock-Em Robots, the earlier battle scene, fought in righteous anger, made me think about the Angel of Mons."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review By Kamal K\n\nThis film is everything you want in a superhero movie. This is the Wonder Woman movie we've been waiting for.\n\nOne of the first superheroes ever created in comics and the very first female superhero, Wonder Woman is among the most recognizable superheroes in history.\n\nIt is outrageously bold and confident, insanely fun and thrilling, powerfully dramatic and delightfully amusing, all rolled into one epic superhero outing. It sports some of the greatest action scenes and visuals of any superhero movie to date, many of which have been saved from the marketing in order to serve as delicious surprises when you finally see the movie. The cast are magnificent, especially Gal Gadot's lead turn as the world's first female superhero. And director Patty Jenkins has instantly proven herself one of the genre's finest filmmakers.\n\nGal Gadot's casting was like a miracle for the studio, as her performance is instantly the stuff of legends. Gadot does a magnificent job with this complex mixture of emotions and motivations in Diana, as well as the many grand fight and action sequences, I can't imagine anyone else in the role.she is Wonder Woman now, through and through. Chris Pine actually delivers his second-best career performance here.\n\nThe action sequences in Wonder Woman set a new standard for the genre. It has excellent hand-to-hand superhero combat on par with Batman's warehouse scene in Batman v Superman or Cap's fights against Batroc and Bucky in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But it also has epic war scenes, fantastic sword-and-sandal battles (the Amazon battle on the beach is an instant classic), and big-scale superhero action set pieces bringing down buildings and demonstrating the full scale of superheroism and super-villainy.\n\nI loved Matthew Jensen's cinematography in Wonder Woman, and how it established different visual tones and styles for different settings and different acts in the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "As someone who does enjoy superhero films when done right, there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointing ones. Enjoyed the character of Wonder Woman as a kid, and always felt compared to other superhero characters that she deserved her own film.\n\nWhich she gets in this 2017 effort directed by Patty Jenkins. Is 'Wonder Woman' as good as the hype and a wonder of a film? Not to me, there are a few things that stop it from being even better. Does it deserve the negativity in a lot of the comments here? While it is easy to see why people would be disappointed, as it could have been better, my answer would be no and that some of the hate is over the top.\n\nThere are problems here in 'Wonder Woman'. Part of it is to do with pacing, the film starts a little dull in places and later on as more happens in the story it felt rushed and at times it affects the storytelling which has its muddled moments.\n\nThe ending is clich\u00e9d and anti-climactic and some of the characters feel underdeveloped, especially the underused and underwritten villain.\n\nHowever, 'Wonder Woman' is mostly an exceptionally made film, apart from instances of frenetic editing, with a lot of atmosphere in the production design and lighting, audacious photography and special effects that are super slick. The music has a haunting sense of mood and rousing energy, and Jenkins directs with an understanding of the titular character and accommodating the performing of Gal Gadot.\n\nScript has some witty humour, heartfelt sentiment and also takes itself seriously without making the mistake of previous BC Extended Universe (of which 'Wonder Woman' is by far the best, actually being a good film) of being too grim and dark. The action is stirring and often spectacular in spectacle.\n\n'Wonder Woman's' story has its faults but most of it is heartfelt and thrilling. It does the character of Wonder Woman justice with a genuinely interesting back-story that makes her a compellingly real and easy-to-relate-to character who you admire for all her strengths and flaws.\n\nGadot is superbly cast as Wonder Woman, creating a character that really stands out among the rest of the superhero line in terms of gender and her ideals. Chris Pine is amusing, commanding and likable with great chemistry with Gadot, while Danny Houston clearly enjoys himself as the villain. The rest of the cast do very solidly.\n\nOverall, not a wonder but a long way from a blunder. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman was much better than anything else DC has released in a very long time, and it was a pretty great film, but was it as amazing as everyone say it was or are we all a bit bias due to the hype surrounding the film? In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the \"main\" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month."

But a standalone movie? This was the ultimate test and though I think she did well I believe her proper debut failed on a lot of fronts.\n\nA tweeked version of her origin story Wonder Woman is full of famous faces and fantastic choices for the most part, it had a tsunami of funding and a competent lead. So what went wrong?\n\nThe same as Batman vs Superman in my opinion, the DC Universe is simply not getting off to a good start. Flashy, cheesy and with some awful awful dialogue Wonder Woman failed to impress.\n\nI'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying for every good scene there are 5 average ones and a couple of stinkers.\n\nWhat took me back was the CGI, this is a AAA movie so why are there so many crappy looking shots? Truly unforgivable considering the budget, the script is weak, the story is predictable and the whole thing is somehow cheesier than the original television series (And that's saying something).\n\nI went in expecting gold but came out with mildly tarnished bronze at best, I wanted to like this I really did but am so unimpressed I'm just going to assume Justice League will be seven shades of abyssmal.\n\nThe Good:\n\nGreat score\n\nWell cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSome choreography is off\n\nSome bizzarely bad cgi\n\nVery different from the original story\n\nBarely connects to the universe they are trying to create\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nEach year judging by ratings people are easier and easier to please\n\nI always consider Tom Cruise unconvincing in action scenes, he looks outstanding compared to David Thewlis\n\nDC is not going to be catching up to Marvel, ever. This confirms it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Coming back to this in 2022 there are some easy themes that stand up to the passage of time. Since it's sequel has been and gone much of the hope has seeped away for as the DCU has been under minded by WB it has not been able to shape anything with consistency.\n\nWith Gal Gadot as WW the star shines very bright and Chris Pine and all other supporting cast are well drawn but plots are a little underdeveloped and when the big bad is the god of war, Aries - the scale seemed small on the screen whilst the jeopardy on screen, whilst it comes to pass, feels more of a foot note than a truly mortal affair.\n\nDC have overpowered heroes like Superman but Steve Trevor deserves more emotional impact on screen given his choices and the villains are given too little attention. The red herring villain didn't work well enough and a more 3D female villain would have sufficed with Aries as her muse and empowered. Perhaps if Jenkins had shown the adversarial nature of women here, then ww84 would've had not misfired on so many levels.\n\nSnyder clearly had a game plan that was untrusted. So when I recall this film and recognise there are some great stand out scenes that come to mind. By the end credits we have a self sufficient film that could've been more but is not wholly disappointing like the follow up."

Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.\n\nIn other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre.\n\nI loved this movie.\n\n8/10"

This movie is directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and stars Gal Gadot (Death on the Nile), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Robin Wright (Forest Gump) and Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting). The storyline for this is very well done and does a great job of introducing Wonder Woman as a character. I loved the depiction of the Amazonians and how it established the character from the foundation up. The special effects and action scenes are very well done as is the depiction of the time period and the challenges and perception of women. The villain was the only let down and I didn't love the final fight sequence, but 80% of this movie is a 10/10. I would score this a solid 8/10 and strongly recommend seeing this.

That being said the film is not perfect, Diana and Steve are really the only characters with any sort of character development, and even that feels rushed.

        "review_title": "Wander Over To Wonder!",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?\n\nLIKES\n\n1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!\n\n2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.\n\n3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything.\n\n4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well.\n\n5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me.\n\n6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, \"Dang, it's already been 90 minutes.\" Not something I often say.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\n1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by.\n\n2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some \"tracking\" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal.\n\n3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me.\n\n4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes.\n\n5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nWonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder woman starts with showing where wonder woman (aka Diana Prince) came from: the amazons who live on the island Themyscira. The island is somewhere near Greece but hidden from view by a strange fog for normal people. We follow how Diana grows up to become one of the greatest amazon to have ever lived. On the day of her final training something strange happens: a German plane from the first world war breaks through the fog surrounding Themyscira and crashes into the sea. Diana rescues the man (Steve, a British spy played by Chris Pine) inside the plane, but he is pursued by German soldiers who also break through the fog. The Germans are quickly defeated by the mighty amazon warriors and learn from Steve that the whole world is currently fighting a great war. Diana thinks it must be the work of Ares, the god of war and that it is time to wield the god killer sword to put an end to Ares once and for all. Together with Steve and his friends she leaves the island of Themyscira to go to horrific front of the first world war, trying to find and defeat Aris.\n\nI went into this movie a bit skeptical, because I wasn't impressed by Batman VS Superman where (the modern version) Wonder Woman made her entrance. But the character is interesting so I was curious how her origin story panned out. The start of the movie was a bit to serious/high fantasy for me but once Chris Pine enters the picture, it get's a lot lighter in tone and I started to like it a lot more. I really like Pine in The scenes where Diana enters London and get's in contact with 1910's civilization are hilarious and Gal Gadot does a fine job playing someone who's from a different world. I also liked the supporting cast who play Steve's friends, lot's of humor in those scenes.\n\nThe action scenes where mostly very well done. Cool slow motion effects and very good stunt work. My only gripe was that the CGI doubles of wonder woman and her opponents where a bit to obvious in a few scenes. And like in many comic book movies, this movie also suffered from a bad guy that was not impressive at all. The final confrontation was a bit to predictable and way to much CGI effects for my taste. But there was an emotional touch in the ending which was well done and unexpected.\n\nWonder woman is an enjoyable action movie with great action scenes and some good laughs. Recommended if your in for an entertaining action movie with some fantasy elements."

With Wonder Woman able to withstand any onslaught, the film is totally lacking in excitement.\n\nHaving watched a handful of other DCU movies, including the recent over-rated effort that was Shazam!, I'm still waiting to be impressed. Casting David Thewlis as the villain definitely isn't the way to go...\n\n4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb - Mindless generic popcorn superhero nonsense. Not totally unwatchable (Gadot being easy on the eye), but definitely unexceptional."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reading the reviews here. Either they are bowing down to the movie or just hating blindly. Not sure how many have actually seen it. Very good movie after all the disappointment from the past DCEU movies.\n\nSeeing all the trailers and featurettes, very little was left for imagination, but those didn't disappoint. The movie is about the journey of a demigod from Themyscira, where it's all bright and shiny to the real world, which is torn by war, greed, hatred and darkness. Diana walks in as the light.\n\nGetting her influence from Donner, Patty Jenkins got it right. What it means to be a hero, what does it mean to inspire..and the quest for the Amazon beauty to become the light in the darkness. Strength, sorrow, motivation, humanity, hope and loss forges the path to be the ultimate hero she's meant to be.\n\nGal Gadot surprised me. Most of her past performances were, well, sub par. Finally she's in the spotlight. She did pretty well. Although she has a long way to go, everyone begins somewhere. This movie is for her. Kudos for her strong performance, specially the fight sequences.\n\nWe all deserved this movie. While not a masterpiece, but good enough to be the stepping stone for women empowerment, and a proper story for a demigod and one of the most popular female superhero who can go toe to toe with the all powerful Superman. I just can't wait to see her interactions and chemistry with the big blue, and how they co ordinate, being the two gods that they are. DCEU is back on track.\n\nApart from her, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor shined, and he is straight from the comic book pages. He's a good actor, not surprising.\n\nDespite all the positives, it has it's flaws. Some scenes were too long and unnecessarily dragged. Diana's chemistry with Steve could have been better. Dr Poison was equivalent to Kaecilius' henchmen..wasted.\n\nA good ending satisfies all, after the emotional turbulence audiences go through. This movie did justice to that.\n\nThat being said, Man of Steel still remains the favorite DCEU movie for me. But perhaps that's because I'm biased to Supes.\n\n7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Wonder Woman\" ends on a note of self sacrifice that hits deep and outdoes many other similar superhero movies within the last eight or so years which often rest on noble cliche.\n\n\"Wonder Woman\" does too, but I think it hits a nerve where others don't quite. The development is unexpected and takes you for a turn after the villain is found but the philosophical real villain remains. Here \"Wonder Woman\" shines in its thoughtfulness about the hero/villain construct, and gives the intellect something to gnaw on.\n\nHowever the last arc, though magnificent, doesn't quite excuse the vague mythology getting to that point or some disturbing questions such as why Wonder Woman is so quick to be an American hero rather than the hero of humanity she claims to be. As well as some thin areas such as exactly how invincible is Diana? Can bullets kill her? And then other loose ends such as the ragtag team Chris Pine's character puts together-were they really necessary, and did their stories conclude in a satisfying way?\n\nAnd then some casting choices were a bit unusual. Like for Ares. You'll see what I mean.\n\nFor me Gal Gadot does a fine job, but perhaps doesn't have a big range. But she does give her all and embodies the character in her determination, innocence and her grappling with the question of whether to be humanity's hero. And of course her physical attributes! I think acting across the emotive Chris Pine certainly helped bring out her best acting moments.\n\nAll in all a much deeper film than expected, but not without its parts which we all just look past."

This movie deserves all the praise I've been listening to."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally we get a half-decent movie from the DCEU. Compared to the last installments, it's probably the best. But that's not saying much.\n\nTo this movies credit, I gotta say that it has an honest heart. it's the first time that they actually feel honest about a movie. This one is not trying to elevate Wonder Woman to something unrealistic (considering the character that she is), it's very grounded, and overall a very enjoyable dumb summer movie.\n\nHaving said that. It's not perfect. Like I said. It's dumb, but with a heart. The acting is OK for the most part (even though Robin Wright's helmet thing looked embarrassing and was hard to take her performance seriously just for that). Gal Gadot was OK, Chris Pine was OK. The rest of the cast was kind of there. The plot was a lazy combination of Thor and the first Captain America movie. Pretty dull in my opinion. The way the plot moves is very dumb and most of the conflict is avoidable if some characters would just listen, otherwise they look very stupid, even if the outcome was the same, giving them some common sense would have given them some substance. It just didn't happen, but I give that to the lazy writing. The villain was uninspiring, not a big surprise for this kind of movie, so you know that it comes with lazy CG and motivation. He just serves to have a super claustrophobic final battle filled with explosions and stuff. One kind of head scratching moment for me was that Wonder Woman was trying to avoid the greatest and most violent conflict ever: WWI. So the stakes seem stupid when you know that WWII was way worse and knocking on the door. We are obviously not going to see her react to that. With a big dope face realizing that the war she thought was the worse was pretty much the beginning.\n\nOh, and the music. I hate it for the most part. I hate her theme. It's way too manipulating and forced.\n\nThe things that I would have liked this movie to be are way to many to be listed here. So I leave it at: it was OK, not great, kind of good, very stupid and face-palming. but nothing as sinful as Suicide Squad. And to it's credit it's the first time a DCEU movie actually makes more or less sense.\n\nAnd to address those who believe that there is a big presence of quality on the film. No, there is not. It's just the first movie from the DCEU that is not complete S H I T. That doesn't make it good."

        "review_detailed_main": "A WWI battlefield, shrouded in gun smoke and war remains, is flanked by trenches of soldiers who've accepted their fate of spending the rest of their short lives in this hell. On one end, a powerful but na\u00efve woman slowly emerges, armed with a shield, a sword and a bundle of conviction to put an end to all of it. In this one sure-to-be iconic moment, the world is (re-)introduced to its new favorite superhero. Wonder Woman, an unabashed woman-empowerment film, uses its pre-established muscle for good: to give us a blockbuster full of true excitement, true humor and true heart. Being a wartime-superhero film, we expect a certain quality of action, and this delivers; the beach attack on the island full of Amazon women is a slow-motion blast of flying and fighting. But what really soars is the script, filled with dialogue that surprisingly pops (\"We can't fix the war, but we can try to get to the men who can.\" \"I AM the men who can!\"). Elements of fish-out-of-water, believable romance and confident humor are more than consistent enough to the small moments of predictability, corn and bad visual effects. I can't help but imagine: what if this was our introduction to the Justice League universe? Instead of the faux-complexity of the Superman entries or the offensive simplicity of Suicide Squad, we'd be setting the tone for the franchise with a film about the effects of violence, the insanity of war and whether humans are inherently good or evil. Either way, it's so great to report that DC has more than righted their course and made a genre film for the ages."

Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place in,it matters not. Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Prince's debut in comics over seven decades ago. As well as DC comic's own Geoff Johns joining the production team! Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordingly!\n\nI don't need humor in a film about a hero , nor do enjoy it when it's forced into a story. The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated. The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right. . This movie benefits from an exciting story, heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains. I want to see it again and can't wait to see Wonder Woman in Justice League this November!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rousing movie with full of action and amusement ; it's complemented by exciting images , thrills and breathtaking scenes , including groundbreaking computer generator special effects . The success of this show can be attributed largely to Gal Gadot . Without her , the picture probably would never have gained the popularity that it did. Dealing with Princess Diana (Gal gadot) who lives in Paradise Isle where women have extremely long lives keeping their looks and all without men . But World War I intruded on their island and the policy of isolation went up in smoke . As Diana must contend with a powerful enemy whose desire for extreme badness sends the world down a path of destruction . During World War I , while Amazonian warrior Diana in training along with her trainer Antiope (Robin Wright) , a plane piloted by officer Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes near Paradise Island , the secret hidden island home of the mighty and eternally young Amazons . The unfortunate pilot is rescued by Princess Diana, taking still unconscious Major to safety , he tells of conflict in the outside world , and learns of the war against the invader Germans . Meanwhile , some enemy military disrupting the fictitious all-female sanctuary of Themyscira created by the Gods of Olympus . The Amazons decide to send one of their own to help fight in this crisis . Although forbidden to participate in the selection process , Diana escapes secretly from her mother Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and wins the right and responsibility to go . She leaves home to fight a war , discovering her full powers and true destiny . Taking the officer Steve , she joins him and subsequently teaming up with other valiant heroes (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui , Ewen Bremner , Eugene Brave Rock) . Heading to an early 20th Century London to stop the war she believes is influenced by the God Ares . Furthermore , the forces of evil threaten the nation, with the nasty General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) carrying out his misogynistic and chauvinistic policies as well as his chemist mad doctor (Elena Anaya) . Diana of the immortal Amazons aids for saving the world and that's why she wins the decisive power . More and more, cataclysmic events push the world to the brink , and emotionally vulnerable Diana must address a cruel dilemma. .A new era of wonder begins. Grace. Wisdom. Wonder. Power . Courage . The future of justice begins with her . Wonder Woman knew exactly which side she would take and it wasn't going to be . Can mighty Wonder Woman save humankind ?\n\nThrilling heroine movie packed with frantic action , fights , moving scenes , dazzling production design and state-of-art special effects . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy , noisy action , battles, romance , and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic , fast- paced and fun movie . It was made to appeal to wide range of audiences, so the plot wasn't so complex , but prominently featured super powers of Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot was absolutely believable as Wonder Woman, and there was no other actress of the time who could have played the role asides from her . This show had one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast Gal Gadot in the title role as the immortal Amazon warrior , Princess Diana of Themyscira . Gal Gadot as Diana , Wonder Woman, would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder, armed with a invincible shield , magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bracelets that can stop any bullet, a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth . Nothing more fun to watch for a boy than to see her running here and there let me tell you. It also helps that it usually had a relatively good story line to go along with it . Including an interesting script and story from Allan Heinberg , Zack Snyder , Jason Fuchs , based on the characters created by William Moulton Marston .The motion picture was competently directed by Patty Jenkins.\n\nFollowed by Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) in which Princess Diana finds herself trying to stay under the radar, working as an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Museum , directed by Patty Jenkins with Gal Gadot , Chris Pine , Kristen Wiig , Pedro Pascal , Robin Wright , Connie Nielsen . And previously \u00a8Wonder Woman\u00a8 (2011) by Jeffrey Reiner with Adrianne Palicki as Diana Princess / Wonder Woman , Cary Elwes , Pedro Pascal , Elizabeth Hurley . And the classic series Wonder Woman (1975) with Lynda Carter , Lyle Waggoner."

Special effects and cgi don't make up for casting such a terrible Wonder Woman!\n\nOther than the terrible storyline that is full of holes any half wit would notice and the terrible cast, the movie ended up being barely watchable.\n\nAs a strong intelligent, independent woman, I am so sick of this feminist garbage which has been associated with this film!\n\nI hope casting directors wake up and stop casting the wrong people and screwing up what could be good movies!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman - Saying that this is the best of the new DC films isn't exactly glowing praise. Saying that it now currently holds my highest score of the year, however, would definitely qualify.\n\nThe dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Here, jokes were well timed and delivered even better. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic, making these back-and-forths all the more believable. And Lucy Davis steals the show as Pine's secretary.\n\nThere is something to be said for the theme song of this movie. Do me a favor and try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spiderman, maybe? I might not be able to pick any of those out of a lineup. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.\n\nSimilar to most of the Marvel films, this one has a weak villain. A German officer is presented as the antagonist, but I felt more like it was just war in general that they were fighting against. I definitely liked the payoff, but he was underwhelming as an adversary.\n\nThe only other negative I can think of is that there are some moments of wonky special effects. It took me back to The Matrix Reloaded where Neo is just a computer animated cartoon knocking around a dozen Agent Smiths with a stick. The effects seemed jarringly dated at times.\n\nDC was in an absolute tailspin up to this point. The last three films received critic ratings of 55%, 27%, and 25%. This could have been the nail in the coffin. Instead, it was an absolute B12 shot to the brand and the studio itself. Box office hauls of future DC films will no doubt be bigger because of this movie. And to think I almost stayed away from this one based on Batman v Superman alone. Now, Wonder Woman is the only reason I'll keep DC in my lineup going forward. 8.75/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "DC has finally set their foot in the right direction. Say what you want about the previous films, but I think we can all agree that they weren't as well received as they could have been. Now with \"Wonder Woman\" we have a good solid superhero story that's actually meaningful. Zack Snyder is not directing this time around, but his influence is still felt in the visual style of the explosive action scenes. Those parts are very entertaining, but they don't take center stage here. This film takes the time to introduce us to characters we can understand and care for. I think Patty Jenkins handled the emotional story nicely. I enjoyed the quite scenes as much as the exciting ones. It's about this one journey which makes it easy to follow. So it's not a very complicated film.\n\nThe scenery on the Amazonian island is breathtaking. Perfect use of locations. The ancient Greek mythology elements work surprisingly well. The idea of setting the world outside the Amazonian realm during WWI is good. It makes the fish out of water situation with Diana even more interesting, and above all it really helped her development. So that made sense. I will say this though: If you are well educated in history and you happen to know a lot about WWI, then you are gonna be annoyed by some things here. Because it doesn't stay completely true to how everything was back then. Some liberties were taken here and there. I'm not an expert on war history, but my brother is and I had to listen to many things that were inaccurate on the way home after the screening. So, sure. They should have gotten some more history consultants to revise the production. As a normal movie goer you probably won't even think about those things. But if you are a history buff then take note that this is pure fantasy/escapism. You won't be too bothered about historical inaccuracies if you go in with that mindset. I do think the villains were very stereotypical. Most of the time it works, but I would have preferred them not being so much like cartoon bad guys. The final fight gets really bloated and CGI heavy with many explosions. It's handled much better then how it was in \"Batman v Superman\", and I'll tell you why: It was focused. The entire movie balances the human story with the action spectacle well. And that gets a good positive point from me.\n\nThe main characters are likable here. There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I strongly believe I'm seeing Wonder Woman on screen and not the actress Gal Gadot. She embodies this role with pride. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is great. There's some banter towards the end that gets repetitive, but other than that I liked it. The movie has a nice message as well. It's about working together and that love and compassion should never be forgotten. All of those things are nice. This movie has an upbeat vibe overall. It's kind of like a classic adventure movie and I like that. You will walk out feeling happy or maybe even a little inspired. That's a good sign that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. So, yes. I can now say that this a wonderful step forwards for DC. They have definitely improved a lot and I hope they continue like this."

        "review_title": "A Visual Extravaganza Brimming with Heart and Reason",
        "review_detailed_main": "Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman' movie begins with a rocky, uneven start. But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clich\u00e9s that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.\n\nDiana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.\n\nBut in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.\n\nIt is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort."

        "review_title": "Exceptional. Outstanding. DC Hits a Homer! FINALLY.",
        "review_detailed_main": "WONDERful! No seriously, this is an excellent film! And I'm just not talking about the superhero genre. DC finally hit a homer with this one. This film also serves as evidence that Zack Snyder can WRITE a great story but should probably stay out of the director's chair. Warner Bros. and Ratpac Dune's Wonder Woman is the superhero film we needed. Trailing so far behind the Marvel brand and film quality, DC needed to produce a film that would make up for Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad AND catch up to Marvel. Seemingly setting out to accomplish the impossible, this film exceeded all measurable expectations and provided a comprehensive cinematic experience. With many themes, this film hits on many topics and does so with incredible precision and elegance. It's almost as if this film is an extension of Diana Prince herself. Never addressed or referenced as Wonder Woman actually, Diana Prince's origin story is powerful and ever so apropos in today's socio-political climate. If only we could all have the courage, compassion, and determination that Wonder Woman embodies and represents.\n\nEver since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Marston, Wonder Woman has always been treated the best when all pre-existing inhibitions typically added to a female character in a \"man's\" role are removed, allowing the feminist ethos at her core to shine and erupt with unbridled passion and strength. Among other traits, the chief characteristic that separates her from other superheroes in both the Marvel and DC universes respectively is--no, not her gender--it is her ability to integrate truth, justice, compassion, and courage in everything she does to protect the planet entrusted to her people by the Greek gods. The key to understanding Wonder Woman is not through her brute strength or supernatural powers, but through her love and compassion for innocent people and her own integrity. Rarely has any film truly given women (or anyone, for the matter) a strong female protagonist who does not pander but exhibits excellence in well-developed strength of character and a complete eruption of the fantasies of many women to rise up to serve and protect. It would have been far too easy to sell Diana Prince as a vengeful women out to destroy men or seek revenge for the destruction that has befallen the planet; but no, that is not the Diana we see. We see a heroine of others--a completely unselfish hero who is of earth. Being of the earth is truly what separates her from someone like Super Man. Sure, some strong female characters from with the world of comics, literature, theatre, TV, or film have demonstrated strong characteristics and have been leaders; but Wonder Woman sands alone as a film that provides audiences with a female protagonist who is not merely a leader, but the engineer--the author--of her own destiny and story.\n\nWhy does this film work so well??? After all, that is the question you are likely asking yourself after so many DC flops (note: that does not count the Burton or Nolan films). The short answer is that Snyder was NOT in the driver's seat on this ride; however, there is more to it than that. Snyder's touch is certainly evident in many scenes (especially the action sequences); furthermore, he was greatly instrumental in the overall structure, but he took a backseat to the driver of this vehicle. His approach was important in the design of the car, and even building it, but when it came time to take it for a spin, he turned the steering wheel over to Director Patty Jenkins. Films featuring strong female protagonists most often seem to fair better when there is a women at the helm. And Wonder Woman is a testament to that observation. Whereas a male director would have likely spent some time sexualizing Diana, Jenkins spends the time on her courage and compassion. Instead of focusing on the terrain of Diana's mystical home beautifully appointed with white cliffs and sapphire water or spending time on her sleek blade or even her trademark lasso of truth, Jenkins spends a significant amount of screen time on the terrain of Diana's face. A face that communicates the heart, mind, and soul of Diana. Instead of a face displaying anger or disgust at the world of men, her face is often bright, hopeful, containing a winning smile with eyes overflowing with optimism. In terms of the production design itself, it only bares hints of Snyder's penchant for beautiful music videos; the production design is one that takes itself seriously, but in the perfect amounts. Although the film is quite dark, there are sufficient moments of levity.\n\nPerhaps you're a stereotypical dude who does not care for films that feature female protagonists and feministic themes. No fear. Wonder Woman is actually a World War I film disguised as a superhero movie. As much as Wonder Woman works as an exceptional superhero movie, it is equally an impressive World War I film. Taking place in the days leading up to Armistice Day, this film displays the atrocities of war and the determination of both sides to win. You will find yourself in the trenches in France and Belgium with the Allied forces who, against all odds, are determined to defeat the enemy in order to stop genocide and widespread devastation. Placing Wonder Woman amidst the warriors of earth, connects her to humanity in ways that most superheroes cannot. Fighting for what you believe in is a major theme in this film. Some of the best war movies are those that \"show don't tell.\" And Wonder Woman certainly shows what war really looks like instead of talking about it as some abstract concept or spending time in diplomacy. In fact, diplomacy is thrown out the window, and Diana lays the need to fight on the hearts of the bureaucratic leaders and soldiers alike. Pick up your sword and fight. Don't just sit idly by while humanity is destroyed."

Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her training but Antiope (Robin Wright) disobeys her. Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares, God of War. Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana. It's WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British. He had discovered that German General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is developing a devastating new poison gas. Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God. They travel to London where Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) is leading the peace effort.\n\nThe DCEU was having problems. I wouldn't say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win. This is exactly that. I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced. Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff. Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better. The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies. Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her. It's a brilliant move.\n\nThe other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ. She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS. The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steve's final conversation with Diana. Martha is a silly construction. The double scene is emotional heartbreak. The action is solid. The no-man's land fight is amazing. There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor. It is character-based and well-earned. It hits almost every note perfectly."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just watched the first show and everybody started clapping when the credit started to roll in the end. That says a lot about a movie.\n\nMany of us had doubt when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman, and she proved the worth. What an amazing cast! Hollywood is full of beautiful actresses, but Gal also has a great personality which resonates with her character very well. She is strong as well as funny. Chris Pine turned out to be the perfect sidekick and love interest of Diana. He has this old classic Hollywood look. I am hoping we will see more of Connie Nelson and Robin Wright's character in the next venture.\n\nI don't want to go further into screenplay. It has its tiny flaws, but we have seen much worse in recent times. Many people might argue why the WWI? Well, the core of the movie is not the war, but the darkness inside us that causes the war. You can easily relate it to today's narrative.\n\nI enjoyed the movie through and through. Finally a quality superhero movie from DC after Batman Trilogy. You go Gal!"

        "review_detailed_main": "For an action movie, the action scenes are good, but not spectacular. For a superhero movie, the special effects are very weak. For World War I movie, the realism of the historical setting is too inconsistent. (Probably explained by parallel history?) For an anti-war movie, the message is too flimsy. And passing from a gaudy setting on a beautiful (computer generated) Greek fantasy island to a gritty World War I setting is a bold move, no matter how well justified by the plot.\n\nFor these reasons it is surprising that this genre-mixing movie actually works very well, overall.\n\nThe film is the origin story of superhero 'Wonder Woman', though in this film she is only referred to as Diana, 'daughter' of the Queen of the Amazons, or 'Diana Prince'. Her 'mother' formed her out of clay to serve as an antagonist to Ares, the Greek god of war, but has become a bit protective. Diana is played by , who before becoming an actress was a Miss Israel and then a martial arts instructor in the Israeli military. This casting choice seems logical in many ways. It goes back to . (There are plenty of comments on this site claiming that she cannot act. I don't understand them.)\n\nIn the first quarter of the film, Steve (Chris Pine), an English spy returning from Germany, crashes near the secret island of the Amazons and is rescued by Diana. Ultimately this leads to Diana leaving the island and seeking her destiny in a joint mission with Steve.\n\nAfter the warrior idyll of the first quarter, our two heroes travel to London, where the film temporarily turns into a comedy despite the gray setting. It is fun to watch an Amazon shop for clothes and get into conflict with early 20th century European gender stereotypes.\n\nIn its second half the film becomes a war drama that has most of the action and superhero stuff, some of it in the trenches of the Ardennes. Unfortunately this is the weaker half, but it's still entertaining enough."

The action is there, the storyline is decent though predictable, it was at least entertaining from a stand point, and didn't take itself too overly serious.\n\nThe movie is fun overall and even with a lengthy run time, the pacing does deliver properly. As mentioned, Gal Gadot is the highlight and she delivers a star making turn as she instantly elevates the film. Chris Pine is also good in his role. We are now anticipating the sequel expected to be released next year- 2020."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe and its second film following a single hero. Given the quality of the movies that preceded it and Wonder Woman's anemic presence in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I really didn't have high hopes for this one. I figured I'd give it a shot, though, and to my surprise, it wasn't awful; in fact, I mostly enjoyed it.\n\nDiana (Gal Gadot) is an Amazon from the island of Themyscira, a land occupied and governed entirely by women. When American fighter pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands off their coast, Diana rescues him and leaves her home to try to put an end to the First World War, which she believes to be the work of Ares, the god of war. Matters aren't as simple as she planned, though, and she ends up learning uncomfortable truths about humanity, as well as secrets of her own identity.\n\nFor the most part, Wonder Woman is a relief from the dour, clunky DC films that have preceded it. First off \u2013 this one is in color! Gone are the days of gray-and-orange sludge; this movie has green grass and a blue sky. More importantly, Wonder Woman's costume has taken on some classic red and blue. The requisite sexist and fish-out-of- water scenes are mostly given their appropriate time on screen without becoming tedious, and a good deal of the intended humor actually lands. There's an improvised scene early on featuring the two leads on a boat at sea, and they play off of each other wonderfully.\n\nUnfortunately, the film still suffers from a lot of the issues that the previous DC films have: awkward pacing, on-the-nose dialog, weak villains, and an overwhelming score that beats you over the head with what you're supposed to feel at every step of the way. The movie is also incredibly cheesy, and while there is an appropriate, or even desired amount of cheese in a comic book movie, I found myself groaning a bit too much from it all. The battle scenes also manage to out- Snyder Zack Snyder in terms of their overuse of slow motion and \"awesome\", impractical fighting. When Wonder Woman herself isn't involved in scenes, I tend to lose interest, and the reveal toward the end of the film hit me like a handful of Triscuits.\n\nFar and away the best aspect of the movie is Wonder Woman herself. Gal Gadot's performance as a naive hero with an overpowering sense of duty is impeccable, and I loved watching her work. This character saves people because she wants to save them, and it is truly compelling to watch such a pure expression of a superhero. We have seen enough movies about heroes begrudgingly doing their work; in BvS, Superman looks pained to help, and Batman doesn't even try to save anyone.\n\nWonder Woman in this film just might be my favorite superhero in the current cinematic universes, across both Marvel's and DC's movies. We see a hero who fights for those who can't fight for themselves. Marvel has produced quippy dialog and some fun fight scenes, but its heroism has faltered lately. For their deity superhero, they gave us a pile of cardboard with a hammer and a sexy accent. I haven't been this excited for comic book movies since the first Avengers film, and I really wasn't expecting that from DC at this point.\n\nI recommend this movie, not for its intrinsic qualities as a film but for the direction it is potentially taking the DCEU and for its main character. I still don't have high hopes for Justice League, but if they keep this hero doing what she does best, I'll probably be just fine with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's incredibly sad to read about how many milestones Wonder Woman touches on, especially in this day and age where a high-profile Twitter user must consider every message they post to the world in fear of being racist, sexist, homophobic, or just plain insensitive. Despite the influx of superhero movies since Marvel kicked off their Cinematic Universe in 2008 with Iron Man, and despite the abundance of long-standing and hugely popular female superheroes existing in the comics, and despite audiences calling out for a female-led superhero film ever since Scarlett Johansson donned the leathers as Black Widow in Iron Man 2, studios have failed to deliver one in 12 years. Perhaps the studios were scared they would have another Elektra on their hands, but that movie failed because it was terrible, and was a spin-off from the also-terrible Daredevil.\n\nThe DC Extended Universe, in the face of the critical mauling they received last year with the double-whammy of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, can only be applauded for taking the much-overdue 'risk' of launching a female-led franchise with Wonder Woman, a movie that not only represents so much in terms of moving cinema out of a stone-age mentality and into the modern world, but surpasses all expectations in a time of superhero overkill. Wonder Woman is, above all, charming, funny and exciting, and will hopefully help steer the DCEU back on track after an incredibly wobbly start. Making her introduction in Batman v Superman and emerging as one of the few positive things to be said about Zack Snyder's overblown and poorly-constructed smack- down, Wonder Woman begins in the present day but flashes back to the time glimpsed in the black-and-white photograph sent to her by Ben Affleck's Batman, when World War I was in full flow and her heart was won by a spy named Steve.\n\nThe young Diana grows up on the island of Themyscira, a beautiful hidden paradise created by Zeus to be a home for the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors tasked with protecting the world from the Greek God's evil, warmongering brother Ares. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), attempts to shield her from the horrors of war and forbids her to practice combat, while her auntie Anitope (Robin Wright) realises her potential and trains her in secret. Zeus left the islanders a gift, a weapon called the 'Godkiller', which will prove decisive when the battle with Ares finally stirs. Cue the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an Allied spy who stumbles on the island while fleeing the Germans. He brings death and war with him, and the Amazons want to kill him before Diana intervenes, revealing he saved her life. The tribe want nothing to do with a war waged by man, but Diana suspects Ares may be puppet-master behind the conflict that has taken millions of lives. Against her mother's wishes, she travels with Steve to London, where he reveals to his superiors German plans to release a devastating new mustard gas created by General Ludendroff (Danny Huston) and Spanish chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya).\n\nThe word 'man' carries a special significance, and director Patty Jenkins carefully weaves this idea into the film without rubbing it in your face. As well as the violent, dangerous 'world of men' lurking across the waters, there is also No Man's Land, the stretch of mud and rubble separating the two warring fronts. This is a place that no man can hope to survive, and this sets up the triumphant moment seen in the trailers in which Diana deflects machine-gun fire with her bracelets and shield before taking out anybody daft enough to stand in her way. This scene is made all the more powerful by Gal Gadot, who puts in a terrific performance despite her lack of acting experience and puts all the doubters to rest, proving to be just as savvy with comedy as the action. The fact that we care so much about her also means that the CGI-heavy climax, which seems to be trend with DC, can almost be forgiven. Thanks to well-written character development and some charming chemistry between Gadot and the ever- brilliant Chris Pine, there is a real emotional investment that was lacking in DC's previous misfires. In terms of origin stories, this doesn't rewrite the rule-book, but the importance and significance of Wonder Woman should not be underestimated."

Secondly, when I first saw this in the theatre, I quite enjoyed it up until the end, where I felt overwhelmed my computer effects. That part didn't seem to bother me as much at home, and I'm glad for that, because the first half of the movie is great, and then it downturns a bit but is still pretty good. I would love to see more of Paradise Island, because that, and Wonder Woman on the battlegrounds, were the best two parts. So basically, I'd love to see more stunt work than special effects."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went in with low expectations, therefore I wasn't disappointed. However, if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries, I would have been quite annoyed. This is NOT a good movie. I barely rate it average.\n\nThere were good parts in it, mainly the feminist aspects of the film. Diana is tough, but also a woman, with a strong personal and cultural desire to help, mend, love. Of course, it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end, when she kills a bunch of people, but still, it was a refreshing, if badly implemented, point of view.\n\nOther than that there is a lot of bad characterization, starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three \"sidekicks\" that do almost nothing the entire movie. Even the villains are underused, in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours. There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame (see the \"they don't know that\" scene, ugh!) and some bad acting here and there.\n\nGal Gadot is beautiful, but not an extremely talented actress. She did her best, though. Chris Pine played Captain Kirk, complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops, thinks a little, then rides another way, plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene. I think it was some sort of tribute, but that part wasn't good in Star Trek either.\n\nBottom line: you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much. \"The savior of DC franchises\" is no worse or better than the things people called disasters before. It is not fun, merely time consuming."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Steve Trevor(Pine, charming, wry) lands on Themyscira, it is the first contact between it and the world of man(the species) in a long time, and the first experienced at all by Diana(Gadot, bringing to life the idealistic titular character. Her smile, her grace and her world are all stunning. Their chemistry is strong). He tells the ethnically diverse group about World War I. Might Ares have returned, creating the conflict he lives for?\n\nThere are chunks of this that pass without action. Especially in the middle section. The climax is less chaotic, loud and, well, blinding, than Batman V Superman's, albeit not entirely dodging those problems. And the first few aren't as consequential. The initial one is essentially combat training. However, when it's there, it is always good, and frequently amazing. It's not there purely because that's part of why we came to watch. Never does it just make people look cool, and let the heroine stack up a body-count. Heck, she barely kills anyone, and she clearly isn't interested in it. In one of the (too) many similarities to Captain America: The First Avenger(a movie it does largely match in overall quality. Nevertheless, it feels derivative), she \"doesn't like bullies\". No, first and foremost, she's doing it to save people.\n\nThis as the leaders of the countries involved are shrugging off massive casualties. As No Man's Land is treated as an unfortunate reality, not one that is likely to be brought to an end. While the two villains, who could easily have been combined into one, spend their compelling screen-time either using horrible poison gas on the defenseless, or studying hard to make it even worse. She's there to rescue those she's never met. From a race she hadn't even encountered days earlier, in her whole life. We're in the middle of a comic book movie boom. And yet this seemingly obvious value and goal so often goes forgotten these days.\n\nOther than the leads, a lot of the performers, talented as most of them are, get lost in the shuffle, with only a couple of moments to really shine. The Amazons are almost all bad actors \u2013 I figure they went for physical types, instead. I would say it could have been handled by hiring talents specifically for when they have dialog, and then those would be ones we didn't see in other scenes. Mostly, they are there to convince you of Paradise Island as somewhere people live, work, not only fence. And they succeed. There are pacing issues. The ending is bad, and borrows from great, but mismatched, sources. Occasionally, the message and themes get cheesy, and the final resolution is one example. Although the humor is rapid-fire, using the fish-out-of-water element well, it frequently feels forced, and I don't blame those who find it obnoxious and, indeed, at no point actually funny. The DCEU(no, saying that this is the best of the four isn't saying much) has yet to balance jokes with seriousness. It's not a perfect film. What it is, is genuinely engaging and moving. Warner Brothers? Keep Patty Jenkins around. She'll help you properly compete with the MCU.\n\nThere is a lot of disturbing content in this. I recommend it to everyone. 7/10"

Okay, we are all entitled to an opinion. If you go to see a movie that you know features a female superhero, probably seen stills and maybe a trailer, it shouldn't be a surprise to see ridiculous antics, a light plot, and a fun film aimed mainly at the male teenage market. Someone had a go at the acting, nothing wrong with it that I could see. Lighten up a little, if you don't like a movie, say so but do it in a way that doesn't insult in an unkind way."

No more spy themes, fighting the cold war, which is already long over in reality. Then it quickly started to bore me and recently I even got annoyed. Hulk, episode 20, Iron Man episode 30, Spider Man third character.... But this had some appeal to me. There is some sort of a story. There are characters and there is some OK acting. The action slowly builds up from some initial Amazon training scenes to later total god mode out of this world in the air hovering boss fight. If you want a movie to be successful these days you have to do this stuff. Either do it or be removed from the theaters after one week. After all: it is entertainment business. What I really enjoyed is the artwork. There is a stunning image language and breath taking beautiful sites. And I do value this. So maybe don't focus so much on the action and enjoy the tastefully arranged scenery."

Action is done very well. The shooting is also fab. The ending twist is perfect. I was always a fan of wonder woman but now I am even more. I heard Gadot got a neck and back surgery after completing the movie. Great for children above 8 and also great for adults. The plot is mind blowing. I have watched this without exaggerating 6 times.

It's a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both \"The First Avenger\" and \"Man of Steel.\"\n\nThe opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome. The story really picks up when Captain Steve Trevor and Diana depart the island. They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest.\n\nUnlike \"Man of Steel,\" which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, \"Wonder Woman\" has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B"

It was entertaining at all times, it had exciting action set-pieces but it still took it's time to have some more quite character moments between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. This is what makes this movie special. It told a great origin story with some themes that were very fitting to the rest of the film. I still have a few issues with the film like the Way some of the characters were treated and the use of CGI explosions but that's about it. \"Wonder Woman is a great summer blockbuster with story, courage and a lot of heart.

It's then that she discovers that this person is a man-and she has never seen one before as her entire island is populated by females. But before she can get much information from him the island is attacked by German soldiers who are eventually killed in a very fierce battle. Not long afterward she is told that his name is \"Captain Steve Trevor\" (Chris Pine) and he is an American soldier working with British Intelligence. Not only that, but he also tells her that the entire world is involved in a war on the scale of something that has never happened before. So having already witnessed the ruthlessness of the Germans, she decides to go with Captain Trevor to London to track down and kill the individual responsible-Aires, the God of War. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good \"Comic Book movie\" which had plenty of action and an interesting plot. Likewise, the presence of an attractive actress like Gal Gadot certainly didn't hurt matters either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to confess, I am not a fan of big-screen comic book/superhero films, especially of the last twenty-plus years. In fact, the only one of these I sat through in my life was the original SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, arguably the best film of its kind ever made-and this was back in 1978. But while I probably can't change my mind about the genre after seeing it, the 2017 film WONDER WOMAN has more than enough to distinguish it from the others of either the DC Comics lineup (which it is a part of) or Marvel.\n\nThe character of Diana, the Amazon warrior princess who became Wonder Woman, originated in comic books the late 1930's, but the most famous iteration of this character was on television during the late 1970's, when the role was portrayed (and legendarily so) by Lynda Carter. Fortunately, in the midst of Hollywood's (and the film going public's) obsession with comics, the character finally made a stand-alone big-screen bow in 2017-and with no less than a woman in the director's chair, Patty Jenkins, here making her first film as a director since 2003's MONSTER.\n\nIsraeli actress Gal Gadot steps into the role of the Amazon warrior princess, whose background of growing up among fellow goddesses on the mythical island of Themyscira is brilliantly depicted by Jenkins and her crew on location in Italy, and is mentored by the best of them (portrayed by Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright). But everything changes for her when an American pilot (Chris Pine) working as a spy for the British crashes his plane close to the island. Pine tells of a war to end all wars happening in the world outside of Themyscira, which is shielded by an invisible force field; and Gadot, having realized her abilities, makes every effort to try and stop it all. She and Pine take a boat into the worst of the fighting on the Western Front in France near the end of this war, World War I, and try to stop a ruthless German general (Danny Huston) from manufacturing a lethal gas sure to make an already atrocious body count in this first example of genuine mechanized warfare even higher than it is. The adventures that Gadot and Pine go on force Gadot to not only understand her own powers, but the weaknesses of the human race in general, and men in particular, and the penchant they have for killing each other through hatred. In her relationship with Pine, she realizes that love is the one thing that can save the world.\n\nUnlike so many other superhero comic book movies, Wonder Woman, besides having immense powers of her own, is also able to show empathy and understanding, only using her powers when nothing else will do. And even though her Israeli accent is very obvious in her line renderings, Gadot makes a completely credible Wonder Woman all the same-likely, she was the only actress capable of creating a Wonder Woman for this era (even though this film is set more than a century in the past) and still paving a certain amount of homage to Carter, whom Jenkins gives very special thanks to in the final credits. The visual effects and the costumes are all first-rate, of course; but the reason they, and the film in general, work as well as they do is because of Jenkins' fine direction and Gadot's portrayal. This is not just a slam-bang, hypersonic Hollywood spectacle. This is a spectacle with a heart and a conscience; and that's why it gets a '9' rating from me."

        "review_title": "Exceeding Expectations, but not Perfect",
        "review_detailed_main": "With the last DC film to come out being Suicide Squad, there was good reason to be concerned about Wonder Woman. Even after the initial wave of positive reviews for it started coming in I was extremely skeptical. With DC having been in a slump of critically unpopular movies and with superhero movie fatigue on the rise, I really thought there was almost no possible way this would be good or be received well. For the most part, I was wrong. That being said, it is by no means perfect. The fact that this movie is being lauded by many critics as some kind of masterpiece is strange. I was reasonably satisfied overall, but let's not get carried away.\n\nFirst, the good news: The overall premise of Wonder Woman helping to bring about an end to WWI by finding and battling the god of war Ares, is a perfectly straightforward and compelling superhero plot. The characters mostly work well, even if some of the side characters that accompany her later on feel a bit pointless and underused. Tonally this is also substantially lighter fare than the other recent DC films, which are all pretty heavy and dark and grim.\n\nInitially, I doubted Gal Gadot could pull off carrying an entire movie, but once again, I was (mostly) wrong. She embodies the role to the point where she is probably the best part of the movie and carries it with surprising competence. Part of my skepticism came from the fact that she is/was a model whose previous forays into the world of acting have more or less been as eye candy in the mind-numbing Fast and Furious franchise.\n\nThankfully, her model looks are not used as a cheap device to hijack the movie into the realm of fan service. That said, her looks do help her to believably pull off a character that is essentially a goddess. Her character is also very clearly a warrior, yet she still mostly plays the character as feminine, not as a male proxy. She also plays the character with an innocent earnestness that, along with her looks, help her to stand out like a beacon in the drab, dreary, and miserable setting of WWI era Europe. And even though she may not have the acting chops of a top tier actress (and it shows in a few scenes), her being cast here fits well enough that I would have a hard time seeing anyone else in the role now. Strong casting usually trumps raw acting experience.\n\nSome of the scenes she is in with Chris Pine's character, who she has an appropriately awkward chemistry with, were allowed to be improvised, which sometimes leads to some very clunky interactions. It kind of works with the naivet\u00e9 of the character, but perhaps a more clever scripted sequence could accomplish the same thing better. I also wasn't a fan of the early sequences of the movie where Diana is growing up and receiving lots of exposition about her homeland and history. It's a beautiful setting and it sets up the rationale for her leaving, but it drags on and the other characters there are mostly uninteresting. Once she leaves, the plot picks up, with a few rocky patches here and there.\n\nThe usage of slow motion during action sequences all the way until the ending is excessive, but not to the point where it's overly obnoxious. My thoughts on the ending and the accompanying battle are mixed. It works as a flashy and climactic way to resolve her motivations for entering the war, but it almost becomes a completely different movie at that point. I think this could've been executed differently so it didn't feel as out of place.\n\nOne other problem which personally bothers me the most is the body count. Superman, Batman, and now even Wonder Woman all kill tons of people (Marvel is occasionally guilty of this as well). With Wonder Woman it feels especially wrong, since not only is she against the idea of war to begin with, but the German soldiers she is so easily crushing with her incredible strength are to her merely innocent men being manipulated by Ares. Yes, this is a war, but at no point is subdual or allowing surrender even considered after demonstrating her immense power. I understand that an action movie needs action, but action doesn't need to mean killing everybody. The early fight on the beaches of her homeland is also strange, with both sides just immediately deciding to kill the other despite having no idea who they even are. If you were a WWI era German soldier who accidentally sailed up to an unknown island and saw a bunch of women riding horses on the beach wearing ancient Greek looking armor, would you immediately open fire on them? It just doesn't make much sense.\n\nAll in all, it's a good movie made better by the fact that it exceeded expectations, but I wouldn't overdo it with the praise. Let's hope DC movies can stay at this level or improve, and maybe Gal Gadot can counterbalance that dark pessimism in the DCEU with some refreshing hopeful optimism."

        "review_title": "Review From a Non-Comic Book Fan: Surprisingly Good",
        "review_detailed_main": "I don't watch any comic book movies. The only reason I watched this is because WW 1984 was hyped during the Coronavirus lockdowns so I watched that out of interest. Reading reviews about that, I wanted to see what the 2017 version was like in comparison. So let me make clear, if you are already a comic book movie fan, this review is coming from a POV of somebody who never watches any of them except for Nolan's Batman trilogy and older ones from the 80's mostly, maybe 1 or 2 from the early 2000's like Spiderman and Superman Returns, both were pretty good.\n\nAs a big fan of World War I (and WW II), I actually loved this movie's ability to converge the story of Dianna into that backdrop, and in my opinion, this is more of a WWI movie than it is a \"superhero\" or comic book movie, even though obviously it is also that, too. The reason why is because the way the scenes were staged and set up, it immersed you into that time period. Most of the costumes, background scenery, war scenes, and even the strategies, weapons, and geography discussed throughout the movie were surprisingly extremely accurate for that, and I was not expecting that whatsoever. In fact, my expectations were incredibly low for this movie before watching it.\n\nSecond, let me mention the also unexpected delight of the added mix of legit funny scenes/humor and a love story that was almost as poignant as something at the pinnacle of that genre, Titanic. Once again, this was totally unexpected on both levels, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they were included. It made the film even more likable and entertaining.\n\nThirdly, the script is very good. It's not elite, but it is way above average and good for this genre. That was also unexpected.\n\nI also have to mention the acting, and Pine does a very good job in his role. Gadot's exotic looks and accent work extremely well for her role since one of the main ideas of the story is that she is a fish out of water entering the modern world from her secluded island.\n\nAbout the only thing I didn't like about this film was how the action sequences toward the end became a little too far fetched and cheesy, but even so, the scenes were emotionally powerful between the score, dialogue, themes, and acting so those components redeemed it just enough to save it from being really bad. It sort of devolved into an average villain cliche, and there is no denying that. However, there were some emotionally powerful elements going on while that was happening. I almost feel like I want to forget that bad part and remember the good parts of that final battle scene.\n\nFinally, I do not usually cry during movies, but this movie caused me to shed a few tears on two levels. First, it's an absolutely beautiful movie between the scenery, musical score, and cinematography. It's brilliant. Second, Gadot's reactions to the sufferings of war and her chemistry with Pine in the love story side of it and their disagreements about the causes of war she hates were very emotionally powerful, and I also did not anticipate that either. The movie has depth, it has emotional depth, and it is hard to forget because this is what makes it a solidly good movie.\n\nI've already seen WW twice, and I look forward to watching it again. Since 2013, there are only about 2-3 other movies I've seen more than once besides this one. So in another surprising way to myself, I would call this easily one of my top 5 favorite movies of the 2010's. It's almost a masterpiece.\n\nUpdate: I've now seen it 2 more times as of Oct 2023 and my review stands. It's a modern classic.\n\n8.5/10."

Accompanied by stunning visuals, Wonder Woman also works as a summer spectacle worth the ticket. The romance is genuine with Gadot and Pine's chemistry carrying the film. Fans of Greek mythology will not be disappointed as it pays homage to its ideals, while sprinkling a modern touch. The villains are, however, the weak link with weak motivations.\n\n8/10"

The thematic relevance and consistency is good, the visuals and color grade are refreshing, the acting is pretty great, and the writing has a lot of good moments and the story is compelling at base. Even the action stands above the standard superhero movie in memorability and fun. The prop and costume design is absolutely terrific.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this is marred terribly by the editing. The entire film is incredibly slow paced for an action movie, even several fight scenes feel lethargic. There are several scenes present that add nothing to the movie, and several jarring oddities. The editing needed serious tightening, and this issue multiplies existing issues. Some of the dialogue is tedious and unnecessary, and the slow editing compounds this into making the movie feel as boring as the dialogue at these parts. The 2 hour and 20 minute runtime is far too long for the substance of the film. There is little outside the editing that's negative, with some odd special effects or minor continuity inconsistencies.\n\nI praise this movie generally, but I can't recommend it for casual viewers. I'd recommend it only for DC fans or people who don't wish to engage much with the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this movie quite entertaining. Despite it's over two hours duration someone can watch it with pleasure. I found many common things to the Captain America's movie as well as to the God of War action game with a female character instead. The movie introduce us to the world of the Amazons. A female warrior society where young Diana grows up. The photography of beautiful landscapes and world war industrial cities is tied to the movie's atmosphere. Costumes and vehicles too. Dialogs are pretty simply but they are not redundant most of the time. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is good. She is a strong female personality but at the same time she possesses a lot of compassion for the human suffering caused by the war and therefore they have a common ground. Acting performances are not great but they are not bad either. Everyone has it's own separate role and they are all tied up together. Choreographies are impressive with tension and quite natural moves for CGI. The soundtrack and the sound effects are suitable to the movie's theme. It is an amusing superhero movie in general which introduces us the wonder woman, a member of the upcoming DC's justice league movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I'd like to point out that I have done reviews before and therefore, rest assured that I am not a bot, which now made me suspicious of all the good reviews that have been written for this movie prior to its worldwide release. This movie is a hot mess. I went in with high expectations after reading all the reviews praising this movie. At the end of the first act (you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see the movie), it felt that the movie should have stopped right there and probably leave Ares to a sequel or something. But no, it slowed down and then moved on to the next villain. And when you think it's over, another villain slapped you in the face and made me think, \"oh yeah, there's another one that they haven't addressed yet\". In total, this movie has 3 climaxes, all arguably equal in terms of power and and at the end of the movie, it is similar to the feeling of stepping off a nauseating roller coaster ride with dramatically steep ups and downs in terms of the pacing of the movie. I would also like to point out that I am not a comic book reader but an avid moviegoer and therefore, no... I am not a Marvel fanboy which many people would say biased my opinion. I want to go to a movie to feel entertained and sorry to say, this movie did not entertain me."

Awkward sleepover episode, shopping episode, prom episode... with Steve as the average Joe anime protagonist and Diana the naivete powerful female protagonist.\n\nIt is worth watching over pirates 5 for sure."

Gal has a great physics for the character, but I wasn't sure if she was poor actor or dialog is terrible.\n\nIf you have some knowledge of WWI, your brain would have hard time to adapt and let you enjoy the movie. Add that to the poor dialog, you will have a hard time tolerate the last 45 minutes.\n\nThe first half was 8, the last half 4."

Thank you Patty Jenkins & THANK YOU Gal Gadot for this masterpiece! \ud83d\udc99\n\nThe film begins inside the walls of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The story begins with Diana, Princess of Themyscira looking at a picture from her past & we are taken on a journey on how she became Wonder Woman by participating in World War I alongside Steve Trevor & his gang plus defeating Ares, the God of War.\n\nWonder Woman is simply amazing. The film does not hold back because Gal Gadot - bless her - gives you all the glory of the iconic Amazonian Warrior Princess. Gal Gadot was well known from the Fast & Furious series, but her quintessential performance in this film has cemented herself as an icon! As Princess Diana of Themyscira, Gal truly does kick ass in this film. She truly is a superwoman in reality as she did her own stunts despite being five months pregnant!\n\nThis film is a masterpiece courtesy of the hard work put into the cinematography to the brilliant choreography & the production plus art design as well as the meticulous details into the costumes. It's one of the many reasons why I keep on watching this film because it truly feels like you are in their world.\n\nThe message of love is strong in this film & I believe in love just like Wonder Woman.\n\nPS: I managed to muster the courage to go to the State of Israel & experience the beauty the nation has to offer. And I have to thank Gal Gadot for it \ud83d\udc99"

        "review_title": "An over-hyped movie, much too predictable",
        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems.\n\nBut just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the \"third wave of feminism\", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as \"horny\", dumb, \"needlessly\" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the \"crashed pilot\") who I'd dare to call a \"token man\" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.\n\n*just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as \"dangerous\". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie \"Batman Vs Superman\", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended.\n\nTo conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy."

        "review_detailed_main": "When i first walk into the theater to watch this movie, i don't have that much of a high expectation. I'm pretty much avoiding a mistake that i already have made back then when i watched batman v superman: dawn of justice and suicide squad , and yet left me disappointed. but wonder woman is actually pretty good!\n\nI think DC evolve much, i think they learn from their previous mistake that they make such serious, dark, but unenjoyable movie. i could see how much effort to make Wonder woman to have dark serious tone yet still being enjoyable, heart warming, and pretty funny . i still have my comments though, on this matter which i will discuss later. The characters itself are very interesting. before i watched the film, i thought that the character wonder woman is going to be a marry sue (a character who doesn't face any challenges and is good at anything, which i despise). but, thankfully, she doesn't. wonder woman a.k.a Diana has her strengths that make her stands out, yet also has weaknesses that sometimes push her away from achieving her goals in the movie, which makes a good main character development. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine might me the highlight of the movie since i think without their chemistry and also performance the movie wouldn't be as well as it is. their relationship in the film, although a bit cheesy, is what makes the movie more realistic and emotional. the fight scenes are also very fun and action-packed.\n\nHowever, This film's not a masterpiece. it still has things i didn't like and sometimes take me away from the movie. first, the humor. as i said before, i appreciate that DC tries to be more fun with light-hearted comedy, but sometimes i felt as if they stretch a joke too long, that turns chuckles into a cringe. like, OK we get it it's funny now can we move on? second, some lines are also very cheesy. third, pacing. sometimes i felt as if this movie is going too slow yet too fast at the same time. at times i would question a character's motivation because i didn't understand their character very well, which leads into the fourth, the story telling. i know how i mentioned how i love the way that diana and steve character's developed, but as they centered on both of them too much, they as if forget the side characters. side characters are not as important as the main characters but still has their own uses in the plot and the main character motives as well. i felt some characters are so pushed out and forced, that i'm not even feeling sympathetic towards them, which is pretty dull sometimes that i don't feel as emotional the movie wants me to be, and fifth and last, is the CGI. i don't have much to say on this, rather than it's pretty acceptable, but sometimes it takes me away from the movie a little. although, some landscape shots at the beginning of the movie showing themyscira is gorgeous and eye- candy.\n\nin conclusion, even with its flaws, i recommend you to watch wonder woman, a movie i would hopefully call a kick-starter for great movies at DCEU at the future!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This review of Wonder Woman is spoiler free\n\n**** (4/5)\n\nTHERE'S A SAYING, a metaphor perhaps that states if a series or a distributor starts with a few false starts in previous instalments then the hype for the next instalment will dwindle, this, of course is true for other series' of films but for the DCEU it clearly isn't. There have been a few false starts for the series, Man of Steel didn't live to expectation nor Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice wasn't as good as was previously thought then Suicide Squad fell into the world of shame rather than live up to what it said on the tin. It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour, at first this saviour came from a meme \u2013 this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war, then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadot's Diana \u2013 perhaps the saviour of BvS.\n\nAfter Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight, and goes into turmoil, in the opening few minutes there's colour, a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince (exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell) willing to train for a coming war. Her mother (Robin Wright) explains that there is no need to do this \u2013 after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior. The opening origin story is exceptional there's a lot colour which we haven't seen in previous instalments, there's stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadot's Diana training with her auntie (Connie Nielsen) the best fighter on the island. An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world. When he's teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need.\n\nPine is exceptional as Steve, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's a charmer who does anything to please our heroine. Diana who's never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from. She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war \u2013 meanwhile villainous doctor, Dr. Poison (Elana Anaya) and her warmongering companion Ludendorff (Danny Huston) design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers. It's a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but now-a-days it works. It's dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films, something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you don't need to be dark to be good.\n\nAnd she does her job well, as Diana Gadot is fantastic she's a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning, as her stronger alter ego she's exceptional, she's strong but on the inside she's vulnerable, unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel she's not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style. Diana was the saviour in BvS, here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS. And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too \u2013 she adds a lot of elements here that makes this super-human feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line.\n\nSadly it's not wonderful, in the last 20 minutes it hits a clich\u00e9 cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on now-a-days, there are some moments that look they're made from green screen and sadly doesn't make it as good as it could've been. Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment, it's she's brought new light to the DCEU and it's about damn time.\n\nVERDICT: After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever, now we can breathe again."

No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans, but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distress.\n\nI really enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen. The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four (4) years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989, we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989.\n\nCongratulations to the women's movement and to all those pre-teens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood. The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman. There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way, including as heroes to emulate, and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman. The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sex.\n\nI am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience. My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI (Computer-generated imagery) during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down. Sometimes too much...is simply too much (CGI). I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 rating."

With any of these block buster type Super hero movies I am left with the definite impression many of the \"reviewers\" on IMDb are either studio plants or have not seen the actual movie and base their votes on Trailers. Much of the final scenes was over bloated and unnecessary and did not add anything to the story. Gadot was outstanding in the title role. Chris Pine looks, as he always does, on the verge of tears or a breakdown or something. I don't rate him as an actor. Supporting cast were good. Over all the movie had good production values, a so so script and the CGI was good but over done in the final scenes. A good movie but not a great movie. Worth the admission price."

And also, the decision to use WW1 backdrop and how well it was portrayed was just perfect.\n\nThe movie has a raw feel to it which makes it extra special. Not a moment will go by where you'll think they tried too hard to fit in the humor, it all comes as natural as natural can be. There is a lot of little moments in the movie that can be appreciated like for example the dancing in midst of war, the romance between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Moreover, the action alone can be a driving factor, which makes me want to watch this movie again and again. Its one like, that we've never seen before.\n\nYes, this movie is not perfect, it has few, a few CGI issues which I think all big action movies have in common (including Marvel movies as well), however, with Wonder Woman its handled really well.\n\nI honestly appreciate the hard work and passion that went behind making this movie possible. Some of the people to credit will be Petty Jenkins (wonderful director), Zack Snyder (for having good vision for these movies) and the screen writers. Wonder Woman is a \"mustsee\" movie on big screens."

        "review_detailed_main": "The moment Diana Prince took her first spear tackle at evil in Batman Vs Superman threw a gauntlet at the feet of an entire generation of older movie-goers who's lingering impression of Wonder Woman was a soft, curvaceous and inherently feminine Linda Carter of the seventies. Spinning magic girl transformations have been replaced with a monstrous power that frankly woke me up in my seat. She was my lingering impression and my first taste of a DC that left me wanting more.\n\nThe Wonder Woman role has big shoes to fill and sadly the shoes themselves will give her a scrutiny male counterparts are not burdened with. Will they be sensible shoes, combat boots or heels? Gal Gadot's counter-argument is a role that is strong, personal and honest. Her tremendous power is counterbalanced with a naivety that reaches beyond comic relief into an often scathing critique of the human leanings toward inhumanity. She reminds us of a bigger picture by becoming a passionate observer of our frailty and in doing so, often exposes her own while retaining all of her strength. In this regard the role of Wonder Woman is an unprecedented success as she struggles to find herself as a person rather than her role as a female superhero.\n\nAlthough aspects of female gender roles are present they develop in other characters. The mother, the amazon, the witch, the submissive - all present as people rather than stereotypes and the roster of strong performances delivers with a confidence that define these women with substance and a dignified strength while avoiding becoming lessons or cautionary tales in femininity.\n\nI feel it as important to note that the male characters in this movie also avoid the same gender stereotypes. The men who marginalize her share the same disregard for all life. The men who initially sought to protect her - as we are taught to by our mothers and sisters - quickly fall behind her and support her strength. She is never forced to explain herself.\n\nIn a genre filled with movies about other movies or stories that build momentum for bigger stories to come it's refreshing to see a movie that delivers a strong tale, genuinely warm characters and manages to embarrass us with the lesson that genuinely strong and honest characters make our gender expectations irrelevant."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman is a superhero film starring Gal Gadot in the title role and the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Directed by Patty Jenkins (2003's Monster), the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps, but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a whole.\n\nIn 1918, the Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira. One day, an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands near the island. After being rescued by Diana, Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a \"war to end all wars\" currently being waged by the human race. Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue, Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this war.\n\nFeaturing a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes, Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time, considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors. There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story, very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute. Gal Gadot's performance in the eponymous role is great, her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical \"superhero origin story\" format and does little to detract from that. However, considering how interesting the main character is, this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall film.\n\nI rate it 8.5/10"

And it's really nice that it's the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend. I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it - just try to leave the feminism discussion out of it.\n\nAnd enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero. Wonder Woman rising in the best sense. There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome. The main villain for example has his issues, but for every thing that may not work 100% you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good. Take Chris Pine for example: I wasn't sure if this was necessary casting ... but it very much was. You needed someone who could hold his own. And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this. Looks and beauty aside, she really pulled her weight acting wise."

But the weather was so hot today I whisked my ten year old nephew to the only 'family' movie in our local air conditioned cinema. Immediately this new world was a visual treat, and the necessary background to WW unfolded like a Greek myth. A few hints of the Amazonian women swaggering like chaps in their training camp, and a couple of corny lines from WW love interest Chris Pine delivered in the expository style early on started to eat away at my disbelief, but these minor grumbles didn't portend and the movie grew in drama, spectacle, tension and intensity. My young companion turned to me saying 'this movie is amazing', and I agree. Gal Gadot and Pine are both credible actors (it's not his fault he's too pretty to be a 'real' hero) and they are well served by an above average script (especially for this kind of movie). David Threwlis brings serious acting chops to the table as expected, but the revelation is Lucy Davis, whose comedic sidekick could carry a show of her own. The audience loved her, and laughed along at every nuance. Her charisma bounced out of the screen and reminded me of the superb character actors of the old studios in the decades before the end of that system; e.g. Eve Arden, Margaret Rutherford, Mary Wickes, Joan Blondell et al. Stardom awaits. I won't overplay the feminist/girl power angles, but if my ten year old nephew loved it as he did, then I can confidently say most young boys will too. Drag them there, the girls too! It's a joy."

But if your intention is to empower women and the best thing about the film is the romance between steve and Diana, you went wrong somewhere. I had absolutely no interest in any of the plot and basically suffered through all the war scenes. The twist at the end was cool I guess, and it was cute to watch Diana navigate outside her element, but once was definitely enough for this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most movies on this website's top 250 films are adaptions, be it a novel or a comic book or even another film. I am not a reader and never read comic books growing up so I am not biased when I watch adaptations which I strongly feel is one of the reasons Wonder Woman has 8.3/10 here and 93% on rotten tomatoes. If Wonder Woman was a spec script this film would not be trending. Until this film Angelina Jolie was the highest earning action Heroine at the US box office with Lara Croft (2001) $131 million. She also managed $118 million with Salt (2010). Scarlett Johanson achieved $126 million with Lucy (2014) and no other actress had been able to carry an action film entirely alone. Hunger games, Star Wars, Divergent and Terminator don't qualify because the male opposite were just as strong.\n\nThe other reason is that this film is directed by a Female. People love this film because it is the first time a Female director has worked with a big budget like this. $150 million. It has been long time coming. I hope female representation will improve from here on and it seems so because Ava Duvernay also achieved a milestone by becoming the first Black female director to direct an upcoming $100 million film also becoming the third overall behind Katherine Bigelow who did K-9 (2002) for $100 million.\n\nI give this film 6/10 because there is nothing groundbreaking like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight. Its actually half that. Wonder Woman is just another superhero popcorn film whose Lead has an accent giving further evidence that Jews runs the World lol. Wonder Woman is played by Gal Gadot who I think is responsible for the financial success not the story or the CGI. She is genuinely funny, sexy and a great actor. I bet She and Chris Pine who plays the male lead will win the Best Duo at the 2018 MTV movie awards. As for Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen whose names are also on the poster they don't make it past the first ten minutes of the film which is fraud because I love Robin Wright."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman (2017) is the best DCEU film since the Dark Knight Rises. Having said that, it is not great but it is a good comic movie that will satisfy 2 hours. It's not as good as the Nolan films but not nearly as bad as the other recent DC movies. The acting from the leads is solid. As a lifelong Wonder Woman fan, Gal Gadot is my new favorite Wonder Woman by far. She's not perfect acting-wise, but her beauty, confidence and strength sells it. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is believable and you care about him. The story is simple (bad guy wants to destroy humanity and the heroes stop him) but very focused. The comedy is a lot similar to Thor's but still enjoyable and does its own thing.\n\nWith all that said, my main issues with the film are with some of the characters (and how they are driven) and the time capsule of the film. Wonder Woman is great but for much of the film, she often feels like a supporting character in her own movie. While not intentional, Trevor is the one that drives the plot and kind of takes over the film. While I like his character, the film is called 'Wonder Woman'. She should've been allowed to make some more decisions for herself. I also want to add that the side characters are passable but could've been better. I honestly didn't really remember them after the movie was over.\n\nMy other issue is the film being set during WWI. The comics are set during WWII. This made sense since the Nazis ideologies were evil and this was when chemicals were really being advanced (Holocaust anyone?). WWI was a lot more politically complex and was basically the clash of empires. No side was completely innocent. I get this is just for entertainment but, as someone with a history degree, it is distracting. Captain America: the First Avenger worked well with WWII and think Wonder Woman would've made more sense too in that time period. I mean the Germans they're describing are Nazis, not Kaiser imperial soldiers. The film just felt more WWII-ish than WWI. Watch War Horse (2011) to compare. I just wonder (haha) what happened when WWII started for Diana. I guess that was just \"Ares\" too and that'll be the sequel? If so, then what will have been the point in this film or Trevor's fate?\n\nThere is not much else to comment on. The film looked really good, even beautiful at times. The music was pretty forgettable (no memorable theme that Wonder Woman deserves).\n\nOverall, I give the film a B-. It wasn't great but wasn't bad either. I think it is a step in the right direction for DC. I would recommend the film for at least one viewing."

She rescues a dashing spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who informs her people about a greater conflict we know to be World War One. She is appalled by the destruction and onslaught so without question she sets out on a quest to end it.\n\nGal Gadot is the beautiful beating heart of this movie and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman. She's charismatic and authoritative but not so much that she loses her feminine charm and sense of humor. Yes a DC character being funny! Imagine that! Chris Pine is the love interest/sidekick who could honestly serve as the lead of his own adventure movie. Pine is factory built for these types of tough but clever action roles. His chemistry with Gadot is the best romance in a superhero movie since probably the original Spider-Man movies. The supporting cast is a strong one. Connie Nielsen is dignified as the Queen, Robin Wright is her steely lieutenant, Danny Huston is a slimy Nazi-by-another-name, Elena Anaya is her creepy henchwoman, and Lucy Davis plays the comic relief.\n\nThe movie uses the wartime setting to its advantage. No Man's Land becomes Diana Prince's debut as Wonder Woman. German infantry fight Amazons on horseback. Later the finale boils down to a god versus another god. And yes they use the Lasso of Truth. It's so cool! The timing of this movie couldn't be better. It works splendidly as a summer blockbuster at the very least. But it gives hope to female viewers young and old that women can be heroes too. It gives male viewers a chance to see a true ideal feminist hero in action. It also redresses for the mistakes made in the previous installments of the DCEU and honestly makes me more excited for Justice League"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it's finally here. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the more anticipated superhero releases of the last decade, which makes it all the more unfortunate that it had to play within the boundaries of the DC Extended Universe, of which it is the fourth entry. It should be stated up-front that while Wonder Woman is not quite good enough to affect the overall quality of the franchise in any meaningful way, it is certainly better than any of the three films preceding it. The DCEU is on a steady climb upwards; let's hope they don't plateau any time soon.\n\nOur framing device sees the Amazing Amazon, in modern-day Paris, receive a photograph from Batman, along with a note asking to one day hear her story. This story begins with her childhood on the Amazonian island Themyscira (there actually is a cute little Paradise Island reference in there, too), her development into a warrior princess and her eventual meeting with the pilot Steve Trevor, who crash-lands into the ocean nearby. After hearing about the Great War, Diana determines that Ares must be behind it and resolves to return to the world of mankind with Trevor in order to vanquish the God of War.\n\nThe fish-out-of-water elements work greatly, not only in terms of the larger cities and groups of people but also in more intimate settings between Diana and Trevor. The clash of cultures is as thought- provoking as it is hilarious, and these scenes were a great way to let the audience catch a breath between action sequences without getting bored.\n\nBecause boring, this film is not. At times it can be frustrating, illogical, incoherent and just plain sloppy, but it's never boring. An example of the sloppiness can be found when Trevor refers to the War as \"The War to End All Wars\", before Diana and her mother exit the room and Diana says \"You heard him, mother! He called it 'A War Without End!'\". That's just lazy.\n\nThe CGI isn't great, and this is especially noticeable in a few scenes where someone falls or leaps from a great height. There's one particularly glaring example where a character is shot in slow- motion, and it's not at all convincing. The music was good, though I was a little disappointed that Wonder Woman's main theme from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was used so sparingly. I actually thought that was a big highlight of that movie's score, and was hoping to hear it play over the more badass moments (like when Wonder Woman fights a bunch of bad guys with her lasso; that was excellent!)\n\nWhere it all fell apart more for me was towards the end. Wonder Woman is sure that Ares is behind the Great War, while Trevor insists that mankind just sucks. Let it suffice to say that the filmmakers attempt to have it both ways, and the result makes little sense. There is also a stupidly pointless death that completely took me out of the film.\n\nAnd so, while it's not a bad movie, the DCEU is still yet to give us a good one. Wonder Woman is probably on par with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the rival MCU's latest film, so at this stage it appears that Fox's Logan is, for now, still the best superhero film of the year. If the DCEU follows its current trend, though, November's Justice League should be an enjoyable watch.\n\nOh, and Wonder Woman is also apparently telekinetic, now, stopping metal with her mind. Considering she already has her bracelets and shockwaves to accomplish the same feat, this felt out of place.\n\nhttp://alexfalzon.com/wonder-woman/ - for more reviews."

It has comedy (Not stupid jokes in the middle of action scenes like marvel). The jokes fit in the plot. The action scenes are way better than in the other DC movies (Of course not including TDK series). Especially the scenes where the Wonder woman Theme plays in the background. Those scenes gave me goosebumps. The visual effects are stunning which makes it a crime to watch this movie in 2D. After watching this movie we can expect some more good movies from DC. Acting by Gal Gadot is awesome. If you have watched other movies in DC like 'Suicide squad' and are in an opinion that there will be no more good movies from DC, this movie will change that opinion entirely."

        "review_title": "\"Wonder Woman\"- Not only the first truly good film for the DCEU, but just a darned fun movie on its own right!",
        "review_detailed_main": "If there was one thought to streak across my mind throughout the entire run-time of director Patty Jenkins' long-awaited cinematic adaptation of the iconic comic-book character \"Wonder Woman\", it's a simple word... redemption. This is the first film in DC's struggling Extended Universe to live up to the promise of its comic-book origins. There have been hints at brilliance here and there, but the three previously released films have all ultimately faltered and fallen flat due to their own numerous issues and contrivances and infuriating focus on convoluted style over substance. Not so with \"Wonder Woman\"... this is the first film in the entire series that places all of it's focus on delivering a charming, thrilling and entertaining film foremost, where the style is dictated by the story, and not the other way around.\n\nIf you've grown tired of waiting for the next great DC cinematic adventure. If like me and many others, previous releases like \"Batman V Superman\" and \"Suicide Squad\" left you feeling empty and angry and underwhelmed. If you were worried that the DCEU would just be a constant exercise in misery and tedium... your hopes for something better- something good- have been fulfilled with the absolutely delightful \"Wonder Woman.\" It's not a perfect film, mind you. It's uneven at times and suffers the same one-dimensional villains that have plagued the similar Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it is a promise of better things to come in the future, and is not only by and far the best the DCEU has to offer at this point... it's just a darned good film in its own right.\n\nOn the island of Themyscira, Diana (Gal Gadot) lives in peace, princess of a tribe of Amazon warriors created by the great Greek Gods to protect humanity from the clutches of Ares- God of War. However, the human world soon enough intrudes on Diana's idyllic life when American Spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands near her home and she and the other Amazon warriors are told of the \"Great War\" that is taking place- World War I. Diana goes against her mother's wishes and leaves the island with Steve, hoping that in helping him on his mission to stop a deadly chemical attack by the German army, she will be able to confront Ares and put an end to all war. But at what cost will her daring mission come?\n\nThe great success of \"Wonder Woman\" comes in large part from its simplicity and keen storytelling. It doesn't venture into needlessly lofty and overstuffed (and half-baked) themes and sequel-baiting as has been the case with previous installments of the DC franchise, but instead just tries its hardest to be a competent, concise and entertaining origin story. And that's why it succeeds. Director Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg smartly concentrate on the fundamentals of character establishment and development above all else, while also giving the film a great deal more personality than has been evident in previous films. With razor-sharp writing, top-notch action set pieces and a constant and appropriate sense of humor that keeps the chuckles coming, you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself grinning ear-to- ear throughout the entire film.\n\nThe cast is also just a ton of fun. Gadot was by and far the best element in the otherwise sloppy \"Batman V Superman\", but she wasn't given much to do. Here, she absolutely shines and proves herself more than worthy to call herself \"Wonder Woman.\" She's got the dramatic chops to handle the heavier moments, the light-hearted whimsy to perfectly land the film's many delightful \"fish out of water\" gags... and she just kicks major butt! I can't wait to see her again on the big-screen. I also quite enjoyed Pine in his supporting role. It's a bit of a standard character, but he gives it the same wonderful personality he's injected to so many other roles. And supporting parts played by the likes of Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen and Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui are all exceptionally well-cast and performed.\n\nThis praise all being said, the film does have some rather large issues that I feel are being generally overlooked. Especially with the film being as hyped up and over-politicized as it has been. Funnily enough, the film suffers a major issue that also desperately plagues many films of their rival studio Marvel- the villains are weak. Pathetic even. Despite having the delightful duo of Danny Huston and Elena Anaya portraying them, the villainous Erich Ludendorff and \"Doctor Poison\" are frankly laughable at times, coming off as so stock as to be ridiculous. At times they even feel like they're in a completely different (and far inferior) film. I know I can't be the only one to cringe when they repeatedly use the old trope of \"villain kills an associate to show he's a threat\" several times to increasingly hilarious results. In addition, the film is a bit uneven as it reaches its midway point, with several key characters from the first act seemingly vanishing and some plot-threads being abandoned for prolonged periods of time. It's a bit distracting. You know the film is capable of so much more.\n\nBut despite these complaints, I can't help but whole-heartedly recommend \"Wonder Woman.\" It's just such a breath of fresh air for this particular franchise thanks to its smart filmmaking and fantastic performances. I was worried before the film came out. Because I will fully admit I have not enjoyed a single other film in the DC Extended Universe to this point, and I was fearing that \"Wonder Woman\" would deal one last fatal blow to the franchise. But it did just the opposite... it revitalized it in the best of ways. And I would favorably compare it to other great superhero origins of the past 10 years, and say it's one of my favorite Summer action films of 2017 thus far.\n\n\"Wonder Woman\" gets a very good 8 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems.\n\nBut just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the \"third wave of feminism\", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as \"horny\", dumb, \"needlessly\" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the \"crashed pilot\") who I'd dare to call a \"token man\" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.\n\njust to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as \"dangerous\". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie \"Batman Vs Superman\", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended.\n\nTo conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.\n\nFinal verdict: watchable, but don't believe the hype. It's not \"that\" good."

All was well in her place when one day she came in contact with an air fighter and knows that there is more in this world than her place so she goes forward to fulfill her destiny.\n\nThe story line was excellent the perfect plot executed really well. Maybe a little lengthy in some places but it was compromised with all those funny lines. At the beginning I was hesitant to watch this movie after my horrible experience with Batman vs Superman but this turned out to be excellent. While seeing this movie I forgot it was a DC movie felt more like it was a Marvel movie because usually a Marvel movie turns out to be so good. The ending of the movie was unpredictable and good. Gal Gadot did a perfect job as the wonder woman hats off to her. Looking forward to the DC movie Justice league with great expectations.\n\nYes I would recommend everyone to watch this movie do not miss this.\n\nNotable Acting\n\nGal Gadot famous for her acting in Batman vs Superman, Furious 7 and many more.\n\nChris Pine famous for his acting in the Star Trek series and many more.\n\nRobin Wright famous for her acting in the movie Forrest Gump and many more.\n\nConnie Nielsen famous for her acting in the movie the Gladiator and many more.\n\nMy Rating 10/10"

        "review_title": "Not a movie for the boys",
        "review_detailed_main": "Interesting reading the comments for this movie. I would guess that most of the negative \"reviews\" are from males in the 18-to-28-year-old demographic who have been weaned on the vast catalogue of male-dominated action-hero films and the increasingly violent video games of the last couple of decades. I suspect also that these \"reviewers\" are not so much disappointed with the movie but more likely threatened by the idea of a woman - and an exceptionally attractive one at that - being the heroine.\n\nAs a male in my 50s, and one who grew up with hundreds of comic books - Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, etc - this movie is far closer to my idea of how WW should be treated that certainly the 80s eye-candy that was the TV show. I mean, what do you boys want?!\n\nAside from the odd movie like \"Kill Bill\" and \"Lara Croft\", I can't think of many others where a woman gets to play the hero centre-stage. Yes, there are many flaws with the movie - if you want to nit-pick every single stupid little thing - and guess what? This applies to practically every movie out there. But the fight sequences alone - the choreography and the fact that you can actually see the action (not close-in shots to mask the inadequacy of the actors/directors) - make the movie well worth it.\n\nThe boys that rate this movie negatively would probably have been far happier with a male director (instead of female), one who perhaps wouldn't have given Gal Gadot as much breadth to threaten the male-dominated super-hero world.\n\nThis movie is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly confusing and overdone series of super-hero universes. I would love to see a version with a script written by a woman.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie yet, and as with any movie anyway, ignore the negative criticism and make your own mind up. I have four daughters and they loved (most of) this movie, and actually found it inspirational. These days, and in this world, anything that inspires my girls gets my nod. Good job, Gal."

But not only did this exceed expectations, but it also SAVED its franchise from destruction.\n\nWonder Woman is not only the best superhero movie of the year by far, but it's also the best female-led superhero movie out there. Thanks to several strengths, it's elevated by powerful writing that tells an engaging story, master-class visual effects, engaging action scenes, a cast of likable characters, and a positive message of female empowerment that actually WORKS. My best recommendation is that this is one of those films any superhero fan will enjoy, but this could also be for those who want something with good female empowerment in their lives. Just to give something good other than the crap we've gotten from 2017. Well, now Wonder Woman got her movie, now we just have to wonder who's next."

        "review_detailed_main": "What were Warner Bros and DC comics smoking when they decided to make Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad? Or what were they smoking when they decided to release Wonder Woman (WW) before Justice League?\n\nWhatever they were smoking, the latter was the better stuff because the only word I can think off describing this movie is fantastic !! Yup !!\n\nThe previous two releases with huge star casts and big budget action sequences were to be told in truth plain boring. WW is like the monsoon in India, refreshing and entertaining.\n\nTo be frank, there is nothing new in WW if you scratch the surface. It is the coming of age of person who has superpowers and fights a villain to protect the world, a sample template of all superhero films.\n\nBut WW is different because the superhero is a woman and that where Patty Jenkins and the writers catch our attention and surprise us. When was the last time we saw a movie completely dedicated to woman superhero??\n\nThey get most of things perfect from the word go. Amazons, the place where WW is born and belongs to is visually mind blowing and beautiful. The warrior women star cast is perfect with Nelson and Wright perfectly playing Diana's mother and aunt. Special mention to Wright who is terrific in action sequences inspite of her age.\n\nAnd then comes Chris Pine who is so happy to play second fiddle to WW. He is the catalyst and the wow factor for women audience. He and WW share a fabulous chemistry on screen and have some nice comic moments too.\n\nThe movie takes time to build up and the setting of WW One is prefect. And there is that one beautiful action set piece with WW taking on the Germans on the battlefield and single handedly destroying them. Perfect.\n\nAnd finally, there is Gal Gadot aka WW aka Diana. Gadot seems to have been born to play WW. She has the physique, the personality and the acting skills to play this role. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this part. She is breath taking in the action sequences and what we saw of her in Batman vs Superman was just a trailer. She owns this role.\n\nThe action sequences are good and the technically its a pretty neat film.\n\nHowever, the climax was tad disappointing and the villain was big let down. Thewlis is fine actor but not suited to play the villain. Plus the villain's role was poorly written. Even Dr. Maru's role was not well written and I hope to see more of her sometime in the future.\n\nBut its still a great film and a must watch for movie buffs. If you are a woman you will love it as its all about women empowerment. For men, watching Gadot in short skirts beating the hell out of the bad guys is fulfilling.\n\nCan't wait for the sequel. he he he."

        "review_detailed_main": "Right, well it was with some mixed anticipation that I went to watch \"Wonder Woman\" in the cinema this weekend. Why? Well, first of all, I am not overly keen on superhero movies, so I had no real incitement or drive for watching this. But then again, I had been told by several people that this was definitely an impressive movie, and one that was well worth the watch even for a non-superhero fan.\n\nI watched \"Wonder Woman\" in 3D in the cinema, which was completely pointless, because there were no outstanding or particularly impressive 3D scenes that made you go \"wow!\" So an ordinary 2D viewing of this movie is recommendable.\n\nI am somewhat familiar with Wonder Woman from the comic books that I read during my childhood, and also having seen a few episodes here and there from the mid-1970s TV show \"Wonder Woman\". So I didn't really have much of any expectations of what the movie had to deliver for it to be worthwhile.\n\nAnd I must say that I was actually impressed. For a superhero movie then \"Wonder Woman\" turned out to be at the higher end of the scale in terms of being entertaining and watchable.\n\nThis was definitely Gal Gadot's movie through and through, because she carried the movie so well with her performance as Diana. She has a very charismatic demeanor and her on-screen appearance just demands attention from the audience. So I think that she has been very well cast for the role of Wonder Woman, and I think it will actually be nice to see her again in upcoming superhero movies.\n\n\"Wonder Woman\" was a visual tour-de-force, and the special effects were impressive and worked very well in favor of the movie. Most of the time it felt like you were right there in the movie yourself, because of the believable special and visual effects. And it was an amazing visual experience to witness Diana run about on the World War II battlefield and take on the Nazis, especially when the scenes were spiced up by those impressive visual effects.\n\nAnd it should also be said that the camera work and cinematography in \"Wonder Woman\" really helped the movie to stand out as well. Lots of great visual presentation of the various scenes throughout the course of the entire movie.\n\nThe cast in the movie was good, and aside from Gal Gadot, then I was more than impressed with the performances put on by Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya. Danny Huston was great in the villainous role of Ludendorff, and Elena Anaya really nailed the role of Dr. Maru. It was a shame that the Dr. Maru character weren't given more on-screen time, because that character had a lot of potential and could have proved so much more effective had the writers opted for more focus on her. However, the casting of Chris Pine was puzzling to me, because he will forever be Associated with a substitute captain Kirk from the \"Star Trek\" reboots.\n\nThe characters found in the movie were well-rounded and quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. There was just about enough character development and growth for all characters to make them all matter and have importance to the storyline. However, some could have benefited more from having more on-screen time, of course.\n\nOne thing that failed, aside from the offbeat and misplaced attempts of comedy, was the fact that the German's didn't speak German. That small feat and detail brings so much flavor and believably to the movie. So I was puzzled why they hadn't opted for that kind of authenticity.\n\nThere were some misplaced attempts at bringing humor into the movie, which didn't sit well with me, and it stuck out like a sore thumb in comparison to the rest of the movie. For example, with the impressive feats and abilities that the Amazons showed, then why did Diana have such problems with a simple, rotating swing door? It was just a laughable attempt at comedy that should never have been in the final cut of the movie.\n\nI was genuinely entertained by \"Wonder Woman\", and I will say that director Patty Jenkins definitely stepped up to the task and delivered where it mattered and where it counted. Regardless of if you like superhero movies or not, then \"Wonder Woman\" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch."

Nonetheless, its a Superhero Movie!! and boy, it delivers on that front. Every Guy, Woman, Kids..Dammit Everyone needs to Watch this Movie. You will cry happy tears that one the most iconic Superheroes has made its Film Debut with such a Blast. Hats off to Patty Jenkins and co for delivering the Superhero Movie of the year (I am not kidding). Guess what, Marvel Fanboys are already at it, giving this Masterpiece Mediocre reviews. This Movie is not Mediocre, Its not even Good, ITS F'n GREAT!!! Even if you are not a fan of DCEU, you'll be flabbergasted, blown away, Rejoice in this Wonderful adventure of a Wonderful Woman!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The much anticipated new Wonder Woman movie is with us, and for once the film lives up to the wall-to-wall marketing hype.\n\nWith a heavy dose of mythology, Diana is growing up as the cossetted daughter of Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen, \"Gladiator\"), the Queen of the Amazons, on the hidden paradise island of Themyscira. Trained up as a warrior by Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright of \"House of Cards\"), Diana is clearly something special. Her ego is reinforced by the knowledge that she was made of clay with life breathed into her by the God Zeus.  It's enough to turn a girl's head!\n\nIt's 1917 and the man-free paradise is shaken up when an American spy by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine, \"Star Trek: Beyond\") crash- lands in the waters off Themyscira.  (And yes... you didn't mishear me... this film genuinely features a hero with both the names \"Steve\" and 'Trevor\"). Prince Eric - no, sorry, wrong film - is saved and awakened on the beach by Diana as the others arrive.  \"Thank God!\", say the Amazonians. \"At last, someone to process the 200 year backlog of washing and ironing\"!  \n\nBut Steve (an \"above average specimen\", LOL) is not long for paradise as he needs to return to the war with the results of his spy-work: a chemistry book stolen from the gorgeously deformed Dr Maru (Elena Anaya), gas-developer for the evil General Ludendorff (Danny Huston). Seeing Ludendorff to be her God-like nemesis Ares, Diana returns with Steve to the WW1 battlefields with the intent of killing the God of War and so ending the 'war to end all wars'.\n\nMuch 'fish out of water' fun is had with Diana meeting civilised London society, although perhaps this section of the film doesn't quite live up to its full potential:  having ice cream for the first time, without any sign of surprise, all she can come up with is an amusing but rather lame \"You must be very proud\".\n\nBut where the film really accelerates into awesomeness is when Diana reaches the trenches. She emerges from the trenches like some shimmering vision of hotness, to set male and lesbian hearts a flutter. Its the most memorable trench-exit since the finale of \"Black Adder 4\", and the subsequent scenes of Diana single-handedly facing the German guns is for me one of the most compelling and enjoyable scenes in any recent DC or Marvel movie.\n\nHolding all this together is the ex-Israeli army-trainer Gal Gadot in the title role. And man oh man, what a Gal! Statuesque, athletic but also sweet, charming and emotionally fragile she completely owns this role from beginning to end.  Gadot made a memorable entry in the otherwise poor \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" (#marthagate #neverforget #neverforgive) but nothing prepares you for just how great she is in this outing.\n\nChris Pine - the thinking women's Chris Pratt - once again proves himself as a talented actor who manages to successfully morph to inhabit the role he plays. Much as he did in the excellent \"Hell or High Water\", not once did I equate him to be James Tiberius Kirk after the first 5 minutes. \n\nEffective in supporting roles are David Thewlis (\"Harry Potter\") as a 'helpful' army bod and an almost unrecognisable Lucy Davis (\"The Office\") as Etta, Steve's comedic secretary.  Steve's rather unlikely sidekicks of Sameer (Said Taghmaoui, \"American Hustle\"), Charlie (Ewen Bremner, \"Trainspotting\") and 'The Chief' (Eugene Brave Rock \"The Revenant\") all rather fade into the woodwork by comparison. \n\nI saw the film in 3D (\"careful now... you could take an eye out with those things\") and very good it was too. Aside from some rather unnecessary Amazonian arrows, its never feels overdone, and elements of it were extremely effective.\n\nAnother star of the show is the superb Wonder Woman theme by Hans Zimmer, here rolled out by the film's composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable.\n\nThe film shifts into more traditional yawn-worthy 'superhero finale' mode in the last twenty minutes, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nPatty Jenkins (\"Monster\") directs and knows the audience she is aiming to please. One can only imagine the empowering impact this film will have on young girls, crossing their wrists and in their imagination casting terrorists into the hell that they should be consigned to. In this week of yet more Isis atrocity in London, Wonder Woman is a role- model we could all stand and salute: \"I believe in love\" too.\n\n(This is an abridged version of the One Mann's Movies graphical review.

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed so many people. As with most DC Comics films, this one was a great disappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even self-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, Wonder Woman was no exception to this rule.\n\nThe scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered on infantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-movie grade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything \u2014 it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.\n\nRegarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best, struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line \u2014 but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for its pretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy, lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.\n\nAgain, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "just back from my viewing this morning (it is opened 30/5 here i n HK). I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie. First of all, still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening ( always a bad sign). Few users' reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL. And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie ( will get back to this on the latter part), my heart dropped dead.\n\nForgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film, i could say i should never saw those evil, brutal 1 star users' \"what to say\". This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!! Those good reviews are no lie at all. Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS. This movie elevates that into another level!! The story really give depth to the character, Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women. The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero film.\n\nInevitably, people do compare this to those Marvel works. For me, Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1 & Captain America 2 winder solider. And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel, that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool. i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs, they are always entertaining and action packed, but that's all, they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth. Except Ironman 1, CA2 or maybe civil war, i don't really think other Marvels are really that great, some are even not good to me (i.e. Thor, IM3..). DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart, it will give u something meaningful to ponder on....WonderWomen's backstory is set on the WW1, the darkest moment for the humanity. it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world. The story is so compelling.\n\nTo those people who could rate movie at 1 star. i mean how could you do that just because you don't like it or simply you are fan of Marvel. We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formula."

Its acting, its direction, its effects, its story and dialogue, everything. And in this case, it made me feel amazing. It reached inside of me and made my heart feel warm and strong.

And yes, this was sort of what I was hoping and expecting 1984 to be like, or at least be more like.\n\nAs far as the comic book genre goes, in my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece. It truly is. It was everything it could possibly be, and maybe a little bit more. Every scene was perfect with only a couple exceptions. There is beauty, symbolism, depth, and good acting at every main part. It even had some really funny scenes sprinkled in that were unexpected.\n\nAlthough the action scenes toward the end were a little bit cliche, they were necessary to the story and still differentiated themselves for some uniqueness, which is all you can ask for in that setting.\n\nThis is the movie I wanted and hoped for out of WW 1984. I'm glad the disappointment with that led me to finally watch this. It was way better than expected.\n\n9/10 (rounded up due to being underrated as it should be at least a 7.8-7.9 on here total if not more)."

The direction from Petty Jenkins works well, the pace builds after a nice set up, it looks great and the WW1 setting gives the plot some depth and context. The main villain at the end could have been better but that's a small gripe. This is Fun, inspiring, exciting, emotional and entertaining. One of the best super hero movies for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman was not created by Aphrodite or Zeus, but was rather the brain-child of a controversial psychologist and inventor, William Moulton Marston. (Marston's other claim to fame is the invention of the lie detector.) Although Superman and Batman were selling well to kids, there was a wave of pseudo-psychology which claimed that comic books were poisoning the minds of impressionable youths. Detective Comics (later renamed DC) were frightened that these radical groups were influencing the voting public which might hire lawmakers to ban comic books altogether. DC hired Marston to address this problem. Rather than changing existing comic books, Marston offered an unexpected solution: make a female superhero, i.e. a super-heroine. The result was Wonder Woman.\n\nLittle did DC comics know Marston had been involved in the early suffragette and birth-control movements of the early 20th century, and he incorporated much of the iconography and symbolism into the comic book. Wonder Woman's looks was originally a hybrid of the Varga pin-up girl posters of the 1940's and Suffragettes of the early 20th century. For example, Wonder Woman's early adventures often involved her being chained, an icon used by feminists and suffragettes in the early 20th century in propaganda posters and political illustrations. When chained, Wonder Woman loses her powers. Her magic lasso compels the person being lassoed to tell the truth, an obvious reference to Marston's lie detector. The comic was an instant hit and even became iconic for the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970's.\n\nFast-forward to 2017. Patty Jenkins has directed an outstanding film on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs based on the DC Comics character. Starring Gal Gadot as the title character and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, this superhero action film flies as fusing of Ancient mythology and human history, and the offering is one of the best of the genre since the original \"Superman\" film starring Christopher Reeve (1979). Like \"Superman\", \"Wonder Woman\" begins with the backstory of the title character. Her name is Diana, daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nelson) and she lives on Paradise Island where only women reside whose culture is a throw-back to Ancient Greek mythology. (Paradise because there are no men to screw things up...?) Diana as a youth is taught by the best combat teacher of the island, General Antiope (Robin Wright) in the ways of combat and becomes the best among her peers.\n\nSticking to the origins, Captain Steve Trevor, an American spy working for the British, is being chased by Germans during the First World War and crashes off the coast of Paradise Island. He has in his possession plans written by Dr. Poison (a real character from DC Comics). After a confrontation between Amazons and the Germans, Trevor is taken in by the Amazons and forced to reveal who and what he is. Eventually, Diana decides she must go with Trevor back to \"the world of men\" and help stop the war. Her reasons are mythological in which she must stop the \"God of War\". Of course Trevor doesn't buy into Diana's myth story but plays along to get back to the war. They sail by boat back to London.\n\nOne of the best sequences is Diana's introduction to early 20th century society. Gadot offers an excellent performance as the slightly culture-shocked fish-out-of-water but never overplays it. She tries on a pouffe dress which definitely wouldn't be \"Wonder Woman\". Eventually, she dons a suitable outfit and signs onto a mission with Trevor and several marginal characters to stop a fatal gas attack which makes the mustard gas of the war seem like the steam from a sauna. The inventor is Doctor Isabel Maru, a.k.a. Dr. Poison who has been supported by General Ludendorff. (In fact Ludendorff was a real general in the First World War and was involved in Hitler's so-called Beer Hall Putsch to overthrow the German government in 1923.) The mission is not sanctioned by the war office of London but in secret with only one member of Parliament offering assistance, Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis). This merry band of misfits, a woman who knows nothing about western society and culture, a Scottish drunk, a Native American pacifist, an Italian actor, and an American spy make their way to the front lines of the First World War.\n\nAn outstanding film all around with excellent performances and a good balance between story and action. The filmmakers made the decision to withhold Diana becoming \"Wonder Woman\" until nearly half-way into the film, similar to \"Superman\". One of the best decisions: she never says \"I'm Wonder Woman\". A superhero speaking his or her name is a fatal screenplay error made by many other screenwriters who shall remain nameless."

As a life-long WW fan, I had high hopes going in, and while there is some clunkiness for sure in the movie (the CGI at the end, for instance), Gadot's charisma makes up for it in spades.\n\nTwo other stand-out performances are from Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta and Robin Wright as Antiope. Wright especially takes what she's given in the role and makes the most of it, I found myself wanting to spend way more time with her Antiope.\n\nI'm thankful that Patty Jenkins gifted us with a Wonder Woman that my daughter can look up to, the way I looked up to Superman when I was a kid. Thank you for this!"

        "review_title": "The Latest Adaptation of the Powerful Female DC Superhero",
        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I think this was a rather different type of DC superheroes movies. This one was felt as a combination of fun and a little bit dark altogether. This movie was telling the origin of Wonder Woman and I think it was told in a very nice way. The earlier part showing Diana since her childhood was quite nice to see. What I loved the most was actually the moment when Diana went to London for the very first time. It was truly fun to see the naivety of her in the \"man's world\" and I think Gal Gadot's portrayal in these scenes were very spot on.\n\nWhat I loved about this movie was also the way Diana evolved from the innocent Amazon woman to what she became at the end. I believe the duration of the movie was just nice even though it was a little bit over than 2 hours. Some might feel it was too long at the beginning but it should not be considered as a flaw. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. I know she was touched during those emotional moments and I know she loved Gal Gadot portraying Wonder Woman.\n\nChris Pine was charming as Steve Rogers and his chemistry with Gal Gadot seemed very nice. The awkward moments during their trip back to London were very fun to see as well. Steve's allies particularly Sameer was the stand out one. Apart from the fun part, there were also some dark moments and emotional moments as well, reminding us that DC superhero adaptation movies would always have dark tone, but it was not as dark as the other earlier movies. Those of you who prefer lighter tone would definitely be able to enjoy this.\n\nThis movie was directed by Patty Jenkins who had just 1 movie to her credit prior to this one, albeit a very highly critically acclaimed one titled Monster (with its main cast Charlize Theron won the Golden Globe and Academy Awards). It was a surprise to me that she was able to make the action sequence looked very cool. The special effects was wonderful. The fight scenes were nice. The sound effects were great, especially since I saw this in a theater with Dolby Atmos sound system. The dramatic, emotional, fun scenes were nicely done by Jenkins. All around I think she did a wonderful job directing this movie and hopefully it would bring more audiences to flock the theaters.\n\nFor those who are expecting to see post-credit scene, be informed that this one did not have any, just like in Batman VS Superman: Dawn of Justice. I guess they did not really want to be seen just like any other Marvel movies? (Although there was some brief mid-credit scene in Suicide Squad).\n\nIn conclusion, I believe this one was a wonderful superhero movie from DC comics. Not since Elektra in 2005 that a female superhero became the lead of a movie based on comic books. Not even Marvel had it in the Marvel cinematic universe. Perhaps after this, they would be making an independent movie of Black Widow?\n\nAnyway, for those of you who prefer Marvel comics movies compared to DC comics movies due to their lighter tones, I think this one would surprise you. For those who are die hard fans of DC comics, I am sure you would be coming to see this one anyway. But for those who just enjoy the movies adapted from any comic books, you should be able to enjoy this one. Just watch this and you would understand what I meant.\n\nFor my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

Even though Gal Gadot's acting isn't stellar in my opinion, I think she's really charming and fit the roll nicely. I watched this in a history through film class for WWI, so we looked at comparisons during the battle scenes with gases, trenches, etc. Although their isn't a magical pill you break open to give you super-human strength in real life, some of the other stuff was pretty accurate. I haven't seen other work directed by Patty Jenkins, but I'm hoping the next Wonder Woman installment will be just as good."

As she fights the Great War, she inspires humanity to rise up and be their better selves but is eventually confronted with the fact that humanity is not the essentially good brotherhood she thought it was and Ares' influence is far more devious and subtle as well.\n\nThe questions at the heart of this film are \"Will Diana despair when faced with reality,\" and \"Is humanity, with all it's dark impulses, worth saving. This struggle is so much more relatable than watching Superman try to beat up another strongman who is going to enslave humanity.\n\nDiana empathizes with dying soldier's and comes to the rescue of small villages instead of flying past dying civilians and toppling building by throwing bad guys into them. She sees how evil men can be and is brokenhearted, not angered. She is a hero that wants to end war, not wage it."

So going in I was excited but also realistic, in that I try to not have my expectation too high.\n\nAnd boy I was not disappointed, I had an absolute blast watching it. The action is amazing, the shots were beautifully shot and directed. The highlight of the film is of course Gal Gadot and Chris Pines who both owned the roles of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Even the supporting cast provided some great humor and depth, it really made me care about each characters.\n\nThe only gripe I had was there was some disappointment with the antagonist. The antagonist is not bad in anyway, in fact the antagonist is visually cool looking, but I realize that the antagonist is not the best villain, good but just disappointed.\n\nAll in all, it is easily one of the best blockbuster films this year, had an amazing time. So go out and watch it, you'll sure find something entertaining out of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The DCEU wasn't doing so well in its first few movies because it was definitely lacking some preparation, but with the release of Wonder Woman that universe seemed to have a lifeline. This film is very different from what we usually see within the superhero subgenre. The first two acts are wonderful, especially after leaving Themyscira and in the trenches scene. The choreographies are incredible, the photography is good, it has an interesting direction. However, from this moment on, the film begins to deteriorate a lot. The third act is boring, it's tiring and it doesn't seem to be the same movie anymore since the pace of it was great. For an hour and a half it tried to be different only to end up being a generic superhero battle. It never had anything so different from other films in general, but within the subgenre it managed to work something new and it worked very well, unfortunately the third act pulls the film down."

Like they KNOW we are that dumb and will just take it up. The story was god awful, stupid even by superhero comic standards and the acting was atrocious.\n\nThere was literally ZERO character development for any of them. No depth. It just all was whipped along as if for the sake of completing the movie. None of the characters were likable and relatable on a psychological level. Comic relief was forced and did not make us laugh. Watching Diana do her innocent act was totally unbelievable and as fake as it can get.\n\nI fell asleep. My girlfriend well asleep and my friend who is generally very tolerating of dumb movies EVEN he fell asleep.\n\nBut that's okay, not a lot of movies are necessarily good. But what breaks my heart and trust in the movie world is that this is getting so much attention and respect with a stellar rating. It's an insult to some of the other gems people have produced to see films like these get ratings similar to theirs."

Wonder Woman is only .4 ahead of it. That's a crying shame.\n\nGal Gadot NAILS this character. Her strength, her courage of conviction.. it gives me goosebumps when I think of certain scenes and how righteous and powerful she is. Chris Pine is also great, and the chemistry between him and Gadot is charming, well-done, and so well-written. Some of the CGI is spotty, but there are some beautiful sequences as well (such as when her mother is teaching her their history).\n\nThe third act, and the fight with Aries borders on 'meh'. I also thought the cast of misfit soldiers was kind of annoying at times, and also why did they attend that party in that castle? That whole part where they passed high-level German security with bad German accents was very ridiculous.\n\nBut overall, the movie is actually a fun experience. It makes you feel things. When WW goes \"over the top\" of the trenches with her shield, I literally raised my fist in the air and cried 'yes!' (I'm a guy btw).\n\nI have watched WW three times and will gladly watch it again. I saw Captain Marvel recently and will NEVER watch it again. Wonder Woman is an excellent example of a female-led superhero movie done more-than-mostly right, CM is flat, dull, uninspired, and deserves a 3/10, not 7."

They strike me as philosophically superficial Bayesque things.\n\nFor most of its running time, WW is about characters, who have well-considered philosophical positions. There's no rubbing your nose in those positions, but they're consistent.\n\nThe absolute strength of WW is in its writing. Which isn't to say that any other bits are bad-- the acting is certainly adequate, although it is a a super-hero flick, not Osage August Count, so the bar is not that high. The direction and editing are fine, and where they fail, it's due to trying to be original, rather than trying to be the same as everything else-- even its directorial failures are a plus in my book.\n\nWW doesn't try to be anything particularly amazing. It's just a superhero movie. Eventually, it turns into boring action for its own sake. But \"eventually\" puts it miles beyond every other superhero movie I've ever seen. Meanwhile, before it gets there, it manages to be smarter than any other superhero flick I've seen."

In 1941, they created the character \"Wonder Woman\" for publisher DC Comics. The role model was their young, polyamorous life partner. In a magazine interview, William Marston stated that the couple wanted to produce an alternative to the then popular (male) superheroes.\n\nRight from the beginning \"Wonder Woman\" appeared on many different media platforms. TV shows, radio programs, video games and a couple of action movies have all, on various occasions, hosted her shenanigans. The gal has also been featured in contemporary artwork on a regular basis. Most famously in pieces by American so-called \"pop artists\". Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, to name just a few.\n\nWarner Brothers started to plan for a new \"Wonder Woman\" movie at the beginning of 1996. But, after failing to come up with a workable screenplay, the entire project got stuck in development hell. The intended picture was finally abandoned in 2002.\n\nBut, never say never. In 2015, Warners decided to put \"Wonder Woman\" back on the silver screen again. And this time the studio executives decided that they wanted a female director. Patty Jenkins, who just a few years earlier had directed \"Monster\" with Charlize Theron, seemed to be the right woman for the job. Especially considering that picture's great artistic and commercial success.\n\nAlthough the film was not aimed exclusively at young women, the marketing department at Warnes realized that this demographic could constitute an important target group. So, a few weeks before the premiere, a promo for the movie was released during the season finale of the TV-series \"Supergirl\". And it worked. \"Wonder Woman\" turned out to be the highest-grossing film of any female director ever."

You'll have an entertaining evening. If you expect it to the of the same level of the batman trilogy, you might expect too much and will probably be disappointed.\n\nSeriously, I really don't get the bad reviews"

        "review_detailed_main": "The best of the DC Universe in my opinion, the beginning is perfect, the humor is so good because it is not forced it came with the situation and the character I love how Diana sees and understands the world is a vision so innocent but so energetic, powerful that is contagious and makes you love the character, has so many moments of characters retrospection so well developed. It is not afraid to be cheesy so it came out as honest, for me it is the problem I have with superhero movies they want to get away from the good, selfless, noble hero because they are aparently 'cheesy' so superheros movies for me don't seem honest but parodies or so dark that they are depressing. This is what I want to see in a superhero movie, the scene of no man's land made me feel in a way that I have no words to define it... it was EPIC.\n\nBut I think it's a shame that the end has broken the rhythm, I think Dr Maru is one of the most mysterious and interesting villains whose potential is wasted to make way for a plot twist and another of the final CGI battles that DC abuses. The movie had a very clear message that at the end i don't know why they decides to destroy it making the story a bit inconsistent for me."

He tried, but the script was not written in favor of him, obviously. It seemed they forgot how important an interesting enemy is, especially for comicbook adaptions/superhero movies.

        "review_detailed_main": "The director of the movie \"Wonder Woman\" Patty Jenkins selected Gal Gadot cause she had been in action movies aside from Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot has a notion about the environment that has to be used in this kind of movies. Nowadays DC movie saga has two movies of Wonder Woman. The first movie WAS released in movie theaters in 1974 and the last adaptation was made in 2017. The last is one of the movies with better quality where a woman is the star character.\n\nGal Gadot developing her role as hero who previously and during the movie had trained Kung-fu, boxing, handling of swords and brazilian jiu-jitsu. Wonder Woman is called Diana and she lives in a island with just women all of them are called amazon. She has never gone away the island, aside her mother does not let her explore it. That island cannot be seen by anyone unless you be into. Diana is daughter of gods and her mother is the queen of the island.\n\nThe environment of the movie is besieged on the First World War that happened in 1914 until 1918. Gal Gadot as Diana is what I like more cause the script that gave her fits her very well, It is worth mentioning that her skin and clothes make her look like a goddess of lightning. Wonder Woman always gets victorious, obviously not at first trying but with faculty and strength she wins. This is a movie that has been made to watch and watch again, simply one of the best actions movies I have seen.\n\nThis is a fictional movie but also tackles real problems and real events that happened in the world, as I have said, but in this adaptation combining Wonder Woman with the First World War, one of the main problems in the movie is Ares, the demon who started the war and as Diana, he has special abilities. For all lovers of action movies and DC comics or movies, mainly women I totally recommend watching Wonder Woman."

I think it's a wonderfully done movie, pun intended.\n\nWarning though, stop with the first WW movie. I sincerely wish I had not watched WW84, so horrible it tarnishes the enjoyment I got from the first WW. Ugg.\n\nThink I'll rewatch the first Wonder Woman to try and forget WW84 ever existed."

Whatever some may think, Gal Gadot is a perfect cast, because she is brilliant and her charisma shines through the screen: both fragile and strong, tender and caring, but ready to fight the evil that men do. Looking forward to seeing The Amazon Princess again in 'Wonder Woman 1984' as soon as the coronavirus pandemic no longer prevents its global release."

        "review_detailed_main": "With the proper introduction of the Man of Steel, with the new older summer of Batman and the anti-heroes who are part of the Suicide Squad, we can finally enjoy a movie of Wonder Woman, the most powerful heroine in the DC universe. After being introduced to the general public in cinemas in \"Batman vc Superman\" that already gave us a very good idea of who the character was and what she was capable of doing and now, the wait is finally over. To bring this super powerful woman to the screen, she was called Patty Jenkins, who does not have as many jobs on her resume, but who became known worldwide for directing Monster (2003) that gave the Oscar for Best Actress to Charlize Theron for playing Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who becomes the first serial killer woman in history. One of the great strengths of the production is the script by Allan Heinberg - egress from TV series like \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Sex and The City\" - which builds a script with many merits, respecting the origin story of Wonder Woman bringing to it highlights several other aspects. Setting the plot at the end of the First World War, the script manages to present aspects of the behavior and customs of society from the beginning of the 20th century, and issues related to the power of those who are in charge of nations, political decisions, all still permeated with gods and legends. mythological, as well as dilemmas of whether or not humanity deserves to be protected by the Amazon. The film begins today, after the events of 'Batman v Superman - Origin of Justice', and shows Diana Prince, who works in the Antiques Department of the Louvre, receiving a World War I photograph from his mail sent by Wayne Enterprises, when you start to remember your past. So we are transported to the beginning of the 20th century, when we see little Diana, who has always wanted to train with the other Azones, but who was prevented by her mother Hippolyta, who hid her father's identity from Diana, thought she you shouldn't worry about that in times and peace and that you should play like a child and not fight. Over time, Hippolyta is convinced by Antiope and Diana then starts to train more than any other Amazon. When pilot Steve Trevor crashes on his plane and is rescued by Diana, all Amazons learn about the dangers that surround the isolated Paradise Island in the world of men. These first forty minutes of the plot are dedicated to telling Diana's childhood, showing how life is on Paradise Island, and better setting the viewer in Greek-Roman legends. With Diana's departure with Steve, it is interesting to note Diana's still naive gaze on humanity, especially in a time of war. The contrast of this naivete in her eyes with that of the experienced pilot and spy Steve is when we realize that she was there embarking on a transformative journey towards London where her beliefs would be confronted. In fact, arriving in the English capital, more aspects of this naivety in relation to the customs of society are understandable and a highlight of the film alongside Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), Steve's secretary. While Diana was born and raised trained to be a warrior, she does not understand the use of dresses, fashion, etc. Even going through a revolving door in your new outfits and a sword becomes a hilarious challenge and trying ice cream for the first time becomes a unique experience. There is also time to be impressed by man-made weapons to kill people. Even the struggle for the right to vote - which would only be won years later - is cited as a criticism of society at the time. The same criticism used later when Diana enters a military audience where only men are allowed. And what about Diana confronting the coldness of political decision and calling the general a coward for allowing soldiers to die on the front lines of battles? Just what we expect from the character. The best of \"Wonder Woman\" is due to this meeting of two peoples: Diana's, composed only by women; and ours, where women had (still have) fewer rights and opportunities than men. The script is fanciful in scenes where the current machismo is ridiculed with pleasure by the protagonist. The script uses the entire first half of the plot to insert Diana into the world of men and develops the character in a slow, careful and skillful way. And from the final half, Diana is able to show her skills to humans, with special emphasis on the scenes when the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are interrupted by enemy machine guns, but Diana leaves alone in the middle of no-man's-land and gathers allied forces behind it to free the village of Veld. The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces The script uses the entire first half of the plot to insert Diana into the world of men and develops the character in a slow, careful and skillful way. And from the final half, Diana is able to show her skills to humans, with special emphasis on the scenes when the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are interrupted by enemy machine guns, but Diana leaves alone in the middle of no-man's-land and gathers allied forces behind it to free the village of Veld. The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces several German soldiers to the sound of the heroine's theme song. In the final stretch, there are also the excellent action sequences with Diana's fight with Ludendorff and, especially afterwards, against another unexpected villain amidst many destructions, shots and explosions. One of the highlights of the film is the relationship between Diana and Steve and that was essential for the film to work. Since Diana rescued him from the sea, we have noticed a sexual tension between them. The complicity between the two only grows over the two hours of projection and makes us cheer for the couple at all times. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is evident and the scene in which he teaches her to dance under the snow and then go to the bedroom and surrender to the love they feel for each other is the culmination of the couple's relationship building. It is in Steve that she knows love and better understands the human action. Humanity's decision is the cause of war and violence, but humanity is also much more than that. It is a humanity capable of loving and that deserves another opportunity. It is also worth highlighting the duo that leave with Diana and Steve to destroy another arms factory together with Ludendorff and Maru. Spy Sameer (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), excellent sniper Charlie (Ewen Bremner). If most of the film builds an exciting film in both visual and narrative, the ending, despite having twists and turns, cannot escape much of the concept of elevating action at the expense of coherence. They are minutes of much noise for nothing, without any direct contribution to the lesson that the heroine needed to learn about humanity. These are moments when the director changes the retro look and uses more practical effects for a more obscure and full of green screen effects. The production of the film also deserves all the praise. Production designer Aline Bonetto, photography by Matthew Jensen are incredible in perfectly setting the time of the First World War in both sets and costumes. It is a war movie with the presence of a superhero, making everything more real and believable even with all the fantastical aspects that involve the origin of the heroine. The soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams is sensational. The composer mixes action themes very well, using the character's theme music very well in moments when he detonates his enemies and also several stretches of pure emotion in the midst of the climate of war. In the post-credits we still have the Australian singer Sia, who wrote a song for the film, entitled \"To Be Human\", with the English musician Labrinth, who is also on the soundtrack. 'Wonder Woman' is a film with excellent production, with a first script and that works thanks to the direction of Patty Jenkins and the scenic presence of Gal Gadot. The choice of the dietician is not only for the symbology of a woman directing a film of a female protagonist in an action film but, consequently, also for being the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist in Hollywood. Just to abuse the clich\u00e9s of films of the genre such as slow cameras and camera turns in the beating scenes, the scenarios where these scenes take place end up differentiating the film from so many others of the genre. The Israeli actress, on the other hand, manages to pass the still naive look of young Diana in the land of men, all her discoveries and dilemmas, which contrast very well with the wiser posture of the character of the first and last scenes of the projection. Diana was very well represented as a normal woman. A woman with very high values, but still a woman. It can be sensitive. She is smart and emotionally independent. She may be confused. She may lose her confidence or not. She's everything. She has a human heart. The actress exudes charisma, easily switching between the sweetness of a young woman discovering a world different from her own and the strength of a warrior who distributes tapas without losing her hairstyle. 'Wonder Woman' is the best film in DC's eccentric extended universe, a work of great quality, quite faithful to its original material, which was a box office success and which will certainly generate new sequences. It is a symbol for women and it came to break barriers and prejudices. It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times."

After Wonder Woman's appearance in Batman v Superman in 2016, she gets her own standalone film.\n\nIn keeping with the Justice League universe, the film has that dark and murky look. We get a long drawn out beginning of a young girl who is a descendant of a Greek god wishing to train to be a warrior despite her mother's resistance to the idea.\n\nWe then see a grown up Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot) who develops little muscular physique despite all her training with fellow warrior sisters on a mystical isolated island of Themyscira.\n\nWhen an an American pilot Steve (Chris Pine) crashes near this island followed by German soldiers, the Amazonians learn of an outside world where humans are engaged in a great war, the first world war. Diana leaves her island with Steve and goes to London with a desire to stop the war.\n\nSteve has found out about a German chemist called Dr Poison trying to develop chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless in a background of both sides to the war having peace talks. Diane believes that Ares, the god of war is responsible for the human misery caused by warfare.\n\nThe film improves once the action moves to London but there are problems with the story. It is weak, when a sinister German general is disposed off well before the end of the film, it just confirms that a certain character is going to be the big bad of the movie.\n\nSome of Steve's ragbag of associates who are there for camaraderie and comic relief are useless. A marksman who cannot shoot.\n\nThe film feels overlong and underwhelming. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief in Wonder Woman's acrobatic abilities as well parrying bullets with her wrist bands.\n\nGadot showed promise in her appearance in Batman v Superman last year, but carrying a film on her own exposed her limitations as an actress. Her range is limited and in many scenes she is just required to pose and replaced by CGI either in slow motion or sped up."

The story, characters, and setup are the best DC has offered since \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" One drawback, however, is DC's overreliance on CGI, which sometimes makes it hard to discern if we're still watching live action or a Pixar movie. Thankfully, these heavily CGI-laden scenes are brief, unlike \"Man of Steel,\" which prominently showcases its digital effects.\n\nDespite this, \"Wonder Woman\" remains a powerful and compelling film, easily becoming one of my favorite movies of the summer. Its widespread appeal is evident from the moment the film begins. The story is focused and engaging, making it enjoyable even for those who aren't die-hard DC fans. I highly recommend this movie; even if you don't love it as much as I did, you'll at least find it entertaining and worth the watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Wonder Woman\" is the answer to the DC universe's prayers. It focuses on telling a story without trying to be edgy/trendy. It takes its time to develop Diana, as well as the world around her. As the film progresses, you see her grow into the character she was destined to be as she breaks past her naive perspective on how the world and the humans within it work, and it was nice to see a basic super hero flick with some depth. Most of the action sequences are polished and entertaining, but sometimes they bring a touch of reality to a scene, and play an integral part to her growth. Sadly the climax turns into the usual, with a villain encounter that undermines what the film was trying to accomplish with his cheesy performance and light show of a battle. There were also drawn out jokes and scenes that wasted precious screen time, but it manages to end strong despite, and I still say it's a step in the right direction for the genre. It's time for less trends, and more good story telling."

Wonder woman is not a perfect movie, it's far from that, but it's a sigh of hope. Telling a story of origin, the film is a great flashback, and make it clear in the first scene, the script of the film is good, especially in the construction of the character and creation of the myth, but in the unfolding of history itself is diffuse. WONDERFUL, GOOD, PASSIVE, these are the 3 adjectives that we can use to describe each act of the film, with a very well built beginning, we have the presentation of the hero and the call to adventure, even if it follows a structure already known, the film is Great, with great scenes and a creation of the world, the Amazons are incredible, and the whole representation of their mythology also, in the second moment we have the acceptance of the adventure, the movie falls, but still good, passing in the first war more with taste Of cold war, we have fights veiled, great dialogues, a great team building, and even the great help of the wonder woman in the reconquest of a village (great sequence), the problems begin in the third act, where the film calls for a villain , Which appears out of nowhere (although the movie is all foreseeable), super forced and that badly helps in the character's progression, maybe if the film did not have a super powerful villain, just an analogy of the war in r To Ares, would be much more interesting, even because the wonder woman was not yet a ready heroine, but insist on putting the hero in the test of fire, do what n\u00e9 .... the end is disconnected with everything that until then came Being presented. The film seems to have been directed by zack Snyder (who despite the critics, I really like a lot of his filmography), we have his cameras used excessively in the slow motion mode, we have his photograph characteristically gray, the scenes of battles that seems to have His signature and even the clear evidence and affirmation that the hero is the hero, in spite of all this evidence, we know that the film was directed by the experienced in television but new in cinema patty jenkins, that sends well, and to notice that the fall Circumstantial in the film is more the script's fault than its direction. We can not fail to praise Gal Gado, who, although not having the best of dramatic charges, behaves well in all scenes of the film, especially in action. \"Wonder Woman\" is not a good thing, but it is a confirmation of what we already knew, DC knows how to make a hero movie!"

I'm also super-picky about movies in general. Having said this, I found Wonder Woman uncommonly refreshing...better than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. Why?\n\nGal Gadot - Her screen presence is breathtaking...mesmerizing. She portrays strength with vulnerability, naivete with intelligence.\n\nChris Pine - His timing and delivery are spot-on as usual. I bet every director loves working with this guy.\n\nCinematography - From the muted colors of WWI to the lush island paradise, brilliant.\n\nThe story - It's not Shawshank but the emotive elements are all there. Engaging from start to finish.\n\nThe mythology - Basic but intriguing and credible. Great tension is created against the prevailing left-brained mindsets.\n\nThe jokes - Corny at times but for the most part they provided nice relief from the drama without ripping the viewer out of the moment like every other superhero movie.\n\nThe twist - People hate on it but I bet no one saw it coming.\n\nAnyway, forget all of this -- the movie just works. And what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with heart. One might call it the Armageddon of superhero movies. So let go. Give it a chance. Your life might not be changed but you may see this list of imdb trolls for what it is. 4/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "For the past 76 years, Wonder Woman has been such an iconic female character in the DC universe. She always proves that if men (superheroes included) can fight against the darkness, the women can do it too. With her sword, shield and Lasso of Truth, she fights for what she believes in and is always there to help those who are weak. Now the time has come for Wonder Woman to make her way to the big screen for the first time ever and the results are phenomenal. And if you remember Lynda Carter stepping into that costume and saving the day in the classic '70s show, then you will definitely remember Isreali sweetheart Gal Gadot as the feisty, tough and big-hearted superheroine. After her scene-stealing debut performance as the Amazonian princess in the flawed, but totally entertaining \"Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice\", I say it's about time that a female superhero gets her chance to shine in her own film. After a year in waiting for this movie to come out, I can say this with a happy heart, this movie is the ride that definitely lives up to the hype. Deftly directed by Patty Jenkins, who gave Charlize Theron an unforgettable performance--and an Oscar---as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in \"Monster\", \"Wonder Woman\" embraces its origin story with enough humor, heart and stunningly choreographed action sequences that it never drags or sags, it just comes alive in a real colorful way. Born in the all-female island of Themyscira, Diana (Gadot), daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), has always wanted to be a warrior just like her mother and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright). In the years that followed, Diana has been training and preparing for action, but discovers that she has powers that are astonishing. Next thing we know, a young soldier named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) lands on the island and Diana is exposed to a more darker side of human nature where bullets are ripping out of their guns and lives are lost. Steve manages to warn these ladies that war is coming (the World War, in fact) with highly impossibly created weapons invented by Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and General Lundendorff (Danny Huston). So Diana leaves her paradise home and travels to London with Steve to fight and to find the one God that actually caused it (I think you know what I am talking about). Part of the fun and heart of this movie is watching Diana exploring and learning about the good and dark side of life. As war causes pain, casualties, and emotions, they can sometimes bring us hope that the world can change, even if it's not as better as one would expect. Along the way, Diana and Steve got the help they need in some unlikely characters including Steve's smart assistant Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), a Scottish sharpshooter named Charlie (Ewen Bremmer) who is struggling with PTSD and a master of disguise named Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) as they fight their way into enemy territory with lots of surprises left in store for them. After the superb \"Man of Steel\", and the flawed, but somewhat good \"BVS\" and \"Suicide Squad\", \"Wonder Woman\" is the DC film I've been waiting for. Here is a rousing, colorful and heartfelt adventure that has big laughs, cool action, characters that you can actually root for and a climax that may be as typical as one might expect from a superhero movie, but it's filled with more emotional power that some might not see coming. The cast that Jenkins has managed to put together, including the awesome David Thewlis in a pivotal role you have to witness for yourself, is amazing. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine's work, following his best performances in the brilliant \"Hell or High Water\" and the \"Star Trek\" films. The cocky demeanor that he brings to Captain Kirk is actually quite useful in the role of Steve Trevor and he has an real undeniable chemistry with Gadot. Plus, the screenplay by Allan Heinberg gives us dialogue that crackles with sly humor (Most of the hearty laughs comes from Sameer, Etta and of course, Diana & Steve) and a lot of exposition that creates a more streamlined plot that is more reserved for a film like this. To end this review, let me say something about Gal Gadot. It's not easy to fill the shoes of Wonder Woman that was once inhabited by Lynda Carter. But she makes it look effortless and puts a lot of hard work into the character. She gives such a remarkable and endearing performance as Wonder Woman and I think this is the one that might actually make her a big star and the character that I can't wait to see again. She's wonderful. So is the movie."

But if you are looking for something refreshing and different in the genre, this movie is not it and DC (and WB) seem to be very far from understanding the game that Disney is getting away with (even when their movies are not perfect, they are at least good enough in most cases).\n\nUnfortunately with the success of this, they basically are now showcasing wonder woman as the leader of the justice league at least until superman gets back, and even then she might be given a role that will attempt to steal the spotlight.\n\nAll in all, this had potential, at least as a black horse of the genre, but the effort was so wasted in mediocre scenarios and lame execution that it just fell too short."

Besides Carter is beautiful, Gadot is very unattractive. I suspect that those who exalt this film are feminists.\n\nAnd compared to the original movie, this one is badly directed. It lacks cohesiveness and credibility. It is as others have noted, a badly flawed flick. If you go to watch it, don't have high expectations because you will really be disappointed. The flick got a lot of undeserved praise.\n\nThe only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr. old granddaughter and my 17 yr. old grandson. My granddaughter loved the movie, my grandson was bored by it, thought it was a waste of time. But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy. Also, why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original. It is like the James Bond movies. The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond, they couldn't match Sean Connery. Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter. And I don't mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies. It is like comparing the Untouchables with the Brahmans.\n\nAnother thing that one has to wonder. Wonder Woman was not released until June 2, yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date. So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flick?"

I hate Slow-Mo but Wonder Woman used it in a good way. It was a thrilling experience to watch it on an IMAX screen. It made me wonder if I was really watching a DC film. It did not feel like a DC film at all.\n\nMost of the DCEU movies have suffered from the same problem. They take things too seriously. I mean, I love Batman and I love the dark atmosphere they create in those films but what's the problem with one or two good jokes? Most of their films maintain the same dark tone throughout the run-time. When they decided to go the Marvel in Suicide Squad, it turned out to be a big turd. Fortunately, Wonder Woman does not suffer from the same problem. It works on multiple levels. It has got style with substance. It has got action and emotions. It has a got a good foundation, over which multiple layers are placed beautifully. There is character development and you get to see how Wonder Woman becomes Wonder Woman. Now, this may sound like I am exaggerating but DC has disappointed me so much in the past that WoW feels like a breath of fresh air.\n\nActing wise, Chris Pine was brilliant but it is Gal Gadot who stole the show. She was made for this role. Her transformation throughout the film is brilliant. To be honest, watching her kicking some butt on the big screen was worth the money and wait.\n\nIt isn't without faults though. The biggest problem with the film is the climax; I saw it coming from a mile away. Also, the ending is a bit too much CGI and made me feel like I was watching a Michael Bay or Snyder film, which kind of ruins an otherwise amazing experience.\n\nSo Wonder Woman is a good film and I would suggest you watch it on the big screen. With this film, DC has finally understood what they need to do in order to make a good film. It has given them a much-needed start. I just hope they don't mess it up in future. Now, I am excited for Justice League."

The trailer did not do justice to this polished, beautifully rendered film with an uncommon heart, contrasting the increasingly tired, smug Marvel tone.\n\nThe British supporting cast add a deeper flair to the proceedings, with Lucy Davis and David Thewlis offering smart performances. Gal Gadot channels a mixture of innocence, strength, wisdom and humour which reminded me of Christopher Reeve in Superman (1978). The script gives her performance a spirit and urgency which the origin story frame allows to flourish. Chris Pine is equally fine, balancing a challenging mixture of humility and bravado that gives the film a distinct edge.\n\nThe parallels with Superman (1978) are particularly apt. Both films kick-started modern takes on legendary figures with colourful, exciting adaptations of origin stories. The actions sequences are intense, clever and filled with emotional resonance."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not amazing by any means, Wonder Woman delivers its promise of a strong entry in the DCEU as well as the first truly good female superhero film.\n\nGadot owns the role as Wonder Woman in the iconic character's first ever live-action adaptation on the big screen, breathing new life in the DCEU with a heroine that is radiant, uplifting, and relatable (a first for DCEU movies). Her performance as Diana Prince the character is very well done and her interpretation of Wonder Woman the warrior is excellent, the noticeably lacking some intensity in the final battle.\n\nPine's Steve Trevor is a charming and charismatic English spy who has great chemistry with Gadot and gives an overall excellent performance, as does Robin Wright who plays Antiope, Diana's aunt.\n\nThe rest of the cast give decent, but highly forgettable performances. Because so much of the film focuses on the core duo, characters like Etta Candy (Trevor's secretary as seen in all the trailers) and the three other members of Trevor's team do not get much focus.\n\nThe villain is comparative to the subpar roster of MCU villains that can be summed up as \"fine, but forgettable,\" though there is a twist that is somewhat interesting. Ultimately though, nothing to write home about.\n\nThe plot can be considered \"above average Marvel movie\", which is absolutely fine. It's better to have a simple and solid story rather than try too hard to have an overly complex one like previous DCEU films. The pacing of the movie can be compared to that of Rogue One. While the action scenes are better spread out and the movie has a riveting final thirty minutes, a decent portion of the middle is slow and boring. A bit too much time is spent with characters we don't care much about, leaving the movie a bit watered-down.\n\nImmediately noticeable is how saturated, bright, and colorful the film is compared to the previous doom and gloom DCEU movies. Themyscira is an absolutely gorgeous sight to behold and Wonder Woman's beautiful costume truly shines as one of the best looking live-action superhero costumes I've ever seen. The action scenes are fairly well filmed, though the frequent use of slow-motion can get a bit annoying at times.\n\nRead my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-2017-new- hope-for-dceu-and.html"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not involved in the D.C. vs Marvel debate, but it's pretty apparent this film is a mishmash of the first Captain America and Thor movies. The plot is the same as Captain America (stop the evil rouge German general from using the spooky weapon he's making in his secret lab), while the romance and humor are very similar to Thor (a man/woman from a mythical planet/island awkwardly interact with human society along side their romantic partners).\n\nThe plot doesn't move quite smoothly, and it's often difficult to determine how characters got from point A to point B. The secondary characters are forgettable, as is the villain (the perennial problem with comic book movies it seems). Chris Pine and Gal Gadot have great chemistry, and the humor mostly works, being lighthearted without becoming unnecessarily goofy. The action scenes are too few, and lacking the intensity to create enough suspense, but it's still fun to see Wonder Woman kickass, especially with that lasso.\n\nI won't spoil the movie, but the ending is a letdown down, and quite inexplicable upon further reflection. That being said, the stunning Gal Gadot carries this movie, and her performance so encapsulates the intelligence, heroism and beauty of Wonder Woman, that it's enough to make the movie worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "We begin with Diana regaining possession of that old photo of her she so eagerly wanted in BvS, then flashback to Princess Diana as a child who yearns to be like the rest of the Amazons of Themyscira. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), is hesitant/hiding something from her, but eventually allows her sister/Diana's aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright), to train her to be better than the rest of the Amazons. She proves herself to be just that and so much more. After Diana rescues Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose crashed plane from World War I penetrated Themyscira's shield/cloak, their two worlds collide. Once Steve's subjected to the Lasso of Truth (Pine's equal parts amusing/utterly believable when under its influence), Diana's convinced the Amazons' old enemy, Ares the God of War, is behind 'the war' Steve speaks of and is determined to help the world of man.\n\nGal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the stand-out in BvS, and proves the skeptics incorrect about that simply being a 'fluke' due to her limited screen-time. This movie rests on her shoulders, and Gadot proves more than up to the task of portraying Diana as brave/courageous/intelligent/'badass' and, most of all, deeply empathetic/compassionate (not just regarding people, but animals too). She radiates warmth and her performance is, at times, heartbreaking (especially during the really emotional scenes). Gadot also has good comedic timing/delivery of lines (like when she discovers ice cream) and is just so likable, endearingly earnest, but genuine. Everything a hero *should* be (unlike other certain so-called 'superheroes').\n\nPine's Steve is far more likable than his Kirk. He does a lot with what could've been a thankless role and, like Diana, Steve proves himself a hero. He helps Diana adjust to being in a new world, teaching/explaining things to her, but is never condescending. Both actors 'click', especially in the boat scene when leaving Themyscira. They have an easy chemistry; their banter is fun and Steve/Diana's respective fish-out-of-water scenarios allow for some amusing moments without verging into silliness. They respect each other, neither one is ever portrayed 'negatively' to 'prop up' the other (even when they argue), and it's one of the only comic book movie romantic pairings (that's been developed over the course of just one movie) which I've found truly believable/has actually had any emotional impact.\n\nSteve's secretary, Etta Candy, also provides some humour, though thankfully isn't too annoying. She takes an instant liking to Diana (you can see why) and Diana respects her in return. See, other comic cook movies? Mutual respect between characters isn't THAT hard! Steve's other trusted reinforcements only get small amounts of screen-time, but each feel like fully-developed/proper characters with depth/flaws. The camaraderie that forms between them and Diana is earned/believable, bringing real 'heart' to the story.\n\nOn the villains' side there's Danny Huston's Ludendorff, who Diana believes to be Ares, thus providing Diana with an adversary she can beat up/someone you really want to see her kick the arse of. Even better, though, is Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka 'Doctor Poison' (she and Ludendorff make a truly twisted pair, with a sick sense of humour that at least makes them more memorable than the typical comic book villains). I've been impressed with Anaya's previous work, and she conveys so much whilst acting with half her face behind a mask. In a scene she shared with Steve, I even felt for her (Pine does well here too). I appreciated the moment between her character and Diana near the end, and that it didn't go quite the way one might've expected.\n\nWhile the Amazons are only in the beginning of the movie, they still make a strong impression. Witnessing them in action is quite something to behold. Despite Hippolyta and Diana often disagreeing/arguing with each other, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen completely sell the love their characters feel for each other (as well as ALL the Amazons). At first David Thewlis feels underutilized as Sir Patrick, who helps Diana/Steve, but later on shares a scene with Diana through a window that I thought was visually interesting.\n\nThe music throughout the film packs an emotional punch, and those complaining about 'overuse' of the awesomely memorable 'Wonder Woman Theme' (which we got a taste of in BvS and this film's trailers) need to hush, as it's only used sparingly/at the RIGHT times, mostly during the epic fight scenes (proving almost as 'iconic' as the 'Superman Theme'). Speaking of, this movie gives us something *different* with the hero's style of fighting. Her use of sword, shield, bullet-deflecting bracelets, as well as the Lasso of Truth, makes for some stunning/inventive action sequences.\n\nRegarding complaints of 'too much CGI' during the climax, given who was fighting who and the power at their disposal, the effects on display were justified. The Wonder Woman costume doesn't get enough credit for being true to the comic whilst also being functional/non-gratuitous/non-exploitative (no star-spangled panties here). The first time she shows it off in the 'No Man's Land' sequence is very memorable. Not only is it one of the movie's best scenes, but it also deserves to be right up there alongside the first time Superman saves Lois as far as immediately 'iconic' (there's that word again) sequences go. Diana's other costumes are also gorgeous, as is Themyscira ('Paradise Island' indeed). The film feels like a classic action/adventure movie. It's well-paced, has plenty of heart, and is indeed one of the best comic book movies in LONG time.\n\nNaturally, it'll have its detractors/nitpickers, but this is one movie where the hype is warranted/to be believed. It's everything I've been waiting for/wanting to see in a superhero movie for so long. This isn't just easily the best DCEU movie so far, nor is it simply an excellent superhero movie, it's also a triumph for the first big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman and an enthralling cinema-going experience/one of the best movies in recent memory. Everyone involved with this film should feel proud/pat themselves on the back for this accomplishment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow.\n\nLet me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it).\n\nPrincess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be.\n\nChris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter.\n\nThe supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\nTaking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains.\n\nThe third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.\n\nI did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed.\n\n8.5/10"

Really, it is a pity as the movie could have become a quite good anti-war movie. Instead they decide that Wonder Woman takes side with the allied forces and they do very little to show how both sides were slaughtering their own people for their imperial demands. Why do they show only the Germans to use poison gas? Churchill had no problem using poison gas against civilists as he stated 1919: \"I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes\" Why don't they show the British empire enslave the people of their colonies? Why don't they show the peace movement in all countries over the world? Why doesn't wonder woman join THEM instead of one of the obviously equally evil fighting forces? They could have shown the revolutions in all over europe that actually did a lot to end the war. Instead they make a propaganda flick for a \"humanitarian\" war.A pity."

The Amazonian princess saves the man's life and is soon swept up in the conflicts of the outside world.\n\nWonder Woman is a fun and action-packed film. The battle scenes are fantastic and there are a few genuinely funny moments.

They are cringe-inducing, but thankfully, those moments are few and far between. Another point to be made is that most superhero movies, especially origin stories, must always deal with the reactions of normal people to the super- human abilities of the hero. This film glosses over this detail and no one is particularly amazed at Diana's powers. However, these are minor critiques.\n\nOverall, Wonder Woman is a great film. Nearly all audiences will find something to enjoy in this movie. Fans of the comic books are especially in for a treat. While no extreme changes are made from the newer source material, fans will be very happy to see their favorite heroine done well in a good movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Following her cinematic debut in 2016's Batman v Superman, Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. Raised on the island paradise of Themyscira and trained as an Amazon warrior, Diana's world is forever changed when American pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), crash lands on the island's shores. Learning from Steve about World War I (which they call the war to end all wars), Diana leaves her home in hopes of bringing the conflict to an end. Following DC's previous mediocre superhero films, Wonder Woman is a vast improvement. Not only is the film's action stunning and gorgeous eye candy, but it also has a strong, cohesive plot line that audiences can get invested in. The biggest praise, however, has to go to Gal Godot and Chris Pine for their respective performances. Diana is a hopeful hero, not one to angst or brood like some other superheroes. While she is a more than capable fighter, in this film she is shown to be quite na\u00efve about the workings of the world. This pairs nicely with Steve Trevor, who, while a charming character, is more cynical about the world than Diana. He can also handle himself in a fight and is not in the film simply as someone for Diana to save. In fact, they often help one another out. The film also knows when to slow down from the action and focus on moments between characters, which give the film a more emotional depth. Now, admittedly the film's German antagonists are a tad one-dimensional, being the stereotypical German villains that are evil purely for the sake of being evil. However, this hardly hampers the film's enjoyment. Overall, this is the best film in DC's cinematic line-up so far. It is worthy of the praise and worthy of seeing in cinemas."

Finally after so many years, Wonder Woman has her own movie and Gal Gadot magnificently does well in the titular role.\n\nWonder Woman starts off by exploring the origins of Diana Prince being born and raised on the island of Themyscira being raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and later undergoing secret training by her Aunty General Antiope (Robin Wright) to become an Amazon Warrior to which Hippolyta forbids at first but later relents. Things change when Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after he crashes off the coast of Themyscira while trying to escape from the German military. Steve reveals that he is actually a spy and has uncovered a sinister plot by General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his chief chemist known as Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) to develop a bioweapon that is deadlier than mustard gas. Steve wants to put a stop to the deadly bioweapon and Diana, believing that Ares is behind World War I, wants to help Steve.\n\nGal Gadot is a welcome addition to the DC superhero franchise and deserves a well earned spot as one of the best superhero portrayals as Wonder Woman. Not sure what Wonder Woman would have turned out to be like had the plans for a movie came to fruition in the late 1990's and in 2009 with Megan Gale almost earning herself the role however the movie never eventuated.\n\nChris Pine who is frequently cast in leading man roles does well taking a step back and playing second fiddle as Steve Trevor to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. He is not a wimp nor is he relying on Wonder Woman all the time, but still wants to prove he can hold his own and lead the charge to prevent the German's deadly plot. The rest of the supporting cast including Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston (a quality villain), Said Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner (can't do any wrong) also do well in their respective roles.\n\nDirector Patty Jenkins does a terrific job bringing Wonder Woman to life. Well known for the crime drama Monster (2003) which netted Charlize Theron an Academy Award for Best Actress, Patty Jenkins also earns the distinction of being the first woman to direct a superhero movie.\n\nThe only downside is that it could have done with more action and less time on the backstory. That being said, the movie was far from dull.\n\nAfter seeing the various trailer of Wonder Woman beforehand, it certainly lived up to the hype. The movie was definitely well worth the experience and I left the cinema very content and fulfilled. Wonder Woman has deserved its popularity with critics and audiences alike, and it looks like it will be one of the most popular movies of 2017. Audiences are sure to see more of Wonder Woman pop up in Justice League in November 2017 and any future sequels down the track.\n\n7/10."

Something that comics (DC in this case) expressed in comic books and now have adapted to the big screen (minus the 60's television series and previous adaptations).\n\nWonder Woman tends to be more action packed at times while carrying to the original idea on how Wonder Woman came to be. Some crude humor made its way into the movie early on then hits you with a dose of sequences full of action and explosions.\n\nFor me it was worth watching but I'll probably wait till DC studios comes out with Justice League sometime soon."

It has been such a long time since we had a truly optimistic, heartfelt, and passionate superhero film. It seems you either have to be super edgy (DC's BvS and Suicide Squad), or super goofy/sarcastic (Marvel Movies)... but Wonder Woman has found a way to navigate those awful waters and find what makes superhero films so great - the same way Richard Donner did with \"Superman\" 1978.\n\nSo don't bother listening to haters - this film is a once in a generation flick, that resurrects the feeling of joy and optimism at the idea that there are \"superhumans\" and \"superheroes\" out there saving the day.\n\nWonderful flick - and best CBM since \"The Dark Knight\" (Possibly ever - alongside Superman 1978). 10/10!"

        "review_title": "This is One Surprisingly Good Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman is the latest film in the (up until now) failed DCEU and it seriously kicks some ass. With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better.\n\nFirst off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.\n\nThe issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.\n\nOverall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission."

        "review_detailed_main": "In DC's new installation, director Patty Jenkins and co breathe new life into the 75-year-old iconic character. Created for the purpose of \"fighting using love\", Wonder Woman had always been a interesting character to include in stories, but hard to pinpoint when it came to personality. After the last 3 DC movies I said no more for me. I'm glad a friend changed my mind on that. I didn't go to see it because it was the next chapter in a cinematic universe, I saw it because it told a story (and the hype behind all the critic reviews, of course). And there's a perfect balance to her: she's not sexual used by virtue of her appearance, and she's not a feminist. She's just a woman, who shows vulnerability, and wants there to be world peace. I was so surprised by how much they humanized her. Inspite of the fact that she was a stonehard killer, she looked at the world mostly through the eyes of a little girl. And I never expected that. I didn't just like it because it was a great movie, I also liked it because this is the best incarnation of Wonder Woman I've ever seen, even compared to the animated features. If you want a movie with great world history, a little bit of mythology, and an awesome \"new\" superhero the center of it all, I'd recommend checking this one out. This took decades to get to, and even Joss Whedon admitted it was too complicated for him to make. Don't watch this because of the Cinematic Universe, watch it because it's a good movie with (finally) a well-made message behind it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had heard some really good things about this movie, so I was obviously excited to see the film. After I came out of the theatre I couldn't understand what all the fuzz is about. The movie is just OK. I think it is closer to being bad than good.\n\nThe acting is good. Most of the actors do a very good job in portraying their characters. The only two actors who I believe were miscast were Robin Wright and David Thewlis as Sir Patrick.\n\nRobin Wright just looked ridiculous dressed like that and doing \"stunts\" ( or better yet a CGI version of her). And David just made me feel sad for him, he was terribly miscast and his character was laughably bad.\n\nThe action scenes in the movie are mediocre. They are full of pretty bad CGI and slo-mo \"money shots\" (trying to look like 300). It was very sad to see how they have an actress like Gal Gadot that is an army veteran and knows how to fight, being replaced by a bad CGI version of her.\n\nI must admit, there are some parts in the action scenes that were pretty cool, specially a fight in London.\n\nThe first half of the film is pretty slow and had me pretty bored, it was really boring to see all the exposition and the Amazonian world. Actually, I was looking at my watch for whole run-time of the film.\n\nThe relationship between the characters was good enough and believable. But there was a big problem, the movie failed in making me care for any character except Wonder Woman. When a character died, I really didn't care about it. I will give it this, I was glad someone died in a superhero movie.\n\nThe ending was terrible though. It was a CGI culsterf*ck that reminded me of BvS. It was really unexciting and completely ruined the message of the film. And the final shot... it was so cringeworthy.\n\nI did enjoyed the \"feminist\" aspect of the film. I was expecting this movie to have extreme feminism and make all the male characters stupid or assh*les while the female characters are perfect. But the movie actually makes both male and female characters relatable and competent.\n\nIn the end, this movie was just mediocre. It is nothing impressive and i wouldn't pay a ticket to watch it."

Not to mention my girlfriend wanted to see it, and there's not many she actually wants to see.\n\nI doubt you can imagine the level of disappointment I felt by the time it was over. And I honestly have no idea why so many people think it's so amazing.\n\nWWI was a huge tragedy, but the first war that was very well documented. And I would have thought that if they had picked that for a setting, that there could have been some semblance of realism somewhere. Not to mention some way of involving her in events that actually, or at least, might have happened. So maybe that's nitpicking. But from start to finish, the plot in general had holes big enough to drive a warship through.\n\nI can't really comment on the acting as the script was so bad I don't think anyone could have saved it.\n\nIt would have also helped if it would have had a great, or even good antagonist. But the villains here got so little screen time, they never felt even a little threatening.\n\nA good supporting cast could have made it better as well. But they too seemed to get no character development, and didn't seem to have too much of a reason to even be there, aside from the odd bit of comic relief and to remind us of how gorgeous Wonder Woman is.\n\nTechnically, there was nothing special about it. The CGI was nothing special and the editing left me wondering how much had been cut out.\n\nOn the plus side, and maybe the only positive about the whole movie, was that Gal Gadot looked great as Wonder Woman. But really, the only reason I can think of for all the glowing reviews, is that people love watching a hot woman kicking ass and taking names (and she didn't actually take that many names...but she did kick a lot of ass though)\n\nAnd in case you're curious, my girlfriend liked it a whole lot less than me."

        "review_detailed_main": "#WonderWoman movie is simply amazing. It doesn't hold back, it pulls out all the stops, it doesn't reserve some parts for a potential sequel, it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory. You'll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you. Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nStarring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis, directed by Patty Jenkins, before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira. But Diana is unaware of her true identity. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world, Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction, the god of war Ares.\n\nBecause it's a DC movie, much of the visual and the style of \"Wonder Woman\" is what you'd expect from a DC movie. But what's great about this one, which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do, is that \"Wonder Woman\" manages to inject entertainment, so it's not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way they've turned boyscout Superman into.\n\nAnd I think much of that is thanks to the fish-out-of-water aspect. This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours. And halfway through the end, the fish-out-of-water aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us, mankind. So perhaps \"Wonder Woman\" is an example of a success story that happens when you don't give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads don't meddle with the mythology and the filmmaker's vision and when things are not forced or rushed. The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought process.\n\nAny doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen. Not only does she look the part, she's absolutely gorgeous, her acting is sharp, she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance. She becomes Wonder Woman, they are now inseparable, just like we're all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan. This is Wonder Woman's debut on the big screen, billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero, they have been anticipating this moment for years, so it is a huge responsibility, one that I think Gadot gracefully carries. Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film, \"Wonder Woman\" is a very well-made film. It's spectacular in every sense of the word.\n\n-- Rama's Screen --"

I've always liked Wonder Woman and it was great to finally see her in the silver screen with today's effects and all.\n\nWonder Woman is a great hero. She's strong, intuitive, and tough while still being both compassionate and kind which was essential to her original character; and this movie keeps true to that. Diana in this movie has those same characters and Gal Dadot's performance was very believable.\n\nThe movie is essentially an origin story which can be hit or miss. The DC Extended Universe movies have not been well received at all, but more on this later. The movie's color scheme is quite clever, showing the island Diana grew up on as a very bright and beautiful with everything outside of it being dark and dreary. It captures the intensity and grit of war, especially the time it takes place in, World War I. There's even a scene where they go into the trenches and it's quite authentic. There isn't a single filler character, even the side characters of the group of soldiers she links up with are entertaining and add a lot of flavor to the movie. My only nitpick is that the music seemed all over the place.\n\nThis is also a great return for DC movies. As I mentioned before recent DC movies, such as \"Man of Steel\", \"Batman V Superman\" and \"Suicide Squad\" (a movie I actually liked for just how fun it was) weren't greatly reciprocated and for good reasons. But \"Wonder Woman\" nails everything that DC movies in the past were great: balancing comedy and intensity. The movie doesn't have that many comedic moments towards the end but it does have that balance very well in the beginning and the movie benefits because of it.\n\nIn the end, I highly recommend this film. I feel that it's one most people should enjoy, especially those who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of movies."

It's even one of the best movies ever made. As the story goes many years before the other films doesn't need to leave loose ends or references to connect them with the rest of the universe. The origin is counted in the first half hour; in the island of Themyscira the scenes are quite colorful with a very beautiful tone, unlike what we were showing the previous films, although the plot is short and the characters don't appear much; Antiope (Robin Wright) is spectacular & Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) also does a good job. When England is shown the colors become tenuous (by the tone of the war) engaging the rest of movies; Diana (Gal Gadot) & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) make an excellent dynamic duo, with good chemistry, charisma and companionship, have a kind of romance & complicity: pure dynamite. The dynamic reminds us of Richard Donner & Christopher Reeve's Superman, the serious drama tone to Tim Burton & Michael Keaton's Batman. Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is a transitional German villain for the plot but it's necessary; Doctor Poison (Helena Anaya) works as a villain, & the final fight with the hidden villain, Ares, is good but it lasts a very short time. If Patty removes that plot, the film stands alone because Diana fighting the Germans is delightful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope; What Man Of Steel should have been. Excellent action scenes, very good choreography and very good production work. The soundtrack is exciting."

You will enjoy it if you have enjoyed the Marvel movies or superhero movies in general. It has what the vast and overwhelming majority of moviegoers want. Action, laughs, feels and love. Also a hero that *gasp* isn't dark, ironic or edgy. Everyone in my family loves this movie. It's clean; it has no foul language and most importantly no blasphemy, nudity or sex. Is Gadot an Oscar- worthy actress? - no, but she works here. Does the CG get a bit muddy at the end? - Yup, but it diminishes the movie not a bit. Honestly, the worst thing about this movie is it's set in the same universe as the horrifically terrible DC movies \"Batman VS Superman,\" \"Man of Steel,\" and the upcoming and probably bad \"Justice League.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "So we bought our tickets and our medium sized popcorn box (usually lasts about 15 minutes in the movie), grabbed the 3D spectacles and sat in the theater to watch Wonder Woman. That's the way to do it. Each genre has its rules and one needs to know a minimum of them before entering the cinema theater or starting to see a movie on TV or on his/her preferred viewing device. When I chose to see a super-heroes comics inspired movie I do not expect a lot of realism or credibility from the story, and these are not the films where I am looking for lessons about life. On the other hand I am ready for fun entertainment, for action and special effects, I hope to see a coherent story with actors performances that make me care about the characters. I do not care about the laws of physics, but I hope there will be some humor and that the good guys will eventually prevail.\n\nMany of the super-heroes movies nowadays do actually carry some cultural background, it's just a different type of culture, and it helps, although it is not mandatory, to know it. 'Wonder Woman' is a character that combines the mythology of comics stories with the other mythology, the ancient Greek one, the one we read about and maybe learned about in school. Invented during WWII, at a time when women were playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort, mostly by undertaking the roles played in economy by the men sent to fight, but not on the first line of the front, the character of princess Diana (yes, this is the name of the character) carries a strong feminist message. The authors of the script and director Patty Jenkins moved the origins of the story to the end of WWI, the war that was supposed to end all wars. By the way, hard to believe that this talented director is at her only second film, and that 14 years passed since her remarkable debut with Monster. They brought the princess from her isolated island somehow hidden in the mist of mythology, in a tentative to really end all wars. We all know that the tentative failed. In the process the hero will learn a few things about men and evils of mankind, will avoid and block a whole arsenal of bullets and bombs and will kick many bad guys to dust.\n\nI enjoyed 'Wonder Woman' because of a few good reasons. The feminism of the message is never dogmatic and almost always impregnated with a dose of self-irony. Gal Gadot who plays the lead role may not be a great actress, but she has the looks, is very well fit physically and typologically for the role. The film is very much the story of her coming to age while learning to understand mankind and fighting on the side of the good guys. She does it with the smile of a teenager on her face and radiates optimism and belief in truth which somehow becomes credible and succeeds to overcome the horrors of the carnage fields of the world war we see on screen. While playing well on the mythology grounds, the story has enough humor to avoid being dry or pathetic and lets us understand we are still in fantasy land. I also liked the special effects, especially in the opening scenes when the Amazons fight the uneven battle with the war machines created by men since they were lost in history. The color palette of the cinematography was well adapted to the different phases of the story, although the 3D spectacles made it (again) too dark - there is something that needs improvement in the technology here. I also liked two of the supporting actors - Chris Pine who succeeded to be the nice guy without being over-sweet (also because of the dose of humor invested in his role), and especially David Thewlis which I have seen previously in Fargo and who develops to be a formidable actor. I liked less the other characters, especially the bad guys, who were, well ... cartoonish. The end of the story was a little disappointing. It looked like one of these epic superheroes endings, but the careful preparation and building that preceded prepared me for something better. It leaves however clearly the path open for the sequels and I will be making reservations when pre-sales tickets become available."

She is shown as a compassionate character yet ruthless and fierce when in battle. It gives the much-awaited reason of turning her back to the world of men.\n\nThe action is intense the Amazons are fearless and Wonder Woman is unstoppable.\n\nDCEU has found its best movie yet. Snyders vision of the DCEU and Patty Jenkin's direction leads this movie to be one of the best female lead movies of all time.\n\nFor People who Liked BvS this will give you goosebumps and for other movie goers, this is definitely worth a watch."

I'm so tired of this stupid bias stuff. We can like both Marvel and DC and the world will be just fine. Beware of the Marvel Shrills who hate on everything DC. Go see this movie for yourself. Great action, Drama, humor, and story. Diana Prince and Steve Trevor or the absolute best on screen superhero relationship since Lois and Clark from the original Superman movie back in the day. In fact, Diana and Steve's relationship is just as exciting and enjoyable as the action scenes!!! I loved it!"

Just because Warner Bros gave them an opportunity to watch the movie before others, they wanted to give a good fake ratings.\n\nWonder Woman was supposed to be a breath of fresh air for Wonder Woman revival and to bring a female hero to the screen as it is dominated by male heroes.\n\nThis movie was a huge miss for me, and I anticipated this movie so much, I knew it would blow me away and I just couldn't wait to see the movie. I ignored all annoying backslashes the movie was getting from fanboys, haters, nerds and anti-Israelis.\n\nThe movie had everything going so well: the cast, everyone was amazing with the acting, flawless. Props, costumes and settings were top notch. I don't know how they built the old England but was it believable and amazing! I love Wonder Woman's costume so much.\n\nIt had some comedy to it which were really nice.\n\nThe story was the biggest gripe for me, I was quite surprised they put a lot of back story to Diana when she was little. But things just went down hill after she kissed the guy. Everything became a messed and it felt like the movie makers ran out of ideas, had budget restrains and just didn't know what to do so they rushed it.\n\nOne thing I liked about Diana is her naive personality.\n\nSo far the best DC movie which I approve is Suicide Squad. Every other DC Movies had not impressed me yet and I was hoping this movie would, but sadly DC missed the mark.\n\nThe thing about Marvel's movie adaptations is that they aim the movie towards people who are aware of who the comic character is. But the story is freshened out for people who are not comic book readers nor do not know about a comic character. And for the hardcore fans of the character who are deep in knowledge with the character's story and universe. Marvel will add little nuggets, clues and cameos in the movie.\n\nHowever this movie just missed the mark. The movie was just aimed at people who don't know anything about Wonder Woman.\n\nAlso anyone seen God of War Ares use thunder has his powers? shouldn't that be Zeus? also how could Diana be created if Zeus gave his life to create shield for Namascrara?\n\nOne thing I hated about Wonder Woman is she keeps clapping her wrist together, that thing is so annoying! It is meant to reflect bullets and projectiles but why does she use it as a special attack???\n\nR0ttenT0mato obviously gave a false review ratings because of the backslash the movie was getting.\n\nZack Synder wrote the movie, and after 1hr of the movie, the story just turned to mess. I don't think i will be watching Justice League because I was disappointed with this movie!\n\nCaptain American First Avenger sucked, but Winter Soldier was too freaking amazing! Ant Man, Iron Man and Spiderman are the only first sequel movies that did not suck.\n\nWhy o why couldn't this movie just get it right?"

In that dark world, Wonder Woman's (and/or Gal Gadot) light shines brighter.\n\nAll Themyscira is perfect and beautiful, as it is all Diana's origin. But the story told works in more than the literal level. The script is superb and well above the generic ones. We have the literal Diana's adventure that ends up with her becoming the hero we know. Then we have the interpretation of War in the world. The naive notion that Diana has, about ending the world by defeating one villain. That translates to the believe that in our world there are clear \"good guys and bad guys\" and with the defeat of the \"bad one\" the wars would stop, when is clearly way more complicated than that. And it also brings the notion of the people that benefits from War and tries to influence humans to give to them nature of war and conflict, for their benefit. I'm referring to Banks that finance wars, the industrial military complex or just plain and simply the militar arm of x country.\n\nAnd then we have Jenkins really using the Snyder visual style, with amazing sequences and fights choreography with slow motion, but also a bombastic third act that can be a bit much. The villains could've been a bit better. And maybe a bit faster here and there, maybe. Maybe one or two less \"slow motion\" scenes."

Yeah, there were problems with the plot, and the acting could have been better, but my biggest problem with the film was the lack of character development and the historical inaccuracies. The vehicles (motorcycle especially) and aircraft, clothing, speech, everything - wouldn't even have passed muster for a WW II film, let alone one set in WW I.\n\nFrom the previews I had high hopes for this movie, and I really liked Gal Gadot as WW, but the movie overall was just 'meh'. I watched it and actually made it through to the end (unlike a few other reviewers) but I did find myself glancing at my watch more often than usual.\n\nSo yeah, there have been better superhero movies, but there have sure been worse ones, too.

It was fairly predictable (I could tell who Ares really was as soon as that character came on screen). Steve's secretary (honestly don't even remember her name) was so one note. She obviously was written in to be some comic relief but she just didn't end up feeling real. Like for instance, Steve (who was presumed dead) shows up with a strange woman, and she just doesn't question it. Not too mention that whole scene in general was silly to me. Steve has made it clear that getting this notebook back to his superior is incredibly important, so why waste time making Diana try on a bajillion dresses. I mean, I know its to have a funny scene where Diana rips a dress as she tries to fight in them, but it just doesn't make sense in context of the movie. I will say though that I did like the war scenes. I felt like it accurately portrayed what war would have felt like back then. The desperation, the pain, the fear in people's eyes. And I also liked that the film had elements of PTSD in there. It brought another layer of realism in there. Those were some aspects of the story I appreciated.\n\nThe CGI was lackluster. Certainly not the worst thing ever, but there was a number of times where it looked fairly obvious they were standing in front of a green screen. And they overused the slo-mo in fight scenes.\n\nI know this review seems fairly negative, but honestly the film was still really entertaining. And I do appreciate seeing more women driven films, and specifically women superheroes. I just don't think its some huge game changer that people are making it out to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.\n\nAfter the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile."

I feel like anyone who watches this movie will really enjoy it because it has so much action and emotion, the fighting scenes are really well executed and super intense. This movie has such a good storyline too and it makes you feel so many emotions. It's about World War 1 and how they overcome the war with the help of Wonder Woman. Even though it's fiction it's still really inspiring. We see a lot of the trials that people had to face during the war, and not even to the full extent of their hardships. This movie was a good source of entertainment because many people love superheroes. My favorite part about this movie was the main character played by Chris Pine because I love him and he's a great actor. There is no part in this movie I didn't like because it's just that good. I love superheroes so I like to watch other movies like this one. The filming was pretty great, they got all the scenes just right and especially the fighting scenes, those were my favorite."

But there is something that seemed to little worked, the visual effects, at times like the scene of the Amazons fighting against the soldiers, was quite bad.\n\nThe Germans as bad guys was too clich\u00e9, I can barely think someone was surprised by this. Just like using the Lasso of Truth to trust a spy. While I don't consider it good to compare, it was inevitable to remember similarities with Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\nBut I won't deny The goosebumps i felt while Wonder Woman fought, while 'Is She With You?' was played (composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL). So, in overall, was fun, but not for watch over and over."

        "review_detailed_main": "It has to be said. This is the best DC film since the Batman Trilogy from Christopher Nolan. The story is engaging, the characters well developed and even the humour misses being corny. Two things take away from the experience:\n\nFirst, the slow motion effects. When they are well done, like in 300, they work incredibly well, but when they fail they are a major turn off. Zooms on the face or animated jump sequences look incredibly out of place and spoil the pace of the otherwise well choreographed action.\n\nSecond, and I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, the political correctness agenda in this film. It's already a feminist film, by definition. But adding a native Indian American character to World War 1 just so he could utter that one line about the white people destroying \"his people\" is beyond ridiculous. And that's only the most blatant bow to the SJW community.\n\nI won't write more, with so many reviews already being up. If you can ignore the above, it's an enjoyable film for sure."

She gets her role well, and her Wonder Woman is a true character of real strength.\n\nChris Pine is another must see here, funny and clumsy at times, but so good and so correct to be Steve Trevor. His part is a great addition to Gal's superior playing.\n\nOthers are very well chosen, too. Danny Huston is great as usual, his old school style serves well, and David Thewlis is a must see, surely so.\n\nAll in all, WW is a great flick, spotless and no blemish found, wow. Excellent watch."

And by that I mean that it has a central hook to differentiate itself from other superhero movies (this is basically Thor meets Captain America meets a woman) but is letdown by an especially convoluted and nonsensical neverending ending - not only did it not make sense on a visual level but neither did it on a plot level with some of the \"twists\" and actions undertaken.\n\nSome of the bright spots include the casting, the first half for the most part, the rapport between Diana and Steve, and some of the action choreography when it's close quarters.\n\nDiana's naivete felt kind of out of place or overdone - sure she doesn't understand certain things about the outside world but she acts like a childish moron sometimes (like Thor without the undercurrent of angst and the general sense that he's that way all the time). Not to mention her \"resolve\" at the end is a bit unfounded considering she was right about Ares. Not only did that reveal make the Amazon women look like idiots but it also justified her belief in people and in a sense let them off the hook from being selfish and evil in their own way. She got to learn a lesson but not too hard of one and she was right anyway so oh well."
