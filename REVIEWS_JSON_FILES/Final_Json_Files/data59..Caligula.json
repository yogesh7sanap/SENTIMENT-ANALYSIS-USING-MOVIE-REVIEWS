        "review_detailed_main": "Some describe CALIGULIA as \"the\" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.\n\nFor a while it looked like it might. CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited \"R\" and original \"Unrated\" versions. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.\n\nThe only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.\n\nViewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.\n\nIn a documentary that accompanies the DVD release, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best. That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.\n\nOn the plus side, those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.\n\nThe movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism. If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe it helps to be familiar with the history, Art, and literature of the Ancient Rome because \"Caligula\" is surprisingly truthful adaptation of the chapter about Caligula in \"The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, the Roman Historian. If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.\n\nThe movie is notoriously famous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been documented in the historical documents that still exist.\n\nI don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that \"never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula\" and that he was rearing \"a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.\"\n\nWhen the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors. Not every day you can see porn with Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud, and of course, Mr. Clockwork Orange himself, Malcolm McDowell."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Caligula\" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 \"Fellini Satyricon\" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the \"glory\" of ancient Rome. But Fellini it ain't... First of all it is not as entertaining. Far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. The portrayals by Jay Robinson in \"The Robe\" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in \"Emperor Caligula\" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. The only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. These two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however."

My boyfriend was with me and he was two years older. We honestly had no idea that what we were about to see was pornography and neither did the rest of the audience. People walked out in disgust. We just sat there in total shock. I don't think either of us understood what we were watching because we'd never seen anything like that before in our entire lives...at least, I hadn't. I remember one middle-aged couple, who left at the same time as we did, saying they thought they were going to see a movie about real Roman history and it certainly wasn't that. My boyfriend and I never talked about it afterwards...I think we were too shocked and overwhelmed to say anything to each other about what we had seen. I know I didn't want to discuss it at all and that was the end of it. But now it's 42 years later and I can honestly say that I've never forgotten that it was the worst movie ever. It wasn't identified as a pornographic film and should have been. I still feel that some kind of fraud was committed against young people like me at the time and to this day, I still cannot believe that it happened. I looked it up just to see if it really happened because it was mentioned in the description of a television program that was on tonight about the man who ran Penthouse magazine and sure enough, he was the person responsible for this terrible movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.\n\nCaligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like \"sin\" and \"depravity\" used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.\n\nThe historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.\n\nRarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.\n\nA review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as \"hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.\" This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned."

The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the \"uncut\" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out (almost smokey) look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it \"paganography\") wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-70's BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look somewhere else."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, as with all, has good points and bad points.\n\nIn general, I feel that the good ones far outweigh the bad.\n\nThe film simply gives the story of the rise and death of Emperor Caligula in a very straight-forward manner. Indeed, it can be seen as shocking, but I think that this is a side-effect of it's desire to be realistic, rather than a deliberate act on the part of the film-makers.\n\nThe cinematography and camera work is awful. The huge sets seem at times almost claustrophobic which is an absolute crime considering the magnificence of them. There is also too much emphasis on Caligula himself, to the detriment of revealing some important traits in other characters, making them seem somewhat shallow at times.\n\nThe sex scenes are very well placed within the context of the film. I thought that only two scenes stood out as being unnecessarily overt, but for the most part, the explicitness is on the fringe of the focus of each scene, while also playing a major part in the atmosphere.\n\nNever once did I feel that any dialogue was out of place, nor did the acting strike me as being bad.\n\nBy far the biggest problem with this film is the fact that the sexual content is widely advertised and therefore anticipated before viewing. This may cause people to focus dominantly on those scenes without really looking at the film as a whole. For me, it enhanced the film. Not in a particularly titillating way, but in the fact that there was no compromise during scenes of sexual acts. Roman orgies are regarded to have been extremely opulent and promiscuous - I found it refreshing to see one as it may have actually been rather than lots of fully-clothed laughing fat men pouring red wine over their faces and eating grapes while draped with female automatons.\n\nIn summary, Caligula definitely has it's place in film history due to it's controversy, but if you look beyond that controversy, you should find a rather good film which neatly tells the story of how power can turn someone into a madman."

The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....\n\nIf you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.\n\nYou've been warned"

The supporting actors do a fine job yet, most of the young ladies were actually Penthouse Pets and were there for eye candy and irrelevant sex scenes. Depending on which film you are watching, the uncut or the R-version, some scenes are extremely graphic. I would usually always recommend the uncut version as opposed to the chopped one, but in this instance, the full length film is purely indulgent. Scenes of sex and gore were added to satisfy the producers (Penthouse) and the expected audience, not to add anything to the story. However, I am and will always be a fan of excess, so get the full version! The story is strong and keeps you interested. McDowell is charming throughout, which is quite the feat considering he murders family members, rapes and molests men and women, and sleeps with his sister. For fans of excess and sleaze, i highly recommend. Viewers who are purely interested in the reign of the notorious ruler might want to skip this one."

Secondly, if I were to sit the multitude of graphic sex scenes only to be repelled and mystified by their presence in the film, then it barely functions as good porn.\n\nIn short, CALIGULA has provided me with two and one-half hours of cinema (if you wish to call it that) that I would never wish on anyone."

What results is nothing short of a fascinating product.\n\nAll of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can't help but think he's like that in real life. His portrayal of Gaius Caligula just drips with maniacal megalomania. The little-known Teresa Ann Savoy is convincing as Drusilla, Caligula's sister. And Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar, whose diseased face is rotting away, is truly an oddity to behold...put he pulls it off well. The acting in general is all very good.\n\nThe use of music is also to be noted.

Guccione's idea seems to have been to portray the perverse and sick side of the Roman era and at the same time, to destroy the Hollywood perception of Biblical movies (given the cast of some well-established actors and actresses). The result was an absolutely disgusting film whose only merit was in its shock value. As many of my fellow IMDb reviewers have pointed out, there is actually a scene early in the film where a group of individuals are buried up to their necks in the ground and are decapitated by a lawn-mower type machine wielding a very large blade. And the scene is very graphic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think engines existed in this era ! As for the remainder, the script is just plain awful and speaking quite frankly, the \"adult\" scenes (if we can refer to them that way) are not very stimulating or exciting at all. Also, there are many scenes of orgies, bestiality, incest, and just about any other perversion you can think of. To me, this movie was an expensive attempt to create a pornographic film set to the backdrop of Ancient Rome and throwing in extreme violence and established actors just to lend it some credibility. I'm sure there are many historical errors here as well but in short, this is just an awful attempt at cinema. At a length of a little over 2 and 1/2 hours, it really becomes boring and pointless. Also, if we check the history books, this movie isn't even close to the facts. For one, the emperor's name was not even Caligula. That was a nickname given to him by the Roman soldiers when he was a little boy. It literally means \"little boots\". He would parade around in front of the soldiers in a soldiers uniform that his mother made for him, which included a tiny set of army boots. And, his reign as emperor only lasted 4 years and was, by far, more violent than sexually perverse. He wound up being assassinated by 2 soldiers whom he insulted. So, this movie technically fails on 2 fronts. Terrible."

I wonder, did John Gielgud or Peter O'Toole ever publish any comments on this film? It would be interesting, I think, to hear their comments. If you have a chance to rent this film, rent the R-rated version, because I think (at least if memory serves me) that it is mercifully, shorter.\n\nIf you want to watch a low budget film along similar lines, that is not quite as bad as this one, (but still very bad indeed) you might try the less awful \"Warrior Queen\", which is also, mercifully, shorter. It has lots of nudity and death, but no Gielguds or O'Tooles to waste in its making. They claim that \"Caligula\" is historically accurate. Perhaps it's true to some extent, but if so, it's a story not worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, copulating couples that's just what you'll want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as syphilis-ridden emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell sticking his finger up a male victim's anus, and you begin to appreciate that Caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick/outrageous films.\n\nThe film charts the life of notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitations, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes.\n\nAlthough Caligula was totally mad in real life, and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not, the film is still inexcusable filth. The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi-layered story - the sex IS the story. After a while, all the nudity, hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild-eyed posturing. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he's in it purely for the money?!). Rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post production, but in truth there isn't a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well-made. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again, so in that sense Caligula is a one-of-a-kind experience... on the other hand, it's so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is \"one-of-a-kind\" is a blessing in disguise."

For those who haven't seen \"Clockwork\", basically a spoiled brat interested in perversities. Yes, a lot of the scenes are just plain gross and shocking, but not necessarily in a good way. If you consider Let's just say that half of the movie is a combo of a S&M and porn director's movie with a colossal budget. This would have been a better movie if it explored Caligula's mind and at least tried to analyze why he performed the atrocities he did. Any person who has read or seen documentaries on Caligula could see that the director chose the most depraved acts and committed it to film, yet nothing is mentioned about his megalomaniac thoughts on being one of the gods and how this really lead to his subsequent demise. To think that actors of O'Toole's and McDowell's caliber actually appeared in this film is unthinkable."

My favorite was the one Caligula wears near the end which is a gorgeous metallic green. You can tell the effort put behind not only the wardrobe but the hairstyles and the sets, they are some of the best aspects of the film. The costume designer Danilo Donati actually won some Oscars because of his work in other films.\n\nNow, everybody who dislikes the film do so because of the very explicit porn. I agree most of the time is excessive and goes on for way too long, I think because of the nature of the story and character a certain amount of explicitness works, but for the most part I find it too be too much and too long.\n\nIf you take away the porn, this movie would be far better received. There's an actual story and it has great performances for the most part.\n\nIt is not perfect however, I do feel the movie stayed one note from beginning to end, doesnt feel like a 3 act story but it was worth it in the end. I am really looking forward to watching the new version that premiered at Cannes this year, hoping it becomes available to the general public very soon."

I had to leave after the two hour mark. There was a bad taste in my mouth (from the movie!), my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. That should tell you something.\n\nThe only saving grace in this is that they got some respected actors who, despite the material, give good performances The late John Gielgud is in the first 10 minutes and then killed off (a wise choice), Peter O'Toole is killed off after 40 minutes (another wise choice). Poor Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren (who admits she did it just for the money) suffer through the entire film. They give two great performances...much better than the film deserves.\n\nA total piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Caligula\" is simply not a good movie. In fact, it's a really bad movie, and that's the God's honest truth. If it weren't for the pornography, this piece of garbage would have been long forgotten. As with most bad movies, the problems start with the writing. The dialogue is corny, the history is poorly told and the transitions from scene to scene feel disjointed and out of place (for the record, I saw the complete and unedited version). The direction, set design and cinematography are also horrendous. The cameraman seemed capable of only two views: close, and far. There was no movement to the camera, as if it were firmly planted on the set. Speaking of the sets, they were also pretty nasty and poorly done. Instead of conveying a period feel, they screamed \"we just threw this together in a few minutes\". The lighting didn't help much, either; it was either way to bright, way to dark or way to red. Then there were the costumes (or lack thereof). The Romans did not wear black togas with gold trim; they wore white togas with purple trim. And there were a few moments where we really didn't need to see nude bodies. The best example is in the beginning of the movie, where naked slaves are engaged in some kind of road project. Slaves may not have lived well, but they at least had a tunic or a loincloth. Finally, the porn scenes. I'll admit, I was shocked the first time I saw masturbating men and women, group orgies and couples engaged in various acts of intercourse, but I suppose that the intent was to get some shock value, and compared to what's out there this was relatively tame. Nevertheless, the sex added nothing to the movie, and wasn't exciting or stimulating. It felt as though it were thrown in simply as a gimmick, a way of attracting movie goers with the allure of a large scale porn movie. In conclusion, if you're looking for exciting Roman history, or pornography, or a combination of the two, don't look to \"Caligula\". For Roman history, see \"Spartacus\" or the upcoming \"Gladiator\". If you want porn, type \"Pamela Lee and Tommy\" into your search engine, or visit an adult video store. But whatever you do, stay away from \"Caligula\"; the movie, in more ways than one, sucks."

There's no dramatic progress, there's no lesson, there are no surprises, there's nothing except base depravity in scene after scene after scene. And the scenes that aren't disgusting are boring. The titular Caligula is a reptile at the beginning, and he's the identical reptile at the end. He lives, he stinks, he dies. The end.\n\nI'll close by noting that, as far as I know, this is the only film the erudite Roger Ebert summed up by invoking the word \"sh**\".

I doubt anyone is going to be aroused by the multitude of orgies depicted on the screen. But the sadistic showmanship of these orgies and executions is a sight to behold.

The question I kept asking myself throughout the film is what kind of audience did the filmmakers have in mind who would want to see this? Certainly not history buffs, because the story is all but incomprehensible, and offers no insights into the life of Caligula or anyone else. Certainly not fans of the gifted and famous actors like Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud. If they did this film for any reason besides the money they should get their heads examined. They have never done anything remotely like this before or since. If the producers hired them in order to give their film \"legitimacy\" were sadly mistaken. Certainly not for people who like pornos. The film is absurdly overlong at two-and-a-half hours, and only a few precious minutes feature hard-core porno. Since Penthouse produced the film, what they should have done was cut an hour out of the film and add more porno scenes in order to make it a standard porno movie and not some half-hearted epic. I was at least expecting the film to feature glossy photography just like in the Penthouse pictorials. Boy, was I wrong. The cinematography is really ugly. It's underlit and washed out, and it looks like one of those cheap Italian gladitor films of the '60s. The editing is a joke. The scenes don't flow together, they just pile them on, one after the other, in no apparent order. Nino Baragli, who edited Sergio Leone's films, worked on this film as well, if you can believe it. This is the kind of film that should be put into a time capsule for a hundred years and then seen again to see if it's any better. It just might, because I was surprised at the high number of \"10\" votes by imdb users. My only other comment is about Malcolm McDowell. He actually gives a performance. He is onscreen almost all the time, and he plays his part with a straight face. He recites the silly dialogue as if he was making an important film like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Nothing fazes him, not what happens onscreen. One would be hard-pressed to recall another instance in which a talented actor worked so hard for such a minimal payoff."

Upon reflection I see I was wrong - its eminently worthy of contempt, if only to inform would-be viewers. I should point out that I can't help but compare it with the superb \"I, Claudius\" TV series and, also, I tend to see things in black or white, so if you want an objective review of this film you are advised to go elsewhere please.\n\nWell I don't quite know where to...this movie is historically inaccurate for starters, which wouldn't be so bad if the dramatisation wasn't so poor. The script is woeful. No wonder Gore Vidal dropped it like a rather molten kartoffel. The storyline is difficult to follow; if I weren't already fairly well acquainted with the events portrayed I'd be left with the impression that ancient Rome was to be viewed (on cut-rate pyschadelics) as some sort of palacial brothel peopled by thespians with pretensions to meglomania, fawned upon by a wearying succession of mincing yet determined dung-beetles and, surprisingly (well) fed, harlots. Well it was at times I guess but surely never with such a crude...limpness.\n\nThe acting is hammy in the worst sense as if somehow it were being earnestly, even courageously, performed by a mental asylum's (oh so) amateur players. Caligula in particular, butchered by Malcolm MacDowell, flits about like a seasoned ponce presenting a tense spasticism where gravitas would be more appropriate and an impish schoolgirl facade in favour of genuine levity. John Hurt's portrayal (in I, Claudius) shows what a well-directed genius can do with such a character. Alas its no wonder the late lamented Sir(?)John Guilgud expressed a keen regret in having an, albeit truncated, association with this movie.\n\nI s'pose for forms sake I should mention the 'notorious' sex scenes. Well got that out of the way...\n\nAt the end of the proverbial this movies' one success can be drawn from its similarity to its subject - all that wealth and talent in the hands of a select few...gormless shagnasties. At least you don't have to wait five centuries for the Huns to hove into view, just sack it with the remote."

Bob Guccione should have stayed in the background as Executive Producer and let the professional filmmakers and editors do their jobs. He couldn't do that and the end result is a confusing hodge-podge of drama, horror, attempted humor, and well-shot but totally unnecessary pornography.\n\nThe real story of Caligula is fascinating. He was an inept leader who set new standards of depravity and madness that shocked even the bloodthirsty and jaded Romans. He was probably insane and yet he ruled a mighty empire, if only for a few years. If you want more than a picture of his depravity and mental instability you will have to look elsewhere. May I suggest the very excellent \"I, Claudius\" as a good place to start?\n\nIf you want history or good drama, look elsewhere. If you want good porn, you won't find it here, either. CALIGULA really has no reason for existence other than as a vanity piece for Bob Guccione. As a film, it's not even as good as junk like \"Dude, Where's My Car?\".\n\nWere it not for the presence of some notable actors, all of whom have disavowed CALIGULA, this film would have scored a 1, and that would have been just a pity point."

        "review_detailed_main": "When a glorified pimp steals control of a masterpiece, and when the moral compasses of all involves withers away, then worlds of cinemas collapse. Logical, no?\n\nOnce, several years before Star Wars, Gore Vidal wrote a screenplay about possibly the most depraved Roman emperor of Ancient times. It's probably safe to say that his mistake was in asking a porn magazine to fund this movie's production. Throw in the involvement of Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione and you have Caligula, one of the most notorious failures of 70s cinema. While it's not quite as vicious as Cannibal Holocaust, it's still excessively exploitative; while Holocaust used real killings, Caligula used real sex - so as to try to boost sales of Penthouse magazine, apparently. So what grabbed my attention for this film so strongly, especially when I initially thought it'd give me nightmares? I mean it's not like it's entirely historically accurate, is it? Well... it's got Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, among others. And the musical score is recognisable, at least among classical music aficionados.\n\nWell, I took one for the team when I went to pick up a copy of the Imperial Edition DVD set. This included the uncut release... which SHOULD warrant an R18 where I live but somehow doesn't... the 1999 \"Rated Version\", misrepresented as the \"Theatrical Version\"... and there's the one I chanced at, the Alternative \"Pre-Release\" Edition, a new edit created from an earlier cut which re-arranges a few scenes back into their original context, and most of the explicit sexual inserts added by Guccione are removed, filled in by a handful of 16mm behind-the-scenes footage. So, fair enough, it's not so much of a sex film as it was before. But not even that could save Caligula from being one of the most miserable films I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing.\n\nFrom start to finish this turkey blows (in more ways than one!), and it's not hard to see why: you have three conflicting artistic differences duking it out, and while sometimes it works, it can't really be excused that sometimes you can forget you're watching a film with explicit sex, and then a helping of genitalia brings you back to earth with an unpleasant thump. Not to mention the violence, as well - in one early scene, a soldier has several gallons of wine poured down his gullet, and Tiberius personally pokes a hole in him... just to prove to us that neither the Ancient Romans nor the Modern Writers have limits when it comes to pointless and senseless violence. Still... I guess it's fair game if, historically, Tiberius ordered to have the scales of a fish rub off a victim's face...\n\nAnd as for the explicit porn - how did this get into public cinemas again? It's clear proof that Bob was a sex tycoon who sneaked back onto the set to film a hardcore porno movie for which - though as I recall, most of the acts are legal - the authorities could shut down the set and sentence everyone to jail. It almost happened anyway - in several theatres the movie was shut down and seized by police! I'm just saying that this is the sort of thing that doesn't bear watching if you aren't in the mood. I'm not going to say anything about them, for obvious reasons. Even if I did, perhaps my arguments would be invalid - except for the fact that they replaced some of the more important scenes.\n\nThis excessive sex and violence aside, the point is this: Caligula in general is a major dud - a long, drawn-out (seriously it drags on well over two hours!!) piece of work of which not one bit is historically accurate, nor assembled in a historically accurate order. If Bob was holding out for artistic freedom, then he'd failed in that respect because really, even ART has standards! Of course, it's not all bad news... Malcolm, Helen, Peter, John and co. did a fairly good job in their acting, and the music, like I said, is a splendid compilation to listen to. The sets aren't bad either, even if they do represent a nightmarish version of Ancient Rome. Also on the Imperial Edition DVD, there are a few deleted scenes which SHOULD have stayed in the film, as they surely would make it less of a disgrace than it is now. A complete and detailed history of the production of the film is also being written by James Ellis Chaffin and Ranjit Sandhu, with research from Thomas Ryerson, called 200 Degrees of Failure: The Unmaking of Caligula, slated for a release sometime this year, or possibly the next. You can find a lot of their research at their site (caligula.ws). I'm sure that the story behind how Gore Vidal's work fell apart would be a much interesting read, and I'm looking forward to it."

Most of the negative comments I've read deal with the movie's excessive violence and sexual depravity, and certainly there are mass amounts of both. But that's what the movie is about.\n\nYou think it was too violent, too disgusting? It's gratuitous sex and sadistic violence made you sick to your stomach? That was exactly the point. Caligula is no fairy tale story of the glory of Rome. It is an examination of the debauchery that pervaded everyday life. Many condemn Bob Guccione for turning the film into a cornucopia of sex and violence. I believe that someone like Guccione *had* to be involved. To use a more reserved filmmaker would lessen the impact, and therefore cheapen the message.\n\nCaligula is not for everyone. If you are disturbed by strong visual images, then steer clear. But if you want a more accurate picture of life in ancient Rome, check this one out."

Some of the scenes are pure B-grade exploitation-style to the point of being literal porn, hence the infamy. Yet, while embarrassing to admit, it's not bad.\n\nThere's more to this film that the gratuitous nudity and sex. The film is actually a decent drama, showing a man who's willing to do anything to take the throne, willing to dispose of trusty friends and allies to retain it, a man whose narcissism and search for pleasure know no bounds, a man totally out of touch with reality and with the people he rules, a man who has left the realm of sanity.\n\nA large degree of graphicness is necessary to demonstrate the blackness of Caligula's mind and the decadence of the times, though not to the extent of this movie (no movie needs that level of explicitness!) but you can't make a film on Caligula and have it play out like a Disney film. The film needed to be edgy, and edgy it is.\n\nThis mix of dark biopic and extreme explicitness makes for a very uneven film. On the one hand you have a Machiavellian, almost Shakespearean, drama being played out, complete with stellar cast - Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Helen Mirren. On the other hand you have, well, porn. The latter cheapens the film considerably. Dialling down the explicitness could have made this into a great drama."

A top-class cast star in this lavish big-budget spectacular, written by renowned scribe Gore Vidal, but produced by Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, and directed by erotic movie maker Tinto Brass. The result is a fascinating epic with fantastic production values, some gruesome violence and a whole load of explicit sex.\n\nGaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (or Caligula for short), as you may be aware, was the tyrannical ruler of Rome from 37AD to 41AD. During his short reign of power, he ensured his place in history with his many acts of depravity, cruelty and sheer madness. Malcolm McDowell is totally believable as the loony leader who shags his sister, makes his horse a member of the senate and forces his senators' wives and daughters into prostitution. Other big names that signed up for this highly controversial movie include (Dame) Helen Mirren, (Sir) John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole.\n\nWatching these highly regarded thesps mixing with Penthouse pets performing hardcore lesbian trysts and blow-jobs is a real eye-opener and really has to be seen to be believed. The film, at a running time of two and a half hours, is quite slow going but it's worth persevering! Where else will you get to see McDowell raping a virgin bride and then fisting her husband, or a man being killed, emasculated and then urinated on. What other big budget movie gives you a smattering of dwarf sex, a machine that decapitates prisoners buried up to their necks and a woman using semen as a skin lotion? The film might be a bit hard going at times, but fans of extremely bizarre and trashy movies should definitely see this one if they can.\n\nCaligula is by no means a great film (it is overlong, factually inaccurate and at times I was tempted to fast forward through the slower bits to get to the next 'shocking' scene), but it is one of those movies that one needs to witness first hand in order to understand how truly unique and unusual it is. It's a hard one to rate, but I think I'll give it a reasonable 7 out of 10 just for its willingness to go the extra mile to entertain."

Just because the horrors and excesses of the Caesars were obscene does not make them unfit subjects for cinema. But to me, the gratuitous sex poisons this film. Please note that I am NOT a prude AT ALL. I have not the tiniest complaint with porn. I consider \"The Gangbang Girl #33\" to be a superior film to \"Caligula\" because it is true to its purpose. Caligula tries to be historical epic and porn flick, and succeeds at neither.\n\nConsider the brothel scene. It is true that Caligula held a brothel in the palace. Film-making is the art of interpretation, imagery, and inflection. The BBC's version shows the brothel, with no explicit sex, and no diminution of the historical significance. Do we really need to see a woman performing oral sex on a man and see the man ejaculating to get the idea? While we're at it, why not show people actually being killed to demonstrate Caligula's capricious cruelty - a real decapitation, for example? Just as important as a real blow job, if you ask me.\n\nIf you want Peter O'Toole in a historical epic, I recommend \"The Lion In Winter.\" If you want stories of the Roman Empire, \"I Claudius\" and \"Ben-Hur\" stand out. If you want oral sex, try the \"Down The Hatch\" series. But not all genres are meant to mix in one film."

About the only sex-scenes that had much function in the story was the (historically fairly accurate) prostitution of the Senators' wives. Even so, this scene was overlong.\n\nThe best aspects of this movie are the music and the art direction; they're not historically correct by a long-shot but have that Dr.Phibes-over the top thing going for it. Also, the basic premise of the movie (Caligula takes Tiberius' disdain for the Romans to heart and is anxious to see how far out his behaviour can be before someone shows some spine) is interesting. It would have been a much better movie if it left out most of the graphic sex scenes, and added more action/gore. Caligula was noted for having an obsession with gladiatorial fights so this would be accurate.\n\nIf you want to see a more 'historically correct' version of Caligula, watch the splendid \"I, Claudius\" TV-series with Jacobi."

In short, one of the hundred worst films ever made.Read the play by Camus..or rent \"I Claudius\""

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Caligula\" is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is pure garbage. I would use different words to describe how awful it is, but IMDb does not permit the use of such words that I would give to this atrocious piece of junk. The film reel that holds this film would be better used spinning in a toilet bowl than on a movie projector.\n\nSo why is this film that bad? You can tell right in the first scene. It shows Malcolm McDowell playfully chasing a very pretty girl through a forest. Not only is the shot out of focus, but the editor somehow felt it appropriate to intersperse this scene with footage of sheep running through a crowded street. Why? What do these sheep even have to do with this scene? It's not even metaphoric. It would be if it showed McDowell speaking to a large crowd of people who are influenced by his words. This way, the metaphor would be that the Romans are like sheep blindly following their leader. However, that is not at all what happens at any point in the film.\n\nIn fact, no one in this film seems to take McDowell's character of Caligula seriously. McDowell, who I loved in \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) and other films, plays the Roman Emperor in a one-note performance that seems to undermine his acting ability. Caligula in this movie is a whiny brat of an emperor who seems to do four things: fornicate, flout about wearing no pants, send people to be executed at random, or elevate his status from Emperor to God. I don't know much about Roman history myself, or at least not about Emperors after Marcus Aurelius. However, the real Caligula must have had more complexity than this.\n\nThere are other great thespians in this movie who, according to what I've read, played their parts while not knowing the mess they were getting into. Peter O'Toole did what he could playing Tiberius, but just seeing the ugly makeup he wore made me want to take a shower and use rubber gloves. That's why I cringed when McDowell and others kissed him on the cheek.\n\nHelen Mirren was also wasted in this movie as Caesonia, Caligula's wife who, according to his sister and lover (yes, that's right) Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. Not only do you not see her with other men in this movie, but she also goes through the entire movie looking bored and just going through the motions. I actually don't blame Mirren for feeling that way if she actually did. Fortunately, better roles would come her way in the next 30 years.\n\nBut again, the biggest weakness of this film comes in the editing. I have not seen a movie before which has sloppier editing, and the flow of the story is completely thrown off because of it. The scene where Caligula first gazes upon Caesonia is followed too abruptly by a man getting his head cut off in a stadium. It goes right from harp-like music playing to a scream and the sound of a sharp knife slicing through bone in a second. Any sane moviegoer would react by saying, \"Woah! What the hell happened!?!\" in that second alone. I found myself saying that phrase through the whole movie.\n\nMany films have strengths and weaknesses, but this is the first film I've seen where I can't think of any strengths whatsoever. It's sloppy in its editing and storytelling, less than mediocre in its character portrayals, and even the settings and backdrops look too much like movie sets. In fact, the scene where Caesonia is giving birth looks like it was filmed in a high school gymnasium.\n\nIf someone who actually knew what they were doing would have made this film, it would have been a lot better. What is most surprising is that the film is gaining an audience with the most recent DVD release. It may be because of its notorious hardcore sex scenes, but to me, those parts of the film aren't even sexy or erotic in the slightest. This film just should not have been made, period, and I don't say that about many other films."

However, the owner of Penthouse put the final product together, and the result is an obvious attempt to make porn more \"mainstream\" by connecting it to big screen actors. I laugh at reviewers defending it when the very actors that starred in it and the writer of the screenplay want nothing to do with it, seeing the final product for what it is- the most expensive porn flick of all time. I had to forward through much of the movie; frankly, I don't know how non-depraved people can actually sit and watch the whole thing. There is a tremendous blow job scene at 2:10. That is the only part of this movie worth watching in my opinion. The rest is complete crap. And that is actually putting it mildly."

I paid my money at the local \"art\" cinema and walked in without having read any reviews. I made it through less than the first hour. When I felt like I was going to throw up, I walked out. There was not a single redeeming feature in the film. Brilliant actors fell to an unsurpassed low. Photography seemed to have been done while blindfolded. Writing was NAUGHT. Plot was NAUGHT. Music was REALLY NAUGHT. But the worst part was that the scenes of debauchery and sadism were still there, and their purpose was NAUGHT.\n\nI am not in any way prudish, but there were scenes in this film that were designed to shock even the most vile sensibilities, and what is the point of that? The purpose of art is to stimulate our lives. That does not mean that all art is going to be happy or beautiful or even understandable. Nevertheless, It should provoke thought and conversation and ultimately contribute to society in some way. I believe that there are dark aspects to each person's life. These dark places exist and need a form of intelligent, thoughtful exploration. We cannot triumph over our own darkness without an awareness that it exists. But this film's sin is that it has no redeeming values. Rather, it seems to dig out the deepest, darkest places in demented amoral behavior and put it on display with a vengeance. Throwing the excrement to the wall to see what sticks is NAUGHT."

        "review_detailed_main": "From what I understand of the history of this film, Franco Rosellini started to make the film, but needed more money. He went to Bob Guccione (among other things, editor in chief of Penthouse magazine), who agreed, but at a cost. The cost is the addition of more sex, including some scenes directed by Guccione himself.\n\nThe result is a mixed bag, the scenes with story, presumably directed by Tinto Brass, are wonderful. Then there are scenes that have no story, appear to be filmed with a different grade of film, and add nothing to the movie except skin; I assume that these were done by Guccione. I would love to see a reedited version, without Bob Guccione's scenes, but it will never happen, since Penthouse is the one holding the rights to the movie.\n\nNote: I'm not saying \"take out all the sex, and the movie would be good\", I'm saying take out Guccione's sex, and leave in Brass's. Some of the scenes I attribute to Brass are quite graphic, such as Tiberius's living sculpture and the Ship of Noble Prostitutes. These scenes are not only interestingly filmed, but are important parts of the story. Guccione shows me nothing I can't find better by getting a porn flick.\n\nSo with that caveat, and with the warning that people offended by explicit sexuality or graphic violence should not watch this film (and that's graphic violence in the disturbing, matter-of-fact way that Italian Cinema seems to do so well), I'd recommend this film. It's an interesting exploration of the intersection between madness and power, as well delving into some depravity that you don't see every day."

John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudius. The climactic (?) assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini's \"Salo\", but by all means stay away from this movie."

Later Caligula gets to play a much hackneyed role from a San Francisco bath house in the 80's (perhaps even the 1880's). If Caligula were indeed the dissipated creature he has oftentimes been portrayed (a _very_ early devotee of carnality with his sister for example) it's hardly likely that he would find Tiberius' unsustainable Brothelicon a shining beacon of desire.\n\nLeaving aside the underplayed (and mostly redundant) carnal component of this cornucopia of calamitous cinematic crap, one wonders if any of the people involved consulted even a single (sober or soused) historian prior to writing. Rome, like victorian England, had its twisted sides but such things were never secret for long and, for all the Praetorian Guard's prowess, the people would not have taken this kind of thing ... um ... lying down, for long. But that's to poke a hole in a swiss cheese the size of Switzerland.\n\nThe thing about cinematic catastrophes such as this is that the director gets his cake either way. He can always claim it was a genius challenge for which the jaded establishment public were inadequately prepared, else he can claim it was a sensitive and humorous parody, which the dim-witted public could not appreciate and thereby missed the inverted/reflected brilliance of his double-bluff to their parodied middle-class bourgeois values.\n\nIt's not a terrible film; there are many worse. It is a notorious film, and for all the wrong reasons. The sets are dark enough to take our minds off their paucity. The dialogue is sparse enough to take our minds off it's painfully skeletal composition fleshed out with fatuousness. The acting is scarce enough to take our minds off. Gielgud was so completely discomfited by his role, he seemed to be speed-reading his lines off his mental teleprompter so he could get off the set and wrap his tortured soul around a warm amontillado and call his agent for a rant and recompense.\n\nI'd say, if you're /really/ bored and this is sitting by the player, load it up and flop into a beanbag.

        "review_detailed_main": "Caligula (1979) is a film that has left an indelible mark on the annals of cinema history, albeit for reasons that are far from conventional. Directed by Tinto Brass and produced by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine, Caligula is a provocative and controversial exploration of power, corruption, and unbridled hedonism. While the film is undeniably flawed, it is not without merit.\n\nThe film centers around the rise and fall of Gaius Caesar Germanicus, better known as Caligula, the third Roman Emperor, who ruled from 37 to 41 AD. Malcolm McDowell delivers a powerhouse performance as the titular character, capturing the essence of Caligula's descent into madness and tyranny with chilling authenticity. The supporting cast, which includes esteemed actors such as Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren, adds a layer of legitimacy to the film that elevates it from being merely a provocative spectacle.\n\nCaligula's visual opulence is one of its most striking features. The film's grandiose sets, lavish costumes, and meticulous attention to detail transport the viewer back to ancient Rome, immersing them in a world of decadence and debauchery. The cinematography, courtesy of Silvano Ippoliti, is often breathtaking, with sweeping vistas of the Roman countryside and sumptuous interiors of the imperial palace.\n\nHowever, it is in the film's graphic depictions of sex and violence that Caligula truly distinguishes itself from other historical epics. The film's unsimulated sex scenes, which were reportedly added by Guccione after Brass had completed principal photography, have earned it a reputation as a pornographic film disguised as high art. While these scenes are undeniably explicit, they also serve a purpose in illustrating the moral decay and unchecked lust that characterized Caligula's reign.\n\nThe film's script, penned by renowned author Gore Vidal, is another of its strong points. Vidal's dialogue is sharp and incisive, providing insight into the political machinations and personal relationships that shaped Caligula's rule. However, the film's narrative often feels disjointed and uneven, with certain scenes appearing to serve no purpose other than to shock and titillate the audience. This uneven pacing and lack of narrative cohesion are among Caligula's most significant weaknesses.\n\nDespite its flaws, Caligula remains a fascinating study of absolute power corrupting absolutely. McDowell's mesmerizing performance as the deranged emperor is reason enough to watch the film, while the sumptuous production values and thought-provoking script make it a worthwhile, albeit challenging, viewing experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Caligula is a film that defies easy categorization and continues to polarize audiences more than four decades after its release. It is not a film for the faint of heart or those seeking a more traditional historical epic. However, for those willing to engage with its provocative and often unsettling content, Caligula offers a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience that pushes the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in mainstream film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the earliest movies I can remember seeing. The other two being Conan the Barbarian and Halloween. My initial view was a brief 30 minutes or so, caused by a cultural misunderstanding. It would take another 10 years or so before I saw the movie in its entirety. It is interested to see how things have evolved and shows like Rome and the Tudors (movies like the Gladiator, 300 and Alexander) have come in the aftermath of this movie. It would almost seem as the prototype for the dramatic historical fiction narrative. It is graphic in terms of sex and violence and tries to depict Rome in terms of its own morals and not ours. This isn't an everyday Roman's view, but rather a look at lasciviousness of the ruling class.\n\nWritten by Gore Vidal, starring a pretty good cast. Peter O'Toole (as the dying and diseased Emperor Tiberius), Malcolm McDowell (Caligula) in yet another full frontal movie (Clockwork Orange), Sir John Gielgud and Helen Mirren (thats right the Queen herself).\n\nIt is nice to see Peter O' Toole and Malcolm McDowell fully embedded in the hedonism of ancient Rome. I can easily see them as downing cartons of wine before scenes and hanging out with John Holmes in the mirror room. It is nice to see the classically trained (Mirren and Gielgud) joining in this Roman foray as well. I can't help but me reminded of Fellini in terms of style. I am thinking of the influence of Roma and Satyricon. It is heavily stylized and the theatricality is quite visible. At time is feels more like theater than a movie. It might lead one to forget that one is watching porn.\n\nEven though there is a heavy story about how Rome works and perhaps the other motivations of the young Emperor (sympathetic eye towards Caligula amongst the cruelty and scandals), the politics of Rome and the question of morality, it is still in the context of the incest, sex, orgies, homosexuality, sex, bestiality, sex, masturbation, and pure unabashed hedonism (and sex) of a corrupt and failing system. The authenticity and production quality leads more to the impression of a stylized documentary rather than porn. And just when you are comfortable with that assessment of the movie, it shoves some genitals in you direction just to make sure you remembered this was a porn. Yet despite all this it still somehow works and has some time to develop. As opposed to most porn, it doesn't forgo the story for the sex. The story develops organically, while periodically linked by one of Rome's eccentricities (a.k.a. the sex). The scene where Caligula rips the Emperor's ring off is amazing. The sheer energy of this scene(sound and imagery) sets the mood for the rest of the movie. Powerful imagery such as the metaphor of casting a ship to sea (and thus declaring war) to the frenzied energy of a fellatio.\n\nThis one is hard to recommend to anyone. This is a view at your own risk kind of movie, not suitable for the TGIF/Fast Food Nation family crowd. It is artistic, graphic and somewhat accurate. I guess its a lot like the history its trying to recreate."

It has been universally dismissed as nothing more than exploitative semi-porn trash by the critics and apparently by most 'common' people too (the IMDb rating). Under certain circumstances, I would be glad to give a film like this a 1 too.\n\nBut this is one movie where all those things that were used to criticize are, in truth, virtues.\n\nHow would one show the story of Caligula, the infamous Roman Emperor that could easily be the greatest monster humanity ever saw? The fact that they had the courage to show violence and nudity, not shying away from the depravity of the subject matter, and also showing the 'dark side' of Ancient Rome, is in the end what makes this a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nAnother plus is that, if you can focus away from the depravity, the movie is all around very solid. The story is very interesting and engrossing, the soundtrack is great, and the cast? You have big names like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, together with beautiful and talented women like Helen Mirren. And what is there to say about Malcolm McDowell? The man is one of the best, most underrated actors and has shown before that he can play a devious lunatic like no one else.\n\nThe fact this is directed by Tinto Brass (known for his almost pornographic movies) and produced by Penthouse (no explanation needed) might be one of the motives for the film's overly poor critical reception. A director like Pasolini, for example, made worse depravities years before and got away because 'cinema experts' said it was an allegory for the human nature or whatever it is they use to justify overrating their 'art' films.\n\nOr maybe it would have been better to sugar-coat the story, making Caligula seem like a victim of whatever disease caused his lunacy, like John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'?"

True, it is by no means whatsoever a perfect film, but what most people fail to realise is that the writer and the director of \"Caligula\" had originally set out to make an allegorical story about life in the corridors of power in Ancient Rome, as opposed to a hard-core pornographic peepshow, The visceral scenes of violence are alarmingly compelling. The sheer savagery of the dark underbelly of Roman life is vividly, and quite accurately captured (though not quite historically accurate).\n\nMalcolm McDowell gives his all and all as the deranged Roman emperor, Caligula. He could certainly give Charlton Heston and Victor Mature a run for their money.\n\nGive me \"Caligula\" over all the stuffy, over-earnest 50's/60's \"sword-and-sandal\" epics any day."

Even with the image only slightly compressed whole scenes focus on billowing curtains, people in the background, or action that is entirely unimportant to the advancement of the plot. Major characters speak off camera, and the camera doesn't seem to care. Extreme closeups are the order of the day, alternating with the cinematographer's one trick--zoom in, zoom out--to create an unsatisfying viewing experience. Considering the apparent opulence of the sets, and the obvious large investment in same, it is maddening to see such inept photography. I'll seek out the uncut fullscreen version for comparison's sake, but technically Caligula is a disaster.\n\nThe cast, especially Peter O'Toole is fine."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty.\n\nAs one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', there is much naked flesh to be seen, and the film lovingly catalogues Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as though Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'Gore'). Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape.\n\nThe Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during the reign of Commodus, an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both those films are artistically far better than 'Caligula'.\n\nThe acting in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star) it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honourable Senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill.\n\nGuccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question). The film does not, however, succeed upon any other level, either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even seen as erotica it is second-rate. 4/10"

It is non of these things. What it is doesn't actually have name but if it did the word would have to smack of excess.\n\nTo be fair, real Roman times were bloody and violent and sex was the TV of the day.

        "review_detailed_main": "(Spoilers Herein) The infamous Caligula. Labeled as \"the most controversial movie in history\". Even it's actors were allegedly appalled by the film (did all of them even see it?). And there are reviews a mile long all over the internet about how \"rediculously bad\" this film is. Here are my thoughts; Although I have mixed emotions about it, I liked it. I can say with all honesty, that I have never seen anything quite like it, anywhere before.\n\n(SPOILERS)The premise is as follows; a young budding man takes the already corrupted throne of power from Tiberius, who is sick and dieing. He makes the love of his life (his sister)his unofficial \"queen\", and allows the power of his new found authority to go to his head. After running the might empire into the ground, a conspiracy conspires against him and he is assasinated (along with his family). Another page in Roman history is turned.\n\nI feel it's \"king of bad cinema\" reputation is highly overrated and incorrect. Is it revolutionary in idea? Not really. Is it the worst film I've ever seen? No way. This type of period piece has been done many times before. The 'power corrupts' story and the 'decadent portrait of the pagan Romans' theme is pretty much a universal theme in the sword and sandal epics of American Cinema (see Ben Hur,Gladiator,etc.) But the Excesses of Rome were never quite as in your face as they are here. Although many would disagree, I feel I can take this film's plot line somewhat seriously. It has a story-structure in which I must admit, does grow dimmer by the end of the film, but has wonderful actors, all giving a very serious and credible performance. It appears to have a budget, with gigantic sets, hundreds of extras (mostly Italian I believe)and it has a heart, of sorts, in the caligula character, and his control over Rome and it's plight. This alone is more than most Arnold Schwartzenegger(sp?) movies have, but nobody seems to spend a lot of time bashing these flicks. Although Caligula the character, is despicable, and does some pretty terrible things, I felt as though, in the film, he was only the product of the society that gave him that position. Malcom Mcdowell(sp?) portrays an eagerness, to his soon coming of power, at the beginning of the film and then lets his grasp on reality immediately start slipping when he takes the throne. I enjoyed seeing the softer side of Caligula at the beginning (when he is shown frolicking in the forest with his lover).\n\nMuch of what you heard about the sex in this movie is true. The sex is real and all of it seems to be shot as though the director (Bob G.)wasn't even aware of censorship laws. In terms of intensity, you won't find anything here that you didn't see in \"In the Realm of the Senses\", in which many, including myself, deem as an artistic classic. For those of you who haven't seen that film, this means real penetration, real mouth to genital contact etc. In terms of content, I saw a lot of shots that by themselves, look like they were shot by someone who deals in the business of sex (and fetishisms; the urination scene for instance). Personally I did not even really feel the excess of sex scenes in the film until the final orgy scene, where I admit, it did seem slightly gratuitus. Sometimes I felt the director was trying to use the sex scenes as metaphors for the story line as we realized the full excesses of Caligula's corrupted reign. And that we the viewer were also indulging in Rome's excesses with Caligula, and we were supposed to feel uncomfortable about that.\n\nThere seems to be myths about the film that go unchallenged; First, there is no 210 min. print in commercial existence. Only the \"unrated cut\" (which is the one I have seen), and the \"R\" rated cut. Second, contrary to many user-posts on IMDb, there are no scenes of bestiality (although he's uncomfortably fond of his horse), there are no scenes of pedophilia (child-sex)(although there is a verbal reference to it in the line: \"do you like little boys?\" \"No, big boys-my soldiers\")and there are NO scenes of necrophilia (although it is perhaps suggested with Drusilla).\n\nAll in all, Caligula's flaw seems to be excess, and a lack of control over something that was too big for anyone to hang onto. But then again, that could be said of the Roman Empire... And whether the film is historically accurate or not, there certainly were rulers of ancient Rome who were capable of this kind of behavior and probably did act this way. Not for the squeamish, but for those who are used to contemporary sex and violence, give it a shot. Also check out \"Queen Margot\" for another view of a different corrupted empire."

Perverted scenes illustrate the magnitude of this infatuation. Thus, both normal sex, orgies, and incest are necessary for the accuracy of the film. Orgies are especially relevant historically given that they became a large source of state income under Caligula. However, each of these types of sexuality were depicted in gratuitious way that was not necessary from the point of view of accuracy; i.e., it is not necessary to spend ten minutes of footage - with multiple close ups to boot - to present the fact that orgies existed in Caligula's life. Though some sexual aspects are left out which would have strengthened the idea of Caligula's immersion into sexuality of all types; namely, acts of beastiality which are as historically true as any other sexual facts on Caligula. This would have been, from a standpoint of accuracy, much more desired than the actual gratuitous sexuality displayed. A superfluous amount of these director mis-judgements compromises the potential for a good film. It is important to understand Caligula from both a modern and classical perspective, but educational and historical understanding and partially bartered for mere arousal and porn profits. But what can you expect from a penthouse-produced film?"

Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.\n\nA story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this?

Bob Guccione's Caligula might have been something truly memorable and noteworthy, but it ends up being nothing more than simply \"notorius\". It isn't just the eye-opening hard core sex and violence that mars this film. The film is hurt every bit as much by the terrible editing, lack of cohesive plot, and the general ugliness of its tone. The film is still viewed regularly, and has more than made a profit. Mostly because of the curiosity factor. Once the viewer gets used to the copious amounts of gratuitous nudity, torture, and explicit sex, they quickly notice that there isn't much else to this project.\n\nA very entertaining project could certainly be made about the pagan ruler Caligula of early A.D. Rome. And Malcolm McDowell is certainly a great choice for the title role. As Caligula, McDowell basically gets to extend his lusty fantasy he has mid way through A Clockwork Orange. Imagine Alex from that film as emperor of the known world, and that's the perspective this film takes. There really isn't much of a linear story here. Gore Vidal wrote the original script but who knows how much of the finished product is his idea. Likely not much since he would later disown the film. Director Tinto Brass did likewise after producer Guccione insisted on editing the film himself. He is apparently the one to blame for all the incessant zooming in and out throughout the film. It seems like they rarely even knew the right perspective in which to shoot most of these scenes. The post dubbing of voices is all too apparent, and the running length is ultimately just too long. Some of the sets look impressive, and it must be noted that the acting is often very convincing. There are some big named actors here like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole that should be ashamed for appearing in this. McDowell has always been a daring performer who brings such effort to his character that he can be forgiven. Incredibly, Bob Guccione was originally trying to get John Huston and Jack Nicholson. At least they had the good sense to pass.\n\nOverall, it was the mean and cynical tone of the film that put me off the most. The technical problems were also too much to overlook. Another problem was the lack of historical perspective. The film never really defines Caligula, or the times in which he ruled. And there really aren't enough actual porn scenes to satisfy the horny voyeur who might only be looking to get off. The film is pretty much a failure at every level. It made Guccione a good chunk of change, though. 2 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound."

It's really a visual attack, and the only thing I find ironic is that highly respected actors like O'Toole and Gielgud accepted to have a role in this monstrosity. This film has nothing: no plot, no story, nor good acting; it's just a series of vignettes showing the most shocking images you could ever imagine. Some people get thrilled by watching gore movies, but one can tell the difference when a film is made just for entertainment, and when it's made to offend the viewer. There are limits. And it seems to me that Brass and Guccione surpassed those limits."

Now, in seeing it again, some of the set pieces are pretty good - e.g. the all white building interior in wide angle and a bright red-robed Caligula sashaying up the middle, that kind of stuff is still cool high style today. Surprisingly, the dialog/soundtrack itself is pretty tame and apart from some screaming is actually only PG, and banal. McDowell hams it up a bit too much, the bug-eyed maniac is tiresome, the point seems to be that this Caligula knew he wasn't a god and resented the way the Roman aristocracy propped up the role of emperor, and seemed relieved to finally get his in the end. So, too bad about the uber violence, porn and poor editing, could've been something!"

With a trilogy of orgies and foul and strange bizzare incest that Caligula shows one tends to ask why? Caligula does not glamorize any of the foul things it displays but simply puts them there for you to see and make your own decision. Perhaps it's a moral story? Perhaps it's porn for thought?\n\nThe acting is very good for both Peter O'Toole who plays Tiberious and Malcom Mcdowell who plays Caligula. If you liked Mcdowell in \"A Clockwork Orange\" you will definitely enjoy this movie. Something about Mcdowell playing crazed lunatics that makes his movies he is in all the more interesting.\n\nSo let the kiddies go to bed and rent this with a close friend or with your husband or wife.

        "review_detailed_main": "Caligula is an example of a film that was trying to go in too many different directions and ended up tearing itself apart. Anyone who looks at it on paper should realize that it does have some very strong points. The basic story was written by Gore Vidal. The cast is superb (Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren, just to name a few). The scenery, sets, and costumes are excellent and may be as close to authentic as one will find. However, this film fails because it had too many clashing personalities working on it behind the scenes. Gore Vidal left because he didn't like the way Tinto Brass (director) was going with the script. Brass left because he was not allowed to edit the film. O'Toole and Gielgud were unaware that hardcore sex was going to be in the film (otherwise they wouldn't have done it) and McDowell has since commented on what a mess it is. It seems that producer Bob Guccione was more concerned with filming hardcore sex scenes to show the debauchery of ancient Rome than with making an accurate or entertaining film.\n\nThe plot is basically that of the life of Emperor Gaius Julius Caeser Augustus Germanicus (Caligula was his nickname). It starts at the end of the reign of Tiberius, who ended up giving Caligula half of his estate to be shared with Tiberius' grandson Gemellus. Caligula either goes power mad, or actually insane, history isn't quite sure which, and begins behaving in very bizarre ways. Caligula slept with his sister Drusilla, married a prostitute, had numerous senators executed for questionable reasons, declared himself a god, and had his army pick up sea shells as spoils of war.\n\nMost of Caligula's \"legacy\" is conveyed in the film, but the film itself seems to be more of an excuse to make a high class porn film than an actual study into the life of the emperor. In addition, the film makers made some large historical errors.\n\nFirst, they have everyone calling him Caligula. Caligula hated his nickname and was not afraid to get rid of anyone who he didn't like, so anyone calling him this to his face probably would have been executed.\n\nSecond, they have some kind of large machine that looks like a house but moves slowly to decapitate its victims. There's no evidence anywhere in history that such a machine was developed in ancient Rome.\n\nThird, Praetorain Cassius Chaerea did strike the first blow in the assassination of Caligula. However, it was not done in the palace but rather a tunnel leading from the stadium where he was watching gladiatorial games. Chaerea also had several accomplices who were of the senatorial class, and the assassins fled shortly there after because Caligula's guards were going to either kill or arrest them for the slaying. Similarly, Chaerea took no part in the crowning of Claudius as emperor, Chaerea wanted to kill him.\n\nThese are just a few errors, I'm sure I could find more if I sat down and watched the film again. I really have no urge to because it is a mess. This film could have been great, but it ended up being extremely disappointing.\n\nIf you want to learn about the early Roman emperors watch \"I, Claudius.\" If you want to see hardcore sex, rent a porn."

The film seeks to be a one hundred percent faithful representation of the events that occurred during the government of the Roman emperor Caligula. In terms of context, he does it very well, having Malcolm McDowell who embodies the character very well. It believably reflects the madness of the emperor, making him look sadistic, wicked and insane with a peculiar black humor. The development of the film, on the other hand, seeks to reflect the Rome of that time in every way. From brutal violence to the free sexual pleasures of the moment. Something like this could be well reflected in the series \"Spartacus\", Caligula mostly focuses more on the sexual part. There is explicit violence, but not much. As for the sexual scenes, there are enough of them and they are as explicit as wanted to the point of making Caligula a pornographic film. The fascinating thing here is that it is not a pornographic film that seeks to generate excitement like many others. It is a film with a quite relevant plot. This is a porn movie that can be watched from start to finish without the need to masturbate. Rather it is a disturbing and uncomfortable film when you see it accompanied by someone. In the sexual part he manages to get it right very well as was the sexual freedom that existed in ancient Rome. What it would have taken was more violence and gore to maintain balance and the film would have been an excellent representation of that Roman era. The technical details of the film are quite appreciable. It has very good production design, good photography, good direction, good editing, and an excellent soundtrack. It's not a movie for everyone, but at least it's a pornographic movie that can be enjoyed for its story and not so much for its sex scenes. My final rating for this movie is 9/10."

Sadness, because Caligula is, in fact, a fascinating historical character (even if, in truth, there's not much known about him) about whom a truly good movie could be made, and sadness because producer Bob Guccione clearly went the extra mile and actually put together a pretty decent cast featuring the likes of a young Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, supported by a young Helen Mirren as his wife, and backed up by solid veteran actors Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud - all of whom, with talents pooled, could have done a pretty good job with a serious production. Ah - but the clear warning sign is that this movie was indeed produced by Bob Guccione, better known as the publisher of Penthouse Magazine. Guccione manages to take some snippets from history (admittedly not necessarily true, because much about Caligula is unknown, and much of what is \"known\" may well be legends and propaganda spread by his enemies) such as Caligula trying to make his horse a priest, and Caligula's supposedly incestuous relationship with his sister, up to and including Caligula's assassination but then he does little more than use the barebones historical record as a backdrop for what this was really about - a chance to give a degree of credibility to a movie that was about nudity and sex. I wouldn't call it porn - not even soft-core - because there was nothing particularly explicit depicted, but the nudity was everywhere. I'm sure this served as an opportunity to highlight a few \"Penthouse Pets\" of the era.\n\nI went into this with my eyes open. I knew it was produced by Guccione and Penthouse Films. I watched it out of curiosity mostly, and for a while it's interesting in a bizarre and even comedic sort of way. But I have to say that at a certain point - certainly by the halfway point, if not sooner - this literally became painful to watch. I suppose Guccione deserves some credit for the audacity involved in putting this out and assembling the cast he put together (although one wonders why well known actors such as Gielgud and O'Toole would be bothered with this) but audacity does not make a good movie. At least, it certainly didn't in this case."

The very fact that Rome allowed this nut to take and hold power explains why Rome fell even after 1000 years of glory and purportedly this was due to of all things lead poisoning! It appears Rome used a lot of lead in their drinking cups and this caused extreme insanity and eventually death which affected many of their Imperial Emperors like Caligula.

From what I can tell Tinto Brass delivered a good version of CALIGULA before the studio got its claws into it. The scene with a dying John Gielgud being questioned by Malcolm McDowell about immortality is too good to be in the picture. The wedding scene is also excessive, but it still looks like it was shot for a movie and not a porno. The scene where Caligula is ill and a senator says he'll give his life if Caligula may be well again, not expecting the fatal results, is the best in the film. What's wrong? Bob Guccione thought it would be a good idea to gut a movie and then fill in the empty space with random sex. There's so much damned sex that after a while stops being shocking or arousing; it just gets boring. I'd love to see the original film, but the final cut is still a piece of s**t. Perhaps it's still a movie to see, but not a movie you'd admit you'd seen."

Building on his performance in the earlier 'A Clockwork Orange', he invests the character of Caligula with wit, sarcasm, and psychosis. His portrayal is pure evil. In support are such luminaries as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who are both memorable.\n\nBut the story meanders around, and other than a few pieces which remain in the mind - the prisoners and the cutting machine being one (I think I've remembered that correctly), it doesn't really go anywhere and leaves a bit of a nasty taste in the mouth.\n\nWorth watching once, but even that is a bit of a chore. Not deserving of all the fuss that's been heaped upon it in the most recent DVD edition."

        "review_title": "Cut and uncut versions",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is available in the UK \u0096 often in bargain bins \u0096 a heavily cut version, though still rated 18, coming in at just under 100 minutes, losing an hour from the \"cinema release\" listed here at 156.\n\nThat cut version I saw years ago on British television (where it may have had further seconds shaved off). But now, with the wonders of international mail order and multi-region DVD players, I've seen it uncut. How does it compare? First reaction; astonishment that they rescued 98 minutes of material both broadcast-able yet retaining some narrative coherence. The sex and nudity is so pervasive. Even where characters are explaining critical plot developments \u0096 as with the young Caligula's talk with Tiberius \u0096 there's things going on behind them. And though the sex generally has some point, some of the nudity is hilariously irrelevant. Where increasingly deranged Caligula launches a play-acting invasion on an imaginary Britain, the attacking troops are bafflingly nude (and splendid chaps they all seem to be too, hundreds of them). Earlier in the film, as Caligula makes his way to his audience with Tiberius, we pass a road-mending gang also in the nude. Why? This isn't a matter of prudery, just prudence. I know the Roman Empire was more casual than we are nowadays about health and safety in the workplace, but with all those pickaxes and shards of rock flying around, a little bit of elementary protection for a worker's dangly bits would have been just commonsense.\n\nWhat about the sex? I don't watch porn films as such, but I've got access to the internet and I've seen modern films like Empire of the Senses, Nine Songs, and Baise-moi. I was all ready to adopt a bored indifference. But by the end, I have to admit I was a bit shaken. There's just so much of it, both relentlessly through the film, and simultaneously. It's that last point more than anything that counts. Alright, you can tell I've never been invited to an orgy. But while no single act portrayed represents anything that hasn't been seen on screen before, I wasn't expecting quite so much of it, all in the same room and at the same time. I can't pretend I wasn't impressed.\n\nBut what was the point of it? Some people here compare it to Pasolini's Salo, and I think that's instructive. I'm not sure Salo is a good film, but its moral and political purpose is clear, which is to chart the corruption of fascism. It achieves its effects by a gradual escalation of depravity reaching a shattering conclusion. Whether successful or not, it certainly disturbs and haunts the imagination. The defence of Caligula, presumably, works similarly; it is a portrayal of decadence and corruption and the political forms accompanying it. But if so, it simply doesn't work; for two reasons, I think.\n\nFirstly (a fault it shares with Salo) it is too hermetic, and doesn't explain enough about the social and political background against which this depravity takes place. Secondly, it is just too relentless. For example, towards the end, we see Caligula deliberately insulting and humiliating the senators by prostituting their wives in a specially built state brothel, which is a key event in crystallising the coup against Caligula. But the outrage is unconvincing. The wives themselves don't seem to mind, approaching their duties, largely oral on this occasion, with no more nor less enthusiasm than anything else they've done. \"Oh, come on\", the viewer protests, \"you're all at it all the time anyway; how does this make it any worse?\". And sure enough, the senators on hand seem merely peeved rather than outraged.\n\nThe film fails too as a personal portrayal of the corruption of Caligula. Here Caligula is corrupt from the outset, despised and suspected by the honourable Nerva, and admiringly described by the dying Tiberius as a \"viper nurtured in the bosom of Rome\". There is no sense of any process of undermining early ideals or even innocence; his behaviour just gradually gets even more and more transgressive. It isn't helped by a performance by Malcolm McDowell (who I've frequently admired elsewhere) that seems to come straight from \"Carry On Caligula\". His humiliation of Proculus and his bride-to-be ought to be seriously disturbing, but instead just comes on like a pantomime villain.\n\nIs the film a spectacle (other than as an orgy)? Allegedly it cost some $15 million dollars but one can only imagine that most of that was spent on persuading enormous numbers of extras to \"do it\" on camera. The sets are astonishingly stage-bound, many scenes opening with the same establishing shot with a flat ornate backdrop (niches, marble panels etc.) and the furniture and props laid out left-to-right in front of it. You can almost see the imaginary proscenium arch framing it. Most of the film takes place indoors, yet there is no sense of space or layout in the buildings involved; just a succession of stage sets. When the characters started to enter and leave rooms by ducking behind curtains, I laughed out loud, as I was simply reminded of an Ed Wood spaceship. The outdoor shots fail to open the film out in any way either. The arena of the grisly beheading machine is particularly claustrophobic, bound by the same four-square geometry that ties so many other scenes to the strict dimensions of the screen.\n\nAm I glad I saw the full length version? Yes, but then I'm always interested in seeing the extremes of film-making. Is this film successful? No; a monstrous folly. Is it porn? Of course; just because it represents a failed genre \u0096 attempting to import porn into mainstream cinema \u0096 doesn't mean it isn't porn. Good porn? You'll have to ask the man in the dirty mac; I'd guess only intermittently.\n\nBut it deserves a few stars just for the sheer bravado of its folly."

Although I wonder how the theatrical cut is? Then again, they would have to cut so much out ... the movie would seem weird to say the least.\n\nStill apparently there is another version to be released which is closer to the version it was supposed to be and one that Malcolm McDowell might like more (and maybe I will too). As Malcolm says (in the entertaining and very open audion commentary), there is a hidden gem here. There is also a lot of other things that are dirty and reprehensible. It will be tough to watch, with almost no redeeming character around to root for ... maybe the sister (Drusila, I wonder if Josh Wheddon was thinking of her when he named the character in Buffy) - but even she is no Angel! She looks like one, but what debauchery, what impure activities ... and more.\n\nOne of the versions released had hardcore scenes in it.

Believe me, it's not necessary to be a puritan to hate \"Caligola\".\n\nThis awful movie, which is artistically poor and technically ridiculously amateurish, would have been soon forgotten wouldn't it be for the numerous sex images and, sadly, the presence of some good actors. How they got involved, I have no idea.\n\nWhat is it? Basically, a porn movie, with an unbelievable sophomoric pretention at making \"art\". Ah! Art? My God! Poor direction, amateurish and laughable cinematography (so dull I first thought it was on purpose!), contrived scenography, inexistant sense of unity... no art whatsoever. Not even competence. Only bombastic pretention and the desire to shock the audience... so immature.\n\nIt tries to compete with Fellini's \"Satyricon\", Ken Russel's \"The Devils\", Pasolini's \"Salo\"... but all of these movies, wether one likes them or not, have inherent artistic and technical qualities that \"Caligola\" totally lacks. Showing more sex and violence doesn't make up for the emptiness of the project.\n\nBut maybe, the snobbish have here an opportunity to openly watch a porn flick, with the excuse of \"art\". I feel sorry for them, not only because they need this kind of excuse to assume their libido, but also because defending this movie is revealing such a bad taste that in the end, it's worse than openly looking at porn movies. My opinion, though.\n\nAnyway this must be one of the most ridiculous films I've came across, and because of its incredible pretention, I'd say it's maybe the worse movie I ever saw. I can't be tolerant towards incompetence and mediocrity when it's pretending to be art. No mercy for the phoney!"

The aesthetics of the set designs and the costumes are absolutely beautiful, and the story is actually very interesting and intriguing. I also particularly enjoyed the character development of Caligula himself in the film, and despite all the horrid things he did throughout, really made me feel somewhat bad for him by the end.\n\nI would've absolutely loved this film if it weren't for all the unnecessary sex, however. It just absolutely ruined the film for me, and I ended up sitting through some of these scenes just for the dialogue I did not want to miss spliced in.\n\nThe gore I didn't mind as much, it was brutal as all hell and quite shocking in a few scenes, but that's really not a negative for me.\n\nOverall, I believe this would be an absolutely fantastic film if it weren't for the large amount of sex scenes spliced in.

Helen Mirren again is wasted and like the rest of the female cast spends most of her time baring her pubic hair and breasts.\n\nAlong with the full frontal nudity we see, there are scenes of masturbation, ejaculations, lesbianism, anal fisting, castration, graphic stabbing scenes, explicit genital closeups, erections and labia and to top it all of shots of babies being fed through phallic-shaped bottles., Its a mess.\n\nThe only credit I will give the film is I've now seen it, and the soundtrack Sergei Prokofiev's \"Romeo & Juliet.\" plays at the beginning and the music of Khachaturian \"Spartacus\" or more popularity known as the theme to The Onedin Line, is great although its source from Spartacus only serves to highlight the lack of originality from the film producers.\n\nI believe Bruno Nicolai scored the music, but I can't detect any music of any worth so its a waste of the Italian and he should have stuck to scoring spaghetti westerns.\n\nTo give the film a little credit it presumably depicts the decadence of Caligula's reign. Like all decadent regimes it will fall, and be made into a film, be it Sadam Hussain in the Devil Double's, Hitler in Downfall or the more recent Partygate in which Boris Johnson's corrupt Tory party, party whilst the plebs are placated and are kept in their place.\n\nLittle tongue in cheek politics there, I think you'll agree.\n\nI'm not allowed by the gods of IMDB to give zero stars so it's 1/10 for Helen Mirren who managed to build a career after this mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "I gave this film a seven. How can I defend this, when any other comment will mention its tastelessness, depravity, etc.?\n\nWell, I defend it based purely on the fact that it's historically accurate. Some liberties are taken, but for the most part, this movie captures Caligula's story. However, this also means that Caligula's sadistic, bestial nature, and that of the Roman era as a whole, are also very disturbingly rendered.\n\nFor those who don't know, Caius Caligula was one of the Caesars of Rome, its highest official. Caligula was widely believed to have ascended to the position by murdering the previous Caesar, his own uncle. Once in control, he went on a sad, cruel and twisted rule that saw mass beheadings, permissible sexual depravity, and flat out cruelty to even those close to the man himself. Caligula had an incestuous relationship with his own sister, had murdered his own friends and co-conspirators, and I believe he willed all his possessions to be given to his horse.\n\nSo, Caligula the film stays true to the facts. That alone would make this a disturbing film. What compounds the issue is the fact that it was co-financed by Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine, and as a result every effort to show lewd and tasteless behavior is taken. In the uncut version, you will see hundreds of completely nude men and women involved in sexual acts with each other, and with themselves. You'll see men on men, women on women. A slain man is urinated on by 2 women, onscreen. A man has his vital organ sliced off and fed to dogs (onscreen, but fake this time). There is suggested rape, item-oriented sexual assault, and things even more disturbing such as twitching, apparent mutants engaging in said behavior as well.\n\nTherein lies the problem. The line of genuine reproduction and smut for smut's sake was crossed, and crossed fast. There are actually only a handful of sex scenes in the movie (all of them very graphic and equal to any of today's pornos). But the bulk of the tasteless stuff is arbitrarily shown in between regular scenes. So, you don't just get a bunch of story followed by bizarre sex, but instead you watch as main characters discuss regular topics and are then disturbed when the camera randomly cuts to an image of extreme sexual behavior. Much of it is irrelevant, and that's where the intent of the film is blurred by its porno roots.\n\nAlthough I'm not a regular watcher, I've seen porn before. And if you are curious about this movie to see if it has any comparably sexy scenes, there is certainly stuff to catch your interest. But for th0e casual viewer, it's wise to stay away from this one because so much of it IS genuine porn, and much of the random cuts show stuff that are in the most specific of weird porn genres. That's a shame to me, because I was interested in the Caligula story and wanted to see a good rendition of it. I did get it, and I was also surprised to some very alluring imagery. But that was offput by all the random, disturbing stuff that I would have preferred not to see.\n\nThe acting is fine, McDowell does an admirable job just being a nutcase throughout most of the film. The set design is great, as are the costumes. It's clear that a lot of money went into this, but it's hard to speak too highly of the end result.\n\nSo why do I give the film a 7? Well, plainly put, it is what it says it is. It is Rome at its sleaziest, with its most depraved of operators at the helm. I didn't rent it expecting a porno, and was pleasantly surprised by some of what I saw. But then the rest of it, the overabundance of juxtaposed weird stuff, was off-putting and unwanted, and unfortunately does take up a significant chunk of screen time. My advice is to see it if you're curious to see just how much weird sexual stuff is in there, or to see an unashamedly graphic portrayal of the subject. Everyone else is urged to steer clear, because this is not a typical Hollywood docu-drama, and you'll be made uncomfortable if you're not prepared for what it contains."

To be honest, the film would be full of hard core sex, S&M, Incest, Violence and Madness because that is the way Caligola turned out. This film was a mess. Bad script, the acting was pure bad 70's.\n\nBut the subject matter is a difficult one to transfer to the cinema back then, I guess Bob thought doing it the old pornography way was the way to do it. I believe with the technology and filmmakers of late, they could show you what Caligola's life was like, his rule was like and have it come out a heck of alot better than this mess."

This film was very beautiful and fantastic and quite an ambitious project for its time. Its just an art-house film with lots of nudity and sex. No different that would you would see today but with accurate historical elements. If all you see is porn or all you want to see it porn here, you must be looking for pornography and I suggest you rent porn. This is a cinematic achievement. The sets, the acting, the story, make up- all in all- a good product. Most, who are in themselves puritans, would see this as porn for they have no sense of what artistic expression really involves. If there is nudity, it must be porn, right? wrong! Sex, nudity, the human naked or nude body, aroused or not, and all that encompasses it can be quite artistic and it is shown here with various degrees of visual artistry. If you want to rent this film because you'd like to see porn for sexual stimulation then why not rent a real porn that has no story or artistic value. Pornographic material ultimate goal is to stimulate you to orgasm. I hardly think that was the point of Caligula. So please, be less illiterate and ignorant for there is some history going on here both for its time, 1979, and as a period piece from pagan Rome."

It runs (in its unrated version) 155 minutes, the plotting is poor and there isn't even one sane character in sight, to draw us in. And yet, you are never bored. You just sit there stupefied, wondering how far it's willing to push the limits of your tolerance (and of good taste!). It's a bizarre hybrid of gore, sex and historical drama; the different parts don't connect well at all, so the graphic depictions of oral sex and rape, for example, seem to come out of nowhere. As for the acting, McDowell is actually pretty good, John Gielgud keeps his dignity (and departs early on) and Teresa Ann Savoy is quite luscious as Caligula's sister, but Peter O'Toole hits an all-time low with a brief but shameful performance.\n\nAll in all, this movie IS worth seeing, if you are prepared for some of the most inconceivably and jaw-droppingly graphic sex scenes you'll ever see in a non-purely pornographic film (the violence is also strong, but not THAT strong). If you do manage to make it to the end, you can tell other people you've seen it and feel like some kind of winner."

I remember reading how much Roger Ebert despised this film and then hearing that it was Brad Jones' (Cinema Snob) favorite movie. It's so ridiculous because all he did in his review was talk about how horrible it was.\n\nThis movie may have at least been tolerable if not for the fact that it goes on forever. It might be the longest porn movie ever made. You could have trimmed all the nudity out to make this an hour and a half. The film becomes too predictable, being nothing but sex scenes over and over. The acting and dubbing is quite poor too. As far as I know, this is in fact a historically accurate film. I don't know quite that much about the real life Caligula. It doesn't matter, because it's awful any way. I consider myself open to new ideas, which is why I saw this. I will now never watch a feature length porn movie the rest of my life!

        "review_detailed_main": "A film that announces how bad it is is something of a kind of luxury for us film buffs who are almost expecting it. Sometimes a movie's awfulness will creep up on a viewer after a while, or one will be worked up by the possibility of it being decent or memorable. Caligula may be memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. It's the prime example of what happens when someone mistakes artistic merit (or lack thereof) with a porno. There were, perhaps, some good intentions going into it: make the most vile, exposed account of the rule of Caligula, one of the most notorious \"Gods\" in history. Show the sex, show the violence, show the rampant horror of an emperor/Caesar gone awry. And cast some good actors- real actors- in the chief roles, actors like Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, and, um, others I guess. And get a director whose directed some stuff (not sure what, but who cares, he can direct, kind of) to helm the production.\n\nBut the conflict came not even so much when the producer, Bob Guccione of Penthouse, didn't go up to the director Tinto Brass and ask \"why aren't you directing with more competency? This \"epic\" looks like an exploitation flick, and not in a good way\", but in Guccione's own profit motive. He was confused, and so was the film - how does one sell a film with such prestige actors and a notorious character, but ALSO sell it to the company that one works for? What happened was the footage that Brass shot was taken away from him and the producer and his editors took lots and lots of footage of explicit nature (cunnilingus, fellatio, orgy, regular and anal sex), and spliced in footage where it either wasn't needed or became extraneous. As if to further dig it to Brass, they used the *bad* takes, ones that weren't supposed to be used, for the majority of the action.\n\nHaving the sexual footage wouldn't have been so bad if a) the explicit sex wasn't so dull and repetitive (as, say, a typical porno turns up to be), and b) the rest of the movie around it wasn't so excruciating. It's also distracting at certain points that have some promise to be better than it is, for example a morose three-some between Caligula, Drusilla and Caesonia that has the potential to be erotic... but the Guccione cuts away constantly to a female orgy behind the curtains. It's a stupid call to make, untrusting, in fact, of either the audience there to see the actors, or those handful of folks watching it simply to get off. If Guccione really was cutting the film together for the latter, he also failed because someone watching it just to get off would turn off the film before it ends.\n\nThe dialog, written by a distanced-from-the-production Gore Vidal, is turgid most often, and other times is just barely passable as being able to be spoken. And for all of the extravagance of the sets and costumes, the production feels cluttered and excessive. And the extreme acts shown in the film, and believe me, there are many (some with McDowell like the \"deflowering\" of the virgins, or the cutting off of the man's crotch, or the giant saw-machine cutting off heads), are done in a slack exploitation style that doesn't even excite on the basis of blood and guts and things. It's one thing to muck up usual things like acting and dialog, but another, if one is a exploitation director, to muck up visceral pleasures. It's too self-serious to be campy, and too graphic to make it in an art-house for too long.\n\nSo why the four-out-of-ten rating? Malcolm McDowell, really. He knows he's taking a p***, so to speak, but he does have fun with a role that requires that much. His other contemporaries- O'Toole and Gielgud- barely have enough screen time to show much, though they look bored or just befuddled to even be on the production, and Helen Mirren, while attractive and competent in the role, doesn't add much to the production. But McDowell seems to get it, of how to go over the top (or even in the struggle to find a top to over this case), and there are some scenes where he's very funny, like when he gets his senators to bah like sheep, or when he shuffles through papers to sign with his seal. If nothing else, McDowell makes this mess watchable, and, sporadically, very entertaining.\n\nBut even he can't save a troubled production. It's troubled from the first scene on, and it rarely gets to a point that the makers thought they would achieve. It's not good art, it's not good porn, it's not even good exploitaton. It's just... a fascinating blob of a movie."

The point though is decadence and nothing else. No insight, no exploration of character or theme.\n\nSo, it's a very badly made film, but still interesting. It holds your attention.

        "review_detailed_main": "I finally succumbed to the hoop-la and decided to watch this movie, just to say I did.\n\nGore and pornography aside, this movie's greatest weakness was that Caligula was simply not an interesting person. He was the Uday Hussein of the classical era; a sadistic and emotionally stunted 15-year-old in a man's body. There was never any intelligence or forethought to his brutality, it was purely random. That alone might make a movie interesting for an hour or so, but after that it just gets boring. Watching Caligula for 2-1/2 hours was like watching a child slowly pulling the legs and wings off insects.\n\nFor the first half of the movie there is a rather competent storyline (which is repeatedly interrupted by scenes of gratuitous porn that appear to have been added after the fact for no apparent reason), but beyond that it's just one scene after the next of a deranged man-child laughingly dishing out sadistic punishments to whomever happened to be standing around him.\n\nThe first 30 minutes or so are well worth watching. Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) was Caligula's predecessor, and he was a much more fascinating character. One gets the idea that he started out as a wise and noble leader that slowly went mad over time, and that would have been a much more worthy subject for a movie of this magnitude.\n\nAfter nearly 2 hours I had all I could stand and fast-forwarded thru the rest."

Clearly this very controversial film has attracted much more interest than many outstanding films that were released at about the same time, and this is presumably a direct result of its controversial content. Some information relating to the production of this film has become common knowledge and is referred to by several of the users who have provided comments for this database, nevertheless when the whole story is told, it will form a very interesting account of how not to create a great film. It appears that there are at least three often incompatible threads contributing to the film as it was finally released. The original script was an attempt to provide a framework for a historically accurate account of life at the Roman court during the reign of a mad emperor. This script was sufficiently complete to enable many fine stars to be signed up for major parts, but when filming began the Director, Tinto Brass, chose to exploit all the violent parts of his story to such an extent that several of the cast became very dissatisfied. John Gielgud for example who gave a very fine performance as Senator Nerva, later commented publicly that he wished he had had nothing to do with this film, even though his contribution to it must certainly have enhanced his reputation. Then we are told that prior to its release Bob Guccione, one of the principal backers, decided the excessive violence was so distasteful the film as produced would be a major flop. He therefore insisted on adding to it a large amount of additional sexual material, including the highly controversial lesbian action scenes, which did not readily fit in with the original story, but which he felt would increase its general appeal.\n\nHow far all this is true may be hard to tell, but there is no doubt that some parts of the final film do not blend well with others. Whatever ones personal inclinations and tastes, there will be parts of the film to satisfy them, whilst other parts of it are likely to be offensive. Depending upon which parts one feels are most important, it is as easy to defend it as a great work as to condemn it as pornographic garbage.\n\nSex and violence are both part of everyday life and therefore must have a place in many films. Fortunately most people enjoy a considerable amount of sexual activity but relatively few experience serious personal violence. Unfortunately current moral standards have meant that the latter is exploited far more often in films than the former, which immediately creates a distortion of normal life. The problem with Caligula is not that it faithfully reflects the violence that was a part of everyday life at the time, but that it concentrates on and emphasises this in a totally unrepresentative way which panders to any sadistic instincts that we may have. Its period is now historically fairly distant, and when we watch it we develop a self righteous glow because the standards of our own society have advanced such a long way during the intervening period. We do not think of the many modern dictators such as Hitler, Idi Amin or Sadaam Hussein who have recently behaved in just the ways portrayed by Caligula in this film. A film that would make us do this could be a great work of art.\n\nUltimately Caligula is an appalling film as it is designed to pander to the worst instincts in each of us. There is a really great film within it which we sometimes see struggling to get out. But unfortunately it is never given the opportunity to do so. The rating I give it would depend upon whether it is being rated simply to guide readers as to its possible interest to them, or whether the rating is intended to recognise how far the film is successful as a work of art. In the former case my rating would be 1 on the 1-10 scale. In the latter case this film deserves some credit for attempting to display Roman court life with a semblance of historical veracity, rather than simply showing it as an ongoing sexual orgy liberally decorated by Penthouse pets (this would have been much easier to do and might have brought in better returns). It also merits credit for some fine acting from a few members of the cast such as John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole. On this basis I would reluctantly give it a rating of 3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This comment refers to the unrated 156 min. version. Although I haven't seen \"Boogie Nights,\" from reading about it, it seems that in the late '70's there was some thought that porn could go mainstream. \"Caligula\" should be seen as an effort to further that idea. Well, we all know that didn't happen. But, I think that's why the porn scenes were included. Otherwise, this film unsatisfactorily straddles two incompatible markets. Many people will be offended by the explicit scenes, but there aren't nearly enough of them to satisfy the porn crowd. Perhaps that's also why some major stars appeared in this film. It may have been unclear at the time what the ultimate limits of sex in mainstream films would end up being. \"Caligula\" answered that question, the answer being \"Not that far.\"\n\nAbout the film. Direction was fairly poor. The script could have been better. Within these limitations, most of the cast did very well. Malcolm McDowell nailed the part. Peter O'Toole played it a bit over the top, but how could he resist. Sir John Gielgud maintained his dignity, as he always did. I haven't seen Teresa Ann Savoy anywhere else, but she certainly was beautiful, and did OK. Helen Mirren was great. No, the film wasn't totally historically accurate, but it's a historical drama, not a documentary. I saw men sitting at tables to eat, and to a Roman, only barbarians did not lie down to eat. I never saw an accurate-looking toga, either. Although Caligula often wore deep red, which is likely what the ancients referred to as purple.\n\nA historical note to a previous comment. Caligula wasn't the last of the \"legitimate\" Roman emperors, meaning those with some familial ties to Gaius Julius Caesar. He was followed by Claudius, and then Nero, who was the last emperor related in any way to Caesar. Afterward, the emperor was usually whoever could amass the most military power.\n\nOverall, this film is OK. There are some disturbing, and even offensive images. There are some good acting performances, limited by direction, writing, and some cheesy sets. The violence is not really any worse than that occurring in the average slasher movie today. It has some (cinematic) historical value as the failed attempt at merging porn with other filmmaking."

Waste of time unless you are a die-hard fan of those 4 actors. If so, then have your fast forward button at the ready....and put the women and children to bed first!!!"

I can't believe so many people are defending it on here, saying \"this is the way it was.\" Those people must have seen the cut version. The version I saw is straight up porno.\n\nI seriously doubt everywhere the real Caligula went he was surrounded by people having a giant orgy or masturbating. It would be like making a movie about JFK or MLK and just focusing on their sex lives, just showing them screwing women for 2 hours as though they never did anything else. (Although both those guys could give Caligula stiff competition in the sleaze department) On the plus side the sets are great and Malcolm McDowell is the perfect person to play Caligula. He looks like him and is no stranger to full frontal nudity and playing sleazy crazy characters. And Peter O'Toole has never looked better though for an Italian production you would expect more Italian actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had watched this on late-night TV while on a visit to London in September 2002; it transpired to have not been the full-length version, since I don\u2019t recall the hardcore footage found here. Anyway, the film is still perhaps mainstream cinema\u2019s biggest folly: while Gore Vidal\u2019s original screenplay may have been interesting, the end result lumbers on for 2\u00bd hours for no particular reason except to wallow in its repellent excesses but proves to be extremely dull, even annoying, into the bargain!\n\nDespite some imposing credentials, it\u2019s little more than an extended home movie from the people at \u201cPenthouse\u201d magazine: director Brass was only credited with \u201cPrincipal Photography\u201d since he objected to Lui and Guccione\u2019s \u201cadditional footage\u201d \u2013 which, apparently, boils down to little more than six minutes of no-holds-barred hardcore stuff! Danilo Donati (famed for his equally garish and overblown collaborations with Federico Fellini) serves as art director/costume designer \u2013 the film itself recalls the vilified later work of Pier Paolo Pasolini (with editing by Nino Baragli, no less) and, of course, anticipates the recent controversy caused by the ultra-realistic ROME TV series. The music, at least, includes judicious excerpts from the classical work of Aram Khachaturyan and Sergei Prokofiev; incidentally, according to the IMDb, the Paul Clemente listed as the film\u2019s composer is a pseudonym for Bruno Nicolai\u2026which is a quite fitting credit, given that he often worked for another notorious purveyor of sex \u2013 Jesus Franco!\n\nAs for the cast, Malcolm McDowell re-affirms his tendency towards hamminess when not guided by master film-makers such as Lindsay Anderson and Stanley Kubrick (another notorious contemporaneous effort I had watched and should re-acquaint myself with in the near-future is the star-studded war drama THE PASSAGE [1979]) \u2013 he\u2019s got the right intensity for the title role but is visibly ill-at-ease with the sex scenes (intending to stress the era\u2019s utter decadence, more often than not these prove a distraction from the main plot) and particularly embarrassing when breaking into an inane dance routine. Perhaps mercifully, the thespian skills of Peter O\u2019Toole (as a demented and sore-riddled Tiberius, appearing much older than his 47 years) and John Gielgud (as the latter\u2019s counselor who opts for the easy way out rather than serve Caligula) are on display for only the first 40 minutes or so of this debacle. Also on hand are a number of notable regulars of Italian cinema \u2013 namely Leopoldo Trieste, Paolo Bonacelli (another Pasolini alumnus) and a campy bald-headed John Steiner. The ladies \u2013 led by Teresa Ann Savoy (sharing an incestuous relationship with her brother the Emperor) and Helen Mirren (as Caligula\u2019s wife, dubbed \u201cthe most promiscuous woman in Rome\u201d) and including several \u201cPenthouse\u201d starlets doing their thing \u2013 provide the expected glamor and titillation, though male nudity is just as much in continual evidence.\n\nAnother sensationalistic aspect to the film is its level of gore, occasionally demonstrated in inventive fashion \u2013 none more so than in the solitary arena sequence where prisoners are buried in sand apart from their head, which is summarily lopped off by a cumbersome machine fitted with deadly blades! Following the bloodthirsty assassination of Caligula and his entire family by his closest associates, his obese and effeminate uncle Claudius is made Emperor; incidentally, I should be acquiring the celebrated I, CLAUDIUS (1976) TV series \u2013 with Derek Jacobi in the title role and John Hurt as Caligula \u2013 soon enough\u2026and, eventually, I\u2019ll presently be getting to Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s other epic about the Roman Empire \u2013 MASADA (1981), itself a TV mini-series!"

I finally got my hands on the Uncut Director's Edition of \"Caligula.\" I can only assume that some of the folks on here saying that this movie is not that pornographic have only seen some chopped up, edited version. It is most definitely porn. We see lots of BJ's and tons of straight up sex. Lots of it appears to have been spliced in after the fact and does nothing for the movie at all.\n\nThe costumes and the sets here are atrocious. It's something like \"Planet of the Apes\" meets \"Clash of the Titans\" meets \"Masters of the Universe\" (the one with Dolph Lundgren) meets some random, off-Broadway play. Too many scenes are filmed on what is just a plain, black stage with cheesy backdrops. The props are awful and embarrassing.\n\nThere are a few good gore scenes, but nothing that will impress an Italian horror buff or a gorehound. It's mostly just naked men and women lounging around and getting each other off. It was all very disgusting and certainly not a turn on. Couldn't see beatin' it to this flick, call me crazy!\n\nMalcolm McDowell delivers a great performance but he basically does little Alex from \"A Clockwork Orange\" again here. It's not hard to see how he went down the 'straight to sci-fi channel' road after this one. Helen Mirren is non-existent really and Peter O'Toole is not in it very long, so these comments about the 'big name stars' are a little silly.\n\nOverall, I expected a lot more gore and disturbing scenes. They just aren't there. The ending was pretty cool though, I like how they hoist up the halfwit to be the new Ceasar.\n\nI'd have to recommend a ton of films before this one if you want disturbing. I struggled to stay awake to tell you the truth.\n\n3 out of 10, kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the review on the main page, it is noted that, \"adultery was an offense punishable by death.\" This is mainly misleading, but also wrong.\n\nAdultery really was an offense punishable by death but certain conditions needed to be met. First, though not a condition, was that adultery was an argument by a citizen used as a defense of murder, not to bring someone to trial. The most important condition that was that adultery was defined as sexual relations between a married woman and a man not her husband. The marriage had to be recognized by the state, which required citizenship. Women were rarely granted full citizenship, almost never to any woman born outside the highest levels of the nobility. Finally (not actually finally but enough to make the point) full citizenship was pretty uncommon in ancient Rome--Rome is estimated to have had at it's height a population of over 1 million people (around 450,000 by some estimates) but no more than 60,000 citizens (by any estimate). Foreigners and slaves had no citizenship, and residents of allied cities could be granted various rights below full citizenship with marriages that weren't always recognized.\n\nSo, you might ask, what does all this mean? Adulterers weren't put to trial, they were killed on the spot, which provided both vengeance to the one whose rights were violated (the spouse of the adulterer) and proof of the crime. It was nearly impossible for women to charge for adultery since they were granted full citizenship so rarely. It was almost as difficult for male Roman citizens to be charged with adultery since no more than 60,000 of 600,000 women in Rome could be married to Roman citizens (military service and a frequent state of war created a tremendous imbalance in population balance between the sexes, and while the 60,000 is a fair estimate, the 600,000 could be quite low). Last (again not last, just the same as above) is that there was a massive women's population available for the act of adultery where the crime didn't apply.\n\nIf you were a female in Rome the crime only mattered to you, except in rare cases, if you married to a citizen and you were guilty of the crime. If you were a male and noble-born, it was a defense for the murder of your wife and her lover, except in rare cases. If you were male and not noble-born, it was a crime that you could be involved in and for which you would be killed on the spot (again, except in rare cases).\n\nIt's more accurate to say that 'adultery was an offense against noble-born males which gave them an excuse to kill their wives and lovers.'\n\nOh yeah-the only reason to watch Caligula is to see what all the fuss was about. Without the fuss it would have been forgotten long ago."

As for the others, I will not watch anything they produce either. To see John Gielgud in this movie was a shock. It was no surprise to see the whacko Peter O'Toole.

The sets are big and beautiful, yet also possess a keen sense of grime growing over the amoral decadence of this vision of Ancient Rome. The actors are all spectacular, especially Malcolm McDowell as a man who slowly loses his soul to power lust and hubris. Had this movie been closer to its original inception, many might have said it's one of his finest moments as an actor.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the snippets of greatness can save the film in its final incarnation. The soft-core pornography repeatedly interrupts the plot. You get the feeling that as originally conceived, the sex was meant to be more gross and impersonal than arousing, more a display of the animalistic side of the people in power. But the problem is there are many scenes where the sex is clearly supposed to arouse the audience and it's just... boring. You sit through orgy after orgy, waiting to get back to the story.\n\nYes, even the lowest depravity gets old after awhile."

McDowell is a good actor, he does his best to portray the mad emperor convincingly. Peter O'Toole is really great as Tiberius: for me, he is the ultimate highlight of this film.

During the first part of his reign he seemed to be doing okay and then the madness crept in and it was characterized by cruelty, sadism, extravagance, sexual perversion and this seems to be what the movie is based on. And while these records are highly suspect, there is literally not a lot of information out there about the man although he did try to increase his power and was eventually killed by his own guard.\n\nBut that doesn't really matter because where else are you going to see giants of the British screen and theater in the same movie playing Romans and chewing the scenery?\n\nMalcolm McDowell is great at playing the crazed psycho no matter what the role is. He's utterly charming and has this devilish look on his face when he's contemplating something. Truly a sight to behold.\n\nThe sets and cinematography are top notch. The actors are all on their game, the dialogue might be a little trite and yes, there is actual porn going on in some scenes. Bob Guccione, of Penthouse magazine, was one of the producers and literally spliced in some scenes of hardcore pornography. Well, maybe hardcore is taking things a little far. There's definitely nudity both male and female, there's a lesbian scene which literally adds nothing to the plot and in the scene where Caligula creates the brothel there are real people actually having sex. You can't see much but you don't really want to. Seriously in today's day and age it's much easier to get your hands on actual porn if that's what you're looking for.\n\nIn the end this ode to pagan Rome while it has it's moments is known more for it's notoriety than what actually goes on in the movie. I'd suggest it if for no other reason than to say you've seen it."

A sensationalized film about him could also be worth viewing in its own right. This, however, is neither of those things.\n\nThis is about Caligula, certainly. The actors hired to actually act in this are quite good, including of course the unmistakable Malcolm McDowell, and the commanding screen presence of Peter O'Toole. As others have remarked, some of the set pieces are actually rather impressive. The screenplay had potential, even taking into account the extreme violence and focus on sex.\n\nYet if Katherine Hepburn starred in a modern teen comedy, and gave the best performance of her life, and if the sets of that comedy were the most beautiful creations since Tarsem Singh's 'The fall,' it still would only be a teen comedy, with all the cheap and shoddily written jokes and otherwise hackneyed acting we usually get from such movies.\n\nAnd so it is with 'Caligula' as any possible value of the film is subsumed by the hardcore porn. It seems fairly well established in the lore of this production that even despite financing by Penthouse, it was only after the likes of McDowell and O'Toole gave their performances that additional footage was inserted to make this the extremely pornographic feature that it is. And if that's your thing, well, good for you. But graphic and explicit sex scenes do not of themselves make a good movie, nor necessarily contribute to one.\n\nit's been years since I've watched this, so I suppose it says something that it has still stuck with me. Yet I recall very well too that having watched this in high school, during the time that I worked at a video store with 'Caligula' on its shelves, I took this home to view specifically because I thought I was being transgressive to do so. I was young and na\u00efve, a sheltered kid watching a pornographic film for the first time just because I was curious what exactly this storied feature was like.\n\nAnd yet I was bored.\n\nIn hindsight, watching this and having no reaction whatsoever, even as a teenage high school student, should have been a big clue that I was ace.\n\nIf porn is your thing, or if you don't mind such scenes overwhelming what otherwise could have been a decent movie, then go ahead and give this a try. Or if you're especially curious. Just manage your expectations, because 'Caligula' really isn't everything that it's made out to be."

Every time I read a history text dealing with Caligula or his uncle Tiberius I picture Malcolm. He's just that good in this movie, he's completely insane and creepy. What's funny is the fact that this was supposed to be a \"porno\" and it isn't. Nothing in this film is masturbation worthy, as it is too...gritty and creepy. It makes me itch all over. The first time I saw this film, I borrowed it from a friend on dvd (unedited of course) and my girlfriend and I watched it. Needless to say, we were amazed, and she needed to turn it off at the um....\"Glory of Rome\" scene in the kitchen. This from the girl who owns every \"Faces of Death\" and \"Mondo Caine\" ever made, not to mention the Ilsa series of movies! Historically, this movie is spot on, as hard to believe as it is, most of this is true. Cinematically, a masterpiece. \"Let them hate me, so long as they FEAR me!\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie many years ago and thought it was just OK. I thought it was too sexually graphic and a bit too melodramatic but I saw this again several years ago and found the movie to be quite good. The reason for my change in attitude is that, in between the two viewings, I had the chance to learn more about Roman history; specifically their culture. This movie portrays Rome as it really was during Caligula time. They were very sexual and openly displayed it.\n\nThis is the story of Caligula or Caligola, the emperor of Rome. In historical context, he was not as bad as some would have it. He actually accomplished quite a bit even though he was not mentally all there. But then given how he grew up, I am surprised he was able to accomplish the amount that he did.\n\nWhen he was young, his uncle Emperor Tiberius killed Caligula's mother and father. He went to live with his uncle who subsequently molested him countless times. I was shocked by this but pederasty, an intimate or erotic relationship between an adolescent boy and an adult male, was quite common in those times. The real shocker was that Tiberius had his Praetorian Guards throw many young boys over a cliff after he was bored with them. If I recall, hundreds if not thousands of boys met their doom in this way. Caligula constantly lived in fear that he too would be thrown over the cliff like those other boys.\n\nIf you don't know much about Roman history, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie. There are intricacies here that will escape those who are unfamiliar or are a novice to Roman history. I'm not saying that you should read a whole college textbook on Roman history but do some internet research on it and afterward watch movie. I'm sure you will like the movie more if you do so rather than just watching it without doing any research at all."

I can't believe Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole and Hellen Mirren went on to have successful careers after this stinker, but I guess the lived it down.\n\nIt's my understanding that the Roman Emperor Caligula was out there and crazy (not the \"fun at parties, \"crazy either, but crazy-crazy). As a result, to tell the story it needed to show his ruthlessness, which it did. There could have been a little more suggestion to it, instead of so \"in-your-face.\" I recall watching this as being shocked at the inter-cut graphic hardcore porn vignettes that literally added nothing at all to the already miserable film.\n\nThere are un simulated sex acts, children in compromising positions, an actual birth, decapitation, rape, sodomy, fisting, and nothing of any historical value except the end which depicts Caligula's assassination (as well as his wife and child). There is a beginning and end but no middle to this movie. I recall just wondering exactly what it was I just watched.\n\nDon't watch this movie if you're even remotely interested in the historical figure of Caligula, read Wikipedia, and save yourself months, if not years of terrible recall from this stinker."

However, this was not the case with this project, which involved many high egos in a fight for creative mastery.\n\nFirst of all, the final editing made by Guccione resulted disastrous, making the film incoherent. The hardcore inserts are out of place, specialy the very long lesbian encounter between Anneka di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner.\n\nIn the sexual depertment, it's curious to note that the movie omitted many of the practices that still are taboo today, but that were common in the pagan Rome.There are just two very quick glimpse of gay sex, maybe to not shock the majoritary heterosexual audience. I think that a serious depiction of the costumes of the Ancient Rome shouldn't be limited by the taboos present in our society. Being produced by Penthouse Magazine, it's not surprising that the producer have made the film to its readers!\n\nTeresa Ann Savoy is very badly dubbed (they should have called her to dub herself). The respectable actors don't get involved in anything sexually explicit, what is a shame, considering that the film sets out to be a mixture of porno and art. How can the depraved emperor not be showed in any explicit scene? All scenes where he is having sex are softcore, obviously because respected actors like Malcolm MsDowell and helen Mirren never would accept to do nothing explicit. These people of cinema are very hypocritical.\n\nAnneka di Lorenzo had her career attempt aborted by her XXX scenes in this film and ended up having a tragical and mysterious death in 2011. She was very beautiful and had potential to be a real actress."

After such a long time, i finally took my time to watch it, and it was a fun ride.\n\nThe movie reminds me of the classic YouTube animation DOUBLE KING, Caligula is Double King, a self centered maniac that will hurt everybody for his own personal gain, and he does his part amazingly the actor. The acting to me seems pretty good, camera work is fine, the plot is interesting enough. However, i got a probelm with this movie and that's the pacing.\n\nThis movie could of been cut in half and we'd have a better movie. There's prolonged too long 18+ scenes and they just drag and it gets kinda dull. Also, as the title suggets, after his sister had passed away, the whole movie spirals into madness. I couldn't follow the movie after that, it seemed like they rushed the whole movie after the sister death.\n\nBefore the sister death, everything you could follow and it was pretty strong in my opinion, and then the movie just spirals when the sisters death come along. I actually enjoyed this movie, and i was scared that i wouldn't. It was actually pretty decent. I think i need to rewatch this again cuz it's such a long movie, it really needs a second viewing to fully grasp the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tinto Brass always struck me as a kind of Italian Ken Russell. They shared the same anarchist tendencies to push the limits of taste, and not only challenged what was morally acceptable, but artistically. They had the same obsession with over-the-top grandiose and baroque set pieces that always seemed oddly stagy, as if the whole movie was taking place beneath the proscenium of an enormous opera house. These director's work in symbol and metaphor, and possess a certain crazed wit and artistry and a keen eye for the outlandish.\n\nGore Vidal clearly intended a more serious, though not necessarily less extreme, story of the dehumanizing nature of absolute power. Anti-establishment mavericks, Brass and McDowell were more interested in exploring the idea of Caligula as a revolutionary anarchist, an anti-hero (much like Little Alex) trying to dismantle and destroy the bureaucratic institutions of power, only to find that those institutions are able to crush even the cruelest of tyrants.\n\nOf course the whole thing would have been wildly tasteless and over-the-top had the slimy Bob Guccione never gotten involved. It was clearly Brass and McDowell's intent to produce a shocking, outrageous, almost psychedelic, and thoroughly offensive piece of work. That's not a bad thing if it's for a just cause, but any illusions of political commentary that Brass and McDowell intended is obscured by the heavy handed, self-serving agenda of Bob Guccione.\n\nFrom the outset, whether the others involved really knew it or not, his intention for 'Caligula' was to bring adult entertainment to the masses; pornography in to the multiplex; and he brought on board the latest Penthouse pets to costar. Their are those who refuse to call the offending scenes in this movie pornographic, though it's tough to imagine what else you call multiple close-ups of blow jobs and masturbation. Perhaps Brass and McDowell underestimated him and thought they could take his money and retain some creative control. They didn't. Throughout the movie, the dull and heavy hand of Guccione can be seen everywhere. You only have to compare the gleeful fun and theatrical shocks of the Tiberian Grotto scene to the later dull and boring porn inserts to see the difference between the two directors. Where Brass attempts eroticism, Gucionne goes for porn. Where Brass injects wit and humor, Gucionne in boringly earnest. Where Brass in inventive, Gucionne is dull and repetitive.\n\nWhat could have been a shocking, but provocative, art house commentary on the indestructibility of bourgeois rule, was turned in to a crude exercise in the most dull and tedious kind of porn. There's enough of Brass's original vision to keep things interesting. It's not for the feint-hearted, but fans of Ken Russel, and later, Peter Greenaway, may appreciate the sheer insane spectacle of it all. But Guccione's ham-fisted ineptitude is so apparent in almost every scene that it becomes, at time, almost impossible to watch. Although he only shot six minutes or so, the most sexually hardcore six minutes of the movie, he re-edited the entire thing in to the mess that it is.\n\nI've never been an advocate of censorship, but 'Caligula' seems to be so far removed from the intentions of all involved that Brass needs to be given the opportunity one-day to re-edit it back to the film it could have been, which I suspect for all its shocking and offensive imagery, would have been pretty good."

Also, being a scholar of history I was curious about the historical portrayals in the film. However, I was pretty much disappointed in both fronts.\n\nTo me this film looks almost like a total splice job, as Bob Guccione, puts in as much random scenes of sex as possible to fill the film up. A lot of times it seemed like they just filmed that stuff separately and randomly spliced it in when there was a reason (doubtful for it). Granted I am not complaining about the sex, after all its great when some films just push it to the limit, but at times it was getting redundant and seeming to be a total gross out factor, as it passed titilation by the first hour.\n\nThe gore was pretty good, I have to give them credit for the scenes of decapitation with the semi realistic head rolling down the floor. The executions were also quite gory and semi-realistic. To be honest, I think some horror directors could improve their movies by studying some of the scenes of gore in this film.\n\nAs for the plot, man it was just plain monotonous and LONG LONG LONG. The unrated version of this film which I saw was over 2 and a half hours, and could have been trimmed down to 90 mins to 2 hours if the editors actually had a brain. Once Peter O'Toole's syphilitic character is murdered early in the film, how the plot proceeds is quite predictable. Caligula takes over and creates a rein of terror BLAH BLAH BLAH. Recommendation to avoid, but if you like sex and gore you can always fast forward to those particular scenes as they are the only saving grace of this dull film."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a scene mid-way through Caligula where Malcolm McDowell as the eponymous emperor kisses every square inch of his naked, dead sister's body. Surprisingly, this is perhaps the least repulsive image in this crass movie.\n\nAny film which contains such a high sexual content as Caligula indeed does will always face a negative reception of knee-jerk reaction and authoritarial opinion. But what really offends about this movie is how witlessly the pieces are put together. The most divine music imaginable is used, with Khachaturyan and Prokofiev used to decorate the drama. Unfortunately, this acts as an ironic counterpoint to the low quality of the script (at best) and, at worst, an insult to the music and a feat of utter pretentiousness. Famously, between five and six minutes of hardcore pornography were filmed and inserted into the film by Penthouse representative Bob Guccione, causing it's ban in many places, including England. The version I got to see was a 20th anniversary special cut for the British television company \"Channel 4\". This excised - where it could be identified - Guccione's additions, and reinserted some cut scenes of the original work. However, even on the open-minded fourth British Channel, this came under close scrutiny of the BBFC, causing some scenes to remain almost statically focused (or out-of-focused, as the picture was blown up to centre on innocuous images) while the soundtrack gave a clue as to what our eyes were prevented from seeing. Even without the hard-core content, the movie is repugnant in its almost infantile need to constantly shock. The images of graphic violence, notably near the climax (no pun intended), are so over-earnest they are nought but repellent.\n\nWhere the film could have salvaged itself is by the acting, and the central core of the plot. While Peter O'Toole is wonderful, (though Guccione alluded in interviews to him being under the substance of narcotics), Malcolm MacDowell greatly disappoints and in no sense recreates his magnificent display of ability in \"A Clockwork Orange\". An insane dictator with a predilection towards bestiality and incest, it is a one-note performance throughout, with no hint at depth beyond the crazed rhetoric to give the audience something to fear, sympathise, or even RELATE to. This may have worked if there were some other sense of normality within the film to anchor it to some sense of reality, but every other character is as mad as Caligula. Only towards the finale, when the senate discuss their hatred of his actions, do we get something approaching an honest emotion, but by then it is too late.\n\nThe budget for this one was revealed as coming in at $17.5 million, a proud boast from Guccione who intended the film to revolutionise modern motion pictures. This it may have done were it of merit, but every cent of its overblown budget is turgidly transferred to the screen without any ounce of artistry. Though notorious, very few people have seen this film (as the low number of IMDb voters - 745 at date of writing - attests), whether due to its widespread ban or merely due to indifference. Famous it may be, its contribution to the film canon is negligible."

I learned that the X rated cut of this film has tons of sex and nudity in it but that kind of stuff is not something that I mind if the film has substance. Unfortunately, I can see why this film was basically panned by all parties upon release.\n\nThis film is meant to be a bit of a life and time of Caligula's reign but it just meanders so much into pornographic, unsimulated sex. There's just not much going story-wise. I read that Tinto Brass (the director) had nothing to do with the hardcore sex scenes that were added to the film, and I can see why he and the cast wanted to distance themselves from the film.\n\nThe cast of this film is actually pretty great. You have young Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren just to name a few. Its just crazy that a film with starpower like that can fall so off the cliff. I know the initial writer and director didn't have much to do with the finished product, but damn what where the producers thinking? They must have been looking to shock viewers and create the most controversial film of the decade.\n\nErm, I can't really recommend this film because its hard to actually watch with someone else. Its about as close to watching a porno with a plot as you'll get in Hollywood. The film gets distracted in its multiple sex scenes; so much so that the plot suffers greatly and any interest you have in this long dreary film is lost right away. I can understand mixing sex with Roman culture media (i.e. Spartacus and Rome), just make sure its not excessive.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's see, what review should be given for this notoriously expensive porn flick from 1979? I remember first hearing about it after it first came out in Canada back in 1981. I overheard my mom's friend telling her about it and the details got me intrigued. I wanted to see it back then, but I was just a kid and the movie had been rated X.\n\nI finally got to see the film at 20 years of age, but it was an R-rated version I rented from the local video store. The heavy cuts to that made me clearly see there was more to this film than what was depicted in that milder version.\n\nFast forward to 2006 where I unexpectedly found the \"Imperial Edition\" on sale at the downtown music store. It contained the original 'uncut' version which compelled me to quickly buy it.\n\nWell, after several years of waiting, I finally got to see Caligula in its full glory. It's gratuity at its best and holds no bars for a look at one of the most sexually deviant ancient emperors that Rome ever had. It's not that good, unfortunately.\n\nThere are hints of post production tampering with the choppy editing that looks like it was cut with a chain saw and it's pretty well aimless. Amid the lavish sets and fancy costumes, there is a story somewhere in there and is solely focused on Caligula's sexual appetite and his seemingly demented mental state. It's all made noticeable right from the very beginning.\n\nHats off though to respectable actors likes Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren for saving this pic from being just another badly acted porn flick. Their professional presence on screen is noticeable and it shows.\n\nTo top it off, this is definitely a highly expensive porn flick trying to bring the sexual escapades of ancient Rome to an explicit highlight. It delivers on that, but not on quality.\n\nThat was a highly controversial film in its day and the involvement of the men's magazine, Penthouse, didn't help matters either. What started off as a classical look into an ancient notorious man turned instead into an orgy of scenes that were laced in during post production. That clearly shows in the results of this old flick that has been chopped up too many times into a variety of different versions. The original vision for this film just isn't there and it's the one created by the famous writer, Gore Vidal. He sued to have his name taken off the credits, by the way.\n\nYes, legal and creative differences did affect this movie, but it's a good curiosity item to view. I mean, nothing like this was done before in the history of film making. To give it an added boost were the respectable actors featured, clearly showing that this film had potential, but it misfired instead. It was all an extravagant showcase, but with really nothing to show for it except overwhelming nudity and an abundance of sex scenes that definitely belong in a low grade porn video."

        "review_detailed_main": "Early this morning I started watching one of the most notorious cult films ever made, Caligula (1979). The full uncut version is available on YouTube (without an 18 and over warning! Kids, do NOT watch this! Seriously!!!). I saw the first half hour of it, tried to go to sleep afterward, and I couldn't (it disturbed me that much). Then I finally went to sleep and resumed the rest of the film when I woke up. It is disturbingly pornographic and violent, and shows the basest of human nature. The back story behind the film is even more interesting than the film itself since it had a lot of big names and blurred the line between mainstream and adult.\n\nThe 70s were a time of experimentation, but this went way beyond that and it is truly decadent and over the top, showing the licentiousness and depravity of Imperial Rome. There are gruesome things in it that will turn your stomach and wall to wall sex that was thrown in without the actors' knowledge after principal photography was completed. So many of the people involved disavowed this film because it devolved into a different kind of animal than what the screenwriter (Gore Vidal, of all people) envisioned. It's like a car wreck, so horrible, but at the same time, you can't help but crane your neck to look at it. It was done with a lot of style, impressive sets and costumes, and even had a bit of dark humor.\n\nIt is a fascinating yet bizarre and shocking picture, one of the darkest I've ever seen, despite it being a big uneven mess. The only good people in the film get killed off and the rest are so corrupt and evil. However, you have to consider the time it was made and the time period that it depicts. In a way I have to admire the balls of the filmmakers. Very few filmmakers today take those kinds of risks, to shatter taboos, and dare to show the ugliness of humanity. It is mainly cult filmmakers that make midnight movies such as these that do.\n\nI draw the line at this film. It's one of those that you see once and once is enough. The only other one I can think of that goes beyond this is Salo, and I am definitely not brave enough for that one!"

        "review_detailed_main": "How many movies with a rating of 4.7, from nearly 30 years ago, have such robust commentary and message boarding? Right there the movie's got something very few, if any, movies have.\n\nI saw it (the uncut version) for the first time last night, and it's not that bad. Of course Guccione did some mangling of the continuity, but really, who watches it for continuity? And I'm not just talking about the nasty bits, it's just surreal all around. Now setting aside debates of just how promiscuous ancient Rome would have been, it certainly captures realistically how it would have been if those who decry the times as decadent were right. IF there were huge orgies taking place, wouldn't they looked mostly like it was portrayed in the film? Granted it was staged, and true reality likely would have had much more awkwardness and less grace in the execution, it stands that various thrustings and what not would have been the order of the day.\n\nI have not seen any of the commentary included with the disks, so perhaps some of the conjectures I have are answered, but one has to wonder if those who ultimately distanced themselves from the film felt that they had to in order to stay respectable (and employable). One also would like to know if Guccione was simply trying to be a peddler of his wares or was he REALLY trying to make an artistic statement and wasn't going to let \"the suits\" detract him from his goal. Who could really know, even with commentary. Did Guccione ruin an artistic creation to make it high class porn, or did he really have a unique vision and dared to do what no one else would dare? Regardless, the output it singular, and that in itself goes a long way toward making art Art.\n\nIF Rome was like this and not just some revisionists puritan views of the time as a cautionary tale for their modern era, this is how I imagine it looked and sounded. It's like you are there, and if groups of people were getting busy, this is how you'd expect it to look. As someone else commented, it was much more realistic than what safely filmed \"depravity\" looked like in films up to that point.\n\nAlso, one would need to put the movie in a modern context too. The movie came out well before the internet became fixed in most people's lives. One can surf the net and pretty much see whatever they want in a minute's time (to a point where it quickly becomes dull). The hardcore elements of the movie are therefore much less shocking to modern sensibilities. Softcore sexuality permeates the airwaves every day. Anything hardcore is available at the snap of the fingers on the internet. Seeing such scenes in a modern, and the relatively near future, seem almost TAME and have more artistic merit than the average smut out on the internet. I can see a time in the not too distant future, as the younger set become the middle age set, and barriers fall, that the uncut version will be broadcasted. People are simply becoming much less inhibited and the paradigms will shift enough where the uncut version will not be seen as horrific.\n\nIn the end, I can see that many of the name people involved had some rarefied sensibility about what the movie should be. Meanwhile Guccione made an earthier epic that sucks the viewer in (no pun intended) versus previous Historical Epics that have great costumes and blowing horns and big sets and clattering horses etc etc, that are staged and bereft realism of any kind. This was a unique experience without a doubt. The viewer had a human's eye view of antiquity versus the bird's eye view common to most movies.\n\nI gave it a 5 simply so as not to skew the existing rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "(1979) Caligula HISTORICAL BIO FICTION\n\nJudging by what I had heard during my teen years, the impression I had about \"Caligula\" was that it was supposed to be erotic since it was co-financed by Penthouse magazine founder at the time, Bob Guccione. So I was like, you know what, I heard of Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and Peter O' Toole, and that I am old enough to watch it. Let's just see how erotic it was. And then after it was all said and done. It was more shock value than erotic. I even took a snooze during watching it, as the tone was a lot of it was about nothing. Whatever story or criticism about Caligula there is has been overshadowed with senseless gore, mutilations, a little necrophilia, and head decapitations. Anyways, because I often love reading about films, and Roger Ebert happens to be one of the few I had read often. The only thing I remembered about the review he gave zero stars to is the amount of drinking involved without having to use the bathroom, which is only a very small inconsistencies of the entire movie.\n\nAnyways, at the opening it has current ruler, Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) basically being a sadistic dictator throwing orders left and right. Including humiliating his son, Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) by forcing him to dance just because he has a simple whim to see him doing, while Tiberius is swimming around in his huge bath house. He then demands other fully naked people sitting around the bath house pool to take a dip in their as well before kicking everyone out. In the first 20 or thirty minutes or so have everyone full frontal and back except for the central characters, that includes McDowell, O'Tool and Helen Mirren. In other words, much of the women who are naked and the men are a bunch of nobody's. And because Tiberius is a ruler, all he does is ridicules and belittle people who are not important to him, continuing to hint relatives are making attempts to end his life. One of those ways was by poison when Caligula hands his grandfather, Tiberius a drink and when he told his son to drink it- he doesn't and hands it to the lady standing next to him, and as soon as she dies from that drink then it is off to try something else. While Tiberius continues talking he then goes toward one of his centurion soldiers and ties a knot onto one of his thingy while former soldiers who were standing beside him are holding him. Tiberius then grabs a sword and guts him in the gut with it before he instructs them to cut his thingy off and send it to his wife. Was this supposed to be funny because I thought it was kind of gross."

        "review_detailed_main": "People tend to understand this movie entirely wrong. It is definitely not just porn.\n\nThe story of the Roman emperor Caligula has it all. Love, sex, paranoia, treachery and fear in a morally quite different landscape. I don't think that a pornographic approach is wrong at all when studying a Roman emperor. Our moral barriers are a creation of our own culture and Christian heritage. People might be discussed by the explicit sex scenes, but what are these scenes compared to the facts that these people could murder their own parents, brothers, sisters and even children? In such circumstances perverted orgies seem quite acceptable and realistic to me.\n\nActing is fair and the choice of music is great (Khachaturyan and Prokofiev). The historical surroundings are adequate, but the camera work is terrible. Some scenes also obviously attempt to shock you at the cost of historical credibility. Even if the overall picture of the movie is positive, you easily start to fantasize what an unforgettable masterpiece you could made using such dramatic ingredients. Ancient Rome is such a fascinating subject, especially from a moral perspective. Some day they'll maybe make a movie of emperor Nero, in which the characters talk Latin and the city of Rome is recreated with computer graphics. The more realistic the would try to make it, the more shocking it would be. Or why not use renaissance Italy? They could be quite cynical too.\n\nI don't regret buying this film at all. The first and last ten minutes of this film are great. The way to approach the movie is also far more correct than the melodramas of the 50s and the 60s. Give it a chance."

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading the few positive reviews for Caligula (which generally run along the \"so bad it's good\" line) I feel compelled to add my own critique. Caligula is a tour de force of powerful, visceral film-making. Many of the films deriders seem to be confused by the explicit sexual content and approach it as pornography, criticising the unattractiveness of the cast for spoiling their experience. (I'm reviewing, of course, the 1h55m unrated cut of the film) If you're looking for a bit of porn there are far better places to go. Likewise if searching for historical accuracy, this is not what the film is about. A taste for the sophisticated discourses on power and desire found in Passolini's Sal\u00f2, the gaudy theatrics of Ken Russell's The Devils, or the humour and obsessive gratuity of William S. Burroughs will help you to fully appreciate the experience. Sex, mortality and addiction to power are the overriding themes presented in such a way as to implicate the viewer in this daring and unique cinematic experiment. The cuts switch between images of arousal and disgust with a balletic beauty climaxing in the beatific portrayal of Caligula's inevitable demise. O'Tool is a particular treat in the role of Tiberius and one cannot help seeing McDowell's Caligula as a matured Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer, filmmaker or cultural theorist, and a good conversation piece for everyone else."

        "review_detailed_main": "You could certainly argue that Caligula (1979) is effectively a shallow piece of pornography with a large budget and extensive script, and indeed the dwelling on graphic sex and nudity does cheapen the filmmaking somewhat. However, to my surprise, Caligula turned out to be a compelling and highly entertaining character study set among the ridiculous excess of the early Roman Empire.\n\nMalcom McDowell is excellent as Gaius Caligula, he is prone to overacting at points but overall is performance is hypnotic and oddly charming. The rest of the cast are also great, Peter O'Tool for example is excellent as Tiberius.\n\nThe photography and set design is incredibly impressive and adds a sense of surreal beauty to what could be described as an otherwise ugly film. Indeed the film does not shy away from the grusome cruelty that characterised the emperor's reign, but this works to its advantage, along with the numerous orgies, the inclusion of bloody violence makes this film an unflinching and mostly realistic portrayal of the aristocracy of ancient Rome.\n\nThe issues here come mainly from a confused script. The writing leaps from mature historical epic to cheap 70s exploitation on a whim and as such the film is tonally confused. The dialogue also varies from adequate to quite compelling to downright terrible. Also the insertion of hardcore sex scenes often distracts from the story and it oftentimes dictates the story, situations are created just so that more nudity can be thrown in.\n\nOverall, there is certainly an impressive historical film in here somewhere, perhaps with a stronger script and less of a focus on sex it could have been a masterpieces. Alas, as it stands Caligula remains an oddity, I found in throughly entertaining and it survives a lengthy runtime without ever becoming dull, it has a great cast and looks and sounds fantastic, however it feels like a piece is missing or maybe there are too many pieces already in place."

Sadly the director was replaced by Bob Guccione from Penthouse, who was producing the film, because the film wasn't explicit enough for Bob's taste. So he re-edited it, and added some completely gratuitous hard-core porn sequences. The result is something of a mess (if you excuse the pun), but the controversy ensured the film's big box-office success. This is the first time I've seen the uncensored version and it is pretty full-on! Sad really because this could have been a great film instead of just being an infamous one."

        "review_detailed_main": "This has to be the most bizarre movie i'd ever seen up to this day and it certainly is one reason to dig into Italian cinema and see more of their hidden and forgotten gems.\n\nThe movie isn't by any way historically accurate but still it captures the roman decadence that lead to the destruction of the empire. Caligola is colourful, visually stunning experience and at the same time distressing for some. It's certainly not a cheap adult movie as some might think but it does contain a lot of nudity which may be disturbing and that might be the reason for such a low rating as many viewers are expecting more conventional movie.\n\nAfter seeing it i was left puzzled and i didn't quite know what to think of it. I do understand why it was censored in so many countries as it did in a way have political messages which are still accurate in today's world.\n\nI can recommend this movie for adults who aren't easily provoked and disgusted. Inducing feelings sort of is the whole point of this movie."

Without even reading a review of the film, I ordered the glorious-sounding \"Imperial Edition\" and got the shock of my life watching it. I expected an epic showing of the rise and downfall of Rome's most monstrous Emperour and instead I received a combination of a great film and hardcore porno. The actual sex footage and some of the suggested actions like the anal fisting, oral sex etc is so repulsive that it actually put me off the brilliant scenes which also happened such as Nerva's suicide in the glass bathtub and the brilliant \"If only all Rome had one neck\" line which blew me away. I give the film a 5-star rating because it was a good film, a brilliant film but I give it a 5-star rating also because it was filthy, queer and brutal piece of trash which doesn't deserve a showing anywhere,"

Although no one would confuse this with I, Claudius, it's still worth a laugh.\n\nMalcolm McDowell plays hyper-depraved Roman Caligula, who becomes emperor after the death of Tiberius. McDowell chews scenery by the Corinthian column, matched only by Peter O'Toole, who appears to be drunk for his entire performance. Other actors who find themselves in this mess include Helen Mirren, who despite playing \"the most promiscuous woman in Rome\" has no real nude scenes. Compared to the porno actresses around her, she seems positively chaste.\n\nOverall, this film works better as comedy than as sexploitation. The sex, although explicit, is nothing you haven't seen before. Better to watch it for those wacky Romans, with their head clippers, horse-men, dwarf sex, and imperial brothels."

I am not exactly shocked about the nudity, explicit sex, orgies, that is all part of the story. That's how roman emperors lived according to historical records. What's wrong is that there is no fluidity in the way the images are shown. OK, I am finding the plot interesting, but then all of the sudden, there's a vagina. What am I suppose to do with that? Get aroused? I get distracted from the plot right? On the other hand, I am jerking off like nuts with the sex images, but then, all of the sudden here comes John Gielgud with one of his speeches, what a turn off!!! It looks like there were two different people directing this. Could have been a great flick if they showed it realistically, but they completely screwed up. Total mess!"

In fairness to everyone involved in this mess they had a great idea and just went overboard. The violence and sex, as graphic as it is, has almost a comical feel to it, as if not to be taken too seriously. McDowell wildly overacts as Caligula. This could have been great if only toned down somewhat and also if Guccioni had given the viewer some insight as to the cause of Caligula's madness instead of this viewer left groping as to figure out what the hell went wrong in Caligula's mind to do the terrible things he did. I wanted to know more about Caligula and wasn't given anything to try and figure him out. Instead we see sex (very graphic in the original version) and lots and lots of violence, which if handled properly I don't have a problem with. But Guccioni, in his attempt to shock (he succeeded very well)forgot the storyline and just went scattering in all different directions. Too bad for a cast with this talent could have really had the greatest film ever."

Unfortunately what happened here was the interference of Bob Guccione making the final product a glorified pornographic film.\n\nWhat could have been a historical epic turns out to have a very loose in not completely lost narrative structure that makes the film hard to follow.\n\nIs there artistic merit? I think there is. The production design team tries their best, but many of the sets are so obvious that you're taken out of the film. The cinematography is atrocious at times, I understand that is is the by-product of a bad edit job by Guccione himself.\n\nLet's not forget that there are some exceptionally talented actors here: John Gielgud, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and of course, Malcolm McDowell. It's really incredible to imagine a film like this exists, and that's what is so exciting, at least for me.\n\nIf you bought this for erotic purposes, I'll say that you're already on the internet and can find much better and more effective products elsewhere.\n\nFor someone who's interested in experiencing the film and believe me, it is an experience, then you can probably do worse. By the end of the film I was bored and just waiting for Caligula's brutal end."

        "review_title": "Sex and sadism resumes the film. Perhaps, if one of the directors had more imagination and studio experience, we would have today the classic that it never was",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are films that upon release receive poor reviews from critics or do not receive as much at the box office as they need to. After years, however, they are considered cults, acclaimed by contemporary critics and regain relevance. Films like \"Blade Runner\" starring Harrison Ford and \"Scarface\" with Michele Pfeiffer and Al Pacino are famous examples. \"Caligula\" was released in 1979, directed by Tinto Brass - he directed most of the footage, but refused to sign the work. Producer Bob Guccione shot additional sexually explicit scenes (without involving the main cast) -, one of the famous Italian avant-garde directors who, in his older age, released erotic films such as Tra(sgre)dire (2000). His most controversial feature was inspired by the Roman Emperor Caligula, a figure known for spending a lot of money and surrendering to sex.\n\nThe film chronicles the rise and fall of the famous Roman Emperor Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), showing the violent methods he employs to gain the throne and the subsequent insanity of his reign. The only one that shows the show of perversions that the Roman Empire hid, and tells the story of Caligula, the craziest of emperors, who had a bizarre sexual affair with his sister, and was married to the most infamous of prostitutes. At the same time that Caligula lived surrounded by flatterers, he also had dangerous enemies, crazy to see him away from power. He appoints his horse (Incitatus (in Latin, Impetuous)) to political office, humiliates and executes anyone who displeases him (he practices all kinds of corruption and atrocities). He also sleeps with his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy), organizes elaborate orgies, and embarks on a fruitless invasion of Britain before meeting a tragic end.\n\nThe epic genre and especially the production of films focused on the Roman Empire had already become a key to success in the cinematographic market. However, unlike other films about the Roman Empire, Caligula was completely rejected by film companies, renowned directors in Hollywood, in short, the high echelon of American cinema. All this \"thanks\" to the way its thinkers wanted to portray Caligula's rise and fall: through an countless number of explicit sex scenes, masochism, bacchanalia, and so on. Obviously, the great sect of Cinema was shocked by such a script and immediately refused to participate in such an undertaking. There was no other option but to look for \"alternative ways\" to make the film. The director sought and chosen was the Italian Tinto Brass, known at the time for his erotic productions. All he had to do was rely on the support of a production company that could sponsor the making of the film. Behold, Penthouse, a large company in the North American pornographic sector, envisioned the chance to project itself in the middle of Cinema, sponsoring a film of great importance.\n\nThe agreement was signed. Bob Guccione, creator and owner of Penthouse, started to sponsor the production of the film, and even actively participated in its realization, filming most of the erotic scenes. \"Cal\u00edgula\" came out of paper in 1979, and reached the cinema screens in 1980. The result: a real porn movie with big movie stars. This is because if directors and producers had refused to participate in its production, it was not the case that some of the biggest celebrities of the time ended up accepting the invitation to participate in such a controversial and controversial film. These were the cases, mainly, of Malcom McDowell, one of the main actors of the time, who ended up playing Caligula himself, of Hellen Mirren, who played Milonia, Caligula's wife, and Peter O'Toole who played Tiberius.\n\nSex and sadism. These are the words that can sum up the film. Caligula and the entire historical and political conjuncture of the Roman Empire end up being drastically reduced to an unbridled practice of sex throughout the entire film. Without any censorship, the film featured explicit sex with very strong scenes, from the bacchanalia with a huge number of people, passing through the most sadistic practices possible, to the incestuous sexual relations of Caligula with his own sister. The film, as expected, ended up being rejected by all the specialized critics. Roger Ebert, the most famous of American critics, gave the film a score of 0, considering it unspeakable garbage. Many other critics reinforced the fact that possibly in the entire film only 6 minutes of its 150 minutes are of quality, with the rest focused on the bacchanalia and sadism of Caligula and the entire Roman troupe. Controversial, controversial. Sadistic and eschatological. \"Caligula\" became one of the most paradoxically repudiated and \"worshipped\" films in the history of Cinema, precisely because of all this, we can say, \"aesthetic boldness\" and mainly because of the furor caused in society.\n\nLuxurious production (estimated at $17,500,000), perfect sets, lush cinematography (by Silvano Ippoliti), magnificent art direction (by Danilo Donati), splendid music (by Paul Clemente (credit to Bruno Nicolai)), spectacular performances (McDowell puts on a show as Emperor Gaius Germanicus Caligula, as well as the renowned cast consisting of Teresa Ann Savoy (Drusilla), Guido Mannari (Macro), Helen Mirren (Caesonia), John Gielgud (Nerva), Peter O'Toole (Tiberius)). Several scenes are bloodthirsty and very violent, but others stand out for their plasticity and beauty (even being revolting): Caligula and Tiberius in the cave; the death of Tiberius by Macro; the marriage of a Roman soldier; Caligula dressed as a woman choosing his wife; the suffering of losing the beloved sister; Caligula roaming the city until he overthrew the staging of the triangle of power; the end on the stairs.\n\n\"Caligula\" is a bland, appealing and aimless film, one of those that you end up questioning why it exists. The work is very similar to Edward II in several aspects: a return to a historical period, contextualization based on a royal family and the notion of dynasty, wrapped in a game of powers, with a non-standard staging and a lot of sex around everything. . But even so, these are two films with different atmospheres; Edward II is more like a novelistic drama while Cal\u00edgula focuses on circus comedy - this one that works as a mockery of the Roman Empire, with a performance that is completely insane and doomed to incompetence when trying to be a sleazy film. Not that being scolded is the reason for the failure of the feature. The question is how this develops, as the pace is too boring to entertain and the script too lost to captivate. And the sex? Sex is at the core of the film, but here it plays, most of the time, a superficial role both as something functional to a possible subtext and as a mere graphic contemplation. And this sex doesn't just have an erotic content, it wants to shock and have a heterogeneous commitment - that's how grotesque moments involving bizarreness and violence arise. Rarely is the impact high, but it draws a little attention. And that's what the movie seems to want to sustain itself from: just the mere distraction. It is the image for the sake of the image, not as an aesthetic exercise, but as a mediocre ornament of little impact.\n\nThe film is a satire of the history of Emperor Caligula and the Roman Empire at that time. The main way he tries to exercise this satire is through this brutality and exaggeration around sex, in a clearly voluntary effort to try to be vulgar, to cause embarrassment and to attract attention in the same way that a spoiled child does with his parents. After the viewer realizes that the work has nothing but something boring to offer, the feeling until the end of the narrative ends up oscillating between the jocular and this innocuous aggressiveness. Caligula strives to be an over-the-top and extremely explicit film, but it is limited to a certain coldness; a violence without energy and a sex with little horniness. Attempts to lead to this grotesque path are found in moments such as: the scene in which there are several men ejaculating on a woman, the king sleeping with a horse and having sex with his sister, a penis being decapitated, a woman having sex and urinating on a man dead and even another woman giving birth to a baby... You can't call \"Caligula\" gratuitous; that is precisely the aim of the film. However, being free does not mean being empty, much less being boring. And here the work of Tinto Brass encounters one of its biggest problems: its long duration. What is the reason for such an arbitrary work and with so many unnecessary moments to last more than two and a half hours? When you take away the sex, the script boils down to just a power game between the characters that make up Rome's political elite. Much of the content left over from the final cut could easily be subtracted within an hour. It gets repetitive, tiring, spinning in false. In the final minutes, we begin to realize that he wants to work, becoming less uninteresting, with scenes that explore some plasticity, with tension and movement. But it's too late.\n\nThe conclusion is that \"Caligula\" should be celebrated more as an event within cinema than a film capable of surviving time. We approached it with curiosity, motivated by the sensationalism it still provokes as background noise in our pop culture. Perhaps, if \"Caligula\" had, among its directors, someone with more imagination and studio experience, we would have today the classic that it never was."

Having heard about Caligula since it was first released, I took advantage of the DvD issue to see it. Neither as good nor as bad as its reputation, I found the film to be one of those movies that is hard to compare to traditional films. The reviewer here who compared it to Plan 9 is right -- not because Caligula is as bad a movie, but because, like Plan 9, it discards nearly all the conventional ideas about filmmaking and strikes out boldly, even foolishly, on its own. The unrated version is far more graphic in its sex scenes than I was expecting, and adds to the sense of the film's resolute difference from other movies. A mish-mash of directorial styles -- from trite to frenetically bizarre -- Caligula lurches from predictable to surprising, sometimes within the same scene. Nearly every element of the film is eccentric, from the script to the lighting, whether through design or mistake is beyond my ability to judge. For fans of outsider cinema, with a tolerance for porn and an ability to forgive silly costumes, strained dialogue, and a moral stance that can only be summed up as deranged, Caligula is well worth seeing."

This topic is goo handled is some scenes... for example, when Caligula (Malcom Mc Dowell surprise again with his sarcastic voice like Kubrick's \"Clockwork orange\") act good with people who going to die for orders of him. Or, for example too, when the town makes a kind of social pyramid that critic the political system of they emperor. The bad thing... unnecessary porn.\n\n\"Caligula\" always going to be a polemic movie, with people who loves it and hates it. And...well, this is my opinion. You have it, you love it or you hate it.\n\n*Sorry for the mistakes...well,if there any"

I guess that Mr. Vidal knew that even if they spell your name correct, there is still bad publicity. The movie starts with some promise. And if you enjoy the acting talents of Malcolm McDowell, then it is a good way to kill a few hours. McDowell does portray the insanity of Caligula quite well. As the movie progresses his acting talents are stronger as he shows the depravity that Caligula sank to. He does a great job in carrying the film. And his performance is as dark as ever. Not quite as dark and foreboding as Alex from A Clockwork Orange though."

Whenever i hear about a film being shocking or extreme i watch it to see what the hype is about. And like the Devils this film is not even that shocking its just boring. It's not shocking like Salo, A Serbian Film or Grotesque. It's just boring and all over the place. I just thought it was a waste of 3 hours. This is one shocking film that is better left to the imagination as the imagination is far better than the reality in this case. The sex scenes are boring, the violence is tame and the story is too weak to fall back on. The acting reminded me of Shakespeare which is tough going when you watch even the best of that. If I could swear in a review I would because it's that poor. Save yourself the pain of watching this. I only did because it was \u00a33.99 on a streaming service. So I took the opportunity. Although if I could I would ask for it back. If I could give a negative score it would be -10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has become some sort of cult-icon, due to all the exciting stories concerning the production, and of course due to the content: a mixture of historical drama, an abundance of graphic sex and equally graphic violence. So you can either appreciate or detest this movie for all these different reasons. Any which way, the result is disappointing and unbalanced (to put it mildly).\n\nWhen you just concentrate on the story of Caligula, I have to admit that it is, from historical perspective, quite well done (how could it not, being based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, who by the way later wanted his credits withdrawn from the production). Unfortunately director Tinto Brass covered this with a tsunami of nudity and sex. Sure, in the Capri- and the brothel-scenes (based on true facts) this can be considered functional, but at many, many other places it's totally superfluous and gratuit, like the flimsy and revealing outfits that virtually everyone wears (totally unthinkable for Roman citizens!) or the nude soldiers, and of course the notorious, later by Bob Guccione added, pornographic footage. It all results in an overkill of nudity and sex that gradually makes you exasperated and in the end just yawn in boredom.\n\nAs to the acting, Malcolm McDowell and Peter O'Toole did a superb job (whatever you may think of the things they were made to do in the movie, or whatever they afterwards have said to discredit their participation in this project). O'Toole is absolutely fascinating as the worn-out but still overbearing and threatening old Tiberius, and McDowell delivers a real tour the force as the indefatigable Caligula, from exuberant to deeply caring (like with his sister) and at last lapsing into madness. Other big name Helen Mirren didn't have a very big role anyway and John Gielgud's part was short and rather static. The sets were in many scenes quite overwhelming and impressive, they must have cost a fortune and certainly were worthy of a better cause.\n\nAll in all, a weird and very unsatisfying movie with at it's core an historically adequate story, unfortunately totally overshadowed by the grotesque sexual fantasies of the makers."

Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula I am all men as I am no man, and so - I am a God!'\n\nBob Guccione's Penthouse International invested 17.5 million dollars into the production of Caligula, and in doing so created one of the wildest exploitation films ever made.\n\nThe film, which chronicles the terrifying reign of the tyrant Gaius Caligula Caesar, Rome's fourth and most notorious emperor, who ruled from A.D. 37 to A.D. 41, took eleven months to film and attracted a multitude of talented artists into its creative team. These included renowned novelist, essayist, playwright and historian Gore Vidal, who wrote the initial screenplay the final film was based on, and Danilo Donati, four time Academy award winning designer, and frequent Fellini collaborator, who created the lavish sets, 64 all up, and costumes. The Emperor himself had 26 costume changes alone. 3,592 costumes in all were created. Actors of the calibre and stature of Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole flew to Rome for what promised to be one hell of an experience, and it proved to be just that.\n\nEver since its release in 1979 Caligula has been resoundly lambasted by not only the critics but by most of the participants in the production. It is well known that the production of the film degenerated into a huge slagging match between the main talents and the money men and that the director, Tinto Brass, was removed from the production after he had edited the first twenty minutes of the film. The rest of the film was edited by Guccione and a freelance editor, and if you look at the film from the moment when dawn arrives and all the freaks awake in Tiberius' grotto, they had no idea what they were doing. They probably even used the wrong takes most of the time. The blame for the films failure has been placed mainly at the feet of Brass. Brass reportedly used three to five cameras all rolling at the same time to capture the action. This was one of the reasons used by Penthouse to fire him. They claimed that he wasted film shooting this way. Yet, if you look at the first twenty minutes the film is a sharply edited piece of work, excluding the opening sequence in the forest, which is pretty dire, and which probably was never shot to open the film anyway. It's a shame Brass wasn't left in control, as I believe he would have produced an intelligent movie. Sure, it wasn't going to be the erotic/todger pulling classic Guccione wanted, but who cares. One of the really bad aspects of the film are the stupid porno inserts featuring the pets. I believe Brass was on his way to creating a masterpiece, well, maybe not, but certainly a film of much merit. Piernico Solinas, author of The Ultimate Porno: The Making of a sex Colossal, certainly believed this to be true. It would be interesting to see the film totally re-edited from start to finish again. There is certainly a lot of footage that was shot that never ended up in the final cut.\n\nCaligula is an easy film to knock. People don't like it because of its frankness. People claim it is badly acted. People claim it is badly written. People claim it is badly photographed. People claim it is just bad. Well they are wrong. What it is is a prime example of how to ruin a film in the editing stage. Anyone claiming it to be badly photographed need look no further than the Dutch Filmworks release of it on DVD. This is a beautiful, not completely blemish free, print that shows just how well filmed Caligula was. It is far superior to the Penthouse DVD. Sure, Caligula is not a perfect film, and sure it is in your face filmmaking, but at least the filmmakers had the guts to make something different, something challenging. What went wrong with Caligula was that there were too many chiefs. What Caligula was was a brave and interesting experiment that didn't quite come off. Caligula could have been powerful, intelligent and stunning. Instead, it is one of the best exploitation films ever made. And, anyway, who could hate a movie that has a giant head lopping machine in it."

Indeed the sheer level of over the top scenes and brazen, even explicit sexuality do seem to reflect our understanding of the period depicted. Accurate historically or not it makes a change within a Roman epic to see nasty torture and killings look nasty and for orgies to actually have people without any clothes. There are magnificent and opulent scenes and there are smaller more intimate ones. There are grand speeches and jokey asides. And all of this within such a long film should not be problematic but the editing is all wrong and scenes collide with one another instead of following on. One is constantly being pulled up from one incident to address another and the lack of continuity becomes problematic. Having said all that, I have previously only watched bits and pieces and the original UK butchered version, and I have to say the overall effect here is fairly stunning and deserves to be watched, at least once, in its fabulous if flawed full edit."

Peter O'Toole plays Tiberius, Caligula's adopted Grandfather and he does a great job also for the short time he is in the movie. Basically, this movie tells the story of Caligula's rise and fall and all that is in between. This mostly includes orgies left and right, incest, random freaks, sadism, masochism and much blood and gore. This movie truly is controversial and very disturbing. I highly recommend it if you have the stomache to sit through this movie. 9 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie traces the rise and fall of Caligula, the last real emperor of the united Roman Empire; before the military took over the government and instituted a line of puppet rulers.\n\nNothing is held back in showing the moral decay and decadence of the final days of the empire. Because of this, there are very few people who will not find at least some part of the movie offensive. While the attempt at realism is admirable, it makes it difficult for some viewers to look past the offense to their personal sensibilities and appreciate the film as a whole.\n\nThe movie has a lot of big names stars, but strangely it is a relative unknown, Theresa Ann Savoy, as Caligula's sister that provides the best performance. Malcom McDowell, John Gielguld, and Peter O'Toole present performances that are fine, but far from their best.\n\nThe film does seem to lack anything resembling a plot. Instead of a cohesive story, the characters move from one unrelated scene to the next. The movie is more akin to a voyeuristic view into Roman life as it was during this period of time.\n\nThe sets and the atmosphere, however, are excellent. \"Caligula\" presents the best vision of the opulence and decadence of Rome since Fellini's Satyricon. While some viewers have criticised the movie as exaggerating the concept of Roman orgies, one should remember that \"Caligula\" takes place during the fall of Rome, where the power of the Emperor and nobility had reached the epitome of corruption. The days when Rome was a center of scientific and philosophical advancement had long disappeared by the time Caligula comes to power. During this time intellectuals and dissidents were slaughtered, the nobility had given up any appearance of proprietary, apathy ran through the citizenry like a plague, the military assumed more and more power, and celebrations and orgies were held constantly in a vain attempt to stave off rebellion. Because the strength of the movie is in its ostentatious depiction, I suggest watching the long version (the short version just doesn't convey the intended vision strongly enough).\n\nWhile not everybody can appreciate the movie, I would recommend it to any student of Roman history or afficionado of film techniques."

I, for one, found this film hard to watch, it is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, along with films like Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and Cannibal Holocaust. The idea that there could be a ruler that forced people to have sex, and so on. Sure, this movie has much nudity...male and female...but this all adds to the film, making it more disturbing. These sex scenes aren't meant for you to whack the weasel to, they are more meant to get a reaction like \"Oh my God, we DO live in a good world.\" Imagine being in a place like Rome in this time, we are just lucky we don't have to live in it. So the movie is not exactly historically significant, but it gives you an idea of what it was like to live in these times. A time no one wants to live in. Also, this movie, like such films as Scarface, is about the fall of man. Caligula was a ruler, and he was on top of the world, then he lost it all. Poof. So if you watch this film, don't think of it as a porno, think of it as a disturbing historical drama. People who see a movie just has sex and just label it a porno and don't try to look deep down into the film, to find meaning and plot are not true movie fans."

Here he plays the titular emperor, who carries on a long-standing incestuous relationship with his sister, Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy), and weds Rome's most promiscuous prostitute, Caesonia (Helen Mirren), only to descend down a power-mad spiral of paranoia, insanity, and death. Director Tinto Brass (himself a porn auteur) uses this bit of history as a springboard into unspooling a lavish, extravagant pseudo-epic, rife with overwhelming sets, costumes, and carnage (dig the motorized decapitator!)--all of which become extensions of Caligula's excessive character. McDowell--who at first seems to be doing a gloss on Alexander DeLarge, clocks in a portrait of murderous tyranny with a mix of cold-blooded conviction and tongue-in-cheek camp. The rest of the cast--including John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole in small roles--adopts the same no-boundaries Method histrionics, which lends the film a fittingly surreal tone. Furthermore, the porn inserts (including two lusty lesbians and a wild, full-blown (pun intended!) orgy scene)--whose integration runs the gambit from clumsy to seamless--are entrancingly sleazy, a complement to Caligula's own prurient pleasures, and an affirmation of our own.\n\n7.5 out of 10"

Watching it again recently, I saw that instead of it being a monumental folly \u0096 or the most expensive porno ever made \u0096 it is in fact a work of Visionary Prophecy which predicts and shows the horror that the Western World has fallen into in the last 30 years. The first section of the film, in Tiberius' court, is obviously based upon what was happening in America in the seventies. The continual partying, the fascination with loveless, experimental and sado-masochistic sex, the self-indulgence and egotism are all there. The film goes on to show where this behaviour leads: to the madness which is the tyranny of an uncontrolled Ego. Caligula in this film is Egotism personified \u0096 paranoid, authoritarian, insane. The film is a series of poetic Visions \u0096 the harvesting machine which crops human heads (the harvest of global capitalism has been and continues to be wide-scale suffering and death); the wedding of Proculus and Livia (loyalty and honour is raped and humiliated in the service of despotism); the prostitution of the Senators wives (those in power-positions in corrupt states find themselves wedded to harlots \u0096 i.e. corrupt materialist philosophies); the election of a horse (Man's animal nature elevated); the pyramid-structure of Rome (a rigid hierarchy with a `reptile' consciousness at its head and slaves at the bottom). Caligula IS Western Capitalism as it now exists. If you buy into it \u0096 if you live in its court \u0096 you will find yourself on an uncontrollable wheel of fate which will replace and kill you at the finish. Mankind's rational ego has set itself up in the place of God and finds only horror and tragic death. The most poignant moment of the film has the Emperor attempting to make love to his sister's dead corpse \u0096 the barrenness of life lived on a purely physical material level exposed for all to see \u0096 nature breeds only a perishable vegetable being. The film looks as good as any Fellini and contains some brilliant work from the actors \u0096 McDowell is legendary, Gielgud and Steiner great (notice how Steiner's Longinus, Caligula's treasurer, is a physical manifestation of the penis, complete with a slit on the top of his head). The film is a grand warning for us all \u0096 and a portrait not of ancient history but of the HERE and NOW."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes the worst of a great writer is better than the schlock of an expensive movie with well-known movie stars, poorly written. Such is 'Caligula', which I bought several years ago and was disgusted by because of the continual sex scenes. In fact, there's so much sexual activity, it gets boring. It's amazing that the present Bush administration hasn't ordered all copies bought up and publicly burned. That's coming, as we march backward into der Fuehrer-land. It's almost refreshing to watch this movie, so as to remind us of a time when movie producers weren't terrified to produce anything that showed the left titty of a woman. On some discussion boards, the word 'titty' is censored as we become a nation disgusted by sex and turned on by violence.\n\n\"Caligula\" needs to be seen as well to remind us of that other empire, where the moral degeneration was such that the leaders of the empire provided the people with sex orgies and animals rending human beings limb from limb to divert their attention from the rot within the government. This is similar to the NASCAR and \"Desperate Housewives\" diversions, in which people profess 'moral values', but flock avidly in the hope of seeing death on the circular track, and sexual teasing in prime time.\n\nRoddy McDowell was not at his best in this movie, and you can see why Gore Vidal wanted nothing to do with this director, once he saw the way the movie was being shot. It would be interesting to find out how much of Vidal's work was actually left in the film. Should be seen for historical interest, and a lesson for today."

Avoid the watered down, compromised, R version which is a travesty created to please the censors.\n\nI have bad news for the prudies who don't like this movie because of its extreme sex, violence, and sensuality. The movie is accurate. This is how it was in Rome at that time. Go read the contemporary histories in Latin. I have. If anything the film downplays the reality of Rome during Caligula's reign.\n\nThe people who agreed to be in this movie, knowing full well that the project was VERY controversial, provide world class and Oscar level acting for the most part. The script is very good and largely based on histories of the time which are in the Vatican library.\n\nWatch it twice. The first time you are going to be blown away by the sex, violence, and action. The second time you can see the acting. If you are a good Christian, cross yourself and run the other way. This film isn't for prudes."

As it was very unusual for my brother and I to go to bed like this, i think we asked them the day after how was the movie and they got really upset and don't want to talk about it ! For sure i recorded the data for later and as an adult, it was a duty to look for it !\n\nHonestly it's very hardcore, graphic and i can't fathom my parents watching it with their family as as this time in France no porn movies were aired to the TV ! The great idea of Guccione was to sell it as a Peplum and not like an adult movie ! For a naive audience (like my family), they see a cover with a roman coin so it's very innocent ! This movie is such a classic that every antiquity hot scene looks like it ! The girls, and especially Anneka, are beautiful and are really skilled experts : all the sexual combination are done and it's totally exciting (especially the lesbian, orgy scenes)! I don't know if it's the most expensive porn movie ever but at least, the production is sumptuous and the sets looks like the best Hollywood movies (and have also some big names in it!). For me, it's thus a really must see movie !"

        "review_detailed_main": "Caligula is one of the most fantastic films I have seen, and yet I do not feel comfortable forwarding it to the \"immature\" of mind. Because the movie touches on some very 'controversial' issues, such as nudity, violence, and sex, the film is immediately labeled as some sort of a historical-pornographic film.\n\nI believe that \"Caligula\" accurately depicts what daily life was like during the reign of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (Caligula). Malcolm McDowell brought Caligula to life in his role as the crazed emperor, showing his many mood swings, and even sincere emotions.\n\nI popped in the film not knowing what to expect--some sort of cheesy play-off of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.\n\nIt is anything but.\n\nThe music fit the mood perfectly, giving an \"eerie\" sense; but perfection arrived with the fade-in of Mark 8.36 \"What shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul.\" Even before the opening credits began rolling, the movie had my full attention, because of that first verse.\n\nCaligula is a movie profound on many different levels: not only does it accurately depict daily Roman life; it humanized Emperor Caligula, bringing to realization the fact that he also was human.\n\n**If you perhaps enjoyed \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", I believe you would also enjoy Caligula, only Caligula is very explicit."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a must see film for anyone interested in Roman history, particularly the fall of the Roman empire.\n\n\"Caligula\" (Latin: Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was the popular nickname of Gaius (31 August 12 AD \u2013 22 January 41 AD), Roman emperor from 37 AD to 41 AD. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nThe film focuses on the period from his adolescence and crowning as Emperor till the time he is brutally assassinated with his wife and child. The method of assassination of Gaius is eerily similar to that of the emperor Julius Caeser who was stabbed 30 times.\n\nThe film portrays him as a cruel tyrant who loves to torment his Senators and also as sex pervert. The film shows him having sexual relations with his sister Julia Drusilla. The film shows him as a man who thinks he can do anything he pleases, without any shred of thought to the consequences and also thinks that he is a God.\n\nHe doesn't win favor with the Senate and is assassinated before he can do more damage to the Roman Empire.\n\nVeteran actor Malcolm McDowell(A Clockwork Orange, Time After Time) plays the emperor Caligula and gives a powerful performance.\n\nOther notable actors/actresses are: Peter O'Toole as Emperor Tiberius John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Paolo Bonacelli as Senator Chaerea.\n\nThe film contains scenes of sex and violence and I therefore do not recommend it being shown to persons under the age of 18. This film is one of the most infamous cult films ever made and remains banned in several countries to this day.\n\nDespite this film being regarded as one of the worst films of all time, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it portrays the most chaotic period in Rome's history.\n\nSimilar films: The Robe (1953) and its sequel Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954), Julius Caesar (1970)."

I first became familiar with his work when I saw A Clockwork Orange and after seeing him in that film I immediately rated him 3rd in my all time favourite movie stars. I then saw him in Cyborg 3 which was disappointing but his short appearance was legendary acting. Very recently I have seen Caligula and McDowells performance touched me. Usually my top 2 favourite actors were Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro but after seeing McDowells performance in this film I have to say in my opinion he puts them both to shame.\n\nCaligula is about a prince (who has the same name as the title of the film)who's grandfather is the lord of the world, Caligula then sees the opportunity to take it all away from the King and he does not let the opportunity pass. Caligula becomes a man of true power and this power turns him into someone evil! with outstanding performances from not only McDowell but also from Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren Caligula is a great experience.If you ARE AGAINST STRONG Violence AND STRONG SEXUAL PREFRENCES THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU, but if you don't mind all that and you are a fan of Malcolm McDowell then you must see this movie!!!!!!!!!!"

There is lots is hardcore, XXX, full penetration sex. The gore was decent but I the story telling made up for it. It's one of those rare movies that I could watch forever and wish it didn't have to end. It gets it point across very well and it portrays Caligula as not a monster or a mad man, but as an average young man given more power than he knows what to do with. It show him as a scared young man and how the power gradually corrupts him and he gets more evil and becomes more of a tyrant as the movie goes on. As far as the sex it's very erotic and high quality. The only down side is the gore was a bit lacking. I don't know why so many people hate this film, I would guess there just closed minded, uptight, prudes that can except a movie that is daring and won't hold back to tell the true story as accurately as possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "So when I first saw this movie I was in college studying history. I had just finished a series of books on Caligula's reign when I came across the full uncut film in a movie store. I bought it thinking it would be along the same lines as Ben Her because it had a great cast mentioned. When I started the film and saw it was a penthouse production I instantly thought what did I get myself into.\n\nNow I have to say it's shocking to watch with plenty of wtf moments and there are scenes that drag on with gratuitous amounts of porn. However as disturbing as some visuals are in this film, when you read The Twelve Caesar's by the Roman author Suetonious it actually describes alot of the things you see. Now I would like to say that book is about as credible as a tabloid talking about Brad and Angelina, alot of it is unproven conjecture and speculation, but is a valid source to see opinions of the general Roman population at the time. I myself view the movie as grossly exaggerated like it's book source but enjoyable to some extent. Some of the more shocking things shown in the movie is more well known from the reign of the previous Caeser Tiberius. The story could've been told in a better way and more background would make the average person understand what's going on. I understood the plot only because I read enough stuff on the subject matter that I could peice it together. This isn't an often watch for me, every time I've seen it after the first view is I'm subjecting someone to see it as they think I'm exaggerating what it is. I definitely recommend people who like movies on ancient Rome to watch once but be warned as you might find some of unsettling. I recommend some reading on the subject beforehand for better understanding, then it also comes across more clever than simply depraved."

How could anyone willfully watch a notorious video nasty like Caligula and then complain about gratuitous sex and violence? Well, there's no mincing words about it with me: that's why I watch the thing and Caligula is about as high budget and classy as it gets for this level of nasty. Not \"historically accurate\"? Seriously, how many movies where they try to show life as it was hundreds or thousands of years are accurate? Probably none. The nightly news can't even get a story straight that happened a few minutes ago.\n\nThe way the story plays out in the film is above average, not fantastic, but interesting and not garbage. I think the pacing is OK and it is never boring, despite the long runtime. The acting is also pretty good for a film of this nature. The fact that they sunk as much money and effort into this film as they did allow the film to stand as a towering oak, casting shade on the puny saplings attempting to shock and offend that followed afterward. It is truly a benchmark of extreme sex and violence that few films have come close to touching in the decades that followed. Of course, I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, but I would think the film's reputation would precede itself at this point. Love it or hate it, chances are there will never be anything else like it, so check it out."

Caligula is different, it is a big budget movie that is part porn movie, part Hollywood epic, part bad seventies camp romp.\n\nYet, it was one of the most powerful movies I have seen recently. Sex and violence were explicit and common place in Empirial Rome, and so they must feature in this movie. They are not little inserts but they are the raw emotion that over shadows the plot (maybe there is too much sex really).\n\nIn Empirial Rome your father had the right to kill you, an Empress once competed with the most famous whore in Rome to see who could sleep with the most men in one night, and the Empress won. Violence and death were public entertainment and emperors lived in fear of their lives while being obeyed instantly.\n\nThe pure feeling of this movie makes it powerful beyond any other sword and sandals epic made before or after. Historical accuracy is not important, only the fantasy being emperor and the thought experiment of what such a life would do to someone.\n\nSee it because\n\nit is different\n\nbecause it is emotional and primal\n\nBut don't watch Mel Brookes' History of World before watching this or you will probably laugh too much."

I don't know if such a story was real or not but such things were there in past. That arrogance of humans in few places is depicted honestly or at least bravely. If one can overlook un-overlook-able eroticses in the film, one will definitely move along with it in its depiction of madness, lust of power and sex, and what not. Can't say again if incidents are real then how much honestly they are filmed but sure thing that such events are reality of human history not too old at various developing places.\n\nI wish this movie can tell about or show us about the extreme or limit of money, power, sex in human life. Some idea can sure be taken in as to what happen now when i have everything."

        "review_detailed_main": "I came downstairs one evening, when my mum and dad had gone to bed. My dad was recording something on Channel 4. I checked it out on Teletext, and it seemed appealing - a Roman epic from 1979 about an emperor who goes mad with power. I thought, \"why not?\" I was certainly not prepared for what I ended up seeing.\n\nI get the impression Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought what I thought - that this was going to be a Roman epic and not a porn film. Oh, well. I enjoyed it. The version I first saw was three hours long and had historic scenes interspersed with almost hardcore pornography.\n\nObviously, the sex scenes turned me on, and watching this film felt like an extremely guilty pleasure, but to be honest, I really enjoyed the other scenes too. The film as a whole seemed scattered and not professionally edited, but it had a charm all of its own. I began to feel compassion for Caligula, despite his faults heavily outweighing his strengths.\n\nOne thing that deserves a special mention is one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever. The main theme is one that provides the essential backdrop to the film, and in this case it paints Caligula as a tragic hero, defeated by his own madness, giving a sympathetic feel, overall.\n\nBy the end of the film, I felt as though I had been on an epic journey, and I didn't feel shortchanged. It was full of bizarre sex, bizarre violence, and bizarre decisions - phallic symbols aplenty and sexual deviance accompanied by a king mad with power.\n\nIt's well worth watching, because there is nothing out there like this film. It's a hardcore porno, with A-class actors. Something that will probably never occur again in our lifetime."

One could have left them out, but they don't diminish the overall quality of the movie in my opinion. After all Caligula has been portrayed in history as a sexual pervert and a madman and the view on sexuality was a totally different one in ancient Greece or Rome. Artistic freedom of the director as far as I'm concerned. Didn't see many movies that stuck 100% to historical facts up until now..."

Malcolm mc Dowell is perfectly casted as Caligula. He runs around like a true madman. The only small minus, is the performance of some of the Italian actors. Extra note: The scene with Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner is one of the most sexual in a non porno movie. Overall is this one of the best movies i have ever seen."

Absolute power to an individual will bring out the animalistic cruelty and sexual perversion.\n\nCaligula is a film that deals with such absolute power and its by-products, that are bestowed on the infamous Roman Ceaser. Malcolm McDowell did a wonderful job in enacting the maniacal role. All the other actors are merely supporting his performance. Peter O'Toole was great in his role. He was very expressive as a dying tyrant who doesn't trust his heir to the throne. His character is also very pervasive and Toole splendidly performed a s one. Helen Mirren has nothing much to do than standing as an eye candy wife of Caligula.\n\nThe movie is filled with nudity and gore. Yet, you will not remember the movie as a softcore or you wouldn't be aroused by the content. Director Tinto Brass made sure that the tone was maintained throughout. Watch Caligula for the pure passion of a bunch of men to tell a shocking story.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Try this movie, if you are OK with the nudity and gore."

With disembowelment, beheadings, beastiality, incest, fisting, rape, sodomy, genital consumption, bowls of semen, sex with midgets, and all other sorts of mutant sex in a wide range of deformaties Caligula is the supreme ruler.

First, that someone like the people from Penthouse really being interested in history, and this film is very historically accurate. As well having big name actors baring thier souls and bodies for a film like this. Also, sex seems to be a point that other reveiwers bring up, but in this film the sex is actually dirty and not a turn on. Even in the graphic lesbian scene, while the girls enjoy each other, the music is actually very sombre and dark. This is not a hard core sex flick, and I hate it being described that way. There is excellent acting, a good story, and great sets. It's a little dated from 1980, but still holds up well 20 years later. It's also obvious that the actors loved what they were doing, and believed in the over all project. This was a labour of love, and a very important movie. Hats off to all involved in this movie, I'm glad you all had the guts to make it, and put your reputations on the line. For people who have not seen this movie yet, you have to watch the unrated version that runs 156 minutes! Cheers! :o)"

However after the opening scene and seeing in the opening credits that Penthouse was involved, I knew it was going to be an unusual movie.\n\nI know just a little bit about Caligula so I don't know if this movie is historically accurate or even aiming for that so I didn't look at it from this perspective. A movie almost 2 and a half hours long, ancient Rome is portrayed as a vulgar and brutal place. Full of debauchery and people getting killed at the whims and fancies of the bloodthirsty emperors and the equally ruthless population.\n\nThe settings were amazing. It must have been a massive undertaking to visualize ancient Rome. It's very impressive.\n\nThe excess in nudity and sex was effective in showing the vulgar empire of Caligula but also got tired quickly. As were the insecurities and monstrous side of Caligula. I think the nudity and brutality did add a certain level of rawness in portraying ancient Rome as an animalistic society. However the movie still got repetitive as the same scenario seemed to be repeated over and over again. This movie would have been better if it was an hour shorter."

Truthfully, it was a small price to pay for such funding. The nudity was certainly well within reason in the costuming. The dialogue covering the orgy scenes was very insightful into the dramatic viewpoints of the characters. Bizarre, but true. Much of the movie is to tear either at your stomach or your heart. No. It is not bad. It makes everyone who watches it feel too much and think too many things to be bad. I agree, it is difficult to take.

CALIGULA was a daring film experiment incorporating big-name, established talent, and the raw energy of under ground film techniques. What results is nothing short of a fascinating product. And that right there is the point of the film. To shock you; you can't believe you're seeing what you're seeing. Beyond the violence and the sex is a well written, acted, and photographed film. All of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can't help but think he's like that in real life. His portrayal of Gaius Caligula just drips with maniacal megalomania. The little-known Teresa Ann Savoy is convincing as Drusilla, Caligula's sister. And Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar, whose diseased face is rotting away, is truly an oddity to behold...put he pulls it off well. The acting in general is all very good. The use of music is also to be noted. There are original, evocative pieces..!?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to strongly disagree with the previous comments. Yes, this movie has inaccuracies - of course it does. Gore Vidal was not around in the time of Caligula. The point of this movie is not to portray a dead-on account of Caligula's rule. The point is to give you a glimpse of what life was probably like when he ruled, as well as to show what can happen in a society when one person is given absolute power. The point is also to shock you. This is a graphic movie, and not only the sex scenes. I think the acting all around was very good. Malcolm McDowell is downright scary as Caligula, and Helen Mirren is great (and sexy) as his wife.\n\nAs for the sex scenes, there are really only two major ones in the movie. There is a lot of nudity and other sexual activity, and I can see how someone could say it's gratuitous - but, they didn't wear much for clothing in those days and it fit with the rest of the movie. Now, the two major sex scenes - they're a little misleading in the context of the movie. They were not filmed with any of the main actors present - they were done separately (yes, there are clips of the main actors during both of these scenes - but they're not involved directly in them). Malcolm McDowell has said he was upset that they were added and claimed he did not know they were being added. They are very graphic scenes, and certainly the term pornographic would fit. However, they are not like what you would see if you went out and rented a xxx movie today. There is no, or at least very little, direction in the scenes. The sex is passionate and unscripted - you can tell they're actually enjoying it. The two scenes are much more erotic than any porn made today."

What kind of disappointed my though that apart those orgies, those were needed of course, some of them were pointless having no relations to the plot and continues of drama, but anyway this movie is underestimated too much. Most people complain about it being just too much out of frames of normal cinematography drama concept, but never less they don't want to notice the beauty of the drama in it. Anyway it is not a home made made porno video, but simply represents what has been happening in 37 - 41 years after Jesus Christ, what should be accepted without freaking out.\n\nGenerally it has very great acting, costumes and music, only may be the direction and camera is shitty, cause the director is a porno master, and the movie should was too much pornoficated when it should have been remembered as one of the greatest dram in the history of cinema."

I saw the x rated cut when I was younger and of course I liked it as any young man would but otherwise it didn't have much of an impact on me. But I just saw the \"ultimate cut\" on 4K and I absolutely loved it. All the X rated inserts are removed and more material has been added which as I understand was quite the undertaking as there was something like 90 hours of footage to go through. Supposedly this is how it was intended to be seen and according to Umbrella Entertainment, who released the latest physical media release (and it's a great one), this was how it was originally played in Europe, specifically Italy. It's a little confusing the way it all went down so don't take my word on that but what I can say with certainty that what is left behind is a really great movie. 3 hours that fly by and such a magnificent performance from Malcolm. Seriously. It does have its kind of cringy over the top moments but nothing that took away from my complete enjoyment of this movie. It's a really new found fondness that I didn't expect to walk away with. So I give, only the ultimate cut an 8/10. I really feel that it's the only way to go unless you want to watch other cuts out of curiosity."

Both have in essence the right to exist. I am speaking of course of the high budget, main audience, major\n\nfeature film; in the likes of 90% of the movies we regularly see...\n\nAnd of the, low-budget, mass-produced, pornographic flics of the\n\nanonymous masses. -- I have NEVER seen a film in which these two were united; until\n\nthis ONE exceptional movie.\n\nLet there be no doubt about it: This is one hell of an EXPLICIT\n\nmovie. It will show you scenes of extreme sexuale violence, the\n\nlikes of which whould put a smile an \"the Marquice the Sade\u00d5s\"\n\nlips. It will show you orgies in which no bodily fluid is spared.\n\nPeople are tortured to death.... in real time! Well, you catch my drift.\n\nBut... there is a totally different side to \"Caligola\". It had huge\n\nproduction cost! I casts some very fine actors, who perform their\n\nparts with perfection. It has an intriging, fabulous, story about\n\nPower and the abuse of it. It puts you back to the Rome of two\n\nthousand years ago. I is one of the grandest movies made.\n\nThus, I marvel... What great courage of the makers, achieving the\n\ncombining of these two in the same movie!\n\nIf you have an open mind, this is the thing to see!"

        "review_detailed_main": "An Ambitious Young Man by the name of Caligula (Malcolm Mc Dowell), which he's a family member of a craze Rome's Mad Emperor (Peter O'Toole). Caligula is in love and he haves a unholy passion for his sister (Teresa Ann Savoy). Which his sister feels the same way towards his brother. Things Changes, When the Emperor's best friend (John Gielgud) dies from killing himself and the Emperor is killed by Caligula's best friend (Guido Mannari). Once Galigula becomes the Emperor, He becomes the Ruler of Rome but his style and his ambition goes out of his control. But Caligula takes a liking to Rome's Most Infamous Prostitute (Helen Mirren). Caligula's fiendishly inventive means of disposing those who would oppose him and the details of his cruel, bizarre reign are revealed right here.\n\nDirected by Tinto Brass (Salon Kitty) made a strange, strong, bizarre and campy film with surreal moments. This film meant to be soft-core drama with some explicit scenes of both sexes. But when Bob Guccione produced the film, he added some hardcore pornography footage. Which the film stock doesn't match with the original cinematography of the movie. Brass was fired from the film, when he was nearly done filming the picture and sadly... he never had final cut. Which i am sure with Brass' cut, it could have been a greater film. Although Brass and actor McDowell made any changes to Gore Vidal's original screenplay. Which Vidal's screenplay was more of a historic drama.\n\nThe original DVD version is the uncut version. DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an actors biographies and an interesting although silly vintage one hour documentary of the movie.\n\nThe new Three Disc Set is \"The Imperial Edition\". Disc One has an new anamorphic Widescreen (2.00:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround Sound and the original Mono sound. Disc One also has Theatrical Trailers of the infamous picture.\n\nDisc 2 is the pre-release version with most of the hardcore footage is gone from Guccione infamous version and this version is more coherent than disc one and correcting the bad obvious continuity error in this version. Disc One has the same anamorphic transfer and sound but the picture quality is slightly darker than disc 1. Three version has three commentaries tracks. Commentary one is by actor:McDowell and moderated by film writer Nick Redman. Commentary two is by actress:Mirren and moderated by film writers Alan Jones & Chaffin. Commentary three is by on-set writer of the film:Ernest Volkman and moderated by Image DVD Producer:Nathaniel Thompson. Disc 2 also includes Deleted/Extended Scenes, while some they look interesting. Unfortunely, there's no sound on the dialogue and even no subtitles. Only could hear the score from the late Bruno Nicolai \"Paul Clemente\".\n\nDisc 3 has plenty of new bonus features as well. Three different featurettes with actor:John Steiner, Ex-Penthouse Pet:Lori Wagner and director:Brass. Which these interviews are fascinating and they offer different in-sights of the film. Disc 3 includes the original vintage one hour documentary as well the alternate 10 minute featurette, 15 behind the scenes featurettes and more. Die Hard fans of the film will enjoy this new edition. Although some viewers will find the Special Features more fascinating than the movie, especially the commentary tracks. This film went on to be a cult classic and it's the notorious behavior of the picture what makes \"Caligula\" is still talked about all these years.\n\nIt would have been a different movie if Brass had his final cut on his film. Especially if Guccione didn't produced this film. The cast are extremely good in the movie (especially McDowell), production values are first-rate and Brass visual style makes this distasteful if odd film an strange experience. If you dislike pornography, it is closer to be a real film on disc 2 of \"The Imperial Edition\". It's still a very flawed film but at least, you knew the director of the film or the screenwriter intentions didn't want to make this picture a XXX feature. It was certainly one of the most fascinating movies ever made during the 1970's. Don't miss it. (****/*****)."
