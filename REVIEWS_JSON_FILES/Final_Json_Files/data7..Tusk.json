Definitely for the art film crowd who tend to lean towards the chillingly wierd."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, Kevin Smith \u2013 I knew him well (mainly in the nineties during his Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy period). I would always say that he's one hell of a writer of dialogue, whether his work falls straight into the 'comedy' bracket, or he dabbles in other genres, i.e. romance, science-fiction fantasy or horror. And, this time round, he's playing with the 'horror genre.' 'Tusk' tells the tale of a complete idiot (played delightfully by Justin Long). He's a typical product of the modern age \u2013 a podcaster with ideas way above his station. Yes, he's a little bit famous, but it appears that a little bit of fame corrupts almost as much as absolute power. He thinks he's 'it' and lets everyone know it, whether it's his co-presenter, his doting girlfriend, or generally anyone he meets along the way.\n\nOne article on his upcoming podcast is an interview with a Canadian 'celebrity' who's also made his name on the internet. Sadly, the 'celebrity' in question is so traumatised with his newfound fame that he kills himself, 'selfishly' leaving our glorious podcaster with nothing to report on while in Canada. That's when he happens upon an interesting offer in a men's restroom. It leads him to a reclusive hermit, played brilliantly by Michael Parks, who offers to tell him his life's story.\n\nThis is the fun part. The interaction between the two is just about as perfect as dialogue can be. The two exchange tales and taken on life in the setting of Park's Gothic mansion. The tension is cranked right up to the max \u2013 you know something is going to happen (something bad, obviously), but you just don't know what. This atmosphere is just electrifying when combined with the snappy dialogue. Everything is going great until...\n\n...the film just kind of switches atmosphere and great dialogue for cheap shocks. And shocks that look pretty bad rather than shocking. The second half of the film is everything that the first half isn't, i.e. cheesy. Yeah, there are a few moments of brilliance thrown in there, but, when you realise what's actually happening, you'll probably just shout, 'What... seriously?' It just doesn't work. It feels like someone has tacked a second (lesser) film onto a good one. If I was rating the first half I'd say it was awesome. If I was rating the second half I'd say don't bother. Fans of Kevin Smith may like the dialogue (like I did), but most people will not really go for this on account of the sudden change in mood that doesn't fit where the film was originally heading.\n\nBest to watch this one for free however you can before you invest in actually paying for it. Some people may find the second half as shocking as it was intended. Personally, I just found it a let down and stupid. Pity."

It is a hit or miss film, you either love it or hate it.\n\nJustin Longs acting in this film is great, but the film had a lot of jumping around and doesn't feel fluid with it's character arcs. It aims to be a dark comedy and I did find myself chuckling at some parts in the film, I equally found myself saying 'What am I watching' just as often. There isn't really much character development in the movie, but you do grow attached to Justin Longs character by the end of the film. The actual walrus when you see it is slightly disturbing.\n\nI genuinely felt slightly upset at the end of the film, but I felt as though the film could have been written better. If there was a more fluid feel to the scenes, and more development on the characters then this film would be getting better ratings.\n\nThe overall story is original, the acting is great, but as a final product it feels very rushed and choppy. I enjoyed tusk and think that it is underrated and being played off as 'too weird'\n\nYes, it's a weird film but it's trying to be different and is a nice change of pace from most horror films these days. If you want a film that will make you genuinely say 'WTF' at the end, tusk is for you. If you're going into this film expecting a good horror film, you're going to be disappointed."

        "review_title": "#WalrusYes -- Kevin Smith Has Gone Insane (and it's Wicked Fun)",
        "review_detailed_main": "I am biased in the realm of Kevin Smith movies so, for the record, my thoughts on TUSK are probably going to be a little more forgiving that what I believe is the general consensus (this movie gotten beaten down on Rotten Tomatoes). I've been a fan of Kevin Smith for years and I know I'll always give his movies a chance. Since the completion of his Jersey series (the Jay/Silent Bob era), his movies have certainly been hit and miss. None have been able to recapture the same level of fun but many have come close. TUSK is one of them. I love the Smith has reached a point where he's not trying to reach general audiences, opting instead to make movies for his existing fans. He's not afraid to go wild with a bizarre idea if it sounds like it could be fun. TUSK is the first film in what will be a trilogy of films set in Canada and opens with our introduction to Wallace Bryton (Justin Long). Wallace is a podcaster with his best friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment), living a successful life of producing his zany web show and failing to be faithful to his beautiful long-time girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez). He sets off alone into a remote area of Manitoba for an interview bit and finds a story in the mysterious Howard Howe (Michael Parks). Howard has lived a life of adventure and wishes to share his tale of sailing the sea, meeting Ernest Hemingway, and forming a friendship with a walrus on a deserted island\u0085.\n\nTUSK is a horror/comedy but it really struggles to fully function in either capacity. It finds a decent balance and I thought it was a weird, fun movie but it's never all that scary or funny enough. This isn't much of an issue for me because the movie's insane premise keeps it interesting and the performances, particularly Michael Parks, are so well done. The biggest problem with TUSK is actually the main character, Wallace. Not the performance; Justin Long does an awesome job. The actual character. Wallace is thoroughly unlikable. He's dismissive of his girlfriend and early scenes show how little he cares about her outside the bedroom. He proudly brags about his infidelities to his best friend/fellow podcaster Teddy, and he's got no moral qualms with taking advantage of others for the sake of producing his show. He's crude, self- centered, and arrogant and, when he finds himself in a horrifying situation, I had zero sympathy for him. Go ahead, Mr. Howe. Wallace deserves it; he already lacks any humanity. So right there, the movie is lacking suspense because I don't care what happens to our protagonist. I care more about Ally and Teddy who, despite how much of a jerk Wallace is, still rush off to Canada to find him when they learn he's in trouble. The real star (and most people seem to agree) is Michael Parks. His raving zealot character in Smith's RED STATE has got nothing on Howard Howe. He gets to go full- blown lunatic in TUSK. He starts off seemingly harmless: an old man in an electric wheelchair with a flair for elegant (if awkward) speech and a desire to share his stories with an interested party. But soon he drops the pretense, reveals his true self, and goes off the chain. It's almost hilarious but you know, if you were trapped alone with this man in the middle of nowhere, you were be scared out of your mind.\n\nWhat I enjoy most about TUSK is that it was done on a super-low budget and has to get creative as a result. That means practical effects. No CG. Any film using practical makeup FX is going to earn bonus points with me. We all know what's coming from the start of the movie and we're waiting anxiously for it. When the suit finally makes its appearance halfway through the film, it does not disappoint. Of course it's going to look fake. I don't care about that. It's a physical prop with presence and weight, it's hideous, it's a little funny, and it works 100% for me. The suit comes out. The walrus training begins. Things get weird. Meanwhile, Ally and Teddy are on the case and, for a while, their story is the more interesting one. Their adventure in Canada to investigate Wallace's disappearance leads them to an encounter late in the film with the film's second strangest character Guy Lapointe. I hated the character the first time I watched TUSK, thinking him too goofy for the film, but he'd grown on me by the second viewing. A former police investigator who's gone solo in his investigation of the weird series of missing persons in Manitoba, he's a surprise cameo (if you've managed to avoid spoilers) that is going to play a larger role in the second film of Smith's Canada film trilogy. I'm annoyed that he shows up so late in the game and it feels like it leads to a rushed conclusion to end the film. The first hour or so of the movie is very slowly paced and then it all gets wrapped up in a quickie of a climax at the finish.\n\nTUSK is a movie for Kevin Smith fans and I'm sure not all of them are going to dig it. It's a movie for people with a taste for the weird. It's got good (some great) performances, awesomely disturbing makeup FX, and Smith's unique style of writing running through it. Smith fans will probably have already sought this movie out, but I recommend others give it a shot as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "The very definition of \"not for everyone\", Tusk is an oddball, absurd, twisted midnight movie that plays more like a demented fever dream than a horror or comedy film. I'd never recommend it to anyone I intend to ever speak to again.\n\nHere are the reasons why you won't like it:\n\n1) It's unexpectedly surreal, with little interest in the laws of reality, or at least modern medicine and police work. And it's not directed in an obviously surreal, arty fashion like, say, a David Lynch picture, which makes it even harder to wrap your head around.\n\n2) It's got an odd tone. There's comedy, sure, but it's mostly a slower, more cringe- inducing variety than Kevin Smith is typically known for. There's suspense, and a bit of gross-out, but the film evokes more unease than outright scares, and the grotesqueries are more evocative of a nightmare after eating one too many sliders than, say, Saw. And it swings freely between the two with no warning at all.\n\n3) You haven't seen Tod Browning's \"Freaks\", a classic bit of cult cinema that Smith has made references to in other films. In fact, you probably don't even know it exists. (Cinephiles will notice rather direct references to many of Kev-O's other favorite movies as well, including Silence of the Lambs and Jaws.)\n\n4) You're Canadian, and your country and culture are No Laughing Matter.\n\nIf for some reason none of the above applies to you, may I recommend \"Tusk\"? It's oddball, gonzo, at times self indulgent and slow, but also occasionally very funny and strangely thought-provoking, provided you're willing to go along for the ride. It'll make an impression...especially if your short-term memory \"isn't what it used to be.\""

Due to their many misadventures Wallace goes to Canada to find material for one of his bits for his podcast only to comes up empty handed. That is until Wallace reads Michael Parks's letter on a bathroom wall looking for a lodging partner which takes us into what becomes of Justin Long.\n\nMichael Parks does a good job playing the \"crazy old man with an obsession\", pretty much the only things that stands out in this film. Kevin Smith does a good job of taking a strange part of his life and making it rather sick. The movie reminds you of \"The Fly\" in that it transforms someone from one level of a human being to the extreme.It isn't horror movie I'd love for the ages but once in a while if you want to fill that nasty, putrid part of your life then I guess this is the movie for it.\n\n**SPOILER** ending leaves wondering how is Wallace still alive?! He would of died of infection either that or god take him out of his misery."

I have seen other reviewers say that this one shows the depth of what happens when a pothead gets the ability to make his own movies, as an avid smoker of the greenery and a semi fan of Kevin Smith I take offense to this analogy. This is just a piece o' crap movie and weed shouldn't take the blame for it or the act of being a \"pothead\".\n\nIt really amazed me more that he convinced any legitimate actor to take part in the steaming pile of horse's anal relief. Justin Long doesn't knock them out of the park every time he takes on a role but how on god's great earth did he ever get talked into this, and I won't even try to figure out how the talk went that convinced Johnny Depp to get involved ... Do actors ever watch the crap they produce before its released, I would be truly embarrassed if I were even an extra in this piece of monkey spunk.\n\nLastly I have seen other reviews that compare this to The Human Centipede, I see how you can come to that comparison and I absolutely hated The Human Centipede, but its an Oscar winning movie in comparison to Tusk. As ridiculous as both concepts are for anything including a movie that's supposed to be somewhat entertaining, at least The Human Centipede tried to take itself somewhat seriously. Tusk try's to add levity to itself from time to time and fails at that as horribly as it does in turning a human into a walrus believably.\n\nI didn't toss in a lot of the spoilers and specifics I would like to because I hate reading reviews that pick apart the details of a movie I haven't seen, and there are PLENTY of other reviews here that already have done that. If you want some specifics read those, most of the ones that give it a 1 star rating are spot on. I am also not writing this in hopes that someone curious to watch it will be deterred from doing so, mainly because I watched this piece of monkey spunk so so should you if your curious. This is my personal F*CK YOU letter to Kevin Smith and anyone involved in this crap-fest of a movie. You could have fed a starving village in Africa with the money you wasted on something that should have never been produced. I truly hope this movie damages your career.\n\nLove, A former fan"

I truly believe and understand the characters, for a moment, but then everything crumbles. It crumbles right before your eyes, and the movie takes on a completely new shape, becomes a wholly new animal. The only thing that remains throughout is the very bizarre and deeply twisted sense of humor baked into the world's very foundation. It's so, so strange. I love strange films. I'm not sure if I love this film, but I did find it extremely fascinating, and I'd argue that's more important.\n\nHowever, the jumbled pacing is a significant problem, and the film loses its steam in the final stretches, sort of rushing to an end that didn't feel terribly climactic due to the directing. At least that's the feeling I had, and it left me unsatisfied.\n\nBut, again, this film was truly strange, and that is, to me, the greatest thing a film can be.

And I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI have seen movies with a similar premise; a person is trapped with a lunatic (Creep, and Misery, for example), or persons in the same situation (The Human Centipede, and Split), but unlike those movies, this one does things right. It keeps the perfect balance between humor, drama, and horror. And unlike most movies in this genre, the focus is not on the gore and sadism (like the Human Centipede). Instead we have a villain that I could not help but feel for, in-between the utter insanity of Michael Parks' character.\n\nAs for the actors, I have never been a fan of Justin Long (which was another reason why I didn't want to see this movie), but he did a very good job! And Michael Parks is absolutely brilliant. Without his performance the movie would not have been half as good. Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodriguez are giving very convincing performances. In fact, the only actor that I didn't like was Johnny Depp, who seemed to under the impression that this was one of Smith's adolescent comedies (and Smith clearly didn't correct him). In fact, had Johnny Depp not brought the movie down with his ridiculous overacting, I may have pushed the rating up a star. It was almost embarrassing to see him try to perform whatever he was doing, and whatever it was it was far from convincing, and honestly, I think the character does very little for the story. He only tells the audience what we had already figured out, or didn't need to know.\n\nSo give it a chance. It certainly is not as bad as so many here have claimed."

        "review_title": "Completely and utterly hilarious, enjoyable, weird and demented, Kevin Smith's \"Tusk\" is unlike anything else you'll likely see.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I went into \"Tusk\" with some worry and reservation.\n\nI consider myself a fairly big Kevin Smith fan. Particularly admiring his films \"Chasing Amy\", \"Dogma\" and \"Red State.\" And I think the (fairly recent) \"backlash\" against Smith is unwarranted for the most part. His films have always been unique and had a flavor all their own. And the man himself has always been open, candid and participatory with his fanbase. (Heck, this film's production was decided by his Twitter followers.) I just don't see why, in the past year or so, an increasingly vocal portion of the internet has turned against him.\n\nBut I wasn't sure what to make of this new film. Knowing it was inspired by an episode of his podcast left me worried it would be one-note. Knowing it was his first real foray into the world of \"body horror\" (a sub-genre that is incredible when done well, but laughable when done poorly) left me worried it might not quite work. And knowing full-well of its ludicrous premise left me worried it would either be too restrained or go way too far. I was worried this might be the first Smith film that I just couldn't get behind or even like. (And yeah, I even kinda dug \"Jersey Girl\", albeit admitting it was flawed.)\n\nBut boy, was I wrong. While it's definitely far from perfect, and far from being his best work, \"Tusk\" represents a bizarre, hellish and hilarious thrill-ride that left me constantly gasping and laughing. It's a terrifying fun-house ride and a twisted clown show that should please Smith fans and horror/comedy audiences looking for their fix of \"weird.\"\n\nJustin Long stars as Wallace Bryton, an American pod-caster who savagely makes fun of people in popular viral videos with his co-host. (Haley Joel Osment) When his trip to Canada goes wrong, and he discovers the subject of an interview he had scheduled has passed away, he attempts to salvage the journey by finding someone new to talk to for the show. He stumbles upon an open letter from \"Howard Howe\" (Michael Parks), a reclusive old man seeking someone to share his lifetime's worth of stories with.\n\nHowever, Wallace soon discovers Howe has an ulterior motive. Obsessed with a hatred of humanity and an idolization of a wild walrus he had \"befriended\" while at sea, Howe wishes to use surgical means to transform Wallace into the animal friend he had known years ago. As Howe slowly begins to alter Wallace's body into a grotesque new form (while mentally conditioning him to embrace his wild side), Wallace's girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) begins a desperate struggle to find Wallace and save him from his demented captor.\n\nThe acting is excellent all around, but Parks steals the show. Howe is equally charming, amusing and perfectly over- the-top, while also still able to be threatening. As weird as it is to say, I could see Parks winning some major awards for the role. Long is fantastic as Wallace. Though undeniably unlikeable, you still feel for him, and get a sense that beneath his cruel exterior, there's a fragile soul. And his role as the \"transforming\" Wallace/Walrus is just a hoot to watch. Rodriguez and Osment ground the film perfectly, giving wonderful weight to their smaller roles.\n\nThe only actor I cannot really comment on is the well-known and even mythical guest-star who shall go unnamed, to save the surprise. But what I can say is that this guest-role will definitely leave audiences polarized, as it's VERY \"out there.\" But I felt that, within the context of the film, it worked. The movie is quite zany on its own during the second half, and I think this character did a good job \"ushering in\" the audience to the film's true craziness when he showed up. And he supplied PLENTY of laughs.\n\nSmith's work on the film is an undeniable sign of growth as a storyteller. His script is tight, concise and full of great moments of shock and hilarity. And I found this to be by far his most visually striking work. Smith often used to sort-of belittle his own skills as a director and visual storyteller. (In part because his first film films were basic and simple in their execution) But this film is slick, stylish and wickedly shot. His guidance of the camera and performances is expert, and the senses of dread and humor he builds are wonderful.\n\nHowever, this is definitely a film of some flaws, which is where it loses some points. The film has some \"fat\" to be trimmed. (Or would that be \"blubber\" in this case?) A few sequences feel too drawn out, which creates a somewhat inconsistent pacing that makes it feel jarring at times. I also felt that the (rather radical) tonal shift that occurs midway through could give some viewers a sense of \"stylistic whip-lash.\" And it could be argued that the movie is a bit clustered in it's final half-hour, attempting to juggled a variety of emotions including fear, dread, sorrow, bemusement and amusement. It's almost too hard to concentrate and be mindful of how the film makes you feel, which is a pretty big problem.\n\nThat being said, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely absorbed in the movie from start-to-finish. And I most certainly will admit that I completely and utterly enjoyed myself. (And was quite shocked by just how darkly hilarious the film was, even at its bleakest moments.) It's not a film for everyone. And I can understand the polarized reaction. But for me (as a Smith fan, a fan of horror, and a fan of \"the weird\" and \"strange\") this was definitely worth seeing. And I will be buying it the second it's out on Blu-Ray.\n\nI give \"Tusk\" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Not for everyone. But if you're even remotely curious, it's well worth giving a shot."

A bit too much can also be attributed to the movie as a whole. This is not for the faint hearted mind you. This is not your Clerks movie or anything like it. Though the bits with Haley (I know, if you watch Sixth Sense before this and then this, it might be a shock to see him like this) and Justin could be attributed to that genre, but they are not the main focus here.\n\nThe fact that Michael Parks is in the main role (was also in Smiths Red State) elevates this movie for me.

        "review_title": "An innovating cult movie for decades to come",
        "review_detailed_main": "''Tusk'' is a movie that goes off the beaten paths. It's a potential cult movie which will be adored by some and despised by others for decades to come. It's almost impossible to have a neutral or no opinion on this controversial movie. It's not a question about getting it or not, it's simply a matter of personal tastes.\n\nThe story is quickly told. An American pod-cast host ends up in the isolated mansion of an old seaman in Manitoba who wants to share some stories about his life. One gets to know that the old fool is in fact a dangerous serial killer who despises mankind because he got intimidated, raped and tortured by the society after the brutal killing of his parents. The only thing that has ever shown respect to him was a walrus that saved him from a shipwreck in Northern Russia. In order to survive on an isolated island, the serial killer had to make the decision to kill his saviour just hours before he got saved. He regrets that decision and in order to relive this pivotal moment in his life again and to take revenge on a society that made him suffer all life long, the serial killer kidnaps, mutilates and tortures young men to transform them into walruses. While the imprisoned pod-cast host gets now mentally and physically unstable and begins more and more to act like a wild animal, his grounded partner and his cheating girlfriend realize that he is in danger. They arrive in Canada and team up with a drug addict and ex-police officer from Quebec to save their friend or what remains of his human body and soul.\n\nThe film is a grotesque that mixes black comedy, drama, horror and thriller elements all at once. The movie has many changes of tone. When you see the two main characters fooling around, the tone is humorous. A few moments later, you assist a burial after a suicide and the tone gets accusatory. The movie then cuts to an actress who is crying her heart out and complains about her cheating boyfriend as the tone gets depressing. Seconds later, she herself cheats on her boyfriend and the whole scene suddenly feels ironical. This film is filled with these fascinating changes of tones. You constantly change your mind about the different characters as well. The main character looks like a superficial idiot during his show in the beginning of the movie. His partner looks like the friendlier and smarter guy. His girlfriend looks like a confident, faithful and serious person. The villain of the story looks like an innocent old fool. Thirty minutes later, the main character has some intellectual dialogues and proves that he is not as dumb as one might have thought. His partner betrays his best friend by sleeping with his girlfriend who suddenly looks fragile, superficial and unfaithful. The old fool has become an intimidating criminal with a horrible past.\n\nIt's not just the tone that changes, the overall mood also does. What starts as a juvenile comedy movie in the key of ''The Interview'' turns into a bleak body horror film like ''The Human Centipede'', gets a touch of a crime comedy movie like ''Good Cop, Bad Cop'' and becomes an existential and nearly philosophical drama like the ending of ''I Saw The Devil'' for example.\n\nThose who say that this movie is bland, superficial and thoughtless are wrong. This movie has more memorable scenes than ten others together. It's a matter of taste whether you like these scenes or not. The scenes of the burial and the close-up on the crying girlfriend shook me up. The ring-tone of the main character's cell phone and the weird dialogue between the French Canadian police officer and the serial killer in front of a shack made me laugh out loud. The torture scenes in the old mansion and the closing part in a zoo made me feel disgust, horror and sadness at once.\n\nThe movie also includes many cultural elements in a humorous way. The idea of including the topic of Duplessis' orphans in the movie was brilliant and shows that the makers of the movie know what they are talking about. The food topic and especially the details about poutines in the movie were completely absurd and hilarious at the same time. The discussions about hockey and especially the Quebec Nordiques were the best jokes about Quebeckers I have ever heard and I have witnessed many lukewarm attempts.\n\nI'm going to admit that this movie is difficult. Those who are looking for a typical American comedy movie might get shocked by the explicit torture scenes. Those who are looking for a sinister body horror film may not dig the humorous parts. This film is not for closed-minded and light-hearted people who just want to get entertained. This movie will haunt you long after it ended in one way or another. All the things mentioned above make this film something really special. It's one of the few movies that still try to innovate at all costs. The more I think about the movie, the more I appreciate it and feel like watching it over and over again. If my review intrigued you and you consider yourself an open-minded and tough cineast, I can only warmly recommend you this incredibly entertaining mixture of the joyful and the woeful. For anyone else, try this at your own costs but don't tell me I didn't warn you."

Yes it was funny, but it could have been a lot funnier (though I might have felt this way because I was more annoyed than amused by a certain cop character...).\n\nIt was also a little too long. There were some scenes that could have been trimmed down or cut altogether, and that lost it a star for me.\n\nI know a lot of people have said you either love or hate this film, but I'm sitting in the middle of the road, leaning towards \"love\" because there was so much of this that worked -- the acting, the script, the cinematography, the subtlety of some of the jokes. But for me it just wasn't enough to scrape a higher rating.\n\nIf you want to see something truly wacky and disturbing, with just enough \"wtf\" moments to make it funny, then go and see this film. Whether or not you liked it, you'll still walk out of the theatre going, \"The hell did I just watch?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Kevin Smith's Tusk is about as far removed from the director's early body of work as one could possibly get, yet still carries that personal touch that made Clerks resonate with so many audiences. While Smith's debut was influenced by his years working at a convenience store, it's no coincidence that Tusk's protagonist, Wallace Bryton (Justin Long), is a successful podcaster whose long- running weekly show features himself and his closest friend laughing themselves into a stupor.\n\nThe film opens with one of these conversations, where Wallace and Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) are taking mean-spirited jabs at a YouTube celebrity, whose fame comes from the fact that he accidentally managed to slice his own leg off while wielding a samurai sword. Wallace has booked a flight to Canada to interview the young man, much to the chagrin of his live-in girlfriend Allie (Genesis Rodriguez), who disapproves of Wallace's cruel brand of comedy.\n\nAn unfortunate turn of events finds Wallace north of the border without a guest for the next episode, until he stumbles across an advertisement on the bulletin board of a local tavern, where an elderly man offers to trade room and board in exchange for someone willing to listen to his tales of a life spent at sea. Two hours later, Wallace finds himself at Pippy Hill, a sprawling estate full of eccentricities and inhabited by the wheelchair-bound Howard Howe (Michael Parks), whose musings about meeting a young Ernest Hemingway fascinate Wallace. But Howe's story of being shipwrecked and rescued by a walrus is the most bizarre of all, and his strange devotion to the creature that saved his life masks a sinister plan.\n\nPeppered with Smith's signature vulgarity, Tusk spends the first 40 minutes or so establishing a genuinely creepy vibe, before taking an abrupt detour into a realm that few filmmakers would have been brave enough - or stoned enough - to explore. There are images in this film that can't be unseen, and Long deserves a tremendous amount of praise for stepping into a role that's so far out of his comfort zone it might as well exist in another universe.\n\nBut Tusk is not without its problems. A bizarre cameo from an A-list star during the second half of the film is amusing at first, but quickly overstays its welcome and becomes far too indulgent. Likewise, the decision to reveal the darker side of Wallace's personality makes it difficult to sympathize with his predicament, which is further complicated upon discovering that his two friends aren't exactly saints, either.\n\nWhile Tusk doesn't quite measure up to the bar Smith set with Red State (my personal favorite), it's another positive step in his ongoing evolution as a filmmaker. Smith took a ridiculously silly idea for a film that most people never would have dared to attempt, and somehow made it work - for the most part, anyway. It's definitely Smith's least mainstream-friendly offering, but that's okay, because his passion and vision is alive in every frame, and it makes me excited to see what he does next."

However, after a certain point very early on, the movie stops being scary, and becomes extremely difficult to take seriously. It wasn't even so bad that it was funny, it was just absolutely terrible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, which is a hard thing for me to say, since I'm a fan of many of Kevin Smith's movies. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different movie. You will be better off not seeing it."

I came across it on one of my streaming services a couple weeks ago and decided to cross another film off the list! And part of me still wishes I hadn't. With this being a horror film, I expected some sort of scare factor, but in my opinion there wasn't any. Some psychological horror elements with the antagonist of the film were definitely there, but that was about it. I will try to keep this review as spoiler free as I can. If you are a fan of gore/body horror, this is a good movie for you. The scenes with the serious gore made me internally uncomfortable. This movie stayed with me, and still has, but I genuinely hated it.\n\nI may have appreciated it more if the ending had been more satisfactory, but it made absolutely no sense, left me enraged, and was so insanely out of character for two out of three of the main protagonists. I can typically enjoy when a horror movie has a cruel ending, that's what horror is for, you're supposed to feel unsettled. And I guess in that sense, this movie nails it. But I couldn't even appreciate the ending with how much it angered me.\n\nAll in all, the acting is wonderful, special effects are believable and horrific in a good way, and the cinematography is well done. The base idea for the film has serious potential, but I feel like it could have been executed better.\n\nSo to end with an explanation for my title... gore/body horror fans everywhere should watch this movie, but I will never ever watch it again."

Fox News? That bloody Flo woman flogging insurance? When I pronounced the movie to be irredeemable poppycock he was shocked... \"But you love Kevin Smith! You even liked Red State!\" And then I saw it - that, right there, is the problem. If this had been merely a SyFy movie, with William Shatner and Tara Reid, it would be mocked, and rightly so. The fact that this came from someone capable of such awesomeness is what makes this soooo much worse. Personally I could see nothing of Kevin smith in this.. nothing. The script had none of his usual flair, flow and crackle. The \"big reveal\" was clumsy and laughable. As for the \"see them from space\" plot holes and inconsistencies? Randall would be beside himself. This movie would be in a box, under a blanket behind the shelf containing Navy Seals. Damn, I should have watched Navy Seals. Here is the weirdest part - the performances were pretty good. Justin pulled off smarmy-but-likable (mustache not withstanding - the most horrifying part of the movie for me) Johnny Depp was amusing enough, doing a fine impersonation of a drunk Alan Partridge. I even liked Haley Joel Whatsit. But those mattered not. I know all directors have lower points, and god knows I am no-one to criticize, but my reason for writing is this: I refuse to believe that everyone involved, at all the many points in the process, watched this and said \"Yup. This is fine\". Not good even, just fine. If I do a crap job at my work, you can bet someone will call me out on it. Does this make him a bad director? Of course not. He is a witty and talented chap indeed... which is the very reason this smarts so much. Here comes my problem, the end - *Spoiler* - after all this trauma, they \"rescue\" him and plonk him in a dodgy roadside zoo!!!! They know he isn't a real bloody walrus right? He was with that bloke for what... 5 mins? Not years! No reconstructive surgery? PTSD counseling? Not even Dr Phil??? Nothing???? the reason he's not speaking to you is because his tongue is torn out.... not cuz he is a walrus - don't throw the poor lad a fish, you patronizing tart! Perhaps \"Tusk 2 - The Revenge\" is justified just to address this. Or maybe not."

The role which Justin Long plays is a seemingly unredeemable douche, yet his world is written as though he's the complete opposite, it's odd because in the scenes with his girlfriend and she treats him like a good guy yet even with her he's an unbelievable douche. The problem with Kevin Smith and horror seems to be that within the script he makes his protagonists unredeemable. The problem with this movie, feels like the length they had to fill to have a full movie, I can still listen to the Smodcast episode and laugh.\n\nNot the worst movie ever made (Joel Schumacher didn't direct it), the question is, is it worth watching? Well, if you've seen Red State, was that worth watching? I'd say Red State was better, but it's also nothing special."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Tusk\" takes the premise of twenty-first-century podcast writers to harrowing and grimly humorous levels; Justin Long plays Wallace Bryton, a podcaster who interviews eccentrics around the world for his podcast show. After a trip to meet an interviewee Manitoba goes bust, he finds a phone number for an old seaman on a bulletin board in a bar restroom. The man claims he has many stories to tell, and Wallace jumps at the opportunity. Bad idea.\n\nI went in knowing virtually nothing about this film, aside from the fact that Kevin Smith had written and directed it, so my experience seeing \"Tusk\" was one hundred percent uncolored by any preconceptions; I hadn't even seen a trailer. In fact, I didn't even know the film existed, and was fascinated when I saw the Gothic poster among the \"now showing\" at the local theater.\n\nI'm not particularly a Kevin Smith fan; I've only seen one or two of his films, so I'm not sure what most people expect of him, but I found this film utterly head-scratching and fascinating. Smith's signature humor bleeds throughout the entire script, but \"Tusk\" is just as much a horror film as it is a dark comedy. Comparisons to \"Misery\" and \"The Human Centipede\" are apt I suppose, though \"Tusk\" is miles more enjoyable than \"Centipede\"\u2014 perhaps because the uncomfortable humor is slightly more digestible\u2014 and even brassier than \"Misery\".\n\nGrimly humorous moments revolving around Wallace and his captor, serial killer Howard Howe, are punctuated and offset with jaw-droppingly emotive monologues from characters (Genesis Rodriguez's is particularly powerful and exemplifies legitimate talent); where there's humor, there's also sorrow, and insanity, and monstrous violence. Johnny Depp's appearance in the film as a token French Canadian P.I. from Quebec is appropriate to the film's overall zaniness, and Justin Long is annoying and lovable as the mouthy Wallace. Michael Parks' turn as the villain is utterly insane, funny, and macabre all in one, and the chemistry with Long on screen is great. The visual aesthetic here is more than accomplished as well; the film is slick and effective, and the photography at Howe's remote rustic mansion is brooding and dark.\n\nAs I said, I knew virtually nothing about this film before seeing it, but I do know afterward that some people will enjoy \"Tusk\" and other people will be completely baffled and/or confused and/or repulsed by it. It's outrageous and darkly humorous while simultaneously catering to the tropes of the abduction thriller and the horror film, and the concoction is ridiculous and oftentimes hilarious while still somehow managing to be absolutely compelling and suspenseful. My only gripe is that the final act felt rushed, though the Fleetwood Mac soundtrack almost made up for it. 7/10."

He has a practically visceral reaction of disgust every time the movie is mentioned. After years of hearing this, I foolishly decided that I might as well watch it to see how bad it could possibly be. In the back of my mind, I assumed that he was exaggerating. Good lord, he was not.\n\nI can say with absolute certainty that that was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Not only was the second half some sort of hallucinogenic nightmare that could only have been conceived under the influence, it wasn't even exciting. I was expecting a fast-paced, albeit weird, movie about a man who fights against his captor to escape the fate of (and I still can't believe I'm saying this) becoming a surgically-manufactured walrus. Other than the most ridiculous two minute fight scene that has ever \"graced\" the television screens of all the poor, horrified viewers of the world, the movie lacked any semblance of a main character's survival instinct and perseverance that make even the most unbearable movies somewhat redeemable.\n\nWhen I came to the reviews after somehow getting through that hour-and-forty minute fever dream, I assumed I would see reviews that similarly expressed the same utter confusion that I experienced. I shockingly found that that was not the case. I feel it is my job to warn anyone who may be perusing the reviews before watching: don't do it. Save yourself. You have the opportunity to spare yourself from being plagued by visions of the anthropomorphic walrus I will now see in my nightmares.\n\nTo close, I will impart some words of wisdom, hopefully more impactful than the collection of random literature quotes that spilled from the mouth of the antagonist throughout the duration of the film. This has long been said, and I leave it as advice for A24, Kevin Smith, and any young, bright filmmaker who may choose to endeavor on a path that may lead them down this avenue of cinema: just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

Reviews have been mixed or negative, and it is no secret that Kevin Smith makes more garbage than winners these days. His only real high point since the 1990s was \"Red State\". So, this was not likely to be good.\n\nAnd yet, I liked it. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Despite the sheer madness of it, and the rather annoying character played by Long, there was so much dark humor in here to really make me laugh. And Johnny Depp gives his best non-pirate performance since... well... a long time. Michael Parks is in top form, and is the driving force of this movie. But then, Michael Parks is always the driving force of the movies he is in (again, see \"Red State\").\n\nEven Kevin Smith failed to ruin this for me. His writing is not as tight as it once was, but Parks knows how to take a weak script and give it life. And the direction is actually much tighter than Smith is known for (he tends to excel on small sets, not knowing what to do with the camera if it needs moving, but actually kept it together for multiple locations). This might be because James Laxton (\"Bad Milo\"), a newcomer to Smith's world, was handling camera duties.\n\nAnyway, I liked it. I am probably in a small minority, though."

Not for the squeamish though as it is ridiculously morbid. Michael Parks does a great job acting his part as Howard Howe, as does the other lead actor Justin Long. The script is what really carries the whole thing. In a comedy sfx etc always comes secondary to acting and script, so it doesn't really matter if the effects aren't really great, in fact it puts the audience at ease, allowing them to not take the film so seriously and gross out."

From start to finish, this cinematic travesty felt like it was intentionally crafted to disgust and alienate its audience. The plot (if you can call it that) is an incoherent mess, bouncing from one grotesque scene to another without any purpose or direction. The dialogue is as nauseating as the visuals, riddled with cringeworthy lines that made me wonder if the script was written by an alien with a grudge against humanity. The characters are either insufferable or completely devoid of personality, leaving no one to root for, let alone care about. The filmmakers seem to have mistaken shock value for storytelling, bombarding the audience with gratuitous gore, uncomfortable imagery, and nonsensical plot twists that serve no purpose other than to provoke disgust. It's as if they tried to push every boundary just for the sake of it, without any thought about how those elements contribute to the narrative. I can't think of a single redeeming quality to this film. It's not \"so bad it's good,\" it's just bad. The only thing it successfully accomplished was making me regret ever pressing play. If you're considering watching it, don't. Your time is worth more than this garbage heap of a movie."

I was excited to finally watch it, but was remarkably unimpressed.\n\nYes, it has an outlandish premise. Yes, it is a horror and comedy. And yes, the somewhat offbeat Kevin Smith directed it.\n\nAs I watched it though, the premise just didn't seem that weird. I don't know if this is \"watched too much absurdism\" me talking. I do suspect that if I watched this in my teens or early twenties I would have thought it was cool, so I'll give it that. It still felt predictable and unsurprising though. You kind of get the point of where it's going and it just keeps going there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just not terribly satisfying.\n\nOne thing that I did find frustrating is that Smith did not figure out how to offset tension of the horror part of the film. Instead, just injecting a comedy side to the film that feels so completely different. I really can't put my finger on what or why this is, but there's just tension-relief beats that are missing in this movie that could have improved it for me.\n\nI realized after watching this movie that Smith often leaves me unsatisfied with his films and this one is no different. It's like he wants to say something deep and expositions a lot, but then just doesn't finish or the thought itself turned out to be nothing that spectacular. Unfortunately, I feel I'm doing the same thing with this review because I can't explain what exactly it needed, there's just a lot of movies that cleverly tie off an idea with the right use of motifs or themes where you feel like you've changed a little bit after watching it. Tusk was not that movie.\n\nAs a Canadian, I enjoyed the Canada jokes even though Guy Lapointe was a bit over the top. He kind of reminded me of the hilarious Jo Cormier (Quebecois comedian). It actually makes me tempted to see the other two followups to this... if that says anything.\n\nI kind of wish I'd seen this movie when I was younger when I first saw a lot of the other Kevin Smith movies and felt a little bit more moved, or that I'd listened to the podcast and felt part of its creation. This movie had its moments but didn't pull through all the way, unfortunately."

Want to never look at a walrus again in fear of thinking of this horrifying and disgusting movie?\n\nHonestly the thing that surprised me the most was Johnny Depp appearing in this, I feel like his talent definitely exceeds this movie by a long shot.\n\nPersonally not my thing, if you like the human centipede - this would probably be up your alley."

Kevin Smith's Tusk is perhaps the most disturbing comedy I've ever seen, even in the premise; a man is turned into a walrus. Oh boy...\n\nThe first act is noticeably well directed. It's funny and builds suspense as you realize what Wallace is in for. Then the story has an abrupt change of tone; instead of being a traditional comedy, it resorts to little more than shock humor. I understand that this is intentional, though I preferred the first act. After all, anybody can create something shockingly absurd. Then again, the fact that this started as a joke on a podcast and eventually became a movie is absolutely hilarious to me.\n\nPerhaps something's wrong with me for laughing at the final \"fight\" scene. On the other hand, it's like a car crash I can't look away from. My curiosity is enough to keep watching while the sick, twisted part of me finds it hilarious. Apart from the tonal shift, my biggest problem was Johnny Depp's character... I didn't care too much for his personality and could hardly understand what he was saying. I've visited Canada a few times, and nobody has ever been so difficult to understand.\n\nTusk is likely to be adored by most fans of dark comedy and body horror. I just wish that it would have stuck to the tone of the first act.\n\nRating: C."

Kevin Smith, can do better than this, so very much better and in my opinion should be ashamed to leave his name on the credits and not replacing it with Alan Smithee.\n\nOverall I cannot understand how this film was made and then given a release, it's not straight to DVD quality, it's not \"TV Movie\" quality.

Most of the main characters in the movie get a chance to deliver a great piece of dialogue and drop some acting chops. There are a couple of scenes that I think could have been done better which dropped the overall rating. If the actors had been given another chance to get it, it would have been tough to give it less than a nine. The fight scene is hilariously epic.\n\nWhile this does have some elements of the Kevin Smith view askew era humour this is not your standard Smith movie. An awesome left turn into new material that bodes well for the rest of the Canadian trifecta (Yoga Hosers and Moose-Jaws to come) and the future production of clerks iii."

Guy gives off a genuinely creepy vibe from start to finish. Kevin Smith I think knocked it out of the park with this one. More people should be talking about this!

        "review_detailed_main": "Kevin Smith is one of the most fascinating men working over multiple platforms today. Whether its movies, podcasts or television, Smith continues to bring his geeky playfulness to mainstream audiences that lap it up like Pavlovian experiments.\n\nIf you have every listened to any of Smith's SModcasts you will learn quickly that Smith is open to talking about anything from politics to masturbating into a beer can. Whatever comes to Smith's creative mind is fair game and his ingenious warped brain cells have pulled together to give us his latest theatrical event titled Tusk.\n\nTusk stars Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers) as podcaster Wallace Bryton who travels from Los Angeles to Manitoba, Canada in search of a story. When his original intentions are met with unexpected results, Wallace answers a barroom washroom ad and finds himself in the company of Howard Howe (Michael Parks) who might just be the 'most interesting man in the world'. A few war stories into their meeting over a cup of tea and Wallace can't hide his excitement of finding such a treasure trove of historical references as seen through the eyes of the elderly Howard.\n\nBut things then take a turn to the macabre. Wallace succumbs to the drugs hidden in his tea and when he awakes he is faced with the horror of being a medical experiment to which Howard wishes to transform the young podcaster into the likeness of a creature that provided him friendship and warmth after a shipwreck of his past.\n\nWhat happens next is a Jackson Pollock of WTF-ness that is weird, funny, repugnant, awkward and downright fascinating \u2013 sometimes all within the same scene.\n\nMichael Parks is perfectly cast as the sinister Howard Howe. His exact pronunciation gives the perfect delivery to Smith's script that gets as close to the edge as it can without losing his audience down the cliff. Justin Long is terminally committed to his role and his Wallace Bryton and subsequent transformation are likely to become part of cult culture lore.\n\nIn an effort to keep audiences engaged with a possible fairy-tale ending, Smith enlists the help of actors Haley Joel Osment (yes, of \"I see Walrus People\") and the drop dead gorgeous Genesis Rodriguez as two friends who engage the services of one Guy Lapointe (an over-the-top Johnny Depp) to assist in tracking down Wallace's whereabouts in Winnipeg. Say that last bit five times fast. We dare ya.\n\nTusk is more strange than good. But it's a good strange so that will just muddle things even further. As if Kevin Smith watched The Human Centipede and Boxing Helena in a double feature then dropped some mushrooms and started pounding out a script. If you take the film for what it is \u2013 it is great fun. Only Depp's overexposure as Lapointe takes any wind from the film's sails. If you are expecting a serious toned horror film, then you must look elsewhere. Do not forget that this is the same mind that didn't think twice of putting a naked dancer and a donkey together in his earlier works so there is no line in the sand that he's afraid of crossing.\n\nThe audience at our Toronto International Film Festival screening seemed almost confused as they left the theatre. A mark to which I am sure Smith would take great pride. But we had a ball. An unabashed rollicking time revelling in Smith's creative juices.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com"

He heads off to Canada to meet a kid who accidentally cut off his own leg in a YouTube video. While at a bar he reads a letter a man named Howard Howe (Parks) wrote and is intrigued. He drives out to see him and is engrossed in his life stories, but when Wallace wakes up his life is forever changed. I have to open by saying that I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and I love everything he does. Clerks is one of my favorite movies and I though Red State was outstanding. I also have to say that this is NOT a movie for everyone. I have never seen the Human Centipede but to me this is a toned down and lighter version of that movie. While the premise and many parts of the movie are pretty comical (Johnny Depp really breaks the tension), this movie is unbelievably disturbing and creepy. Smith walks the line between horror and comedy perfectly. This is a movie that is not supposed to be taken 100% serious but it's hard to shake off the feeling it leaves you with. I really enjoyed this and I recommend this but a movie about a man being turned into a walrus is not something everyone will be into. I thought Red State was better but I still liked this. Overall, fans of Smith or bizarre movies will really enjoy this. If you are more into mainstream fare then pass this up. Somethings can not be unseen. I give this a high B+."

The unexpected take on body horror by Smith was something I loved very much, as well as Johnny Depp's quirky character Guy Lapointe. However, in general the movie was a bit too much hit and miss, especially in dialogue. Definitely one of those films that will generate its own following (like with everything Smith directs) and be called \"underrated\" several times. Not by myself though. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to the next two episodes: Yoga Hosers and Moose Jaws."

        "review_detailed_main": "I followed Kevin Smith's work on Tusk very closely as I listen to his pod-cast. I love his stuff, sure the guy has bad movies but most directors that have been in the business as long as he has have made at least one less-than-stellar film. So naturally I was excited to see what Kevin Smith did with this material. When him and Scott came up with the concept, I remember thinking it had potential to be a great horror-comedy if handled right.\n\nUnfortunately, this film was not handled right. There were numerous times where the film could have used another pair of eyes. And good on Kev for making something really independent, but that turns out to be a really bad thing for this in that Kevin must have missed some of the more major flaws in the film.\n\nSome of the acting is unbearable. There's one scene when Guy LaPointe and Michael Parks character have an interchange in a flashback and it was one the most annoying things I've seen this year and it felt like it went on forever. It felt like another segment of Movie 43. Like it belonged in that movie. It took a great actor and a great performer and made them absolutely repugnant. I had to leave the theater halfway through the scene and return when I heard it was over. And I know you probably think that I'm just the one guy who didn't think it was funny, but we had more walk outs in that scene that anything else I sat through this year.\n\nThe pacing of the film was strange. It went from being incredibly interesting in the first 30 mins to a complete dead stop at Genesis Rodriguez's monologue. Good on the director for telling us what the back story is instead of showing us. The monologue goes on for a good 3-5 minutes and it's unbearably slow. She's a great actor, we get it. But we didn't need that long of a break from the main story.\n\nThis movie suffers from something that a lot of horror movies suffer from now and I don't think people realize it's happening. Justin Long's character was not a great guy. He was kind of a jerk. So when he inevitably gets put in a walrus suit, guess who cared... No one. We were all kinda like...well good.\n\nOn top of all that, the walrus suit is one of the most laughably bad designs I've seen in awhile. Props to Kevin for taking the practical route with it but it looked like a cheap Don Post Halloween mask only all over Justin Long's body. There's a moment near the end where Michael Parks hits Justin Longs walrus face and one of the tusks moves across his face as if it was attached to the suit and not his face. This was the only time I laughed in the film. Not to mention my laugh was the only laugh in the whole theater for the whole movie.\n\nI felt compelled to ask other audience members what they thought and as expected, there were tons of Kevin Smith fans in the audience. They all used the word disappointed. We were all sad. It's not just that the movie does things poorly intentionally but that it seems to not notice how horribly it was put together. It needed another edit, some shots needed re-shot, and it needed another draft badly. I'm very disappointed and I feel bad for hating this film. I wanted so bad to love it. I feel bad for Kevin. Good for him making the movie he wanted to make, but unfortunately that movie was a 3/10."

I found it obvious, so I'm a bit shocked with the reviews indicating this wasn't a comedy or horror flick, which is accurate and I don't understand the expectation that it was supposed to be. The movie depicts society well. His original trip to Canada was for a nod to people living on the internet and often laughing at other's misfortunes. Karma caught him and he's now the butt of the joke. Then you have the story tellers between Howe and the detective, which is what the lead was supposed to do, bring back the story after the trip. It's certainly not for everyone, but it's being painted in the wrong shade."

Characters had depth, characters had emotions.\n\nTusk didn't let us down with a few nutty characters but the premise was to stay focused on the plot and that he did.\n\nTusk is different and its a great film, if you go into it hoping for another Clerks, you are going to be extremely disappointed. Go in with an open mind and you will find yourself enthralled."

Zack and miri make a porno was excellent. Comedy is your forte. So wtf man? If the goal is to make a movie that no one cares to see twice, then you have succeeded on your last two outings. I wont even recommend this to other ks fans. And im not trying to be a dick but I feel like you were when you made this. Like your saying \"f u im kevin smith and can do whatever I want.\" I gave it 2 stars because of the acting. It was top notch for what garbage they had to work with. I was looking forward to seeing justin long in another smith movie(his character in z and m was one the funniest characters ever). The whole cast is actually a great ensemble(where has hjo been all this time). Michael parks is an amazing actor and you have just ruined him for people in your last 2 movies. At least for me(I now feel like he makes poor script choices and don't care to see his next movie).\n\nIf this is your new direction then im done giving a s$#t. I can come up with ridiculous ideas off the top off my head to but it doesn't mean they should be movies. You're insulting everyone with this and not in an ironic or funny way. Its just crap."

I have seen Dogma and Clerks a long time ago, and I can barely remember them so Tusk being made by the same director didn't really matter.\n\nOne thing you need to understand is that Tusk is NOT a horror movie. It borrows the setting of a horror thriller but it is at its core a comedy. Sometimes you want to mix genres, so you make a horror comedy in which you will import horror elements into the comedy genre (like Mel Brooks would do). Tusk is doing actual opposite of that, it's importing comedy elements like Justin Long and Johnny Depp's characters into a thriller/horror setting.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews comparing it to The Human Centipede. Tusk has NOTHING to do with that movie. Yes the premise of turning a man into an animal is similar, but Tusk is way more metaphorical. Also, it has real actors, delivering a very good performance overall.\n\nIf you wanted draw some kind of similarities with other movies, I would name Polanski's Dance of the Vampires or Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness.\n\nMost importantly, if you let yourself drawn into the movie without polluting your mind by trying to label Tusk, you will have a lot of fun."

Especially the scenes between Justin Long and Michael Parks. There were a few times when the tension was so thick I thought I was suffocating a little.\n\nIn all honesty, I'm very intrigued (and terrified) by the whole plot of this movie. Serial killer? Awesome. Survival of the fittest? Why not. Cool, although slightly lacking, back story? Can't hurt.\n\nThe whole premise of this film is very interesting and probably could have done better if it were in someone else's hands, but alas, that was not the case. I'm just glad a movie was made that wasn't your typical serial killer/kidnapped drama like I see in most movies and TV shows now a days.\n\nIf you think you'd be interested in this, I recommend watching it.

Typical Manitoba, amiright?\n\nIn terms of what it was aiming for, this movie is pretty pitch- perfect. It doesn't purport to be sympathetic, or realistic, or particularly horrifying, and it is none of those things. While there are certainly moments of legitimate disgust (I watched this movie having consumed nothing but coffee all day; needless to say it did not help my stomach settle all that much), the movie is primarily a totally surreal, intentionally schlocky romp into a quirky alternate reality, where Not-See Party (get it?) is a legitimate podcast name and Johnny Depp is a hammed-up (European) French person masquerading as a Quebecer with a few loose screws.\n\nThis movie is most certainly not for everybody. It borders on torture porn, and I think fairly compared to the Human Centipede in a number of respects. However, the trailer is a fair reflection of the movie's atmosphere and plot. I found nothing in the movie particularly surprising, and it goes about how you would expect. It really does not take itself that seriously, and while it is certainly not a laugh-out-loud, ha-ha kind of funny, it's funny in a disbelieving, \"did they really just go there?\" kind of way. That is, it doesn't tell jokes; it revels in gory absurdity.\n\nIf that is not your thing, then it's not your thing and you probably won't enjoy this movie. I personally found it highly entertaining, but would be wary of recommending it to anyone without a whole series of qualifying inquiries about their tastes in movies."

TUSK might just be his most divisive movie yet, it's seriously unlike anything I've seen from the creator of CLERKS and MALL RATS or any filmmaker out there and MAN, it's quite the disturb fest!\n\nWallace Bryton (JUSTIN LONG where have you been) is a pod caster, who, with his buddy Teddy (HALEY JOEL OSMENT), host a radio show called the Not-See Party. They look up videos on the internet of people humiliating themselves and laugh about it. Sounds like my kind of career. After watching a particular video featuring the Kill Bill Kid, Wallace decides to travel to Manitoba, Canada to meet this internet sensation. However, circumstances come up and Wallace is forced to find a new story to cover and finds it in a public bathroom post by a man named, Howard Howe. Mr. Howe writes that he has many grand stories to tell which is what our main protagonist is looking for, so Wallace finds this man in hopes of hearing a decent, replacement story for his show. Well Wallace goes missing shortly after meeting with Mr. Howe and it's up to \"best bro\" Teddy and Wallace's girlfriend (GENESIS RODRIGUEZ) to find him in the backwoods of Canada. That's the best I can do without spoiling anything!\n\nFor my full review of TUSK, head over to my InstaBio and click on the link my Tumblr.

That's not horror.......That's just gross.\n\nI liked this movie but I can certainly see why others may not. But I also am very into Psychology and what makes people tick and why people do what they do. It wasn't the best made movie nor did it have the finest actor's, but it did leave me thinking \"well, that was just messed up\" and searching my Anatomy and Physiology books.\n\nI gave it a 7 only because it peaked my curiosity and didn't leave me feeling like that was the longest hour and a half in my life....Much like the new Disney musical Into The Woods left me feeling and THAT move was obviously well funded and well acted but it was a musical and it felt very very long to me. I also tend to like weird little independent films so if you're looking for intense horror.....This is probably not it but if you like movies where you find yourself thinking \"what in the world is this guy up to?\" and/or \"How exactly is this guy going to......\" then you might want to give it a go."

Sure, there's some laughs, but they're mostly incredulous. Now, I'm a pretty big fan of Smith's and I used to listen to SModCast (but haven't heard the one this was based on) and I've seen all his films and stand-up DVDs. But even still, this has to be the worst thing he's done. I admire him for taking a risk and doing something unexpected, but 'Red State' was at least new, exciting and inventive. 'Tusk', not so much.\n\nBefore this turns into a total bagging, let me point out some of the pros - the score is great, the use of Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk' (\"don't say that you love me!\") is pretty great and fitting in its scene and some of the language and nuances that Parks uses are fantastic. Depp is also pretty funny as the unrecognisable (thanks to a fake nose and, I think, contacts) detective.\n\nBut it's just hard to ignore the total and complete nonsensicalness. Why is it set in Winnipeg, Canada, but filmed in North Carolina, USA? Why would Parks leave the phone lying around for Long to find? How is Parks supposed to be 90+ when he's only 74? Why do we need to see Joel Osment & Rodriguez pretty much talking to the camera when Long's not there, adding nothing to the story? Why does Parks do what he does? There's no real motivation there. Why does none of the plot make sense? Why do we need over half of the movie being exposition before anything happens? All I'll say is, see it if you're curious, but be prepared to be grossed out and simultaneously underwhelmed."

To be fair it's goal is to creepy and if it's funny to you that include as a bonus. What the movie does well in is making the audience feel like the main character Wallis. Scenes have a feeling of being bazaar, creepy, and out of place. Unlike most modern horror movies Tusk isn't an extremely gross movie which is a good thing. Also the movie doesn't move around much at all and adds more drama to the film. The movie is weird and the concept is very different and I recommend that you check it out for only those two reasons."

It's almost as if they intentioned it to be this way. Maybe some effort to become a classic B-cult movie down the road, who knows. It was a depressing downer. I didn't like the movie, the acting, the subject matter, the story line and would not recommend it to anyone, even the most devout trashy B-horror loving gross factor, blood and guts fan. Didn't like it. Wouldn't recommend it. Would just really like to get it out of my mind. I'm not sure that is possible.

        "review_detailed_main": "In Tusk, Justin Long and Haley Joel Osment play podcasters Wallace and Teddy. Wallace, (sounds like walrus) travels to Canada to interview an internet viral video star who slices his leg off with a samurai sword imitating the movie Kill Bill (2003). Upon arriving in Canada Wallace learns of the internet stars suicide given the online ridicule he received, partially to blame is Wallace and Teddy's podcast. Not wanting to make the trip a total loss Wallace tries to find another interview. He stumbles upon an ad in the men's room offering free lodging to anyone willing to come to the a mansion in the middle of nowhere and listen to an old man tell of his astonishing life story. Intrigued by the ad Wallace rushes out that night and meets Howard Howe (Michael Parks), a man with stories just as interesting as promised in the ad. Yet he has a dark ulterior motive to the rendezvous that ends up with Wallace a missing person. Once missing Teddy and Wallace's girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) venture up to Canada to find him. With the help of detective Guy Lapointe, played by an unbilled A list actor for your surprise enjoyment. Director Kevin Smith created this adventure during one of his own Podcasts. It was voted upon via social media to green light or not the project. It is actually set to be a trilogy of B movie horror flicks set in the great white north of Canada. Kevin Smith has always been a Fan's Director. His series of Evening with Kevin Smith films and Podcast give fans an all access backstage look at his productions. Letting Fan Boys fell like Hollywood insiders. I don't necessarily belong to this cult of followers, but I've been to a few of their church services. I know enough to make Tusk more enjoyable than it might be to a total Kevin Smith outsider. I was happy to see Kevin's daughter Harley Quinn Smith as a convenient store clerk in Tusk. A kind of homage to what made her father famous, Clerks (1994). I haven't always been on board for all of Kevin's creations, Red State (2011) and Jersey Girl (2002) I was less than a fan. Much like how Kevin Smith feels about George Lucas and Star Wars, I feel the original trilogy is the best; Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997). His first three embodied all that was wonderful about independent film in the early 90's. Like punk rock in its infancy. The audio commentaries on those three are just as enjoyable as the films. The next two films, Dogma (1999) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) felt like Cannon Ball Run films to me. Tusk and the promise of the next 2 Canada themed B horror movies have me excited. Tusk was just good campy fun, and in moments a little scary. The real treat in this film is the unbilled A list actor hidden in the middle. His costumed performance is reminiscent of the great Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther (1963). I will not spoil who the A list actor is, my surprise in figuring it out was half my enjoyment of this film. I think this film works well on a campy horror film level. If you were a fan of Cabin in the Woods (2012) or the Evil Dead Franchise you should like it. I loved Justin Long's character Brandon St. Randy in Zack and Miri Make a Porno(2010) so much I was excited to see him working with Kevin Smith again. If you haven't seen it, it's a very quotable raunchy comedy. Michael Park's is a standout role in this movie. I have been a fan of him since his brief role as the Texas Ranger in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He is a great character actor, and his performance in Tusk is unsettlingly haunting. As for the soundtrack, I couldn't help but hear Fleetwood Mac's song Tusk in my head when thinking about the title to the movie, there is a scene where my waiting paid off. Thank you. Tusk knows what it is, a cheesy horror film. It doesn't venture out of the dairy isle and try to be any more than that. Enjoy it for what it is, I did.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"

What was the point of this picture? When it will end, don't even start to think what you have just saw - it would be as pointless as the movie itself. Now i don't say that this flick is bad, but if you will skip it you won't lose anything.\n\nThe only interesting thing was to see Haley Joel Osment on screen probably the first time since \"Artificial Intelligence: AI\" back in 2001. Once considered one of the most talented young actors that ever walked the earth (and on my opinion he truly was), he quickly was forgotten probably after his voice broke. It was very cool to see him again, of course far from a movie or role he was famous for. Hope to see him more often in a future, and in far more better roles then this one."

What did you expect would happen?\n\nCome to think of it, what sick pleasure did Kevin Smith get out of making this piece of trash? Is this a prank? Like, do you hate every single person who listens to your podcast and was deluded enough to think this was a good idea? Did you get stoned out of your mind while watching The Human Centipede or Misery and think you could do it better?\n\nBecause, I hate to break it to you, but you couldn't. Seriously. I would rather watch all three Human Centipede films one right after another, because at least they succeed in what they want to do for the most part. What exactly did this film want to do?\n\nDid it want to scare me with its awful rubber suit or ridiculous villain? Cause it wasn't scary. Did you want to be funny, with your annoying protagonist and awkward conversation scenes that drag on forever? Cause it wasn't funny, either.\n\nDid you perhaps just want me to revel in your protagonist getting what he arguably deserved? Well maybe you achieved that a little bit, but did I enjoy it even slightly? God no.\n\nI wanted to stop and do absolutely anything else the entire time. That's what you achieved, Kevin. Your directing is terrible, you've got no imagination for interesting shots, your characters suck (yes I know they're intentionally terrible people, but that's all they are, and simply being terrible people is not enough to make them interesting), and your story is one that I couldn't wait to be over.\n\nAnd I'm not familiar with your other work, but at least when writing a feature film, you're not funny or scary in the least. I'm sorry, but sometimes it's just got to be said.\n\nYou've made a film that I legitimately wish had worse acting so that I could justify giving it a half star, so count yourself lucky that the people you hired for this are more talented than you.\n\nAnd you couldn't even get the rights for I Am The Walrus to play over the end credits.

Johnny Depp's character was hilarious, Justin long's performance was notable, and Michael Park was amazing. I literally believed the man was bat shi* crazy! There was some gore and bloodshed, but this isn't a horror movie, and I think a lot of people went into it thinking it was and that explains some of the bad reviews.\n\nFor a movie based on a totally absurd premise, Tusk was pretty good, unfortunately I don't see it having much re-watch value. I might watch it again just to laugh at some of the dialogue, but it certainly isn't Clerks or Chasing Amy. Tusk is basically The Human Centipede with some humor thrown in Kevin Smith style. I recommend a watch, but there will unfortunately never be a Tusk poster on my wall."

I can't say enough about how awful this film is, am angry that I wasted the 101 minutes it took to watch it, and why Kevin Smith continues to make films is beyond me; I know, at least, I won't be watching another one.

These scenes remained with me when I sat down to watch it.\n\nI decided to let the film germinate in my subconscious, so that I could be certain of my opinion after the fact. Did I enjoy it? Very much so. It's a strange blend of comedy and horror, which I know some people didn't like. The climactic scene was both horrifyingly disturbing and strangely funny. I'm actually on the verge of laughing just thinking about it. The performances stand out, especially Michael Parks and Johnny Depp. The scene in which both characters meet is hilarious and left me hungry for more.\n\nSome people didn't connect with the source material or the characters, which is understandable since it's such a strange movie. It's also worth noting that it performed poorly at the box office, for one reason or another. Still, I can't help but wonder if it'll simply fade away into obscurity or garner more attention over the years through VOD, blu ray and midnight screenings. After all, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is still one of the weirdest films ever made, flopped during release only to rise from the ashes as a cult mega hit. Watch this space, I don't think this is the end for 'Tusk'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kevin Smith's vanity film Tusk is sure to be polarizing: either you will love it or hate it, there won't be any gray area. Archon Cinema Reviews happen to love it's crazy ass.\n\nTusk is a half comedy and half horror film where podcaster Wallace Bryton goes missing while in Canada out looking for content for his radio show.\n\nWallace's cringe-humor podcast with his best friend Teddy revolves around Wallace going out interviewing zany people and then telling Teddy about it, the podcast is aptly called the Not-See Party. Wallace ventures out to the great white north of Canada to the boonies of Manitoba for an especially gnarly story. When it falls through, Wallace finds a plan-B and decides to interview this odd and mysterious seafarer Howard Howe. At this point Tusk turns from straight comedy to straight horror when Wallace goes MIA and his BFF and girlfriend Allison team up to look for him.\n\nIf you don't know the idea behind Tusk, Kevin Smith came up with it while talking on his own podcast with his own friend. Can the film be more of a vanity project under these circumstances? I don't think so! Smith makes the film he wants with complete disregard for appeasing the viewers \u2013 and it pays off big for his fans and others who are simply dark and twisty in their gooey center.\n\nTusk is neither comedic-horror or horrific-comedy and a clear and defined line can be drawn (or spliced) in the film where the two shant meet. The first thirty minutes contain joke after masterful joke playing into American stereotypes of Canadians and Canadia in general. The latter portion making up about an hour of the film is perverse horror. It is unnerving and unsettling with completely weird and off-kilter imagery.\n\nJustin Long, who plays Wallace, is the quintessential American who just can't keep his mouth shut and is marvelous. Michael Parks was made to play serial killer Howard Howe and both Long and Parks are perfect together. Relative newcomer to mainstream audiences Genesis Rodriguez is smart, beautiful and most importantly believably real as Allison, girlfriend to the consummate nerd that is Wallace. Even Haley Joel Osment is the perfect beta-geek as Wallace's bestie Teddy. There is an A-lister in Tusk that I think should remain a surprise cameo until you watch the film. With that said, Kevin Smith's Tusk definitely could have done without it and it was a massive distraction that cheapened the horror half of the film. If you heard about the cameo then you should know who I am talking about.\n\nKevin Smith's Tusk is a film for the oddball freaks, when it comes down to it, but nobody can say it's not original. A good litmus test as to whether Tusk will be your cup of tea, in our opinion: If you like the 1981 original The Evil Dead or From Dusk Till Dawn's overboard but fresh take on their associated genres (especially when they were initially released and before they garnered cult-like acclaim) then you probably won't dislike Tusk.\n\nCheck out our WEBSITE for all the 2014 horrors and recent releases reviews in FULL."

As disturbing as it may be and as darkly humorous as it is, it lacks substance. It's like a pile of crap that was called a film. The rating is at a 6???? It should be at most a 2. I give this movie two big thumbs down in a pile of crap!!! Kevin Smith please for the sake of the film community release something with substance. Bring Jason Lee back in on a project and use him well. Jason Lee I know him from Silverdale and he has far more talent than what he has been used for. Please do another cynical dark comedy but not one like this. Make Lee the main character for once. He deserves it not this stupid Mac Computer guy who plays the same role in every movie...\n\nSincerely, A Guy losing respect for your film making abilities BTW New Jersey sucks ;)"

Bad.\n\nThe only \"kudos\" I can relinquish to anyone for this debacle is to poor Michael Parks as his part was OBVIOUSLY written for Christopher Walken and he managed to impersonate a fairly decent deranged Christopher Walken throughout the movie. By the way, Michael Parks looks fantastic, considering I used to watch him in \"Then Came Bronson\" a million years ago.\n\nKevin Smith? How the heck did you go from the brilliance of \"Clerks\" to THIS???? Holy cow.\n\nDreadful. Just dreadful. And I sat through \"Jersey Girl.\" Sigh."

The film may have done poorly in the states, but I think it would have thrived here.\n\nOnto the point. This film is what it promises to be. One of the best produced B-grade horror movies I have ever seen. Although it doesn't ever really scare, it does get quite creepy, and on occasion it is pretty damn funny too.\n\nI don't know how you can give a bad review to this film. If you walk into the cinema understanding that the central premise of this film is about a man being hacked into a Walrus, you are either going to love it, or you were secretly hoping that it wasn't a film about a guy getting hacked into a Walrus.\n\nWhile this film may not have made its money in cinemas, it is going to be regarded as a cult classic if ever there was one. I mean, the climactic scene (the one in which the Fleetwood Mac song 'Tusk' plays) is nothing short of hilariously disturbing, over-the-top chaotic brilliance. I could watch it over and over."

I didnt particularly enjoy the film personally, but it does what it set out to do. Its deranged, its grotesque, its bizarre beyond belief. And I think that is why it probably didnt do as well in the box office....its gonna be one of those films that performed poorly in revenue but years later down the road it will become a cult classic. The ending, in my opinion, was very lack luster. That is probably because I expected the typical ending and that didnt happen."

Don't even waste your time watching this movie for free, its not worth loading. I rather watch my computer breakdown from a virus than stuck watching this junk again. Kevin Smith way to blow your career. Stay out of the movie scene and keep yourself in stand up comedy.

Depp shines as the bumbling French Canadian detective. Long is just right for the arrogant pod caster who gets what is coming to him. Several scenes-Howard and Wallace's first meeting, Guy and Howard being of note-are extremely pleasing. Sure some of this stuff, like the film itself, overstays its welcome. But Smith's dialog crackles as it always did and the characters are just so.\n\nBut on the whole the film is rather misjudged. The second half is disturbing and gore filled in a way that the first half just doesn't set up. Wallace's fate is utterly creepy and several of the torture scenes are far harsher, vivid than the lighter comedy that comes before them. Part of this film just makes me feel terrible for Justin Long. I hope he was paid well.\n\nThe film is striking and outside of Dogma it is Smith's most unique film. That aspect is a good thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "When ever I see directed by Kevin Smith, my excitement and predisposed disappointment set in. I'm always hoping the film will be great (Dogma, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back,Red State), but usually they turn out to be garbage (MallRats, Clerks 2, Cop Out, Tusk).\n\nKevin Smith's venture into the horror realm could have been so much more, but you can feel the punches being pulled in every scene. The disappointment I felt after watching Tusk was angering enough to lead me to write a review about it. Now, I know that the premise for the story was first introduced to Kevin Smith on his pod-cast when a caller called in with the idea for the movie. What I don't understand is, how did anyone think this was a plausible or original idea. Having also seen the Human Centipede, I can't help make the comparisons every step of the way, and the problem is that firstly, I'm making comparisons to a Tom Six film, and secondly (and I can't believe I'm saying this) the Tom Six film is much much better.\n\nSmith's film has all the hallmarks of a psychological thriller, but the huge let down is (and again, I can't believe I'm saying this) is Johnny Depps appalling attempt at a Quebec/French Canadian accent (Not to mention how camp the role was played). It detracts from the seriousness of the matter at hand and turns the whole film into a rather poor joke. What would have been more effective, would have been a less accentuated farce, and a more serious approach to the matter at hand. I felt myself cringing in embarrassment at every scene wishing it would end sooner rather than later.\n\nJustin Long and Michael Parks give stellar performances, as always, but are under-utilized in what should have been a bizarre psychological thriller.\n\nThe big let down is the special effects and conceptual makeup. Unbelievable and over the top which detracts from any hope of instilling any fear or remorse for any character.\n\nI feel that with whatever budget (let's face it, When he has less of a budget, he seems to be able to do more) was allocated to Tusk, could have been utilized so much better.\n\nHell, it would have been better to remake Clerks with Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Melody Depp. Or better yet, remake Human Centipede, no wait.....that's what Tusk is."

Howe is in love with his stories but after a while you begin to wonder if they are even real.\n\nParks shifts from funny to terrifying to just plain weird will stay with you long after the film ends. He also happens to be immensely quotable in this flick \"are you really mourning your humanity,I don't understand! Who in the hell would want to be human\" or \"We must discover if man is truly a walrus at heart\" stayed with me long after the credits rolled.\n\nLook I can't really review this movie without giving to much away, its a flick about a guy who turns the apple guy into a walrus. But that is why you have to see it. I too thought the concept was bizarre but the movie works and hats off to Kevin Smith for making one of my favorites of the year."

Neither felt complete. The Horror part is great, it could have been a good movie if they stuck to horror alone.\n\nBut then formatted it into a comedy movie and an embarringsly boring comedy, worst than Adam Sandler. A cock-eyed Johnny Depp as some kinda investigator similar to the Pink Panther. All jokes fall flat.\n\nNo, this movie failed because they didn't stick to the horror all the way.

Well if you've seen Human Centipede you kinda know where the plot is gonna go...\n\nIf you haven't perhaps it will shock you and you'll find it disturbing but in comparison with Human Centipede not so much, I guess the most disturbing part is that the viewer is supposed to laugh at Justin Long's character's undescribable pain\n\nYeah he's a moron for making a living of making fun of other peoples pain and misery but I don't know maybe I'm just too nice but I can't say that he \"got what he deserved\" cause frankly even tho the people he was making fun of in his Podcast went through crappy stuff, like with the Kill Bill Kid stuff that was at least his decision to swing that sword around and causing that accident\n\nIt has a couple moments, but not many... Johnny Depp plays his detective character like it belong in a goofball comedy like THE RATRACE or something, while Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodrigues plays there character more seriously... Uneven to say the least\n\nNot the worst movie of 2014... But it's in my bottom 10"

Although there is some good horror in here--the villain is one of the most demented ever. Although there's some good comedy in there--and it won't be unfamiliar to fans of Clerks and Smith's other work. It just never feels like a cohesive film. I'd go as far to say that Kevin Smith knows little about horror. A scary, horrifying film can be funny--but it ought to be funny in the right place at the right time. Why did no one look at this film and tell Kevin Smith, \"Look, pal, you've got some work to do\"? Although some elements work well independently, there's disharmony when they're combined. It's as though Tusk was directed by two directors with clashing styles. Extreme horror is and Kevin Smith self-aware comedy undermine each other, which left me with the feeling that I was a victim of the world's most malicious practical joke.\n\nAnd that's not even the worst part of Tusk.\n\nThere's a cameo from a well-known Hollywood start in the last quarter of the film, and I won't name him just in case you want to waste two hours of your life watching Tusk. Well, this well-known star contributes to completely ruining this film. The acting is so campy, so bad that I think Tor Johnson spun in his grave. But one has to put that on Kevin Smith as well. After all, a director's job is to DIRECT the actors, and I don't give care about the size of this particular actor's ego. Judging by this performance and his recent roles, he shouldn't have much of an ego left.\n\nSave your time. There's better stuff to watch."

It starts with minor yet annoying things such as Canadians saying \"eh\" and \"aboot\" and then devolves into a bad mishmash of Misery and the Human Centipede.\n\nThat would be enough in its own right but almost as if to prove the movie can be made worse, Johnny Depp's character emerges. A French- speaking, beret-wearing (did I mention inaccurate clich\u00e9s?) ex-cop whose presentation in the film just weakens this already limp excuse for a movie.\n\nWhat's sadder than losing over an hour and a half of your life watching this movie is knowing that somewhere, deep inside, Kevin Smith still must have talent yet can't seem to channel it to make any movie that means something anymore."

I have seen the everything from A Serbian Film to Martyrs to Human Centipede the awesome second one not the first but this movie stands shoulders above the rest which is strange to me being that it is a Justin Long/Kevin Smith vehicle which contains comedy.\n\nSee this film, it will haunt you and I truly believe you will never look at Justin Long the same way again.

They interview (mock, more like) weird people on their show. For their latest interview, Wallace goes to Canada, only to discover that the interviewee has died. Loathe to return to LA with nothing to show for his efforts, he sets out to find an interesting person or story. His search leads him to the middle of nowhere and Howard Howe (Michael Parks), who has a very keen interest in walruses...\n\nDirected by Kevin Smith, this is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. Kevin Smith made his name making stoner-slacker comedies in the 90s and 00s: Clerks (which is brilliant), Mallrats, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, to name but a few. In 2011 he made Red State, a drama that focused on religious cults and terrorism. While not brilliant, it was reasonably good and, moreover, was quite a radical and interesting departure for him. Surely this was the start of the new Kevin Smith, the one who makes biting, insightful dramas?\n\nSadly, it was a false dawn. Tusk is his first feature film since Red State and it is atrocious. Plot is very stupid, going out of its way to gross people out. It reminds me of Boxing Helena (1993), and that was pretty perverse, and dumb.\n\nThere are some lighter moments in the second half which help ease the pain of watching the movie, and it is those that prevent this from getting the lowest possible rating.\n\nThe fact that there are known actors in this makes it even more perplexing - who would want this on their CV? Justin Long tends to do B-grade movies, so not too much of a surprise there, I suppose. Haley Joel Osment's star has clearly waned significantly since the heights of The Sixth Sense. The biggest surprise is the appearance of Johnny Depp, in more ways than one. Don't know why he took the gig, and he is barely recognisable.\n\nFleetwood Mac / Lindsay Buckingham must be regretting allowing \"Tusk\" to be used in the soundtrack. This is not the sort of movie you want to be associated with."

That already means quite a lot, because many reviewers around here and members of this website's horror forum absolutely loathe \"Tusk\" with a passion. Personally I admire writer/director Kevin Smith for the variety and creativity that he inserted into his career since 2006 or so. I've always been a fan of his crude comedies (particularly \"Clerks\", \"Dogma\" and \"Mallrats\") but admittedly the formula and style became rather derivative after the Jay & Silent Bob movie and the redundant sequel to \"Clerks\". Apparently Smith realized this as well and thus brought more versatility in his repertoire, first with a different type of comedies (\"Zack and Miri make a Porno\" and \"Cop Out\") and now with horror/thriller/comedy hybrids. I liked the raw and gritty atmosphere of \"Red State\" and I definitely also appreciate the grotesque absurdity of \"Tusk\". The horror concept of turning human beings into animals \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 certainly isn't new. There are the legendary adaptations of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\", but also titles such as \"The Alligator People\" and more recently the infamous \"Human Centipede\" franchise. However, I don't think that anyone ever came up with the idea of a human walrus, and even though it doesn't immediately sounds realistic or petrifying, \"Tusk\" certainly does contain a couple of uncomfortable and shocking moments thanks to a handful of terrific dialogs and the fantastically menacing charisma of lead-actor Michael Parks. The legendary Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez regular stars as Howard Howe, an eccentric adventurer at rest living somewhere upstate in the backwoods of Manitoba, Canada. Howe captures the attention of Wallace Bryton, a popular Californian podcaster \u2013 with a ridiculous mustache \u2013 who's in the area and desperately needs a replacement interviewee because the one-legged kid he had an appointment with committed suicide. Wallace is a guest at Howe's mansion, but rapidly and physically experiences that he's a deranged psychopath who wants to bring Mr. Tusk back to life. And who's Mr. Tusk, you ask? Mr. Tusk is the walrus \u2013 either real or imaginary \u2013 that Howard Howe met and unfortunately had to kill during one of his arctic adventures. While Wallace surgically transforms in Mr. Tusk, his girlfriend Allie and fellow podcaster Teddy team up with the odd Canadian detective Guy Lapointe in order to trace his whereabouts. \"Tusk\" is mostly entertaining, but also far too talkative and full of flaws. It's kind of like a \"light\" version of the aforementioned \"The Human Centipede\", with a lot less sickness and gory make-up effects. I really liked the scenes with the crazed and mad-raving Michael Parks, but all the interactions between Wallace and his girlfriend (mainly through flashbacks) are boring and pointless. Oh, and that kid from \"The Sixth Sense\" got really ugly"

This is a weird, disturbing, and uneven horror/drama/comedy film filled with silly and dark humors with unique concept that may not appeal to everyone's taste. Though I must say the revealing of Justin Long as Walrus had me covering my mouth with quite a shock that had me cheerfully shouting Walrus YES! afterward. Really cool looking yet very creepy, SCARY, and gleefully disturbing at the same time. The film may not be that GORY but it's still gross and will likely satisfy horror fans with its Walrus transformation result. Overall, if you are looking for a weird horror film in the similar style as The Human Centipede with a touch of comedy then Kevin Smith's Tusk is probably the right film for you as it is a Walrus Yes! for me\n\n>>B<<"

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I have a lot of respect for Kevin Smith for not going the mainstream route and making movies for exorbitant amounts of money that he has little passion for. As an alternative, I think it is great that he can switch gears and take his film career in a different direction by making the films he wants to make, even though they are less accessible and/or marketable for a mainstream audience. Tusk, is definitely not meant to please the masses. I found it to be an enjoyable, macabre and unusual horror comedy. Tusk gets compared to The Human Centipede a lot, while both films are similar in many ways, Tusk is a different kind of animal.(no pun intended) The Human Centipede films are much more geared to pushing the envelope on the extreme end of horror and to make people sick. Tusk has very little gore and is driven by black comedy and dialogue. Michael Parks is brilliant as a highly educated psychopath with a severe fondness for the walrus. Justin Long is Wallace, a snarky douchebag that does not quite deserve what is coming to him. Wallace may be an unlikeable scumbag, but Smith does leave room for empathy for his character. For a budget just under 3 million, the film looks good. The score helps to create atmosphere to elevate the terror and help the audience feel uneasy. Tusk is much more cohesive than Smith's last movie Red State. If you want to see another Chasing Amy, this is not for you. However, if you want to see something unusual, creepy and have a twisted sense of humor, you may possibly enjoy this."

The look of the \"monster\" they created was amazing. I was shocked, like I just smoked a joint then I saw the Walrus shocked, Making it perfect Kevin Smith.\n\nAlways a good with the dialog, I felt that Smith is coming into Tarantino type status here with the look and feel of the movie.

Directed by Kevin Smith, Tusk marks his return to the horror realm since Red State. And as Red State proved (at least for me), Kevin Smith can't direct horror. Tusk is a film that is bogged down by bloated scenes of quirky dialog that couldn't be more unfitting for the tone. One minute Justin Long is delivering a typical crude Kevin Smith line and the next he is being tortured physically and emotionally, it is an absolute mess. Smith's urge to become the next great writer is so evident here that it comes off as more pretentious than anything else. The dialog is the biggest issue with this film. It is long scenes of spacey dialog that tries to be clever without ever really telling us why. Michael Parks is an amazing actor and honestly, he was as good as he was going to be here but his character was by far, the most annoying. Justin Long comes in as a close second, half the film he spends his time screaming and wallowing in pain without every uttering an intelligible word. Haley Joel Osment was, surprisingly, one of the better actors in this film as he plays Teddy, Wallace's co-host on the podcast. The real stand out here is Johnny Depp as Quebec detective Guy Lappointe, the opening scene for his character is extremely Tarantino-esque. Everything down the to dialog reeks of Tarantino inspiration for Smith, which isn't a bad thing because it actually was very good. The storyline with Wallace's girlfriend and Teddy trying to locate him is among the better portion of the film but it doesn't nearly last long enough to sustain anymore interest in anything outside of when the hell the movie ends. The bad part about it all is that the storyline and Depp's performance come in so late in the film, its hard to care about it. The screenplay is the downfall here, Smith spends too much time on the little picture instead of the big, worries about bloating a conversation instead of shrinking it. It isn't character development, it isn't even banter, its completely useless scenes surrounded by genius that is struggling to get out. Nothing is more sad than watch a great concept go to waste and that is exactly what Tusk is."

'Tusk' has been compared to 'The Human Centipede', but it more heavily resembles 'The Skin I Live In', and the less else said about the plot the better to avoid ruining a fresh experience. Whatever the case, the first half is compelling stuff. Justin Long plays such an arrogant jerk that one almost wonders if he deserves his fate, and yet Smith carves a sympathetic enough character that we feel for him during his strife. Michael Parks though is the actor who steals the show as the war veteran whose poetic eloquence and charisma (waxing poetic about the sea) makes him all the more chilling as he goes about discussing his surgical plans for Long with a straight face. Learning of his struggles, he is oddly sympathetic too. The second half of the film is not quite so strong though with lots of time spent away from Parks and Long as two friends investigate his disappearance and encounter an over-the-top caricature of a French detective, played by Johnny Depp. This in turn renders 'Tusk' more of a comedy than sad horror film, which doesn't quite seem like the right note to end on. Obviously, Smith is having a lot of fun with his material, but a less comedic approach to the tale may have well made it more haunting."

Examples of such are immediately evident in three scenes: Wallace (Justin Long) in the Canadian convenience store, Howard Howe's (Michael Parks) introduction, and Guy Lapoint's flashback tale. The story itself is both comical and disturbing in a self-deprecating way, but a messy third act is ambiguous in deciding which swim lane to take \u2013 deadpan horrific or goofy schlock. The straddle ultimately presented leaves the film unfulfilled.\n\nSmith being Smith, is an equally-opportunity offender making fun of Canadians, podcasters, mustaches, and Latino accents. Regrettably, a majority of the film's blatant third-act humor comes as the result of the ridiculousness of the \"guest-star,\" setting the final focus of the film as murky as aquarium pool water drastically deviating away from any self-righteous statements on horror-torture films but also of any clever wittiness."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I went into the movie totally open to the idea of someone being kidnapped and turned into a walrus(horror is by far my favorite genre), the execution was thoroughly lacking. The biggest issue being its pacing, some very long and monotonous scenes of dialogue that kill the pace. On the other hand, the movie is effectively silly and ludicrous in the best possible way.....if you are able to buy into it. But it is hard to look past how much time 'Tusk' spends on outside characters searching for the 'hero' and not enough time inside the mad house where all the excitement lays. The movie is surprisingly far less gory than I expected it to be, so you if are worried about that, don't be; and if you are looking for a more, less intense horror movie(as in silly or comedic tones), this is sure to please you. In the end I wanted to like this more than I actually did, too many slow moving scenes compared to true mayhem the story deserved. Perhaps the New York Post said it best - \"There's a fine horror film inside Tusk, but it's only 20 minutes long. The rest is just blubber'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having watched the trailer, and hearing some good early reviews I thought I would finally check out Kevin Smith's new movie. First off I want to say I'm normally not a big Kevin Smith fan outside of a couple comedies he worked on. This film however is surprisingly on the edge of being great. With Tusk you are asking yourself what is going on early in the film, and it only gets stranger from there. The following is my review of Tusk.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Kevin Smith. Smith is widely known for his popular films such as The Clerks, Mallrats, and Dogma. The Clerks and Mallrats are really my only favorites from Smith. Which is why I was worried about going into this film. Smith recently did another original film called Red State. I found that film to be awful, and going into this film I was worried this film would suffer the same fate. Thankfully it did not. The story is fairly strange once you dig deeper into it. However, I not be spoiling the movie in this review. The film follows podcaster Wallace Bryton(played by Justin Long) who heads up north to Canada so he can interview someone. Bryton is basically an internet shock jock host and he wants to interview people with some wild stories. As the story continues he finds a posting from a crippled man, Howard Howe(played by Michael Parks), who is interested in someone helping him out around the house in return will tell them interesting stories and give them a place to sleep free of charge. Things go south very quickly and things take a very strange turn from there. Just when you think this film is very strange, it gets even more stranger. For most of this movie it contains character buildup or development from the characters just sitting around talking to each other. This works the best in two instances. One where Bryton and Howe are talking for a good bit about some interesting stories Howe had about his past, and the other with Teddy Craft(Haley Joel Osment), Ally Leon(Genesis Rodriguez), and Guy Lapointe(Guy Lapointe, wink wink). These two scenes where there is a good bit of dialogue are actually very fun to sit back and watch. Some could easily find these scenes boring but, if you love some good acting, these scenes are for you. Overall, Smith delivers some fresh yet very strange storytelling here. He gets a big thumbs up from me.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Kevin Smith also directed this film. The film plays out like a good slow paced horror film without any major action scenes. There are some disturbing scenes in this film but, that is about it. The film is shot amazingly and the attention to detail is very nice. As I mention above, there is a good bit of character driven scenes with a great deal of talking. Most of these scenes play out well as I talked about, however the scenes with Ally and Bryton are very boring in my opinion. Genesis Rodriguez delivers a very wooden performance is this film, while every other actor is fabulous. The actor who steal the show for me is Michael Parks. His banter back and forth with Justin Long is excellent and really a joy to watch, even if it does carry on for a good while. Guy Lapointe is also an interesting character, and when you see the movie you will see why. The actor playing him comes as a shock as you can't really tell who it is right away. Overall, Smith does a mostly good job handling the directing and the actors in this film.\n\nChristopher Drake is the composer of this film, and is one of my favorite composers as he does most of his work in the animated comic book movie genre. His works in Batman: Under the Red Hood and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns(Parts 1 & 2) are amazing work. This genre of film is different from his usual work, with this being a horror film. He really adapts well I must admit. The score can't be described as groundbreaking or one of my favorite but, he brings a nice chilling aspect to the film. Drake overall gives a great performance for this film as the composer.\n\nIn closing, fans of Kevin Smith and those who aren't should enjoy this film. This is a horror film for the most part, so remember that. If you aren't a horror movie fan, then watching this film would likely only make you upset. Those of us who love horror films will find this original and very strange. That is missing lately in this genre. So give this a watch sometime soon if you can catch it in it's current limited run in theaters.\n\n7.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello. I have never posted a review before, but I thought \"Tusk\" was worth it because of all the reviews I've seen that I think are way too harsh and negative. I'll be fair, I don't consider Kevin Smith is a genius and I don't think this movie is even close from a masterpiece but frankly I don't understand some comments on the film that seem so full of unreasonable despise. I can understand how some people might have been disappointed when they entered the movie hoping for an actual comedy, but if you can get past the fact that this film is not really a comedy I think some will find this is a really great horror movie. Overall, the acting is not amazing (except for the creepy Michael Parks and a sometimes disturbing Justin Long)but it does the trick and it's more than enough to give you the shivers sometimes. The writing is also pretty clumsy but that's OK because it's also enough to tell you what you need to know to enjoy the ride that is a disgusting, enervating and disturbing one, but also really funny. I won't talk about the story because the less you know the better. All I can say is that I really believe that at least anyone who likes horror movies (from the classics \"The Last House On The Left\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\", to the more contemporary \"Saw\" or even \"A Serbian Film\") will have to love this film for all it's gory moments, crazy storyline, disgusting makeups and all the things that make so many people love a cult horror movie. I'm pretty sure that in twenty years this film will be praised as a cult movie by an huge amount of fans. Watch it if you like gory, wacky horror. You'll have a great time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some podcaster named Wallace decides to interview some Canadian kid who gained notoriety online by accidentally slicing his leg off. His girlfriend doesn't want him to go because she thinks that sort of story is beneath him.\n\nHe goes anyway, has a ridiculous run in with Canadian passport control, drives to the kid's house and finds that the kid has killed himself. In a bar restroom he finds a bulletin board with a long letter by some guy who promises to tell some amazing stories. Wallace, desperate to get something out of the trip, calls the guy and visits him in his mansion somewhere remote in the middle of the night.\n\nThe guy named Howe is wheelchair-bound, offers tea and starts telling stories how he met Hemingway, how he was hunting the great white shark in Siberia when the boat hit an iceberg and as the only survivor he found refuge on a rock in the company of a walrus.\n\nWallace starts getting dizzy and faints, there was something in the tea. Next day he wakes up on a wheelchair, with his leg cut off and Howe completely off the deep end telling him about his love for the walrus that saved his life. That story has a poignant ending.\n\nMeanwhile Wallace's girlfriend and podcast partner travel to Canada to look for him and hire some former cop to help in the search. They eventually find him and what they see is not exactly what they or anyone would expect.\n\nTusk is a very uneven movie, part dumb comedy, part serious thriller, part horror, part monster movie. The Wallace character is annoying, full of himself, I guess based on the director himself. Clearly this movie starts with a really bad idea, based on a real life...podcast. I guess that's what happens when someone actually has the money to realize any dumb stuff he ends up talking about with his friends. However, many movies start with a bad idea and make something of that idea. Here too after having to endure the Wallace character for too long, we are finally introduced to the brilliant Howe character who's a literatus, adventurer, collector of weird things. Things start getting tense but then devolve into weirdness to end in some uncomfortable emotion.\n\nIn a way you want to like this movie for its audacity, but it's the director who gets in the way of himself. Apparently nearly everything in this movie is based on something relating to his life. Worst of all, he doesn't know when enough is enough. Yes, there is too much of a good thing. The passport control scene and Canada/America jokes go on way after you've had enough. \"Guy Lapointe\" gives a wild performance and Parks, too, does a good job, but these just drag on, and on, and on to the point of annoyance. A lesson all these alleged movie aficionados-turned directors haven't learned from movie history is that often less is more. The drive for explicitness in movies has often had the opposite effect intended. In monster movies rarely does it help to show the monster for too long and from every angle conceivable.\n\nWe are told that this is the first of the director's Canada trilogy. Canada trilogy? Where has this guy been the last 25 years of globalization? I'm quite torn about this movie. A lot is brilliant and a lot is retarded, as the kids would say. I'm afraid the director thrives on the latter as evidenced by the original and moronic walrus podcast during credits."

I'm really torn on this one but, ultimately, can't really recommend it.\n\nI applaud the ambition and general don't-give-a-F--- attitude that went into this movie and, at the beginning, I was really routing for it to emerge as a weird cult classic. Unfortunately, as the movie unfolded, I found that I wasn't really emotionally connected or hooked into any of the characters on screen and lost interest by the end.\n\nI love what are often considered \"weird\" movies (David Lynch and early David Cronenberg spring to mind), but they only really work for me when all the bizarre WTF-edness is rooted in something that is human and relatable and \"Tusk\" never made that connection with me or really made me FEEL anything on a deeper emotional or psychological level.\n\nIt seemed to have something to say about modern media in the internet age, but that felt pretty superficial and totally on-the-nose. You can feel that weird and surreal movies \"Eraserhead\" or \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, And Her Lover\" have something genuine and profoundly human that they are trying to express, even when you can't quite decipher exactly what the f--- it is. At the end of the day, I never felt like \"Tusk\" had something to say or a point that made all the weirdness work and come together in a way that somehow felt right.\n\nI appreciate how the movie tries to buck expectations and conventions, but unfortunately, this also really ends up working against it. The movie isn't funny enough to work as a comedy, it's not scary or suspenseful enough to work as a horror/thriller, and, like I said above, it lacks the emotional or psychological depth to stand out as a weird but brilliant cult classic. It really would have been amazing if the movie had managed to hit each and every one of those targets (and I give it credit for even trying), but it kind of ends up missing all of them instead.\n\nStill, I appreciate the effort and would rather watch an interesting and ambitious failure like this than a lot of the tepid and familiar mainstream movies that are out there these days."

Justin Long does this EXTREMELY FUNNY Cry and he does it only 2 times and the movie and I honestly cant get it out of my head and I laugh when I think about it. Hence I watch it a few times to laugh. Yes Depp sorta messed the movie up. If you can get over that you may really laugh your butt off. I have a pretty good feeling that a lot of the movie may have been improve and some of it appears to be usually kept footage that would normally make it on a bloopers take. In fact I am watching it again just because i want to laugh. I think maybe people are trying to think it is a Horror comedy but it came out as really just an unusual Comedy. So I guess its not getting all the people watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wallace Bryton: \"I don't wanna die in Canada!\".\n\nThe story to Tusk is about a young man goes searching for his best friend, and pod-cast co-host, after he goes missing in the backwoods of Canada, along with his friend's girlfriend.\n\nTusk was a movie that I never heard of until last week when I got a chance to watch it. But before seeing it I heard a lot of mix reviews for this movie, some people say it's like a guilty pleasure to them and they had a good time with the film, but with other people who said the movie is laughably bad and nothing to it.\n\nIn my opinion Tusk is a okay movie and I was actually surprised that I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would, but there are some scenes that made me laugh a little bit like Justin Long character (Wallace) start's to scream for help and the mad man who's turning Wallace into a Walrus played by Michael Parks, he start's to make a weird but funny scream while pulling a mad face, that scene was pretty funny.\n\nKevin Smith as a film director can make good, okay and really bad movies during his career. Dogma was brilliant, Zack and Miri Make a Porno was descent flick and Tusk falls into the okay pile.\n\nJustin Long's did a good job in this movie, not fantastic, just good. His character is supposed to be a big douche bag, but even a douche bag in real life wouldn't be like this guy, because Justin Long made his character so unlikable and so stuck up at the beginning that I truly didn't care for him, until the end where I didn't hate him as much and I think that's what the movie was going for.\n\nMichael Parks did great in this film playing the insane person who's obsessed with walrus, and he got all the craziness and the comfortableness in just one character. Haley Joel Osment also was good in the movie, just like Justin not great just good.\n\nThe movie itself and I'm not joking around here but it's actually pretty enjoyable, you don't see much of the gore just the after math, like one of his body part will have been removed and judging by the way it's been cut off or removed it looks extremely painfully and a lot of hard work.\n\nThe movie has a lot of problems like the film is trying to be it's so bad that it's funny but it really didn't work for me, because the writing is amazingly mix for me and it's very usual for me to say that. The comedy wasn't funny at all and it just left me into silence, until that weird but funny scream while pulling a mad face scene was pretty funny. The all movie should have been a shock fest kind of film and I normally don't request a horror movie to do that, but a story like this is like a shock fest film that never got the big picture.\n\nJohnny Depp french accident in this movie was just god awful and to be honest he should have been cut out of the film. I like Johnny Depp as a person and as a actor but this wasn't his movie to shine in.\n\nOverall Tusk is okay film, but I wouldn't really recommend it but if you're the kind of person who likes to watch stupid horror flicks like this then go ahead."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it is difficult to put in to words what effect this film has had on me. It is certainly not your average film; in fact, I have watched many movies in my time but never have I watched anything like 'Tusk'.\n\nThe film follows Wallace Bryton played by Justin Long who is a pod-caster seeking a story for his online show. The synopsis on IMDb provides all the information required to provide an outline of the plot so no need to go in to any more detail other than to say it is literally based on a man who is turned in to a walrus. It sounds weird and it is. By far the strangest film I have ever seen and the most original which is what warrants my 6 rating.\n\nIn my opinion, the acting is in the main very good and all actors fit well in their roles. Justin Long is particularly good. The remaining actors, Johnny Depp included, maintain the quirkiness of the movie. That said, some may see the acting as poor. However, in my opinion that is intentional to contribute towards the originality of the movie. That may sound strange but hopefully you will see where I'm coming from when you watch it.\n\nI have thought long and hard about whether there is any film to compare it to and really there isn't. I watched it a few months ago and some scenes still haunt me, not that they are terrifying, but they initiate thoughts that I'm sure any person would not contemplate which is an achievement in itself.\n\nA friend asked me whether it is worth watching and I couldn't decide whether to answer yes or no. Why? Well, there are lots of things to dislike in this film; the plot is strange; it is completely unfathomable and I can't say I particularly enjoyed watching it. Nonetheless, it is a film that will linger in my mind for years to come and for that reason it has to be seen.\n\nGenre: Weird horror. Not scary but sort of a delayed shock effect. Comedy is not laugh out loud but the humour is within the characters if that makes sense. I wouldn't call it a drama. Acting: Intentionally quirky but effective. Script: Weird. Enough said."

The thought of some thing taking over your body or something happening to your body and the only way to stop it is to kill yourself is terrifying to me. And if you inject some morbid humor into it that makes it better. Like the film CLOWN; that's an effective and satisfying body horror film with an equally effective morbid sense of humor. But instead we got all of this:\n\nA fake-looking Walrus suit. A poorly-written main character. I get he's supposed to be arrogant and narcissistic, but he's so over-the-top. And Justin Long doesn't help it because he's not the best actor!\n\nMichael Parks is fine, I guess.\n\nThe actress who played the girlfriend is fine.\n\nJohnny Depp's character was irritating.\n\nA terrible sense of pacing.\n\nUnfunny humor.\n\nGod-awful CGI. I mean, are you kidding me with that leg severing scene?\n\nWhy would Wallace call his friends instead of the cops? Are you kidding me with that?!\n\nI liked this movie when I was younger. Looking back on it I find myself asking, \"What was wrong with me?\"\n\nSorry, Mr. Smith. You seem like a nice guy and a cool guy and I'd like to hang out with you and I appreciate the fact you wanted to do something different but you really missed the mark with this one. Clerks was good, though!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Without giving too much away (in fact I shall try to be as vague as possible) I enjoyed enjoyed this movie. However not all things seen are meant to be enjoyed, merely taken in as a new experience.\n\nThis latest Kevin Smith film is sooo far removed from what he has done in the past as actor, writer or directer that is almost creates its own genre. A genre not unheard of in some circles, twisting the imagination toward such dire straits that the film almost mocks the premise it tries to present. YES...it is a contradiction: a somewhat dark comedy that is horrifying and disgusting to most people and funny only to those that have seen more than most people ever have...or will. One must almost certainly be jaded to a point in order to laugh or chortle under ones breath or smile even the slightest at the scenes of dark hilarity that make themselves so easily identifiable. Like watching someone trip and fall and go \"OW!\", sometimes we cant help but le hah hahahahaaa.\n\nThe cruelty of both men AND women often afford us no safety from how we truly feel or what we say and too late cannot take back. Yet it works. Yet it works to offer one of the few plot devices within this film to envelop us into its web, its woven yarn or ichor and filth. Cruelty.\n\nCall me jaded, but I say I have seen much, call me callous, I say I have a tougher , more open minded imagination than others; not libertine in my acceptance of the grotesque and mad, but merely ready to accept my choice of viewing the gift of a film created with time and effort by noted film shapers...film...Smiths..( =p) for truly Kevin Smith holds true to his familial name. He is embarking upon new territory for himself, forging ahead of many other cowardly 'artists' in this growingly unbold world and its growingly unbold medium.\n\nP.ost S.cript\n\nMost likely I would have given this an 8/10 if it had more realistic looking gore, flesh etc, didn't have J Depp in the film, and one or two other things. Still a 7 (6.9/10) is not bad. CIAO enlightened viewers!"

When the interview is cancelled he chances upon an Ad about an old man with great stories, not wanting to go back empty handed, Wallace takes a chance and goes to his house.\n\nThen it goes off the rails, the old man seems intelligent and friendly at first, and then takes a sharp turn into a deranged madman. The movie then splits into the perspective of Wallaces' girlfriend looking for him.\n\nThe problem with Tusk for me, is that its so tonally inconsistent that it almost's forgets the atmosphere it builds in the first half. The first half was funny, and intriguing as you wonder how in the world is he going to get transformed into a Walrus. After you see it tho, and it is horrific, the movie drags on its second half, barely surviving on steam as it becomes a comedy about a silly detective trying to find the killer.\n\nI will admit, i enjoyed the first half, Kevin Smith mixes horror and comedy quite well, and the performances, all around are Great! The ending tho is absurd and seems to be weird for the sake of being weird. Unlike something like Fargo, where the eccentricities give the movie charm, here it just derails the movie bit by bit.\n\nIts hard to recommend unless you want something really different that doesn't have a nice payoff."

I thought Depp played his role well, although a little annoying with the nuances of the character, and what I never clearly understood was if there was a serial killer in Canada, with the details Depp went on with, then why didn't the Manitoba Police know about these previous cases, or take the situation more seriously, with the recent coincidence of the call from Depp seriously?

Unfortunately, the star committed suicide - leaving Wallace without a story. Desperate, he answers a cryptic ad for a roommate. Arriving at the remote mansion, Wallace is drugged and encased in a walrus suit constructed by his psychotic host (Michael Parks). Based on his own podcast, writer/director Kevin Smith masterfully brings this aquatic nightmare to life in the film's first half. However, that fear fades in the ladder half when a badly disguised Johnny Depp masterfully fails as a French-Canadian detective.

If the intention was to play the first half of the movie straight and the second half ludicrous then it succeeded.

        "review_detailed_main": "Recently, I watched the movie \"Se7en\" for the first time; then, about eighteen hours later, I watched the movie \"Tusk.\" \"Se7en\" is much bloodier and more violent, with a wider variety of gruesome images; yet I honestly thought \"Tusk\" was more disgusting somehow. So, if \"Se7en\" was too much for you, I'd like to warn you that \"Tusk\" won't go down any easier.\n\nThe movie is about a guy named Wallace, who has his own radio show and takes a trip to Canada to interview someone for the show. The interview does not work out, and so Wallace decides to take a risk and seek out a recluse who claims to have had great sea adventures. The recluse, Howard Howe, drugs Wallace and ties him to a chair.\n\nI won't give away what follows, but I will tell you that this movie goes fully, completely over the top. It is about one human being's search for contrition, his belief that his very species is a terrible abomination; and that we must seek, not to transcend our condition, but to relinquish it and reduce ourselves to the level of animals. This is the philosophy of Howard Howe, and it is the only fully-expressed set of thoughts that make their way on screen. He is not particularly intelligent, but he has conviction. He is a mad creationist, a cross between Victor Frankenstein and Captain Ahab.\n\nI guess what really turned me off from this movie was that, in spite of how wacky it was, it just wasn't that funny. It starts with a Youtube video of a kid playing with a samurai sword and accidentally hacking his own leg off (seriously, how is that funny?). The radio show is called the \"Not-See Party,\" and Wallace somehow does not think this title will horrify people. It seemed almost as if Smith imagined that if something is offensive enough, it will automatically be funny. Maybe it was, to the targeted audience. But I think that horror should serve a purpose, to show an audience the torment of the inner soul in an apathetic world (or something like that). One of my favorite movies is \"Beetlejuice,\" which is effectively funny because the characters are self-aware enough to notice how absurd and ridiculous the story is, yet they must work within the rules of this alternate world in order to seek what they desire. In \"Tusk,\" the horror existed for its own sake, and I got the feeling that I was just supposed to laugh at the expense of the hapless victims.\n\nIn spite of how over-the-top it was, the movie was underwhelming. It was crude, half-baked, linear, and used an overly conventional approach to a thoroughly unconventional idea. There was no climax, no point where the characters appeared to learn anything. There is a theme in the movie of animals being morally superior to human beings, but that theme was underdeveloped. If there had been more animals throughout the film, more interaction between man and the wild, this theme might have shone through more effectively. The script needed a few rewrites. I felt like Smith was kind of exploring the idea, without realizing it.\n\nI will admit that the acting was good. Michael Parks is terrifying as Howe. Justin Long is convincing as Wallace, though his character was bigoted, unlikeable, and without any redeeming values (I don't know if this was Smith's intention). Depp was at least amusing as the bumbling Detective Lapointe, a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Kid Shelleen, though at times he went on for too long with too little to say. I thought Lapointe had the potential to be intelligent, a benign force to counteract the insanity of Howe; however, it did not play out this way, and Smith missed an opportunity.\n\nI give this movie four stars out of ten, because at least it had the courage to go where no other movie has gone before. It was frank about its disturbed nature. But I felt no connection to any of the characters, except perhaps Howard Howe. Like Macbeth, Howe is imaginative without the release of being creative, and by the end of the movie I was too horrified by his actions to feel any sympathy for his intentions. I felt as if Smith made this movie just to see if he could pull it off. I guess that just doesn't seem like a good enough reason to make a movie."

Sure, it's not for everyone, but sometimes I just want to switched off and be entertained, this movie does that and then some. Michael Parks is just fabulous and Justin Long (who I have a huge crush on) is also excellent. However, Mr.Depp's cameo is solid gold it adds so much to the film that it just needed. This film isn't really trying to scare you, but it creates a good sense of dread and helplessness that horror films so desperately need. Not a great film but a gem nonetheless, people meed to just look at it for what it is, a fun little movie designed for pure entertainment."

The acting is also top-notch, with standout performances from Michael Parks and Justin Long, who bring their characters to life with nuance and intensity.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Tusk is not for everyone. The film contains graphic violence and disturbing images that are sure to shock and unsettle the viewer. If you're looking for a lighthearted horror movie, this is not the film for you. But for those who appreciate the darker side of cinema and are looking for a truly unique and thought-provoking experience, Tusk is a must-see.\n\nOverall, Tusk is a haunting and memorable film that will leave a lasting impression on those who dare to watch it. Whether you love it or hate it, it's sure to generate strong reactions and debates, making it a must-see for fans of independent and horror cinema."

It starts running off the rails when Michael Parks is doing his own VO narration during one of his operations. In a way, this might encapsulate one of the errors: Instead of opting for the terror of The Unknown, Smith resorts to a cheap VO narration gimmick to spoon-feed us way, way too much cluttered backstory. And there's much clutter to come.\n\nAlso, tone becomes bizarrely mismanaged. While Smith had not-ineffectually blended in a modulated bit of Canadian stereotyping, his detective Lapointe (Depp) is absurd, stupid, and way, way beside-the-point. This, and so many other directoral false notes utterly savage the very real tension Smith had built, up to that point.\n\nIt's a drag. I'd heard the premise of this flick, and looked forward to seeing a smart, horrific, fun product brought successfully to the screen. I'm one of those folks who very sincerely wants to see Smith succeed and prosper (and I rejoice when he does), and Tusk really let me down.\n\nDon't bother watching it."

I'll admit I laughed out loud on several occasions at this horror/comedy grind-fest, but I must admit,with my pot smoking days are behind me, I couldn't help but to imagine Smith and friends high as s--t as he conceptualized and wrote this one. In fact, it nearly made me return to the bong just to watch it again and see if it would get even funnier. As in Evil Dead 2 funnier. But alas, I knew that it wouldn't. Not even Johnny Depp could save this Human Centipede Want To Be.\n\nADDENDUM: In the 3 or 4 days after watching this film, I could not help but to notice that the pathetic mewling and howling agony of of the Human Walrus intruding upon my mental continuum, and I could not help but to laugh out loud as during these intrusions. If you think about it, is that not a sign of a totally unique film. Not necessary a good film, but a unique one, one that leaves us thinking and questioning and wondering about the kind of mind that conceived of it. Because of this, I've upgraded it to 6 out of 10, for the ingenuity and innovation aloe, and I hope there is a TUSK 2 coming soon (: Thanks Kevin."

With Tusk, the horror feels cheap and silly, and the comedy feels forced and annoying, not funny. The ending wasn't what I was expecting, but again it's just more low-brow shock value, and in the golden age of indie films getting their time in the spotlight more often than ever, it's honestly not all that unique of a plot device. I could see this one appealing to twelve-year-olds who still find dick jokes funny maybe, or people who want to creep out their friends at a party, but I just didn't see what all the hype was about. Johnny Depp was especially obnoxious and annoying in this one; was the point of it supposed to make viewers want to punch every character in the face?"

Unless you're a huge Kevin Smith fan and absolutely must see everything he writes, stay away from Tusk. It isn't funny.\n\nI really got tired of Canadian stereotypes a long time ago. Canadians aren't porn star-mustache wearing, backwoods hillbillies. We don't say \"eh\" or \"aboot\" any more than all Americans say \"ya'll, or its plural \"all y'all\".\n\nIf you don't know anything about Canada, don't write about it. And don't film a movie that supposedly takes place in Manitoba, in North Carolina. That's like filming a movie that takes place in Iowa, in California, with palm trees in the background. Iowa, by the way, is only an 8 hour drive from Winnipeg, and would have made a better backdrop.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, the premise is ridiculous. Human Centipede wasn't as bad as this. At least the centipede is not impossible. A walrus. Really? I wasn't sure if this were supposed to be funny, or some kind of \"horror\" film...because it is neither."

        "review_detailed_main": "If this had been made by a new upcoming filmmaker as their first feature Tusk would probably be hailed as a surreal and stunning debut from a talented new director but it was made by Kevin Smith who we all know and love for Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and the Jay & Silent Bob movies. He has a loyal fan base and is known for producing witty and observational comedy with loads of dialogue where his characters pontificate on life, sex, relationships, religion, science fiction and much more. Tusk comes as a bit of a shock to the system and a jarring experience from someone we thought we knew.\n\nIt lulls you into a false sense of security as we meet Justin Long's character Wallace making podcasts with his friend Teddy, played by Haley Joel Osment. The two goof around and go in search of interviewing eccentric people for their popular Not-See Party podcast. Intrigued by a viral video they watch on the internet Wallace goes in search of the person who made it but when he arrives in Canada in search of him he is found dead. Determined for the trip not to be wasted Wallace spots a flyer offering free bed and board and the promise of interesting stories. When he arrives at a mysterious mansion in the middle of nowhere he meets Howard, a retired seamen, excellently played to sinister effect by Michael Parks, who tells him about a walrus that saved his life. Things soon take a nasty turn as he entraps Wallace and begins to torture him signalling a significant shift in tone to the movie.\n\nKevin Smith should be applauded for trying something different and for taking a risk with his excursion into horror however the idea is so disturbing, grotesque, intriguing, silly and bizarre it caught fans off guard and left many feeling bemused and unsettled at best. Smith had told the story on his Smodcast with long time collaborator Scott Mosier called the Walrus and the Carpenter, a title derived from a Lewis Carroll poem, based on a prank post that was put up on Gumtree. Smith then democratically asked listeners to vote on Twitter whether they would like to see the story turned into a movie. The answer was an emphatic yes so Smith went to work on making it happen.\n\nYou think Tusk is going to be a dark comedy but then you realise half way through that Smith is actually being serious in taking us on a bizarre and twisted journey. This film will challenge the viewer and may force you to re-evaluate your opinion of Kevin Smith as a filmmaker as he exposes his dark side but I liked the fact that he took the gamble and tried something different more than I liked the movie itself. I found the use of the Fleetwood Mac track of the same name to be an amusing inclusion but a barely recognisable Johnny Depp who plays detective Guy LePointe seems pointless and just diverts us away from the horror, breaking the spell of being trapped alone with a serial killer.\n\nIt's still an interesting film with echoes of Frankenstein and The Silence of the Lambs but ultimately doesn't go anywhere or achieve much. It was John Lennon who once proclaimed I Am the Walrus, Kevin Smith takes that notion in a literal sense and runs with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Smith's second attempt at a genre other than comedy. His last effort Red State was Smith's homage to the Coen brothers, specifically their crime film Fargo. I applauded that film for being Smith's most ambitious film, taking him out of his comfort zone and always pulling the rug out from under me. I had no idea where he was going to take it and I was along for the ride. With Tusk we have Smith dipping his toes into the horror genre a bit further. This time he seems to be channeling more Cronenberg-esque with body mutilation, but knowing the history behind the creation of this project, I can't help but think the entire thing was a big joke.\n\nA lot of what happens has to be seen to be believed. After seeing this, I have to ask people who have also seen it a simply question. Should this film have remained a smodcast idea? Was there enough story here to justify Smith making it? I asked myself these questions when the film would oddly throw in some flashbacks. One set of flashbacks are told in black and white from Parks' lifetime, while the other, in colour, belongs to Long. As mentioned earlier, the idea was from a smodcast that Smith and his long-time producing partner, Scott Mosier did and you can actually hear them talking about this idea near the end of the credits. They laugh at the ridiculousness of it all and ask fans to vote #WalrusYes #WalrusNo. Well, as you could have guessed, #WalrusYes won and we have our film. Tusk awkwardly tries to honour the original idea of it being a horror film, the grotesqueness of body horror and also try to be hilariously stupid at the same time. Smith doesn't balance this tone very well and the reason is the cameo performance from a Hollywood A-lister.\n\nI'm not going to spoil who the actor is, but he plays the role so comically over the top that I sat there thinking; did Smith give him 100% free range to do whatever the hell he wanted? I was on board with the seriousness of the film until he showed up, then it went off the rails in ways I can't even describe. Smith goes for an ambitious mixture of tone and I think he fails here. Played half for laughs and half for seriousness, I couldn't help but feel a little let down by it all.\n\nI think the horror aspect works better than the comedy here. The humour here is lacking, especially with the Long character. He comes off as obnoxious and not funny, despite the numerous jokes he tries to throw out there. Does he deserve what he gets? That question is left in the viewers mind. Some people might make the argument that this film exists merely to give Parks a juicy role. Verbally eloquent, vaguely sinister, Parks spews his lines so well and with such gusto that he gives his performance in Red State a run for its money. It's one of the most successful elements of the film.\n\nI am interested in Smith's career direction now. Red State and Tusk aren't receiving as much praise as his previous films, but the man is stepping out of his comfort zone to try something different. He's been accused of being a lazy filmmaker that only makes poop jokes. Not anymore, so I applaud him for this, he's finally making interesting films, good or bad, they are interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: What a strange but original movie! Justin Long plays a cocky podcaster who goes to Canada to interview a boy who chops of his leg on YouTube by mistake. When he reaches his destination, he ends up interviewing a mysterious man after finding a letter that was left in a bar toilet. The guy has all of these wonderful stories about his past but all is not what it seems. He takes Justin Long as his hostage and he converts his body into a walrus after several operations and mental torture. His girlfriend and best friend start to question his disappearance and they go on the hunt to save there best friend, with the help of a private investigator who has been investigating the disappearance of other people. Personally I found the movie quite disturbing because of the graphic walrus transformation and the mental pressure on Longs character. I liked the PI who took on the case to find there friend because he brought some humour to the extremely dark project. I thought that it was a walrus suit that could have been taken off but there was obviously more to transformation than I thought. Justin Long and Michael Parks made this warped storyline feel quite realistic which was why it was hard to watch in parts. I'm basically in two minds about this film because it's intriguing and mysterious in one hand but disturbing and graphic in another. Based on my assumptions, it's worth a watch just to get another opinion on this Fly type movie. Weird but watchable, if you can stomach it!\n\nRound-Up: This is a different direction for Kevin Smith who usually makes comedies like the awful Cop Out, the Jay and Silent Bob franchise, Zack and Mary Make A Porno, Dogma and the Clerks franchise. He does have a warped sense of humour so I'm sure that there was a weird reason why he made this film. He's a man that doesn't have any boundaries, like with the subject matter in Dogma but I still found this movie quite shocking in parts. Justin Long has had a up and down career which has seemed to have slowed down at the moment. Although Die Hard 4.0 wasn't that great, he did have a major role next to Bruce Willis, which should have pushed his career to new heights after starring in over 60 movies. He's another person which is mostly known for his comedic roles in movies like Funny People, Dodgeball, Galaxy Quest and the Break-Up so I don't know if he would have been my first choice for this film. That's not to say that he didn't do a good job but judging by the box office takings, it might have been taken more seriously if it had a major star playing the lead. \n\nBudget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $2million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their disturbing horror/thriller movies about a man who takes a promising podcaster hostage to convert him into a walrus. 4/10"

Justin Long's character was really obnoxious, but whatever. That's not the issue.\n\nI'm surprised someone was capable of getting a career as a filmmaker and create this huge pile of garbage. Seriously how does that happen..\n\nThe movie sucks."

And I hadn't already seen this, so one of my friends strongly recommended that I did so.\n\nSo I did. And I will say that the concept of the movie was very interesting, sort of as a modern twist on the Frankenstein story.\n\n\"Tusk\" did indeed have some good acting performances that helped carry the movie, and there was a good cast in the movie. I will say that Justin Long really carried the movie well, and it was sort of an interesting thing to see him in a movie as bizarre as this turned out to be. But the icing on the cake had to be Johnny Depp's character and his performance, that was just hilarious. But it was also a rather good performance by Michael Parks, although it was far from being the crowning achievement of his entire acting career.\n\nThe walrus creature, however, looked so horribly fake that it just didn't work out for the movie. It was laughable to look at, and it was so difficult to take it serious in any possible means. And the way that one would isolate oneself and assume the demeanor of an animal just didn't make much sense to me.\n\n\"Tusk\" is hardly the type of movie that you will watch more than once, because the storyline and the movie itself just doesn't have enough material to support more than a single viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tusk begins with a refreshing originality that immediately grabs my attention. The film's first half is engaging and effectively sets up a bizarre and intriguing premise. The story of a podcaster who becomes ensnared in a maniacal scheme to transform him into a walrus is both darkly comedic and unsettling. Kevin Smith's unique vision shines through, and the performances, particularly by Justin Long and Michael Parks, are strong, adding depth to the film's eccentricity.\n\nThe first act excels in its setup, blending horror with dark humor in a way that keeps me hooked. The dialogue is sharp, and the absurdity of the situation is handled with a sense of playful creativity. It's a fascinating ride that promises a memorable experience.\n\nHowever, as the film progresses, it struggles to maintain the same level of intrigue and excitement. The second half, while still bizarre, begins to drag, and the initially fresh premise starts to feel strained. The tonal shifts become more pronounced, and the narrative loses some of its earlier momentum. The climax, while undeniably outrageous, doesn't fully deliver on the promise set up in the first act, leaving the film feeling uneven.\n\nOverall, Tusk is a film with a strong and intriguing start, but it falters as it progresses. The initial creativity and dark humor give way to a more erratic and less compelling finale. It's a unique watch that's worth seeing for its originality, but it doesn't quite sustain its early promise throughout."

I didn't laugh at this movie, I didn't cringe from being grossed out, I didn't shrink in fear. All I can say is that I watched it. It's almost as though I just had a great practical joke played on me, only I didn't get the punch line. It's like this was made because it could be made. That being said, it is more than I could do, but it saddens me to see any currency that Kevin Smith had was spent on this. It truly feels like it was made for Kevin Smith, his friends, and his die hard fans, which is great if you are in one of those categories. I thought I was indeed one of those fans, but I might have to rethink that. It's not that I hated it, or it was the worst thing I have ever seen. (Anyone who grew up on 80's TV has seen so much worse) I am not knocking you Kevin, I love ya. I saw all the other movies, DVDs, read your book Tough SH&T (which was very moving BTW) but I honestly feel like I missed something here. I was hoping for more of what you have put into those other ventures put into this one. You are truly an inspiration to many of us out here, and there are times you have told stories that have moved me very much. If you are a die hard fan, by all means watch this movie. If you are looking for something that will keep you interested, laughing, or even hiding behind your hands, this is not for most. I truly believe that Kevin Smith can make great movies, and write fantastic things. For me at least, this is not one of them."

Now I'll admit that I was expecting something weird coming from a collaboration between Kevin Smith and A24, but this movie is a whole different level of weirdness in almost every way possible.\n\nPositives for Tusk (2014): There is certain amount of ridiculousness that can come from a movie with a premise as bonkers as this and it achieves that. The humor in this movie is decent enough, but the best humor is at the beginning between Justin Long and Haley Joel Osment. The practical effects for the walrus design in this movie is unique and weird. The performances from the cast are all great. And finally, I appreciates that Kevin Smith took something that he did from his past and made it into a movie.\n\nNegatives for Tusk (2014): Despite everything that Kevin Smith got right with this movie, he also got a lot of stuff wrong. First off, the movie can't decide what the tone should be. There is a lot of different tone shifts to where you'll be watching something really funny and then it cuts to something very dark and serious. Also, the movie is a little too weird for me and that's something that you can expect from A24, but this is one of those few times to where the weird artistic nature of these movies didn't work for me.\n\nOverall, Tusk (2014) was certainly an experience that I won't be forgetting anytime soon, but I also don't see myself rewatching this movie at all."

This is a honestly pretty good horror comedy. It can be pretty real and brutal at times. Interchanged with some funny sequences.\n\nDirecting felt fine, a lot more colorful than what you'd typically expect for a horror, it's graded like a summer flick. Which in a way helps in turn against the darker scenes. Though it made some side character scenes feel a bit cheaper, can't put my finger on it exactly.\n\nActing was decent too, I loved Howe. Great bits. Lapointe (Depp), which I didn't even realize was Johnny Depp, like what?! He was good, though his introduction scene was way too long. That character did add the needed layer of silliness that completed the movie for me as a comedy. The whole podcast thing never felt funny to me. Nor the relationship dialog. I feel sorry for Long, his throat must've been hurting. Good cast, he does these types of characters well and has done them before.\n\nStory/gore/etc I liked the story, it build up nicely, so many red flags but our main is just so naive, it's great. The third act goes full on and it's great. It just finished how it needed to once you saw that first reveal. It's hilarious. The gore was pretty good, until the suit, that was much more intentionally fake than what came before. That said it's still effective. Especially the face area.\n\nMusic good, nice background timings with some moments. Liked that.\n\nAll in all not much else to say, can't really say it disturbed me like I've seen some others mention, but weird. That. It. Is. Love it."

I do not like body horrors, I have no intention of ever watching the Saw movies or The Human Centipede.\n\nThis one, I went in with no expectations, having read no reviews. The protagonist is an arrogant unlikeable man, of the kind you've probably met on youtube or some random twitch stream. So much so, that at first you almost feel he deserves his initial blow.\n\nBut the horror of what a serial killer does to him does produce genuine pity for him. And yes, it's gross, but I didn't mind, partly because the comedy element kept the darkness at bay.\n\nIts far from perfect, and I've never liked body horror, so I spent a fair amount of it being grossed out, but less though than say Cronenberg's 'The Fly' which still disturbs me to even think about let alone rewatch.\n\nIts a short run length too, and even then it feels like a creepypasta stretched a little thin. Still, I really enjoyed it and I think that was mainly due to Michael Park's incredible performance. The rest of the cast were fairly throwaway, but Park's twisted Walrus lover is something else! He's believable in his utter insanity.\n\nLastly while body horror movies may make people uncomfortable, true horror is psychological. This will be a movie I'll remember as weird, creepy, and dark yet somewhat of a romp. Compare that to say \"Synedoche, New York\" which has no horror and yet left me an emotional train wreck for about a week later."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh boy. I don't think ideas for horror movies get so over-the- top than Tusk, though a comedy horror is a risky genre that has paid of before, courtesy of Zombieland back in 2009. If you've seen the trailer, you can probably guess what the premise here is. If you haven't, don't worry. If you can stick around long enough to get to where the horror aspect begins, which is a chore to do all by itself, you should be able to figure it out by that point.\n\nJourney to another boring horror movie, that tries to be a comedy and fails miserably. Despite the Comedy genre I saw attached to it on the Redbox machine, what it has, way more than it does laughs, is exposition that makes The Last Airbender sh\u00eft in its pants. The flashbacks seldom ever add anything to the plot and is more likely just there to make the movie longer so that it fills an hour and a half of wasted time instead of maybe 50-60 minutes of it. There are laughs, but they are few and very far between and the movie was stale as a result.\n\nAlso, I couldn't care less about these characters, except maybe Teddy. Of course, the only reason I even followed Teddy is because Haley Joel Osment, the guy portraying Teddy, is Sora's Voice Actor for Kingdom Hearts, so really, I am really only rooting for Sora more than I am Teddy. As far as the other characters, they were too underdeveloped and, outside of being a victim, they just were not memorable.\n\nThat said, the horror aspect of the film is served as there was a slight sense of dread and even the tiniest bit of sadness come the film's end. I am even willing to admit that the villain of the film was cringe-worthy enough to be somewhat worthwhile. But this can't really save the film here. The cons far outweigh the pros because it failed as a comedy. I see what it wanted to go for, but the execution could have been a lot better and it failed to give me enough to like it. Tusk had the potential there, but it was wasted and the end result was not satisfying."

The film is full of suspense, humor, and horror elements that are well-balanced and expertly executed.\n\nThe acting is top-notch, with standout performances by Justin Long as the hapless Wallace and Michael Parks as the eccentric kidnapper. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the eerie beauty of rural Canada and the chilling atmosphere of the story.\n\nTusk is a film that takes risks and pays off in spades. Its unique blend of genres and its ability to be both hilarious and frightening is a testament to the talent of everyone involved in its creation.

Other times a suspense thriller that misses the mark. The build up in the first half doesn't hit its target the second half either.\n\nIf its meant to be a joke, would be better to preface this in an opening credits sequence; not at the end credits where we discover this was just some ludicrous banter from a podcast.\n\nIf the film had better direction & a proper soundtrack it could have been something revered and hated like The Human Centipede.\n\nFor all the dialogue (that you come to expect in a kevin smith film) it really fell flat with no purpose come the final 10-15 minutes or so.\n\nI could have appreciated it either way if it wasn't for the fact that the whole thing was done as a joke. A very unfunny joke.\n\nBut that's just it. If it was a success you bask in it but it was absurd and not in a good way.\n\nI do enjoy a twist ending, as insane and nonsensical as it was. Could have gone in a much darker direction, but then you come to realise the ending was already (literally) foretold.\n\nSo it truly was baseless and a waste of time..i was told to avoid this movie like the plague. None the less, some good performances here. Which is truly dissappointing, but we aren't supposed to take this pile of crap seriously in the first place, right?\n\nIt is fraught with hypocrisy, and the follow up pseudo-docu that followed i'm sure justifies every word I say.\n\nNone the less, as far as pieces of crap go, I give this a 6. Not as a serious film, but a time waster. Idiotic, pointless, mind-numbing bullsht.\n\nIt at least made me laugh at some points so i bumped it from 5 to 6."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tusk is a film with a very quirky premise that should be fun, or eerie, or at least entertaining. A melancholy old man abducts a podcaster and surgically alters him to resemble a walrus, which he thinks is the world's finest creature. Anyone with half a brain could make this bizarre idea either really funny or really creepy; it would take a lot of incompetence to fail. Yet Kevin Smith and his hangers-on are clearly such a black hole of talent that they managed to fail dismally.\n\nThe comedy is nonexistent. The movie throws in bad Canadian accents, an old guy saying \"poop hole\" and \"hyuk, Canadians like hockey a lot.\" If you think that's side-splitting, then this movie was clearly made for you. The humor in this movie makes Family Guy look like comedic genius.\n\nSince the comedy is dead in the water, you'd think the movie would try to do something worthwhile on the horror element, but we are not so lucky. We're treated to the gimmick of a guy in a lame costume, and then... well, that's it. It's just scene after scene of a guy sitting around in a lame walrus costume while nothing interesting happens. At that point, it's clear that the creators knew they could make a lame, boring time-waster and still rake in a ton of cash thanks to Kevin Smith's name in the credits. Hurray for pop culture.\n\nThe \"creative\" team was so lazy that they actually have to pad out the movie with tedious love triangle dreck about these characters we don't care about. It's nice knowing they spent millions of dollars to make this happen.\n\nSo the content of the film is pathetic; how about the performances? Justin Long is just another limp-wristed white guy as our protagonist, and he spends half the movie in the stupid walrus costume. Nothing to see here. Michael Parks does the best he can as the villain. He has one great scene where he tells Long a made-up story about a poisonous spiderbite; in this scene, he is an unpredictable, compelling character. But outside of those 5 minutes, he just plays a generic crazy old guy who exposits a lot and sometimes makes lame literary references.\n\nHaley Joel Osmont plays a forgettable non-character, and Johnny Depp appears as a pointless detective with a \"hilarious\" accent like some amateur SNL comedian. Genesis Rodriguez stands out as the stinkiest log on this pile, appearing as the obligatory airbrushed girl who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Most of the actors are forgettable, and they clearly understand this movie isn't worth much effort. But Rodriguez is trying way too hard, and her godawful lack of any acting ability is painfully bad.\n\nI enjoy B movies and \"so bad they're good movies,\" but this one is just a time-waster. Don't watch this flick unless you want to see an interesting premise turned into a boring failure."

It's absurd, yet at the same time realistic and that's why it's really deeply shocking. It's not a movie everyone will enjoy obviously there are some haters (or narrow-minded people) who don't credit it for what it is. But i agree on that it's not for everyone's taste, i'm not sure if i can recommend it to anyone, at the same time i can say it's one of the best recent movies i have seen.

I don't know why Smith tried so hard to inject comedy in a film that is clearly a horror film.\n\nThe film stars Justin Long, Michael Parks, Genesis Rodriguez, Haley Joel Osment, and Johnny Depp. I will say I think the acting for the most part is really good, especially Michael Parks and Genesis Rodriguez. I've been a huge fan of Michael Parks even since I saw him in his double role in Kill Bill. Parks is having so much fun with this role and adds a truly terrifying atmosphere to the film. Genesis Rodriguez adds a wonderful level of emotion to the film. You feel her pain all throw out the film and gives a performance that really did move me. The last scene between her and Justin Long where she talks about her grandfather is heartbreaking. Everyone else does fine but those two are the ones that shine.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film is the tone control. Kevin Smith has no control over the tone of this film and the constant back in fourth between horror and comedy is very confusing. I will admit that the parts of the film that is horror is actually scary and at times horrifying. But sadly all of that is ruined by the switch to comedy. The comedy in this film is so unfunny and at many times just mean spirited and just made me uncomfortable(and not the good kind of uncomfortable). During the credits we get a audio clip of the \"infamous\" podcast that lead to this film. Kevin smith is talking about the final scene and laughing all the way throw pitching the movie. He's laughter shows the total misinterpretation of his own script and shoes the mean spirited humor that is laced throughout this film.\n\n\"Tusk\" could've been a great movie. With a great cast and an interesting plot but Kevin Smith just destroyed it by trying to inject his so called \"Humor\" in it. If he had just gone and made a straight horror film he could have had something special here. I see Kevin Smith's comedy something along the lines as George Lucas's use of special effects.\n\nIt's not needed.\n\n1.5/4 Stars"

Michael Parks gives a performance that is both hilarious and incredibly creepy and unsettling. Even though Justin Long's character deserves what's coming to him, you can't help but feel bad (and laugh) as he screams and cries like a walrus or is forced to eat a raw fish.\n\nThis movie is a better horror film than most that have already or will be coming out during this years Halloween line up, and it was a lot funnier than most of this year comedies. All together, it was definitely one of the most fun movies I have seen this year.\n\nIf you like horror, comedy, drama, weird and creepy imagery, and weird movies that leave you feeling odd, but satisfied, I highly recommend this movie."

The film is original, even bizarre, but it cannot in fact be considered a horror movie, and anyone who does it must be deeply easy to scare. It doesn't scare anyone, although its provocative and has strong scenes. The script is based on a podcaster's trip to Canada, where he meets an old sailor who is actually a psychopath obsessed with walruses. But the biggest problem is that the film seems only interested in provoking, not in accomplishing something. It's not a comedy, it's not a horror movie, it could never be a thriller because we can predict everything that will happen with great ease... I just don't know how to rate this movie.\n\nKevin Smith is far from a good director and this film only served to solidify the certainty that he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. The construction of the script fails in many ways, none of the characters goes beyond the caricature, the performance of the actors is also a caricature of themselves. The only exception is Michael Parks who, with a generally good and somewhat serious interpretation, prevented the film from completely sinking in the mud and didn't allowed me to give up watching it. About Johnny Depp ... I'm just not surprised to see him here because he's gotten used to expecting anything from him."

It's a low budget oddity with a focus on gross-out comedy and quirky humour, but none of it is funny, just obnoxious. I didn't recognise Depp in this but his character is irritating as he's too obviously mannered. Osment is better but Smith's puerile script makes this near unwatchable at times."

The characters are charming and the setting draws you in.

I normally like horror, but this had nothing from a good horror (suspense, thrills etc). It just had gross out factor and disturbing images.\n\nThis film is for a REALLY niche market. The 5 stars are for the acting and the first half. The second half is best avoided.\n\nOh, and the Canadian accents are HORRIBLE. I live in Canada. Nobody talks like that. I thought Kevin Smith respected Canada, but it was just full of Canadian stereo types turned up to 11."

I put myself in the same twisted situation and feel I could have not in real life acted better than him. He has now risen to the top 5 of acting of all time only as no one else could pull off this role I'm sure of that. Along with some incredible monologues and a Johnny depp performance that was necessary to my enjoyment of the movie but further enhanced it I have to give the film tusk a hands down 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "The experience that I had with Kevin Smith's new film \"Tusk\" is unlike any other. And when I say 'any other', I mean ANY other. It doesn't draw similarities with films of the same genre (or others for that matter), both in the style and the characters. The whole concept in and of itself is one of the most original ideas for a movie I've ever seen, and the execution of it is surprising and strange. And though it may not be the kind-of movie I would frequently recommend, mostly due to the odd looks I'd be given, it directly proves that sometimes weird is good.\n\nThe film centers around a podcaster named Wallace (Justin Long) who, on a quest to find his next interesting interviewee in the backwoods of Canada, encounters a creepy and mysterious old seafarer that has an obsession with walruses. Yes, you read it correctly, walruses. And due to the fact that I don't want to spoil the film's many plot surprises, let's just say that Justin Long's character becomes the victim of that obsession. What ensues is a bizarre (yet seamless) mixture of comedy and horror that never fails to entertain.\n\nIt's easily one of the most surreal movie experiences I've ever had, and it's destined to be a midnight-movie classic. You certainly need to know that what you're getting into shouldn't be taken seriously, and once you're in that mindset, you'll revel in its outrageousness. And for a movie so out- there and different, it's startling how great some of the performances are. Michael Parks (who plays the sinister antagonist) is outstanding, and Justin Long complements him perfectly. It's definitely a B-Movie in every sense of the word, but that's why I found it so enjoyable."

But all I'm going to say is the girlfriend choosing the protagonists lifestyle at the end of the film, do to his inability to speak, is a CRAZY ILLEGAL CHOICE. It says it takes place a year after the incident but regardless, the protagonists wounds are still bleeding. The latex is shown coming off in multiple scenes when wet, and for some reason Johnny depps character has no further role past a massive cliff hanger at the second to last scene! What was that about?

Writing this review to warn people to not waste their time feeling sick to your stomach for two hours."

        "review_detailed_main": "'TUSK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nWriter/director Kevin Smith's new horror-comedy flick about a deranged, wheelchair-bound, retired seaman who attempts to surgically transform a popular podcast host (who's also a house visitor, at his home in Manitoba) into a walrus. It was written and directed by Smith and based on an idea from his own SModcast podcast show (Smith hosts with his buddy Scott Mosier). The film stars Michael Parks (who also starred in Smith's last feature film, 'RED STATE'), Justin Long, Genesis Rodriquez, Haley Joel Osment and Johnny Depp. It's the first in a planned trilogy of films, Smith calls the 'True North Trilogy', using many of the same characters and cast. The movie is really weird but if you don't mind 'crazy' it's really entertaining as well.\n\nWallace Bryton (Long) and Teddy Craft (Osment) are friends that host a popular podcast show together, called 'The Not-See Party'. On the show, the two viciously attack, and ridicule, popular viral YouTube videos. Wallace travels to meet the unfortunate internet stars and then tells Teddy (who doesn't like to fly) about them on the show (which is why it's called 'the not-see party'). Wallace makes a trip to Canada to meet a guy who accidentally cut off his own leg but finds out he recently killed himself. He spots a flyer, at a local bar in Manitoba, advertising free room and board, in a big old house, and a lifetime of interesting stories. Rather than going home empty-handed Wallace decides to meet the retired seafarer (Parks), who put up the add, and interview him for his show. The visit turns out to be a horrifying mistake as he's soon drugged, by the madman, and turned into part of an insane experiment. Wallace's girlfriend, Ally (Rodriquez), and Teddy go looking for him, when he goes missing. They enlist the help of a quirky Quebec ex-cop (Depp), who's investigating the crazy seaman.\n\nI'm a huge Kevin Smith fan and I'm really excited in the direction he's taking, with his movies. I really like indie horror flicks as well, especially the comedic type, and I think Smith is a perfect writer/director to produce this type of material. 'RED STATE' is a slightly better film, because it is more serious and frightening, but as a spoof this movie really works as well (and it's also pretty disturbing). It's kind of like a more comedic version of 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE' (not quite as violent or disgusting though). Although I hate the 'HUMAN CENTIPEDE' films, I loved this movie. Depp and Parks are both perfectly cast, zany and memorable in it. Long makes a good unlikable antihero lead and it's great to see Osment doing anything. Rodriguez is way too beautiful (and hot) to believe she'd ever be with Justin Long, but she's good in the movie even so. I also really liked Smith's directing choices, throughout the entire film, and the dialogue is brilliant. It's everything you could possibly want in a Kevin Smith movie, or an indie horror-comedy flick. I loved it and I'm sure it will become a beloved cult classic (just like most of Smith's films).\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/hS02wz4z3uU"

When the nonstop Canada jokes start (yeah we get it) including an annoying, cartoonish goofball French Canadian Homicide Detective, it's all downhill. It certainly ranks among the most memorable horror/comedies I have seen, but not for the best reasons. Perhaps a glass (or four) of wine prior to watching may help."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Tusk' makes an impression. I just don't know what that impression says.\n\nIt's also pretty unforgettable. But what's most memorable about it is no reflection on quality, good or bad, but simply how bizarre it is.\n\nKevin Smith has a very particular brand of comedy that he's brought to so many of his films, and there are elements of it to be found in Justin Long's obnoxious podcaster Wallace; in the attempts of his friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) to trace his steps; and in the very, very, very surreal absurdity of the entire scenario. Yet if 'Clerks' or 'Dogma' made you laugh out loud, don't rush to jump on the 'Tusk' bandwagon, because Smith's offbeat humor - any humor it all - is kind of sparse here.\n\n'Tusk' also brings to the table big slabs of body horror and the trope of the psychopathic captor. It's in the latter that this film finds its shining star, as Michael Parks is brilliant and morbid as odd, storied recluse Howard Howe. I regret to say that I haven't seen a great many of Parks' films, but just reflecting on his performance here, I kind of want to try to find more. He's creepy, and funny in a creepy way, but also creepily endearing in a funny way.\n\nI could remark on the camerawork, or the script, or the appearances by Johnny Depp, his daughter Lily-Rose, or Smith's daughter Harley Quinn. I could try to tell you whether it's good or bad, or give a recommendation. Yet everything about 'Tusk' is just rather overshadowed by how very, very odd it is. Those disparate elements of sparse offbeat humor and bizarre takes on horror tropes combine into a feature that is difficult to pin down in any shape or form except \"WALRUS.\"\n\nIf I had to give a definitive opinion on 'Tusk,' my first impulse is to be very middle of the road: I didn't dislike it, but I'm also hard-pressed to say I liked it - again, it's just so... odd. And it's that very quality of oddness that somewhat tips the scales for me to the negative side, because despite its best efforts, 'Tusk' gets so wrapped up in its own absurdity that it fails to give us much of any other reason to watch.\n\nStrangely, I recall 'Tusk' more fondly in hindsight than when I'd just finished watching.\n\nRecommended if you're a fan of Michael Parks, or if you specifically try to find the most strange of films. Otherwise, 'Tusk' is best approached with a very open mind and highly tempered expectations."

        "review_title": "What If Kevin Smith Made The Human Centipede?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Tusk ultimately works as both a hauntingly grotesque horror film and a thoughtful exploration of contemporary society\u2014things that this generation have brought to existence from the likes of addictive technology to silly podcasts. The film centers on an abhorrently obnoxious and presumptuous twenty-something, named Wallace (Justin Long), who pretty much epitomizes the narcissistic and insensitive youth of our culture. But not only that\u2014it's also about what really separates man from animal; humanity from plain rock and coldness.\n\nWallace hosts a comedy podcast with a friend (Haley Joel Osment!), and their interactions/behavior very much resemble Kevin Smith's \"broship\" with Scott Mosier on their actual podcast (goofily titled \"SModcast\"), incessantly guffawing and joking around. One day, Long gets the opportunity to interview a one-legged teenager who infamously chopped his own leg off with a samurai sword on accident in what became an incredibly viral Youtube video (totally fictional, by the way). Fundamentally, we have a couple of fame-hungry young adults seizing an opportunity to further popularize their show off of a deathly maimed kid. What's new? Sooner rather than later, our main character meets the pure definition of Karma's wrath when planned business goes awry; he, instead, ends up visiting an eerie, sequestered mansion two hours away from Winnipeg where his worst nightmares become completely realized.\n\nI know this has been said more than a thousand times already, but Tusk is somewhat of a hilarious Human Centipede. It's that rare taste of a shockingly twisted and dark comedy\u2014a daring and uncompromising terror story that's astonishingly uproarious at the same time. You'll lay witness to some of the most disturbing sights you've seen in a long time while guiltily attempting to repress your laughter. This is the exemplar of \"twisted\" at its finest\u2014characters wailing, weeping, begging for dear life, and suffering through the most agonizing of torture while audiences are in hysterics. What also substantially elevates the hilarity of it all is a really surprising cameo that's easily the funniest part of the entire film.\n\nThe very nature of this movie is also an amusing tease throughout in the manner that it's edited and in regards to its camera angle choices, keeping you in apprehensive wonderment as it refrains from revealing any startling details too quickly. Frequently, you will see a look of shock or any other given reaction long before you see what truly stands before the characters.\n\nNow, after I left the theater with satisfaction, I gave SModcast a listen, quickly browsing through the catalog to find the specific episode where this tale was brilliantly envisioned between two jesting buddies in ceaseless cachinnation (Episode #259\" The Walrus and The Carpenter). Following the finish of this episode, one can clearly tell that while almost everyone's ready to vomit at the horrific sight on- screen, Kevin Smith is having a field day and breathlessly laughing.\n\nOn the other hand, the film can certainly feel, at times, like it's being stretched out, especially concerning the last act. Normally, Kevin Smith's screenplays utterly shine brightest, capturing the compelling essence of conversation like the greatest of screenwriters (think: Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen, and Richard Linklater), but that sheer ability unfortunately wasn't convincingly showcased in this entry. In fact, many of the conversations/dialogue go on for far too long, and I presume Smith's script just wasn't exceptional enough to engross us through fifteen minutes of anecdotes and aphorisms. Eventually, you just desire for the narrative to finally move along from the transparently prolonged discussion at hand and continue the ghastly tale that we all came to see in the first place.\n\nAt the end of the day, you surely won't see anything quite like Tusk, which makes it worth the price of admission alone. Strong performances from Justin Long and Michael Parks (portraying the creepy owner of the mansion), a gradually terrifying plot, and the outlandish humor will ensure that moviegoers won't soon forget how (positively) f*cked-up this picture really is."

Michael Parks' turn as the quack with adolescent trauma issues manifesting in serial killer play maker is arguably the best performance in the picture. I found Guy LaPoint's turn as the reincarnation of Peter Falk circa Columbo to be too ham-fisted in attempting comedy. The problem I have, and maybe others will have with this film is this: If you want to be a horror movie then bring the originality of ideas with ingenious builds of suspense, or, If you want to be a comedy, then make the comedy clever and relative. This film was trying to be both (or maybe neither) which leaves it in a world equally as interesting. Next!"

The whys and wherefores I'll leave for you to discover, suffice to say that the film is totally insane.\n\nUnfortunately, as messed up as Tusk undeniably is, it's not one of Smith's better efforts: it's far fetched (albeit intentionally so), overly talky (as per every Smith movie), and at over 100 minutes, about 20 minutes too long. The dialogue isn't terrible - Smith is more than capable of writing witty conversation - but there's simply too much of it, and this causes the movie to drag. And as much as I admire make-up man Robert Kurtzman, his man-turned-walrus effects aren't among his best work.\n\nI'm glad that Smith is able to get such weirdness out of his system, and admire his willingness to explore material that most film-makers would leave well alone, but Tusk proves that if body horror is to be done by any Canadian, then that person should always be Cronenberg."

I thought I knew exactly what to expect from those two, but I was so wrong. This has no similarity with anything any of them ever did. IMDb says comedy, drama, horror, and although it has elements of each, I can not agree with that classification. True, there's humor, but if you are in for a comedy, you're in for extremely unpleasant surprise. Although it has elements of eighties B horror, this movie is not scary. It won't frighten you or keep you tense, but most of it is both psychologically and visually unpleasant. And whether you will characterize it as a drama, I think it depends on your subjective experience. It's surreal, awkward, nasty and sick. Whether you like it or not, it's certain you won't easily forget it.\n\n8/10"

Otherwise, the characters are one dimensional and the humor often falls flat in between the generic horror aspects of the film. Balancing the two genres of comedy and horror in one picture is a feat in its own, one which director Kevin Smith does not succeed in. The end result is a dull body horror flick in which the few highlights take place in the first 20 minutes. Not even a quirky Johnny Depp could save this film."

It's not suppose to be taken seriously, it's pure shock and I did enjoy the dark humor that was included. Like watching a low-budget horror movie, you can't go in expecting the effects to look realistic. Instead you have to appreciate how unrealistic everything is and have a laugh at it.\n\nLuckily the movie was directed with this expectation. It was presented showing scenes that are obviously over-the-top just for the sake of it.\n\nThe fun of watching this movie is getting to laugh at it and then ask yourself \"Why am I watching this?\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, WHAT THE F#CK HAPPENED TO KEVIN SMITH? (Do I Mean That in a Good or Bad Way? Find Out Here)\n\nTusk is written and directed by one of my favorite directors Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy). Tusk is about a U.S. podcaster, played by Justin Long ( Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Live Free or Die Hard) ventures into the Canadian wilderness to interview an old man, played by in my opinion, a very underrated actor Michael Parks (Red State, Django Unchained) who has an extraordinary past, and the American learns the man has a dark secret involving a walrus.\n\nKevin Smith is a very talented director and writer. I love his films, Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, you name it. I also respect what he has done for the filmmaking business, and his passion for storytelling. For instance, he sold his comic book collection, and stayed up for countless hours just to make an independent movie called Clerks. Clerks is a great movie, well-rounded characters, great dialogue, it's funny, it changed the way we look at independent cinema, and overall the film has a large value of entertainment. He comes off like a cool person, a fan of comic books, and someone you could easily have a conversation with. In my opinion, Kevin Smith has not directed a great film since Clerks 2, and has not directed a decent movie since Zach and Miri make a Porno and Red State. If anyone would love to give the film Tusk a good rating it is me, because I really like Kevin Smith. On the other hand, I believe Tusk is the worst film Smith has written and directed.\n\nI was so interested in this movie, because the plot seems so interesting. The positive outcomes of the film are the tension is there, builds up horror; Justin Long does a good job, Michael Parks is phenomenal in his performance, it's well shot, and damn it I wanted to see a man turn another man into a half man half walrus! In my opinion, this is the Michael Park's film. If you want to see a creepy old man, who will scare the hell out of you, see Michael Park perform. He was in another Kevin Smith film called Red State. I did enjoy that movie. Accordingly, this is a nice throwback to old school cinema, and grindhouse/exploitation films. However, the same problems I had with Red State finds its way into Tusk.\n\nFor instance, our main character is not very likable. He comes off as sleazy, rude, and arrogant. There are scenes throughout the film where they try to mix horror and comedy, and for me this doesn't blend all that well. I love when horror and comedy can combine, and make a well- crafted film. But, it comes of a little confusing, and downright awkward at times. I can't tell if this film is trying to be so bad that it's funny, or is it just that bad of a film? The horror elements work beautifully; to me this should have just been a straight up horror flick. In addition, there is a cameo in this film, and I actually didn't recognize him at all! Therefore, I give props to whoever did the design/makeup. Once I found out who it was, I was actually surprised, and I found it to be funny. What I didn't find funny was how long the scene goes on for. It drags, and drags, to the point where it is not funny anymore. They had a good joke, and just like that, it died. So my biggest issue with the film is the writing.\n\nWhy do walruses go to Tupperware parties? To find a tight seal.\n\nOkay, that joked sucked. Let's get to what everyone cares about, the damn walrus. All I have to say is when you see it is disturbing and you can't help but to look away, but find away to still look at what's on screen. (Does that make any sense?) Once you get a good look at the walrus human hybrid, that's when you know the film is once again trying to be an awkward blend of horror and comedy.\n\nSo these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Tusk. It is far from Kevin Smith's best movie. What works is the horror. What doesn't work for me is the writing, characters, and honestly how Kevin Smith went from amazing films to this. I believe the movie has more weak spots, than good spots. I really hope Kevin Smith can come back and make a spectacular film. Maybe, it will be his next upcoming film titled Moose Jaws. It's like Jaws but with a moose\u0085I can hop can't I. Maybe I just didn't understand the movie. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, even though I like tea. If you truly want to know the history of filmmaker, writer, and entertainer Kevin Smith, you should definitely check out his previous films before this one. I believe the film Tusk earns a\u0085\n\n4/10\n\nThis review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"

It is a stew pot of ingredients with some exceptional acting performances mixed in with ridiculousness. Some of the dialogue is sublime almost, especially Howard How's monologues and there is a juxtaposition to the crassness of Wallace's podcasting sell out character. There is a lot of thought in this script and possibly a lot to talk about however I must say that the third act where Johnny Depp generally steals the screen when I'm not distracted by the almost joke rubbery suit kind of takes off in a different kooky direction. Justin Long and Michael Parks really were fantastic together, and whilst I awaited the resolution of the third act I think the movie should have ended in the high gear it was for the first two acts. However the story is there and still stands regarding Wallace's extreme journey from himself to his objective humour and eventually becoming an extremity of what he laughed at. This is a rather unusual movie and certainly a cult one at that for its deeper than you may think. If you are after popcorn stay away, however if you're after some non-standard crazyness that actually has a point to make come on in."

Several people had written long paragraphs, but summed up short it felt like neither a horror movie nor a comedy. It is almost astounding how they even got the actors to partake in this."

The acting was a little overkill (Justin Long could've been a better actor). I will give props to Michael Parks though for being genuinely weird and sometimes making me laugh! Watch at your own risk, it's gruesome."

Some worse than others..but sometimes, you can't help but feel bad for the ones who plead for their lives or freedom, and whom are denied that right. It's freakishly demented, one that is difficult to stomach. I don't think I've ever seen a film in which the original \"bad guy\" is the one punished by a second, and it's a lose-lose situation. One in which the end of the movie will almost have you fighting back tears. I've always loved monster movies, and if you're looking for some kind of horror/creature feature type movie...well that's not exactly what this is. Its a lot deeper than that."

No worries there, for a horror/comedy sort of movie, so we kept watching. At that point, we were thinking along the lines of, \"So, when does this character get what he deserves?\" But it's the audience who gets the short end of the stick here, and no one deserves to see a movie this BAD. Tacky isn't funny, characters you hate, when it's literally all of them, and a \"plot\" that makes less sense than a surreal dreamscape from psychedelic mushrooms (I can only guess) do not make for entertainment. There had to be some sort of drugs involved to make such a strange and senseless storyline. Senseless plot, no logic at all, tackiness pretending to be humor, and shock value pretending to be scares; no, just no. Not good, not entertaining, not thought provoking, just stupid. Worse that stupid. Anyone who claims to have enjoyed this movie needs a shrink. Seriously. If I knew someone who said they did, I'd cut off all relations with that person. Fast. I feel for any actor with a career so bad they had to be involved in such a movie. Well, almost. One name I saw in the cast listing, scrolling down to write this review, wow, what a nail n the coffin of a career. I have to note, too, the Netflix description LIES. They had description that sounds like some sort of fun creature feature, and that is NOT what you get. Avoid like the plague. Have a root canal, instead. Far less painful. This one makes the list of WORST MOVIES EVER MADE, hands down. Right down there with that pathetic 3-D piranha fiasco. I'd even say, avoid anything from anyone remotely connected to this horrible excuse for a film. I know I will."

Oy vey!! This flick is hard to watch, but honestly, I liked Depp in this film, and that's saying a lot.

Sadly, we didn't have much screen time regarding the horror. But it's still enjoyable. The prosthetic work was terrific in this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Tusk, directed by Kevin Smith, is an intriguing and bizarre entry into the body horror genre. The film is undeniably grotesque, yet it's oddly captivating in its outlandishness. The story revolves around Wallace, a dislikable and self-absorbed podcaster, played by Justin Long, whose arrogance makes it hard to root for him. In fact, there isn't really a character in the film who you'd consider sympathetic or worth cheering for, which adds a strange layer of detachment to the horror unfolding on screen. Despite this, Wallace's ultimate fate is deeply unsettling and sad, a twisted end that leaves a mark.\n\nThe plot itself is completely absurd-without giving too much away, it's hard to believe that what transpires could ever actually happen. Yet, Tusk fully embraces its own ridiculousness, and that's part of what makes it an oddly enjoyable watch. It's a movie that asks you to suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride, and if you're willing to do that, it delivers a horror experience that is as grotesque as it is memorable.\n\nThis film is not for the squeamish. The body horror is intense, and the transformation at the heart of the movie is both disturbing and gruesome. Kevin Smith pushes the boundaries of what's both physically and psychologically horrifying, and while the film can be hard to stomach, it's also hard to look away from.\n\nOverall, Tusk is an interesting and unsettling film. Its plot might be ridiculous, and its characters deeply unlikable, but it still manages to be an engaging and bizarre horror story. If you enjoy body horror and can handle some truly grotesque moments, Tusk is worth a watch. Just be prepared for a film that's as strange as it is disturbing."

If there was ever a character that needed his own TV series or stand-alone movie, this would be it. The fact that I didn't even know it was Depp playing this incredibly off-beat, enchanting character made it that much better for me when I actually figured out it was him playing the guy.\n\nI have to say that I have always been a middle of the road guy when it comes to Kevin Smith movies, don't really love them, but I don't really hate them either. I have a lot of respect for anyone who just grabs a camera goes out and gets it done, you have to. This movie showed me a lot of new levels of him. He has chops, skills, whatever you want to call it. The whole execution of this movie was pretty much flawless. The directing, editing, acting, all of it were worthy of any \"A\" listers. Michael Parks, like Depp, is a human chameleon and always blows me away with his performances. Tusk is no exception. His dry, humorous back door insults in this movie are of epic stature, as are his characters that he slips in and out of playing this estranged psychopath.\n\nI'm recommending this to everyone. This movie was awesome. Period."

        "review_detailed_main": "I knew absolutely nothing about 'Tusk' going in other than it was a Kevin Smith film and it was a horror/comedy. I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan so I was looking forward to it. It started off like any other Smith film with brilliant dialogue (that I could happily listen to for hours on end) and an interesting set up which I had no doubt was going to lead to hilarious results. What I had forgotten by this stage was the 'horror' element previously mentioned. So what took place for the second two-thirds of the film came as quite a shock.\n\nI think the way I went into it, knowing nothing about what I was in for, was the best way to enjoy this film. It really did come as a massive shock out of left field. You can go into a 'Saw' or 'Hostel' film and there's no doubt what you witness is shocking, but it's also expected which eases the discomfort of watching it somewhat. Here I felt completely unprepared for what I was witnessing and that heightened the intended affect.\n\nTwice in the movie I had to look up the credit list to check whether I was losing my mind or not. The first was to check whether that was actually Haley Joel Osment. His transformation has been monumental to the point where even after checking it was him I still didn't feel 100% certain. The second time was to check whether that was actually Johnny Depp. That was an incredibly pleasant surprise. An actor of his brilliance reading lines written by Kevin Smith is nothing short of pure ecstasy. Michael Parks was brilliant in his role and Justin Long was well cast in the lead.\n\nI'm glad there is no mention of the truly shocking element to this film in its synopsis as I think this will lead people to enjoy the film a lot more. I really didn't know Smith had a film like this in him but I'm so glad he did. He's more than just a one-trick pony. I read that Quentin Tarantino turned down a cameo which I found interesting because I couldn't help feeling a lot of scenes had a touch of his style to them. I wouldn't be surprised to later find out he gave advise to Smith on a few things here and there. Altogether a brilliant film that I will be recommending to a lot of people."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I have seen an abundance of films like these, gory horror and body horror isn't really my thing. I prefer paranormal based on a true story types, but this film - while I can't say I enjoyed it - was certainly impressive on an epic scale as a minimalist horror film. I definitely heard about Kevin Smith's Red State which caused quite the hurrah a couple years back. When I saw the trailer to this film, they slyly didn't show ANY of the transformed Justin Long - something in marketing that is pretty much unheard of these days. Not a single frame of what he becomes was in any of the marketing campaigns. That sparked my interest. What were they hiding? What did it look like? What had crazy cat Kevin Smith cooked up as the humanoid walrus hybrid? It also seemed like one of those talk of the town movies, a la The Human Centipede, where you just had to see it to stay in the social loop (in my case tortured artists and theatery people). Well, well, well. What an interesting viewing experience it has been. I can say - without giving ANYTHING away - the sight of one of the most bizarre duels in movie-making history is worth the wait. The images are shocking - and I remember people both laughing and gasping when the curtain is lifted and we see the film's \"walrus.\" Michael Parks is a true sadist - charming, unreliable, hilarious, and sick. Justin Long's hatable nature as a self-involved, raunchy podcaster is still something we can kind of miss once the transformation begins. The film is an odd allegory for how, as human beings, we have lost our humanity. Oddly enough, without giving anything away, humanity is achieved like never before at the end - while not exactly in the way everyone was expecting. It's not too disturbing but then again I'm pretty desensitized so horror virgins beware. This could give you nightmares. Funny, disgusting, ridiculous, insane, intelligently inane, and absolutely first class independent film midnight movie making that was backed by a major studio. Just go see the thing. Of all the things Kevin Smith has done, it may just be his masterpiece."

This is very similar in feel and style to the 70's film \"Ssssss\"---which I always enjoyed and thought was underrated. Add in a little dose of Cronenberg's \"The Fly\", and a touch of \"Dead of Winter\"(the one with Mary Steenbergen). The acting by Depp, Parks, Long,Osment and all the cast was spot-on. Depp's performance was truly original and inspired. Smith's direction took the story to an almost unbearable level of horror-tolerance, without going over the edge like the \"Saw\" films or the disgusting \"Human Centipede\" films---so, if that's what you're looking for, torture-porn horror, then stay away, you WON'T like it. But if you're looking for a good, creepy, funny, somewhat disturbing horror film, then this will put a smile on your face. Really reminded me of the 70's horror films, in content and style. Lots of talking in spots, but all relevant to the plot---tightly and expertly directed by Smith. I was not expecting this when reading all the horrible, hateful reviews, and makes me wonder if those reviewing even actually watched the film, or are just trolling to stir-up anger in people. If you like horror, R-rated horror, with a dose of comedy, then this is your ticket. I absolutely loved it!"

The whole time you are watching you don't know whether to be freaked out or laugh. If going to see a movie different from the normal mainstream movies we are all used to isn't enough to sell you on it then the performance put together by Michael Parks will. He hasn't don much in recent years except for work with Smith on Red State and Tusk, but he is a master at his craft. I will admit that I was not sold on this movie when I first heard about it (even being a huge fan of Kevin Smith, his movies, and his podcasts) but after watching it the only thing I can say is #WalrusYes"

Kevins screen writing and directing shows you he is not afraid to go out of his comfort zone and deliver an off the wall movie and he does just that in Tusk. It's not for everyone but its a movie that you must understand Kevin Smith and his personality to truly enjoy Tusk. The movie grabs your attention at the beginning. The middle gives you a back ground and tells the plot. The end gives you a tear jerker and appreciate the brilliance of Kevin and his writing. Can not wait to see what movies he does next. #Walrusyes #Tusk #Idontwanttodieincanada"

The plot of this movie just sounds stupid. It's about an old guy wants to turn this other guy into a walrus. And does it work. Yes it does. I think Kevin Smith proved to himself that he can direct a horror movie. The acting in this movie is really good and Michael Parks is just fantastic in this movie. There were a couple scenes in this movie that made me laugh too. Also there's a great cameo in this movie that was pretty funny too. The movie also feels original I can tell you that this movie is better than Human Centipede. However there is some problems in this movie. There were a couple of dialogue scenes that dragged on for too long. Also when you finally see what the walrus looks like it seemed a little to early for the film to show what it looks like. Also there's a point at the end of the film where it kind of got a little ridiculous and a little confusing. Those are mostly the problems about the film. I think Tusk can be related to the films Enemy and Under The Skin. Mostly because they feel like a Twilight Zone episode but longer. I heard that this film will be part of a trilogy. The final 2 movies are Yoga Hosers and Moose Jaws. I think in a couple years this film could reach of being a cult classic. Also this film is very memorable because when people say Tusk then another person will say \"Oh I remember that film\". Overall it's just a solid horror flick and I think it's a movie where you get a couple of your friends and just enjoy the film.\n\n\"There, there. It'll be all right, Mr. Tusk\".- Howard Howe"

I watched the movie not knowing anything about it, but only had heard it was \"disturbing\" so that intrigued me. I got home from work and seen it was on Amazon so fired it on to see how it was and I have seen more disturbing than this but it will definitely stick with me.

Those screams will shake anyones soul, so much so that I actually had to fastforward a bit thru them this time...more than I could take before bedtime, thats for sure! the acting was very good and the lead actor, once transformed, had to rely on his facial expressions and eyes and those cries to convey his state and it was painful to the extreme and heartbreaking at the same time...Im not going to say what horrors were done or what he went thru, no spoilers, just know that it was chilling and that it may stay with you long after the movie is over... this hits on a primal level, and affects you at ur core more than pretty much Any other horror movie I can think of...I see from some reviews that Some people actually felt it hilarious?? Well all I can say is there must be some seriously demented souls out there who get off on extreme human sufferring and indignity! There Are a few comedic moments in the film and Depp's character is one of them, but what justin long goes thru and his fate, is Anything but funny! Be prepared and be warned!

        "review_detailed_main": "If you can stomach some of what Kevin Smith's \"Tusk\" has to offer, you will find this film to be a fascinating joyride into the macabre.\n\nJustin Long stars as podcaster Wallace Bryton who travels from Los Angeles to Manitoba, Canada in search of a story to boost the ratings for his show. Upon discovering the story that originally brought him to Canada is no longer there, he sets out to find a new one. This time his latest story is found in Howard Howe (Michael Parks), an older eccentric gentleman living in an isolated mansion.\n\nWith many sips of tea and vintage stories being told by old man Howard, Wallace finds himself attracted by the visual details of storytelling by which Howard candidly shares with his latest victim.\n\nWhat happens next leads to several unexpected surprise changes for Wallace. He is heavily sedated and cured from an apparent poisonous spider bite. Such generosity found in private health care can only be found in these sort of films where disgruntled sociopaths practice their craft on unwilling patients. However, as \"Tusk\" may have it, we soon find out that Howard has very different plans for his now captive guest.\n\nNot much should be revealed here in order to really spare the viewer from any unintentional leaks, however, I will say the film takes you on a ride with a strong message about humanity and mankind as a whole and more importantly how you reap what you sow. Wallace went to Canada looking to expose and exploit a story for his show's ratings, but soon he becomes the main attraction in a story that would skyrocket the ratings of his own podcast off the charts had he known he would have much of himself to thank for becoming the kind of story he sought in the first place, a road kill attraction for his next internet circus show.\n\nDirector Kevin Smith tugs at many raw emotions simultaneously as the events degenerate into a Frankenstein like metamorphosis of Wallace revealing the true dark side of human nature and how if left unchecked can result in pure unfiltered madness.\n\nThe introduction of a special appearance by quasi detective Guy Lapointe played by an over the top Johnny Depp leaves much to be desired. First, his monologue fails momentarily by extracting your suspension of disbelief from the successful track the story was headed. What may seem like a very long moment of Johnny Depp, being well... Johnny Depp, was in my opinion unnecessary, redundant and just plain tedious to watch. That's without saying that it slows down the film to a screeching halt for a good moment. But once this \"detective\" is reintegrated and relegated back to the main story, then the pace accelerates to a very unusual ending worthy of much debate afterwards.\n\nIf you enjoyed the premise and originality of \"Tusk\", you may want to remain seated during the end credits just to make sure you don't miss the commentary by the director himself and other images that may help give you some insight and maybe closure as to the ideas that went behind the making of this film. The director himself comments on what he was looking to achieve by the third act. With that said, Tusk will certainly take you somewhere where you have yet to go this year, this is the film to help you escape to another dimension where the depths of human depravity combined with some very solid performances with lead to a jarring experience that you are not soon to forget."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished watching Tusk, the latest film by Kevin Smith. I loved it. It reminded me of the feeling I used to have when I had my first TV set 20 years ago, sitting up in my bedroom watching anything that was on till I couldn't stay awake any longer only to wake up and realize the TV was still on. I would consume whatever was on the TV, this was before I had my own DVD player etc, and every once in a while something would come on that completely grabbed my attention. Not because it was a masterpiece of film, but because it pushed all the right buttons that good cinema should. The grind house revival of Tarrantino/Rodriguez comes to mind, although of a different measure, I imagine they tried to recreate a similar sort of feeling from their youths. With his film Tusk, Kevin Smith has made good cinema. Watchable cinema, fun cinema that brought me back to that what the fxxk moment that would come along every so often when for example a Cronenberg film, or a crazy Kung fu movie or a stylistic Hong Kong gangster movie would come on my little TV 20 years ago. Whatever that ingredient is, has been lost in the over polished modern cinematic world and Mr Smith managed to recreate this for me. A classic in this sense."

        "review_detailed_main": "For anyone who complained about this movie, take a second to stop and think about the premise. Kevin Smith, notorious comedian stoner type, hosts a pod-cast in which he reads an ad for somebody seeking \"walrus fun\". He laughs about it on his show several times, ultimately forming the plot for a silly horror movie. He draws from the Human Centipede, but decides that he wants to make it absurd. And irreverent towards Canadians. And bring in the Apple-commercial guy. And Johnny Depp. And some great actor you will long remember but had to look up his name again (Michael Parks. Michael Parks was awesome.). Then, he drew you in with a truly light hearted, endearing relationship story line. Some a**hole humor. A strange set of circumstances. Then, something truly horrible. A blend of Misery-meets-a-freak-show. But, when you put it all in the blender and add a great big dose of sketchy walrus-island crap, somehow it comes out into something so outlandish and strange, it is amazingly funny and genius. Sure, it is gross. But that is kind of the point. Personally, I think Kevin Smith has made a horror film that achieves a new standard for gore with comedy. All the better that it wanders like a stoner's mind. It makes it that much more silly and over the top. Heck, get stoned and try it. It was just fine sober. The acting was, quite honestly, top shelf for this kind of sideshow. Great stuff. Don't let the other over-analyzers with a need for \"Rob Zombie or bust\" horror scare you away. If this is for you, you will love it. And Michael Parks is amazing. Especially in his bit out in a cabin in the woods!"

This movie with mess with your head, yet make you to enjoy every second of it.\n\nKevin Smith is able to drag the viewer down into the twisted, satirical ride of faux horror-comedy, and estranged occult madness. He does this while simultaneously producing a work that can snag the mind of the viewer, and shove it into a boiling pot of surreal mental disturbance, only to take it back out and sugar coat it with beautiful humor, drama, and amounts of sarcastic tone.\n\nThe acting held by Justin Long was nothing short of an impressive surprise, casting forth rich humanizing emotion past his previously crude and apathetic self, as the mind of Wallace can be seen to deteriorate piece by piece through his torment. These factors are only amplified with the addition of Michael Park's outstanding performances. Himself being able to show Howard's intentions devolve, and have his dark past unfolded before the viewer in a sick concoction of memoir and nightmare.\n\nOverall, this movie is surprising, to say the least. I can guarantee you it is not perfect (and can also safely say you will not like yourself for watching it either). Yet, those flaws are highly outweighed by the obscure genius that lies in the ribald depths of this film's loudmouthed, contorted plot. From the raw characters, the tongue-in-cheek humor, the sickening effects, and almost completely convincing lore, Tusk is a revolting mind-game of b-horror that can't wait to drag you in."

It's not torture porn more is overly graphic but rather I found it to be a piece filled with irony and allegorical humor aimed at the overly egotistical audience that makes up America. If you can't see the genius in the irony in this film you need to watch it again and give Smith a break. It was a good movie, not a classic but I gave it an 8 to help balance out the IMDb score because it seems there's just a lot of crap talking haters on here. But really it was a solid 7.7. Entertaining, don't watch with the kids and take it for what it is. A good new age horror with a good production value, good acting and a great writer/director that is Kevin Smith."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am so incredibly happy that this world has a human being like Kevin freaking Smith. In a cinematic age polluted with writers telling uninspired stories and directors taking no risks in their filmmaking it's always so refreshing to see what old Kevin is up to. He's always been that filmmaker who makes the movies HE wants to make, so now that he's earned millions to put into ridiculous films that are part art and part excuse to hang out with your friends making a crazy ass movie, we get the traumatizing horror/comedy Tusk.\n\nTusk stars Justin Long as Wallace Bryton, a podcaster who goes to Canada to interview an old fisherman named Howard Howe who claims to have incredible seafaring stories to tell. However, Wallace gets more than he bargained for when he's abducted by Howe who reveals himself to be a fisherman with what must be a pretty great background in surgeon practice when he turns Wallace the human into Wallace the walrus. Yes, you read that right. A walrus. Tusk is a movie about Justin Long getting turned into a walrus by a crazy old Canadian man. It's at this point that you should know whether or not you want to see this movie, and if you share my taste for the twisted and deranged then you REALLY want to see this movie.\n\nTusk is essentially Kevin Smith's 102 minute long trolling of the film community. It's a big F-U to high brow comedy and \"sophisticated\" horror, and a slap in the face to typical B-movie fare, because of it's B-movie concept packed with great actors and excellent production value. But really Smith doesn't give a damn what you think of his film because he's busy laughing it up with his buddies who I'm positive had an incredible time making such an absurd film.\n\nIf you're at the level of success enjoyed by Smith then making this kind of a film is a win in every way. He's not trying to impress anyone here and obviously isn't trying to be taken seriously. And that approach to filmmaking definitely rubs off on the film itself because Tusk is an absolute blast. It's got all of the comedic brilliance that one expects from Kevin Smith dialogue, and it also brings you the joy of being able to watch such an impossibly bizarre concept actually play out on screen.\n\nThe blend of funny and disturbing works so well here, which is in part due to Smith's writing, and also because of the killer performance by Michael Parks who is one of the creepiest old men to ever grace the silver screen. Not only is Parks great but Justin Long surprisingly kills it as well. He's convincingly terrified for most of the movie and his walrus performance is...well... that's something you have to see for yourself. Tusk also has one of the most unexpectedly brilliant cameos I've seen in ages. So brilliant in fact I'm not going to tell you who it is. I will tell you that that performance is far better than Haley Joel Osment or Genesis Rodriguez who are good, but forgettable.\n\nThe great thing about Tusk is that there's so much twisted entertainment value and it's so disturbingly unique that all of its shortcomings become so forgivable. Tusk is certainly a movie wrought with issues, but it's nothing major enough to detract from how much fun it is. Smith's writing is mostly fantastic, but there are some scenes considerably weaker than others. It's also got some weird pacing issues going on, with some scenes playing out way too long, probably because Smith was just having too much fun watching his actors do what they do. I would have liked certain things to be cut down to allow more time for other more walrusy things to happen, but honestly I'm fairly certain there will never be another movie about a man turned into a walrus, so I am pretty damn satisfied with what I got to see in Tusk.\n\nThere's no two ways about it. I really did love this movie. The vomit-inducing terror that unfolds on screen has you laughing and cringing all at the same time. My stomach churns as my brain smiles, and honestly I wasn't asking for anything more. Admittedly I have some Kevin Smith bias as I'm a big fan of the fat-man's work, but even putting all bias aside I honestly believe that Tusk is a stroke of horrible, disgusting, hilarious genius."

The screenplay also by Kevin Smith is fresh and original which is something I haven't come across in a long time. The casting and acting are really good especially by Justin Long as the Pod caster and Michael Parks as the mysterious person to be interviewed: All in all I would u-give this five out of a possible five stars."

I recommend it to everyone I know that likes off beat movies, and it's one of my favorites in recent years.

Ultimately, he gets more than he bargained for and properly deserves. The fluctuation of characters are genius and pairs nicely with the striking imagery. Tusk is one of my favorite films, if not my favorite Kevin Smith film. Like any joke, once it gets taken too far, the consequences will find you. Body horror to the max and unnerving dialogue will have you asking for more or questioning why this film was made in the first place. Justin long, Michael Parks and Haley Joel-Osment give such an unforgettable performance that is edge of your seat. Lilly rose Depp, and Kevin Smith's own Harley Quinn Smith give a humorous display of acting that counteracts the atrocities that partake in the film. Once Johnny Depp shows up, the film is still on the edge of lunacy that still seems to work with the horror."

Sometimes i long in the mirror wishing.. hoping that one day i can be just like him. This movie is an emotional experience and did you know you can buy your very own tusk suit!!!

        "review_detailed_main": "With this movie, I won't hide it: it was the typical story of \"first hate, then love.\" It was a Sunday morning, about three years ago. I was browsing Wikipedia looking for interesting horror movie plots. And there it was. I read the plot. What? What is this? Wait, let me double-check. I did an internet search, and it happened. There were those damn images from the movie. What the heck is that? For heaven's sake, I'm used to horror and have seen disturbing things. If I hadn't READ the story, maybe I wouldn't have understood it right away. But unfortunately, I had. And damn it, my cursed curiosity. For three years, this movie remained on my \"blacklist\" alongside Human Centipede. You know those mental lists like, \"I can't handle watching this movie; it makes me sick just thinking about it\"? Well, this movie, along with Human Centipede, stayed on that list. I managed to watch Human Centipede. About a year ago. But Tusk, no. Not after those terrible images. And then, one fine day, I told myself: \"Why not? Come on, you can do it. At worst, just close your eyes. Come on, you had no problems with Human Centipede. How bad could it be?\" And I faced my destiny. I watched the movie in two separate sessions. Until halfway through. Then I continued two days later. I got this weight off my shoulders. The devil is not as black as he is painted, you know. In fact, I must say there's even a bit of humor. A strange humor, but it helps to lighten things up. Well, I won't lie to you; the first part of the movie was enough to give me weird dreams. I think I had them more than once. The problem is, and I struggle to admit it, but I like this movie. It's bizarre. Disturbing, but at the same time (unlike Human Centipede), completely surreal. It's strange, playful, a surreal comedy, but at the same time grotesque and dramatic, and partly also sad. The ending brought a tear to my eye. And then, when you've finished watching it, you say: What the heck did I just watch? And I knew exactly how it was going to end because I had researched it beforehand. And I had glimpsed those damn images. I wonder what it would be like to watch this movie without knowing anything about it. It's not easily forgotten. Recommendation: for those looking for something very unusual. But you need to be somewhat \"used to\" horror. But some people didn't like it anyway and found it stupid. Now it's among my favorites, and there it will stay forever."

Justin Long, in his first horror film since Jeepers Creepers, the great Michael Parks (R. I. P.), Haley Joel Osment (lol can this dude act like anyone other than himself? Jeeez), and..... JOHNNY DEPP! An un-accredited appearance by Johnny Depp.... AWESOME!\n\nThis is original af. Who would think to make a movie about a crazy walrus obsessed serial killer kidnapping a$$holes and turning them into walruses?? Kevin Smith would not be the person I choose. Not only that, but who would actually financially back it?! If you know about filmmaking then you know that it was produced by a great producer...... Nate Bolotin (XYZ Films), known for amazing films such as Mandy, Brawl in Cell Block 99, and The Raid: Redemption and The Raid 2.\n\nIf you want to watch a weird B horror movie with your girlfriend and leave her wondering wtf is going on....... this is it!"

I would give it 11 stars if I could. A must watch. If you like a mixture of suspense, horror and drama, this is the film for you. Tusk brings real life together with fantasy and Science Fiction. The make up and CGI is unparalleled. You cannot walk away from this movie without absolutely raving about it to your friends. I saw the reviews and found them to be incorrect. I almost didn't watch this movie. So glad I didn't listen to people who really don't know what a really good film is."

        "review_detailed_main": "A podcast host journeys to Canada to interview viral video 'star' Kill Bill Kid, but ends up following a lead to a mysterious man who has many tales to tell. This is wildly entertaining stuff. Justin Long is a little annoying as the said podcast host, but most of the rest of the cast are superb, particularly Michael Parks, who is superb as the mysterious tale-teller. As the film goes on it gets more and more twisted and progressively funnier. The one thing that really grated was the Canadian policeman character 'Guy Lapointe' who was just too daft and didn't fit with the rest of the film. I had no idea who the actor portraying him was while I was watching, but as it turned out to be Johnny Depp, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that he wasn't great. I would recommend that everybody watch this film. Some will hate it, but many will love it."
