The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.\n\nI never saw any of the \"Shades of Gray\" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.\n\nThe good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):\n\n\nShould you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.\n\nSo yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low."

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.\n\nThe actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like \"woo lets go buy some new clothes\". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like \"oh that's good she got away from him\". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????\n\nThe second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like \"Yeah fair enough\" and just sits down like this happens every day.\n\nOn top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like \"Posing, modelling\" faces and is not like \"Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help\". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?\n\nIt also relies heavily on \"Pop\" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like \"well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in\".\n\nI could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.\n\nBelieve it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.\n\nSo its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck."

Kind of a plot, but not really. More of a erotic fantasy. I love the 2 main characters together. They seemed to have great chemistry. It works. I speak for myself here, but I don't really like regular porn as it's very unrealistic. Yes as a female I will watch some of it, but I don't get turned on to the same things men do and I'm always searching for something that I really enjoy watching that doesn't annoy me with the whiny moans and money shots. At least something like this is a little more relatable and not so ridiculously fake (very little based on the \"plot\" but you know what I mean). It's a steamy fantasy movie. That's it. I read all 50 shades books and the movies were really awful. I was so disappointed. They should've gone all out. This movie, the sex scenes, especially the first one, were on point! As a chick, I'm into the erotic steamy sex scenes in movies and they're hard to find. Those turn me on more than porn. I like to see passion, love, sweat, etc. This movie shows that. I hope they plan to do the others in the series, which based on the ending, it appears they will since it's left open."

        "review_detailed_main": "A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot.\n\nI honestly think that the folks responsible for \"365 Days\" know they created an evil and dangerous film....and that was their intention. Sure, it's irresponsible to make a movie promoting kidnapping and sexual assault...and I cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is a good thing or that it would make a good movie. No, I think the filmmakers knew the film would get a lot of hate and anger...and as a result, it would get a lot of attention. In other words, if you can't make a good film to get attention, make a terrible one to get attention. And, not surprisingly, this film has earned a spot on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List.\n\nSo is the film good in any way? The plot that is pro-rape and pro-kidnapping certainly isn't good. Technically speaking, the film also has a few issues.....though it is slick and 'hip' much of the time. While they do a lot of gimmicky cinematographic techniques to make the movie look good, it also often falls back on the tired use of the shaky cam. Additionally, the film turns out to be disappointing even as pornography, as you really don't get much enjoyment or sexual energy from most of the picture. You'd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner! Overall, a smarmy little picture...one that unfortunately DID get the negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive to this world and is rather boring.\n\nIn real life, I am trying to imagine an offender in court telling the judge \"I was just doing what I saw them doing in \"365 Days\"...is that so wrong?!\"....and promptly being sentenced to 104 years in prison!"

Couldn't they at least made it clearer how much time has passed, because half the time I have no idea if it's been week or five months. It does feel like a year, that's for sure."

He is immediately smitten by her and kidnaps her, takes her back to his estate and holds her captive. He gives her 365 days to fall in love with him.\n\nIncredibly bad: weak story, dull and wafer-thin plot. Doesn't work on any level.\n\nNot sure who the target audience is. If you want a good story, there isn't much of a plot. If you want a good gangster/crime drama, that element takes up maybe 5-10% of the movie. If you want a romantic drama: what part of a woman being kidnapped by a knuckle-headed hoodlum and yet somehow falling in love with him is romantic, or even plausible? If you want an erotic drama, this will only work if you're a teenager and/or you don't have access to the internet.\n\nI assume this was made to cash in on the inexplicable success of Fifty Shades of Grey. On that note, as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey is, 365 Days makes that look like a masterpiece."

If that was the case, all the movies in netflix should show only positive movies ( movies based on robbery, killings,psycho thriller etc shouldn't be showed). I get it. Movies can influence ppl.\n\nDont watch this movie if you dont like watching too much of nude scenes. Lot of it was spoken in polish and without any subtitles. Its sad that movies are released without much english subtitles. I was able to see the movie with 50% english subtitles. Couldnt understand the whole story.\n\nBut, from what i understood and the acting by the male and female character, movie was nice.

        "review_detailed_main": "The overall rating on this movie is quite misleading, and that's disappointing. Hence the reason for my 10/10. It probably deserves more of 6/10 or so.\n\n365 dni is not to be Oscar worthy. It wasn't made to be the best dramatic film either. It is EROTICA. All these horrible reviews on acting, explicit sex, fetish's, no plot, and etc. Disappointing if you expected something different than the great erotica it is. The movie photo alone allures to more.\n\n365 dni is aspects of movies more on the lines of Wild Orchid, Secretary, Henry & June, Killing Me Softly, Delta of Venus, 9 1/2 Weeks, Red Shoe Diaries, and yes even 50 Shades. ASPECTS though, not entire scenes. Move along if you're not here to view erotica and forgo your inaccurate reviews, please.\n\nAlthough technically the lead male, Mossimo kidnaps lead female, Laura, there's more to it. Those crying #MeToo or Stockholm, maybe pay attention to the lead male character, Mossimo, as there's more. Sex only comes into play about halfway in. The only body parts shown are buttocks and breasts. However, it's very sensual and there is indeed build up, showing we didn't need full nudity to enjoy (but might be nice). Yes, there are oral scenes with proper sounds, but again, parts are not truly shown. You must use your imagination, which is fine and works well in this movie.\n\nThe movie begins on a rooftop. A meeting between Mossimo's father and two men. Mossimo is there (along with guards), but sees a beautiful, smiling, dancing, happy female through binoculars. I won't list any spoilers. There are three languages spoken (Polish, Italian, and English). My subtitles only captured the Italian and I understood the English. I missed out on the Polish conversations, which was a bummer, but not too many scenes (maybe 4). There is death (2 count), there is the chance sighting, there is beautiful scenery, there is wealth, there is the chance finding, there is murder, there is drugs (one scene), there is teasing, there is sex, there is pleasure, and there is love. Sure, there could have been more building between the two main characters, but that didn't make this a bad movie. Sure, there's aspects in the flick that are never fully explained, but again, it's erotica and didn't make this a bad movie. Yes, there's a spreader bar, chains, and fasteners, but this doesn't make it a fetish film.\n\nTo each their own. Only you, the viewer can be the judge, but you must be open minded and enjoy erotica to enjoy this movie. As for me, I'll watch it again and be happy with it. Thank you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Somewhere on a rooftop by the sea some mobsters are conducting some deal. Because it involves human trafficking, the one side is reluctant. One guy is watching a girl on the beach when his father goes to talk to him. The father is then shot. Now the son, Massimo inherits the mob clan.\n\nSome attractive executive named Laura is working on a deal. She's in a relationship with some guy way below her league. For her birthday they go with another couple to Italy. There she runs into Massimo, who then kidnaps her. Turns out she was to girl on the beach years ago. I wouldn't have known, we only get a split-second view of her on the beach. But he became obsessed with her and made it his mission to find her and make her his. He offers her a \"deal.\" He'll keep her for 365 days during which he'll try to make her fall in love with him. If he fails, she's free to go and he won't force her to do anything against her will.\n\nEven though this guy lives in a castle for crying out loud, Laura is downright hostile for a while. She gets to have everything she wants but insists on escaping. Eventually he lets her make a phone call. He makes the mistake of taking her to party where she off course overtly starts flirting with guys. That drives Massimo crazy and he attacks one guy...who happens to be from a rival mafia. This will come back to haunt them.\n\nHe's not particularly adept at romantic seduction, he's more interested in sexual seduction and surprisingly succeeds in making her fall first in lust with him. Eventually in love as well. And they establish a sort of normal relationship, except that no one can know what he does for a living. They even go so far as plan a wedding but that's when his occupation becomes an issue.\n\nEven though there's a quite a bit of story here, the focus is more carnal. There's not shortage of sex involving mostly this one couple. The sex scenes are rather odd. Yes, they are strong in a way, but I found them a bit clean and sterile in how they where filmed. They are also filmed more for a female audience. Anna Maria Sieklucka is both lovely and hot. Not in a bombshell way but more in a stunning girl-next-door way.\n\n365 days is a strong erotic romance drama for adults. As such it's a relatively good movie. American audiences are of course not familiar with movies about sex that aren't porn or gateways to bdsm or offensive comedies, hence the poor reviews and the absurd low score here. But this genre of slightly erotic non-porn movies with varying degrees of explicitness where vanilla sex is the main theme has been around in Europe for decades. 365 Days is a just recent and successful example. Hopefully it will begin break the link that the porn industry has established in the American mind that sex + film = necessarily porn. So I applaud the intention of this movie. Perhaps it's success will give rise to more movies of its kind."

If this movie was this good, I can't wait for the books to be published in English. Polish people went all in. Now, it's not exactly like 50 shades, but it's the same principal: cat and mouse game. I know people are confused on why people and women in particular love this movie. It's a fantasy, yes, it's not real, we know that, but that doesn't matter. It's a safe fantasy in our minds because it's in a movie and not real. Michele who plays Mossimo does an amazing job, better than Jamie did with Christian Gray. He fits the role to a tee.\n\nAs for the ending, this is part of a trilogy. Once people understand that, the ending makes sense. It's not over and I CAN NOT wait for #2.\n\nAt the end of this day, this movie is not meant to win awards. It's meant to be a feel good movie and it gives millions of women all over the world, the feels and it hits the mark. Especially since we are in quarantine, we need a movie that takes us away.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't understand this movie, they don't understand erotic fantasy. This movie is not for everyone! But it is for millions of people all over the world!"

And nothing is a \"copycat\" to 50 shades, as a lot of old erotica novels have similar storyline's. This movie is just an erotica novel coming to film. The sex scenes are that of the books my grandma even read and handed down to me! The story line did make sense, however the back story wasn't supposed to be the focus. The film was about desire, passion and sex. That's it. Erotica novels are cheesy with some cringe story lines but the sex scenes are hot! And this is what this movie really is. The adult film industry is the largest in the world and believe it or not this type of fantasy is actually very common. Of course it's not wanted in real life that's why it's a fantasy. The woman's sexuality actually had all the power and what is wrong with that? Don't over think the \"captive\" part. It's just a plot to build competitive desire between the characters."

A movie isn't about the thrill. It's not about filters and fancy clothes, being spoilt as a woman and loaded as a man. No actually that actually is all this is. Netflix throws this at us because of the demands to please the audience with this sort of thing. Any pathetic, girl power, snap chat fish for likes love myself type of person will adore this. As too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual. Point blank doesn't matter how disgusting the male lead is, how bad the story or dialogue, how bad the female leads acting is, it's all about what is pleasing on the eye. That's why a Netflix original cannot be trusted or half of the reviews left by these so called adults. Many of whom are probably underage by the way or only care about a good time and no doubt have everything easy. This isn't about an escape and it's not about putting yourself in the polish girls shoes, or underpants, it's about what is wrong with the every day person these days and how so long as they're enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters. Shame. A woeful woeful film.\n\nNeed to be in one of my clubs in two hours? Ha ha. Cringe. Just shut up."

It feels like she was hired just because she is attractive and was willing to do things that maybe other performers wouldn't be. Her character is laughably bad and has no depth to her at all, she is so weak and you really wonder why you should care about her in the film. Then there is the main guy who is probably even worse, he is so aggressive towards her and unlikeable, the fact that these two people would have any type of relationship is absurd and is hard to watch as it is all the film gives to you.\n\nSupporting Characters There are literally no interesting supporting characters, it is all the stereotypes you would expect. The ex partners of both people, the crazy bestfriend and the old school gangster but none of them are performed well at all and you are given no reason to care.\n\nStory There is a slightly interesting premise here but it requires good acting and good storytelling which this film has neither. The two leads have no chemistry together and actually their relationship is pretty abusive and really hard to root for even though the film tries to make you. There are some generic side plots that are there to pad out the film and play no part of the main plot, plus the ending is awful with no explanation at all.\n\nScript The script is shocking, the dialogue is truly laughable, there is no hu,our and no drama which makes the film even worse then it should be.\n\nStyle The film's style mainly focuses on it's sex scenes and yeah they are well done but honestly it is not worth the time, you can find things on the internet that is the same and quicker to watch. This film forgets what it is, it goes on for two hours which is way too long and makes this film feel longer then it has any right to be.\n\nOverall Overall, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, this film is there for it's sex but the rest of them film has the porn level of acting and storytelling that comes with it making it a truly awful film.\n\nRating - 1/10."

They only sell you the physique. Pretentious Explicit sexual scenes, in fact it is the only resource that the film uses, that and eroticism. The story's arguments don't make much sense. Since when did violence, crime, kidnapping, misogyny and gender violence become something romantic? Pathetic how a kidnapped person reacts. This closely resembles 50 Shades of Gray as it uses the same misogynous resources. The ending is the only thing that does the film justice."

Though mouths are being used for things here, that will be quite appalling to some. You don't even have to be a prude to feel this goes a bit too far. This is quite the understatement to be honest, because it is quite explicit.\n\nWhile I didn't freeze frame, you can clearly see a (plastic) penis in many shots. So if that already is shocking and feels a bit too much ... maybe this isn't for you. The shock value aside though, because while most already have mentioned and are aware of the 50 shades of grey connection, many have not mentioned or connected this with the Beauty and the Beast story. It is there, even the time frame, how long she has to fall in love and all that. There is no witch with a curse, but there is an inciting incident at the beginning of the movie, that completely breaks our character.\n\nThis broken strong man (alpha male) type thing draws a certain female fantasy and type in. So while I think a lot are unfair to demean this because of its story, the real flaws lie in the script and the very weak performances. As a mixture of two movies this is fine actually. If the script would have had some tweaks to it, I might even have considered it better than 50 shades (you can hate me now), especially because of the B&B injection - and because it actually dares to go some extra miles (didn't even have to be as explicit).\n\nSo in conclusion, not your typical love story in any stretch of the imagination (and not much imagination needed anyway) ..."

I personally am glad that these films are being made. Even when it's met with so much criticism - that is always to be expected because it's one step closer to more fysical, visual and mental freedom.\n\nKeep it light. It's a Great movie for a girls night... and not made for heavy discussions. The kidnapping storyline is not new - and often used in other genres. This time it's used for creating intimacy. And there is no force in de ssc - safe / sane and consensual intimate acts that are the basis for the developing relationship. And keep in mind there are a lot of fantasies about being whisked away by a handsome stranger who lives in the lap of luxury and who wants to woo his love intrest. And that is wat this is - a fantasy... wich you are watching as a voyeur. Real life is cruel enough, so these fantasies story's have a place to exist on it own as guilty pleasures.\n\nAbout the critics... in the horror genre are more shocking visuals and worse storylines. But everyone knows what they are going to watch. So is it with this story. Don't hate what you can expect is coming. The haters don't appreciate the effort en artistry that has been put in this movie. And that is the only valid parallel with 50 Shades - what had a virgin and a beautiful control freak. This is about a handsome bad boy and a strong girl. So I prefer this storyline more..."

Lots of sex in different positions and fancy location like a typical paperback romance novella. It's rated R for the ample showing of boobs, but not quite NC-17.\n\nIt doesn't have much of a story to be completely honest. It is mostly erotica so comparing it against any other soft-porn film will make it fare badly. The top boss gets wacked almost taking the bosses' son along with him. But son takes over the family business and becomes obsessed with a very pretty Polish girl.\n\nNo mob business ever gets conducted in the film so don't expect a Martin Scorsese mob drama. It's mostly an eye-candy romance with good looking actors but little acting skill. Watch it as a fun movie without great expectations. I am not going to rate it a 1/10 even though I can see why some would. I enjoyed the eye candy.\n\nIf the poster interest you and you want to watch some eye-candy, its not bad.

There are obvious parallels between this film and the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, but 365 Days makes the Fifty Shades movies seem like Oscar-winning, cinematic genius. Yes 365 Days is that bad. Even if you're able to look past the film trying to pass rape and sexual assualt as 'romance', or the portrayal of women as mindless, gold-digging bimbos, or the painfully stereotypical hot Italian gangster, it's hard to look past the terrible acting, plot, and ending. This film is equivalent to a car crash, but let's face it. No one is watching this for the story."

How many polish movies got this kind of attention? If your are someone who gets offended by watching two attractive, beautiful actors get naked and perform sex scenes on screen, it would not be a problem for you to find an American alternative in last ten years; Hollywood movies which pretend sex does not exist, actors whom keep their clothes on for a sex scene or directors who have to shoot actors in a way that audience wouldn't be able to see anything during love scenes. I would like to congratulate all cast and crew on this success, especially Barbara Bialowas for her courage as an emerging, young director who didn't let restrictions ruin her movie. Although she has to improve in future projects but she managed to make one of the most successful polish movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was given an offer I couldn't refuse when my littlest brother \"pitched\" 365 Days, insisting that the Fifty Shades of Grey films will seem \"f-cking amazing\" by comparison. You can't achieve this, I thought, unless satirizing the format, but even if the film in question is laughable, that is because it's entirely serious.\n\nI could end things here if I were more dismissive of inept cinema. The thing is, though, that movies like 365 Days are of greater psychoanalytical interest than most media, especially in the climate that surrounds contemporary courtship and that which men are said to be collectively guilty of. Much like the Fifty Shades trilogy, this is a movie I desperately need to see remade.\n\nWhy would I want to see this movie again, you ask? It's very simple. It is because this film, like Fifty Shades, does have a fanbase, and I am so endlessly curious as to how these people (mostly female, middle-aged, and amidst various crises) respond to the material if we pull a Michael Haneke and remake these movies exactly the same way - scene-for-scene, shot-for-shot, each inane line left intact - except the powerful, dominant male of the central romance is replaced by a Kevin Spacey or a Harvey Weinstein analog; a closer resemblance to how these scenarios may pan out in reality.\n\nHow would the fangirls feel about this kind of story, in terms of its purported sexiness and mystique, if it better resembled the real-life counterpart? Better yet, would it turn a knob in their brains that finally made them look inward and think about what this signals to the abusers of the world?\n\nWhat exactly are they communicating with their love toward this kinda content? What does it look like they're into? If they want to improve/change the way that men are societally taught to approach women, is it easier for them to understand how \"I want my own Christian Grey or Massimo\" isn't helping if we show them what Christian Greys and Massimos actually look like (and where they can find them, if they're serious in their pursuit)? Is the present state of things, I query with complete honesty, squarely on the dick-owners?\n\nI think I got ahead of myself by asking these questions straight away. Who exactly is this Massimo? Well, he's a Sicilian mafioso (played, fortunately, by a photogenic hunk named Michele Morrone) who abducts an unwitting Anna-Maria Sieklucka and explains that she must fall for him within 365 days if she is to regain freedom.\n\nEssentially, some Polish author gravely misunderstood Beauty and the Beast and decided that something as nightmarish as this would be equivalent, plus the oh so daring sex scenes. The consolation is that Massimo agrees not to touch Laura, as the character is named, without clear consent. We all wish we could be imprisoned for months on end by someone so thoughtful. I've seen more romantic things in my stool.\n\nSo, is this indeed worse than Fifty Shades of Grey? On one hand, it is categorically more original than \"glorified Twilight Saga fan fiction\" and it may not be quite as dangerous as young women aren't as likely to go after mafia hunks as they are to end up in a Christian Grey scenario (albeit with more of a Weinstein type in the role). On the other hand, who has time to learn Polish?\n\nAnd before anyone starts: I get it. I get that we all have our weird fantasies that don't strictly adhere to what we desire for realsies (hence my terabytes worth of \"Bugs Bunny on Daffy\" fan-art don't prove my sincere dating preferences). I preemptively agree with your counter that \"this is just a movie, bro\". But sometimes it isn't \"just a movie\". Ask yourself whose fault that is."

So just because the guy is hot that gives them an excuse to force a person against their will to fall in love with them? Disgusting. Is this what we're trying to teach people today? That stalking and harassing people is the best way to enter a relationship? This Massimo character has all of the appeal of Harvey Weinstein and Ted Bundy in one. It's creepy but true. He makes Christian Grey from Fifty Shades lool like a good boyfriend. That is NOT good. I felt my soul die everytime he said \"Are you lost baby gUrL?\"\n\nNetflix needs to just stop with these Wattpad fanfiction stories. They're AWFUL!

        "review_detailed_main": "The extraordinary bodies of Michele Morrone and Anna Maria Sieklucka are perhaps the only forces that drive the ludicrous and somewhat silly \"365 Days\", the Polish production that generated such a hot buzz it ended in the Top 10 Netflix to-watch films.\n\nI confess my male crush: the man, Massimo, is a towering and tanned Latin hunk with finely-traced abs and looks like he's always posing for a Giorgio Armani ad, the woman, Laura, has the kind of gorgeous face and tantalizing body that provoke an immediate urge for possession. Only a fool would have a woman like Laura and make no effort to keep her... only a fool woman wouldn't surrender to Massimo's charm.\n\nBut only a fool script would have a man like Massimo kidnap a woman like Laura and sequestrate her in a heavenly remote island and give her 365 days to love him... in fact, only a fool script would have Massimo say \"you have 365 days\" whoever says \"365 days?\" isn't saying \"one year\" a simpler formulation? What if it's a bissextile year (like 2020), are you willing to sacrifice the possibility to have her love you at the last minute? Or is \"365 days\" only a figure of speech and Massimo knew damn well it wouldn't take so long? Anyway, when he said \"365 days\" I could swear I head the voice from \"CinemaSins\" saying \"Title Drop\".\n\nSo Massimo takes Laura in his dungeon of wealth, luxuriance and... weird sexual practices, he promises not to hurt her, to let her go shopping but she's his prisoner before becoming his lover. All we know about the two is that Massimo is some kind of Mafia member who instantly fell in love with Laura and Laura is a tough businesswoman with a husband who doesn't know how lucky he is. Massimo had his father killed in front of him and Laura is in need. Massimo as a man of possession and Laura as a woman in desire of possession.\n\nThe expositional part goes even further, it also shows Massimo forcing a flight attendant to make him happy, she's reluctant at first but at the end, she's smiling. What we have in that scene is the film in microcosm, Massimo is the new Leo, what we want, he gets, and apparently, the director is stingy on shocking moments that would normally be followed by instant uproars and calls for censorhip in these post-Weinstein days. Seems that the confinement context helped a little. The problem with \"365 Days\" is that the film tries too hard to make a sensation: so many scenes are filled with useless pop music that we're not left one instant with an opportunity to get into the depths of these characters, basically, they're all characterized by their needs.\n\nIt's a sort of psychological arm-wrestling that would be fine if the film wasn't just going up and down between moments where both go along and others where violence ensues. The film intelligently avoids the point of no return, Massimo never treats Laura like the fligth attendant but then again, it doesn't play fair with its own premise. If days are numbered, how come we never know how many days have passed? How come Laura seems quickly aroused by Massimo? Why couldn't she go through the different stages: fear, anger, hunger strikes, you know the drift.\n\nThe reason is because the film's sole purpose is to show sex scenes as heated and torrid as the sun we were missing during the confinement, I guess people were in need of that. The film doesn't care much for the feelings as long as they can be expressed within the spectrum of sexual desire: anger is physical need, defiance is sexual tension, gentlness is a preliminary, joy is orgasm etc. What's left at the end is something silly but also unpleasant in the sense that we never exactly understand why Laura surrenders to Massimo: is it Stockholm syndrome? Is it his looks? Or is it because he's stinking rich?\n\nBut I dare not torture myself with such questions because ultimately, it unveils the biggest flaw of the film which is the premise. Was Laura that hard to get to begin with? Couldn't Massimo just attract her attention? Court her? Didn't he have enough to offer instead of entrapping her in his gilded cage? Did it have to be so damn complicated? Laura was already an unsatisfied wife... The 'kidnapping' part doesn't work because it's a wrong premise but because it's treated like a gimmick, a word to put on the summary and allow the film to have its little edge other over soft core productions, this is what it's all about, and when it culminates with the long-awaited sex scene, I was aroused but didn't feel rewarde I thought \"it was about time\".\n\nIf you take off the sex material and the awful pop music, there's nothing left from the film... it's dry empty... but near the end the film got more interesting, Laura was given back her freedom and went to her home and met Massimo again, she confronted him, threw her anger at him and then I was following the scene with full attention, finally, a scene with depth, with true emotions, something totally unrelated to body fluids but no it had to switch to a sort of angry sex scene with (you get it) an awful pop music... that's when I abandoned any hope for this film.\n\nI take \"365 Days\" at face value as a little more elaborate soft core film with a silly script, and two gorgeous bodies... a wannabe \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", which isn't saying much."

The film manages to mask some of this with homages to another erotic drama \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" however it's lack of substance and creative authenticity by part of the director is fully evident. If you're looking to get a quick pull & tug, by all means knock yourself out...but this film by no means manages to add anything new, exciting or imaginative to a genre that is rich with higher quality narratives which have already shown how this type of film should be done. If you'd like to see those, I suggest the following - Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, Basic Instinct, Body Heat, Fatal Attraction, Single White Female. What mad Almodovar's film unique amongst this group and its predecessors, was his inversion of the gender roles, with the male playing the femme fatal role and the woman playing the unwitting object of their affection. However, in this click bait era of over promising and under delivering this film sits right at home."

The whole plot was a complete mess, the script was poorly written, most of it was just \"baby girl\". The wattpad stories that are written from 13 years old are more interesting.

They have most illogical music videos, one second they'll be fighting, and then the other, their riding in their car and there will be some happy song playing. This reminds me of the movie, After, just filled with abusive relationships and unnecessary plot twists. It's indescribable, the movie is just indescribable, what is actually going on? The direction makes me nauseous. It's the fact that Anne-Maria Sieklucka (Laura Biel) keeps trying to do a seductive voice, even though it just feels like she's whispering, it's cringe."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film essentially begins on the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa with the head of an organized crime family declining an agreement involving sex trafficking. When he then turns to have a conversation with his son, a bullet rips through his chest which kills him immediately. It also seriously injures his son \"Massimo Torricelli\" (Michele Morrone). The scene then shifts to five years later with a meeting being held with an investment firm in which Massimo is being told that he has lost a substantial sum of money. However, rather than simply accepting these losses he allows his attractive colleague \"Anna\" (Natasza Urbanska) to change the subject which then allows Massimo to present some scandalous information involving members of the firm which puts all of them at a considerable disadvantage. That being said, they immediately agree to cover all of Massimo's losses and the meeting is quickly adjourned. Not long afterward, Massimo sees a beautiful woman by the name of \"Laura Biel\" (Anna Maria Sieklucka) and becomes determined to have her at all costs. To that end, he has her kidnapped and brought to his sizeable mansion where he tells her that she will be his prisoner for one full year and if she doesn't love him by then she will be given her freedom. What he doesn't realize, however, is that Laura has a mind of her own and knows exactly how to manipulate men to get what she wants. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film should have been much better if it had even a minimum amount of competent direction. Unfortunately, that was not the case as the directors (Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes) were clearly over the heads and failed miserably in that regard as they saturated the film with one musical number after another. Now, I understand having a musical score at the very beginning of the movie and one at the very end. That's natural. But not every 5 or 10 minutes! To further illustrate, there were a number of sex scenes--which apparently required music in all of them. Likewise, there were dancing scenes. And more music. There were romantic scenes. And more music. There were also shopping scenes. With more music. And talking scenes. With more music. Ad nauseum. But everything seemed so artificial because there was absolutely no chemistry between the main actors. Neither was there any real drama or suspense. Having said all of that, I completely understand why both of the directors won the Razzie Award for \"Worst Screenplay.\" I also totally understand why both of them were nominated for a Razzie Award for \"Worst Direction.\" What I disagree with, however, are the Razzie Award nominations for \"Worst Actor\" and \"Worst Actress\" on the part of Michele Morrone and Anna Maria Sieklucka, respectfully. In my opinion, they did the best with what they had to work with and I don't think it's fair to criticize either of them in that regard. Be that as it may, the sad fact is that this was not a good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

        "review_detailed_main": "This whole movie explains what happens when two psychos are in a psychotic relationship (this is not a romantic normal relationship this is just complete example of 2 people who are not normal/ in reality and have Flack up minds). They are not in a toxic relationship but rather in a psychotic mentally ill toxic relationship. The writer Blanka Lipinska is obviously not in the right mind , she thinks that the love between Laura and Massimo is ok/perfectly normal. Just because she thinks that does not mean it is normal/right /ok. This type of so called love (the romance between Laura and Massimo) is not even called love/romance, but instead it is called how to be in a psychotic abusive mentally tortured relationship and be a psycho (obviously). This movie ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE and LACKS A LOT OF COMMON SENSE . It is so unrealistic (the sex scenes are simulated as well). Whatever happened to Laura in this movie is very bad/ sad (Massimo enjoys mentally torturing Laura even more than she already was before and he loves to take a sexual advantage of her because of her Stockholm syndrome ; Massimo literally sees Laura as a sex toy that he is obsessed about not truly likes). If you think whatever was happening between Massimo and Laura was so called hot, romantic and also sexy (there is no difference between you and the writer). Blanka Lipinska showed the audience how desperate she is to be sexually/mentally abused by a so called Mafia (maybe she should go to Italy there is a lot of them there to give her the taste of her abnormal book/movie). Blanka Lipinska is also just mentally not in the right mind she really needs to get her mind checked out ; she is psychologically/medically not ok. This movie is a perfect example of objectification towards women and how the author/writer loves to make art that expresses how to abuse women / treat them like wild animals or sex toys. Blanka thinks that the love between Massimo and Laura is perfectly normal where Massimo spits in her private places (that is so disgusting and absolutely psychologically abnormal) she really needs to get her mental health checked out . I am surprised how she did not end up in the mental hospital yet. The writer also showed how desperate she is to loose her virginity and is fine with being sexually abused/used as a sexual toy (because she never got anyone who actually loved her for her #insecurities). I can not believe that the Poland writer can drop down so low just for profit."

This movie is a perfect exemplification of a lot of real behaviors in the old Europe, yes, from my experience - even if I assume the book/scenario is fiction - the inspiration was on real facts/desires/behaviors.\n\nYou do not like it? For comparison, watch Lauren Bacall with Humphrey Bogart in \"To Have and Have Not\" 1944 and compare the sexual tension, femme fatale archetype and the \"game\" with the same from this movie. If you are not convinced then continue with \"The Big Sleep\" 1946, \"Dark Passage\" 1947 and \"Key Largo\" 1948. Then take a look at the more modern one, like \"Basic Instinct\" and ask yourself if is a problem with this movie or with yourself. If you are a man, ask the woman near you what she loves, hates and get arouse from these stories/archetypes - then draw your own conclusions. If you are a woman and the man near you needs some guidance maybe you can learn a few tricks and help your man to become a better one for you.\n\nWatch this movie to learn about seduction, power of a strong woman, respect to a woman, love, passion, the price you pay when you go too far, respect of a woman for a man and the passion of a man for a woman - more about the pain and the suffer but also about the victory of conquer and love and be loved.\n\nIn this movie is so much psychology and human behavior than I asked myself who wrote this? from wikipedia: \"Lipinska worked as a therapist-hypnotist. She enjoys sports and fitness as well as sailing.\" Do you need more to understand from where all of this is coming?\n\nIn these times, in Anno Domini 2020, such a movie cannot be done anymore in USA, not even in France or UK. It has been done in Poland, please ask yourself why? This is a painful lesson than we need to pass to our children!\n\nHave fun and enjoy life!"

It literally says \"abducted, kidnapped\" Now I will agree with the plot issues, there are so many holes in it, but maybe thats how it's supposed to be. In my opinion, I want a fuller story. We never actually find out a lot of things, and they make introductions of characters and then never backtrack to them or include them anywhere. Another thing I saw was someone complained about how the English was barely understood here. From my point of view, if someone does not speak English as a first language, they don't usually speak it correctly. Nowhere did it say or even hint that these characters were well versed in English, and I think it adds to the plot and their character that they don't speak it perfectly.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with this but I would loooove to watch the same movie with more detail, or a sequel or something."

The way people react to certain situations is ridiculous, there's one point where the girl falls off a boat into the water so the guy jumps in after her, they are literally in there for a few seconds and he acts like she nearly died! The film could have been so much better and I don't know if it's the acting or directing or just a mixture of both. Both leads are decent to look at but that's about it. Watch if you want a laugh."

The entire movie felt like an intro to a hardcore porno, then you get cucked before you see anything. Never in my life have I endured something as painful as watching this movie. It's a movie based on a rape fantasy. There was not the slightest bit of this movie I enjoyed, besides the occasional times this light hardcore porno showed a nipple.

Should have bailed 15-20 minutes into this thing. Can't believe it has been in the Netflix top 10 for so long. One line we'll never forget from this movie, \"Do you want to touch it\". Don't touch this movie if want a meaningful 2 hours of your life. Top 3 worst movie we've ever watched."

It was not expected to be the best, however what I have seen did not rise to the least of my incredibly low expectations. What's bothering me most is that this movie was supposed to be polish verion of Grey and it turned out to be a cheaper version of Bounty ads. Too much explicit sex, no real bond and depth between main characters, no viable motivies behind characters' actions- these are only a few of so many sins that have been commited. This movie is outrageously bad. The very first impression that came to my mind after seeing it was that everything was so forced and artifical. Now I know that it's not even the movie itself, but the plot behind it that made it so incredibly unamusing. Final thoughts? Go see Grey if you enjoy erotic and romantic genre, cause this movie is definitely not worth it."

This movie is made to fullfill a fantasy. It is made for the women who enjoy it. If it's not your cup of tea just move along."

It wasn't half bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "365 Days (Polish: 365 Dni) is a 2020 Polish erotic romantic drama film directed by Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes. It is based on the first novel of a trilogy written by Blanka Lipinska. The plot follows a young Warsaw woman in a spiritless relationship falling for a dominant Sicilian man who imprisons her and grants 365 days to fall in love with him.\n\nThe film stars Anna-Maria Sieklucka as Laura Biel and Michele Morrone as Massimo Torricelli. The film was released theatrically in Poland on February 7th 2020 and was later made available on Netflix, quickly gaining global popularity and widespread recognition.\n\nI didn't initially intend on watching this film until it spent over two weeks in the Top 10 on Netflix in the United Kingdom. This film is by no means high art but it's undeniably entertaining, I didn't take my eyes off the screen for the whole runtime. I know I shouldn't of liked it as much as I did looking at the other reviews but this film is pure escapism with beautiful cinematography - if the Fast & Furious films can do the exact same for men and be praised why can't films like like this?"

I have to give to actors; they were truly committed to it. They made the movie enjoyable even with its blatant mindless Stockholm syndrome plot. It gives 100% more satisfaction than the 50 Shades trilogy.\n\nAnna Maria Sieklucka is stunning; she reminded me a lot of Turkish renowned female actress Beren Saat from Ask-i Memnu (Forbidden Love). It's a good time-pass for people looking for some Netflix and more Chill!!!"
