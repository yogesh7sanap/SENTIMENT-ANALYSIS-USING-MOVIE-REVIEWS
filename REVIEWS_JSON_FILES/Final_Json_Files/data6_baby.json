And that second half will glue you to your seat! Such a thrill, such a tension,the effort put by director is so brilliant that you will feel like cheering up. None of the characters are wasted. Everyone has a important part to play in. The acting is superb. Everyone, and I mean literally everyone has acted so well that sometime you feel like you are not even watching a movie. Anyone who loves watching Bollywood movies, should not miss this classic. It's a classic, a masterpiece and kind of movie that is made once in a decade. Simply stating it, Its one of the finest movie ever made in Bollywood."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it's just not for you.\n\nAkshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.\n\nMOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duo\n\nOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies. And regarding the negative reviews, just do not pay any heed to them, for THIS GEM IS NOT TO BE MISSED. Neeraj Pandey as a director has done a brilliant job."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.\n\nComing on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.\n\nTalking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.\n\nDirector Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.\n\nIt has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.\n\nOverall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.\n\nI have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5."

And needless to say, one of plus points of the movie is Akshay Kumar's acting as an authentic security officer. Taapsee is a delight to watch. Rana Daggubati's acting is also very good and has done a very good job as another security officer. The storyline and the plot are new and refreshing which highly complements the movie. The songs are good and matches well with the movie without boring or torturing the audience. If you liked the songs in Neeraj Pandey's previous movie \"Special 26\", then you are sure to like this too, actually the songs are even more good in Baby. And, needless to tell about \"Neeraj Pandey\", the director who has given us epics like \"A Wednesday\" and \"Special 26\". He has just proved his mettle yet again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a movie buff and watch almost every movie. Last time, I was so excited about a movie was when I saw Ugly! Talking about Neeraj Pandey, I'm among those very people who didn't find the climax of Special Chabbees exciting. In fact, I was able to guess the finale long before it started. And so for me, the finale was the weakest link in Special Chhabees. For A Wednesday, it was a great thriller from start till end.\n\nNow coming to the Baby! The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.\n\nKudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.\n\nAkshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough!\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Will definitely see again on Silver Screen, too! Urge you all to watch this movie if you really want a fast paced Indian thriller."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering all the movies Akshay Kumar has worked on in the past few years, I think Baby turned out to be a way better movie than what I expected. There were some scenes where my reaction was like \"what? why would you even do that?!\" or \"that's not even possible!!\", but then there's Akshay Kumar for you and it is definitely entertaining. Anupam Kher also added some humor to the movie, being the amazing artist that he has always been. The manner in which they've shown how terrorists plot and plan their moves and how they maintain secrecy is actually very intriguing. I wouldn't say that the intense scenes in the movie were nail-biting, but Neeraj Pandey did squeeze in a few such scenes in the movie where you wonder what's coming next. Some of the explosions in the movie were animated and the quality of animation was terrible. For those 2-3 minutes, I did wish they had spent a little more money and time on getting the visualizations correct. However, overall, I enjoyed the movie and I think is good entertainment for a one-time-watch. I definitely recommend this movie."

Full marks to Producer Bhushan Kumar for believing in such a landmark film, backed by exceptional marketing especially when it's devoid of songs. On the whole, BABY is one of the finest films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Not only because of its excellent cinematic credentials but also because of the balanced 'Thought' behind the film. Neeraj Pandey once again proves that he's a genius. This time he proves, it's possible to better Perfection. We say, hey baby, don't think, just go for BABY. Cinema at its very best!"

Bollywood rarely produces movies nowadays that are watchable, and in between comes this gem of a movie. The first half of the movie is good. However the real plot comes into play in the second half. The last 45-50 minutes of the the movie were so engaging that I could not remove my eyes from the theater screen. And the biggest merit of the film is the fact that there are no songs in the movie, only background music is there.\n\nAkshay Kumar has played a superb role. Its time that he should realize the fact that he looks really amazing doing films like holiday, baby and Special 26, and that he should stop doing mindless commercial movies. Danny and Anupam Kher are great at their roles. The action scenes are amazing, and cinematography is good. The best part of the movie is its direction. Neeraj Pandey has made two awesome movies earlier, and with this film he sets the standards even higher. Why cant Bollywood have more of Neeraj Pandeys and Hiranis and Anurag Kashyaps? Why cant Bollywood churn even two quality films every month?\n\nKudos to Neeraj Pandey, Akshay Kumar and co....."

The twists are further accentuated by the background music. Thankfully, no unnecessary songs in the film. A little lengthy and could have been edited better. Some cliches and the inspiration from certain Hollywood spy movies are evident. Anupam Kher's wig looked garish.\n\nOverall, a good movie.

The scene where Akshay interrogates a suspect by stuffing him in a plastic bag is one of the best scene I have seen in recent time. The scene where Akshay Kumar's partner officer fights with another suspect before he comes for the rescue is simply mindblowing. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. Other actors do justice to their role\n\nOverall , BABY is nail-biting , reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5"

Writer-Director Neeraj Pandey has made a brilliant film that is not only technically at par with the best in the world, but it's also a dispassionate non- judgmental take on terrorism that's completely devoid of jingoism and is extremely gripping. Full marks to Producer Bhushan Kumar for believing in such a landmark film, backed by exceptional marketing especially when it's devoid of songs. BABY is one of the finest films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Not only because of its excellent cinematic credentials but also because of the balanced 'Thought' behind the film. Neeraj Pandey once again proves that he's a genius. This time he proves, it's possible to better Perfection. We say, hey baby, don't think, just go for BABY.A Must Watch!!!!!"

But unfortunately the story was not gripping at all. There was a lack of depth in characters. Cinematography and fighting sequences were also not that good. Music was trying very hard to keep the audience not getting bored. And the end, that \"Mini Argo\" really set my mood me off. I was totally not expecting this from Neeraj Pandey. Till the end, I was waiting for the story to take it's sudden turn, but it never came. Not to mention what a waste of talents like K. K. Menon and Anupam Kher."

Plot deal with A top-secret counter-espionage team 'Baby' is born after 26/11. Its officers, led by Ajay Singh (Akshay), have no official records or responsibilities - except to thwart terror attacks. If caught, the government denies about them\n\nAkshay Kumar gives the best performance of his career in this tremendously accomplished thriller, this was the best Akshay Kumar film I ever seen. Anupam Kher, Rana, Taapsee, Kay Kay Menon, Mikaal and Danny all the supporting cast done well with BABY. BABY tells an amazing but true story set against the International terrorism, it will keep you chained to your seat. In a way, the film is about the technique of movie-making, the spinning of stories that will persuade the audience they're true.\n\nThis is the kind of filmmaking that elevates suspense to a perception. For fans of the thriller genre BABY is a must-see, and is an all- around quality time at the movies for the mature crowd. The film fulfills its promise of being worthwhile genre and gets boosted by a good cast, good script, and the luck of timing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though I'm an admirer of Neeraj Pandey's work, Baby was not among the same league as Special 26 and 'A Wednesday', which was a class apart. Most Indian audiences would like this movie a lot but for me it was a case of an average movie that could've been a great one. There were a lot of loop holes(not particularly plot holes) and it could have been cut short by about 10-15 minutes. Some dialogs seemed as if they've been included just to please the audiences like Akshay's wife saying more than once \"Marna mat\"(Don't die). In fact she was one of the only miscast of the movie. Started 'not liking' her from her very first scene. First half felt like somewhat dragging, but the second half must've infused interest in the majority.\n\nThe movie had its pros too, first of which was the star-cast and the acting. Akshay Kumar was great, which he always is in these kind of roles, and everyone supported hi beautifully, be it the fight sequence from Tapsee Pannu, or the supporting roles of Anupam Kher and Rana Daggubati. Danny Dengzongpa seems to be in the second innings of his career and I'd love for him to play an elongated part in this one. Other good things about this movie were that it seemed good on the technical front and the research behind it bore fruits like the rest of the director's works. Finally, Rasheed Naz must be the perfect person to play 'Maulana Mohammed Rahman'.\n\nI personally liked D-Day, which was based on the similar story-line, a lot better than Baby though the majority might differ. Hence I won't say to stay away from this one, instead go for it and decide for yourself."

The film captures certain key pointers of how the government and Indian Intelligence functions.

Danny Denzongpa (Feroze Ali Khan) as chief officer of a secret test team named 'Baby' leads the pack of a of handful men who are ever ready to sacrifice their life for the sake of protecting their motherland.

But the show stealer is Anupam kher who despite coming in the last 30 minutes takes the limelight. Only drawback is the length and it gets dragged towards end. The walking scenes could have been edited. On the whole baby is another masterpiece from Neeraj Pandey."

All was in seam. For those wondering, the character of Anupam Kher was introduced in the last hour of the movie.\n\n4) The clich\u00e9 of a girl trying to save herself from a \"villain\" while the \"hero\" comes to save her was removed in a very exuberant manner. You are in for a glorious treat. ;) 5) Surprisingly, the first half of the movie had no comic elements and the second half was full of it. Usually it happens the other way round.\n\n6) The climax of the movie will remind you of the climax of Argo. ;) However very clinical in its approach of showcasing terrorism, processes and people behind it, it does have flag-waving elements when it comes to patriotism. At least for me, it is something we need at the moment. It also contains subtle messages which may seem controversial but are sourced from real situations prevailing in the country.\n\nAn overly stretched movie by standard, it does have some very boring and unwanted bits. A good weekend-watch considering the patriotic occasion, you should watch it for its non-Bollywoodish treatment in the action genre.\n\n3.5/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "Excellent movie. Time well spent watching it. Kudos to the technical team for being brilliant and hats off to Neeraj Pandey for putting out another beauty.Baby is Bollywood's most grown-up action drama yet. Its scale is lavish, zipping between India, Nepal, Turkey and the Middle East, and its performances excellent. Akshay Kumar is terrific as Ajay whose core of steel you can almost feel. Akshay presents top-rung action - you practically hear opponents' bones breaking under his stabbing kicks.We are given a luxuriously-bearded mullah (based, clearly, upon a couple of real-life types) whose eyeballs have flames in them, and a crowd of followers who look as if they are ready for 'jihad'. They raise blood-curdling slogans, and talk nasty about 'Indiya'. The retaliatory measures undertaken by our hero are justified right in the beginning. Can't have hate-spewing terrorists who hide out in countries-ringed-by-deserts-and-sand-dunes threatening our sovereign nation, can we? So we are meant to cheer when the skilled counter-espionage agent Ajay (Akshay Kumar) breaks bones and smashes faces, while a gruesome interrogation sets the scene. If they can bash our guys, we are allowed to bash right back, no questions asked. Ajay and his band of merry men, the impossibly buff Daggubati, and the sulky computer expert Anupam Kher, cause some amusement as they race around Turkey and Nepal and the Middle East, tracking the baddies. But the whole is familiar and much of it is tedious.Other performances sustain Baby - Danny Denzongpa is superb as Feroz, unit chief whose love for nation and team often escape his quiet bureaucratic suits. Tapsee Pannu has a dazzling little role while Rana Daggubati provides muscle to the lean, mean team. Anupam Kher as sour-tongued strategist Shuklaji delivers with tart aplomb while Kay Kay exudes menace through unnerving, unblinking eyes."

It has many scenes which will bound viewer to the movie. In fact movie is perfect from start to end. And no nudity or romance scenes. It is even better than the Akshay's last movie Holiday. Though Holiday may have a little more drama than this but this movie beats it in thriller section. If you are fan of other bollywood movies which includes lot of over drama and fake action then you may find this one a little odd, but it is great movie to watch with family."

This movie might not make big box office collections because it does not have commercial elements like comedy, romance, songs, hot babes, unnecessary action, hyper sentiments and larger than life characters.\n\nThis movie is about people who want to save country from terrorism. It delivers with story, action, strong performance of actors, background score and last but not least simple and yet awesome direction. The movie has its flaws and who cares when you see the effort they put in making this movie and performance of actors they put to deliver to great product.\n\nSo folks, This movie is only for people who wants to watch no non-sense action thriller and masala loving people can keep away. All the best to makers of BABY."

I appreciate the actors,technicians,story,producer,Director and for the first time The Censor Board. Must say... it a beautifully directed movie and the actors were brilliant in their roles. Loved the 'INDIAN' in bold dialogue. A must watch movie for anyone who would write 'Indian' as their nationality."

        "review_title": "A well shot, inspired espionage thriller that surprisingly has its director coming into form post 100 minutes.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Beginning with a typical filmy action hero sequence with a racy background score (where the loud beep of the transmitter/phone is strangely not being heard by the goons), it loudly declares itself as a more action oriented film till Kay Kay Menon comes in to impress right away followed by another engaging scene featuring Rasheed Naazfrom Pakistan. Offering just the usual, uninteresting stuff in its first hour (with another completely filmy jail escape happening in the middle of the road in broad daylight), the first major entertaining sequence of a clash comes in post 50 minutes leaving you stunned that how can the ATS team leave a self confessed, proved agent of terrorism just like that without making an arrest, after getting the desired information from him about another key suspect.\n\nThe visible flaws continue in the next sequence right before the interval too when again a terrorist (caught while making a possible bomb lying open on the table) is not arrested as per the strict procedure and is allowed sufficient time to trigger a blast killing many. Whereas in reality, the moment such a wanted man is caught, the first step taken is to see his clear hands, get hold of them quickly, so that he cannot press any button or take anything in his mouth leading to any further disaster. Hence till interval, BABY remains a well shot but average escapist kind of thriller that fails to make any major impact on the audience and offers nothing path breaking or fresh as compared to even Neeraj's last venture SPECIAL 26.\n\nBut fortunately, the tables get turned in the second half when all new faces enter the scene led by Anupam Kher, Tapsee Punnu, Sushant and Rana Dagubatti infusing new life into the BABY making it alive again. Here at first we have another long chase sequence involving Tapsee and Sushant with Tapsee simply excelling in her well-directed action scene performed superbly. And from here onwards the pace picks up in a significant manner with Neeraj coming back into the form after almost 100 minutes of the film with a terrific final hour bringing you onto the edge of your seats through an engaging action and tension crafted well. In fact the final 60 minutes get you so much involved that you tend to forget as well as forgive the mess displayed in its first half and that's exactly why the film turns out to be a winner altogether in the end with praises in your mind forgetting everything else.\n\nSo if one wishes to consider BABY from a commercial angle, then the film works well delivering the entertaining excitement anticipated (particularly) in its second half along with a worth praising cinematography (wonderfully capturing the action and the locales of Istanbul, Nepal, Abu Dhabi and more), a pulsating background score (that is a must for such thrilling ventures), fine editing (though a bit long), some well written dialogues coming at regular intervals and (especially) no songs to hinder the proceedings as usual (it has only one short love song in an unplugged form).\n\nAkshay Kumar performs as a solid actor, enjoying his action & great fitness level keeping an unsmiling expression throughout that suits his character perfectly. And its really great to see that he is supporting ventures like these on a personal level following the right path. Taapsee (as the agent) looks great and performs well too in her few scenes and so does Madhurima (as Akshay's wife). Danny, Anupam Kher, Sushant Singh and Rana Dagubatti, all play their cameo kind of short roles effectively. Plus both Rasheed Naaz and Mikal Zulfiqar from Pakistan make their presence felt, particularly Rasheed Naaz in his single scene through a peculiar kind of dialogue delivery demanding an instant attention.\n\nYet, despite all the above merits that mostly get visible in the film's second half, I am unable to rate BABY as an exceptional achievement mainly due to four reasons as mentioned below. Firstly for its entirely forgettable first half with many flawed sequences relying more on just action, cinematography and background score without any basic story as such.\n\nSecondly for shockingly wasting Kay Kay Menon, who was prominently featured in the trailer as the key villain, but was only given one major scene in the entire film so cruelly. How can one do that with an asset like Kay Kay Menon, I frankly couldn't get it?\n\nThirdly for being too convenient in its execution moving away from the reality with a typical filmy touch and cunningly playing it safe with reference to Pakistan and Muslim community (eying another commercial territory avoiding a possible ban) which further dilutes the impact justifying none.\n\nAnd lastly for having a borrowed kind of theme taking it from more than one source that is not like a Neeraj Pandey film unexpectedly. To elaborate further the major part of the film (its final hour) that actually works reminds you of the plot earlier seen in Nikhil Advani's D-DAY where they wish to take Dawood back to India. And then the final setting of making fake papers and arrangements to fly back home with the man along, is exactly like the structure of award winning English flick ARGO.\n\nSumming up, BABY has its moments in the first 100 minutes. But it's the final 60 minutes that turn it into a fast paced engaging thriller giving you the return of your money spent. And if a film's second half is much stronger than the first defying the famous jinx then that simply changes the game undoubtedly."

It's one of those that kept me excited but also kept me waiting for this punch that wasn't there.\n\nAlso - I couldn't help but think about Special 26! Heck Akshay looked exactly as he did in that movie too and that had Anupam Kher in a major role as well. I bet in a few years I wouldn't know which was which.\n\nBack to the punch - if the movie was based on real life events, it'd get a 10 because of the sentimental value but since it was just regular commercial Bollywood cinema, it missed a thump at the end. My expectation was also largely set by Danny's opening (through casting) where he said 'we thought we were ready but we were not' -- what's up with that!! They looked ready to me through and through and I unnecessarily kept speculating twists and face turns.\n\nWatch it for how intelligently the movie was made - nothing else really IMHO."

His eyes, expressions, body language everything is just perfect and he of course performs all the action scenes so beautifully and convincingly. It would not be wrong to say that he is the brightest spot of film. Danny Denzongpa is very good. Rana Daggubati looks amazing. Taapsee Pannu creates impact in a brief role. Kay Kay Menon is excellent in the role of terrorist. His expressions are just terrific and he is a treat to watch. Anupam Kher is very good. Rashid Naz is impactful. Sushant Singh is good. Madhurima Tuli is appropriate.\n\nNeeraj Pandey's Direction is excellent. Although his script could've been better but he has done a flawless job as a Director.\n\nBaby is a very good action thriller with lots of twists and turns.

Though completely different, it reminds me of Madras Cafe. A serious movie with no unnecessary scene at all. Shocking that the screen was just 25% full. I remember seeing Band Baja Baarat 1st day 1st show with only 2-3 people in the theater, a week later it was declared super hit. With BABY I expect it to go down as one of Bollywood's finest movies. I am not exaggerating anything. I am an SRK fan since I was born and off late I must say SRK's last sensible movies were Chak De India and Rab Ne ... Off late it is Akshay Kumar who is giving us some great movies. Special 26, Holiday and now Baby. This is definitely going down as one of my all time favorites. I wonder how pathetic crap movies like Happy New Year make so much money and gain so much hype and classics like Baby hardly get any hype which they truly deserve. Don't miss this one at any cost."

After his earlier hits - A Wednesday and Special 26, the expectations were only higher and he sure has lived up to it. A gripping story line and an even excellent direction combined with a near flawless script makes this movie a must watch. Every actor fits their role perfectly and Neeraj Pandey ensures that each one of the characters makes an impression in the story. However small a role is, it leaves a lasting impression and forms an important chain in the events unfolding in the movie. He has maintained a very good balance between reality and on screen portrayal and has been able to show the danger of terrorism without painting every Muslim with the same brush. That the antagonist happens to be a follower of Islam is just a coincident. Although there are few factual errors in between and near the end of the movie, they can be overlooked considering the expressive freedom of a director. A movie well qualified to be like a Hollywood thriller, its a welcome change for Bollywood with young directors believing in delivering masterpieces rather than just giving out Masala entertainers. It will be a surprise if Neeraj Pandey does not win an award and bigger surprise if the Movie itself looses on being the Best. 9.5/10. Must Watch."

        "review_title": "A straightforward espionage thriller that doesn't care to camouflage its violent theme with emotions",
        "review_detailed_main": "In his latest movie called BABY, director Neeraj Pandey takes you through an almost three hour action-fueled journey of a super effective, highly covert anti-terrorism cell called BABY, comprising of Akshay Kumar as Ajay Singh Rathore, Taapsee Pannu as Priya, Anupam Kher as Shukhlaji, Rana as Jai and led by Danny as Feroze Ali Khan. Basically, the main idea behind BABY is simple: to wipe out terrorism in five years or the cell itself gets wiped off the government's slate. The movie certainly flaunts some serious, riveting ideas at start and most importantly has heart to display what's necessary but the major problem lies in its originality and of course, its execution. BABY clearly derives heavy references from Ben Affleck's ARGO and Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty but still manages to enthrall you and most importantly, touch you with its patriotism-fueled execution.\n\nABY is a straightforward espionage thriller that doesn't care to camouflage its violent theme with emotions and has no scope for the usual glittery romance or brainless songs to tone it down. The best part of it is Akshay Kumar who has rightly earned the name ACTION KUMAR. He has become so adept at doing these kind of roles that in most of the situations he looks like a natural. In the movie, nobody could have ever pulled off the religion quote better than Akshay Kumar. As he says, \"religion wala jo column hota hai usme hum BOLD aur CAPITAL me Indian likhte hain..\" , you can feel the kind of authority he has on his role. He keeps you hooked into the film right from the first frame and rarely you'd feel the need to take your eyes off the screen. He's perfectly suited for roles like these and I'd hope that he doesn't do any of those bullshit comic roles in the cheap comedies that make him lose his authentic charisma.\n\nAnother engaging aspect about the movie is its tight screenplay. The movie ventures to various locations from Nepal to Saudi Arabia and still it doesn't lose any grip over its story. The dialogues are perfect for a patriotic film and one would find all his patriotism thirst quenched in Neeraj Pandey's BABY. The direction of Neeraj Pandey is brilliant to say the least. Some of the scenes are so intensely thrilling that they keep you permanently engrossed with your heart skipping a beat or two. One fight sequence in particular, featuring Priya (an agent) kicking ass of a terrorist, was a delight to watch. The whole fight is superbly choreographed and the dazzling fighting skills of a female agent in a Bollywood movie are rare to watch and that's what makes the whole scene special. There are many scenes in the movie that are so well filmed with situations that are equally thrilling and hysterically funny.\n\nWhile, the movie relies mostly on Akshay Kumar for most of its runtime, the supporting cast still manages to impress you with whatever they had to showcase. Anupam Kher as Shuklaji is extremely hilarious in his own funny ways and keeps you entertained with his even funnier one- liners and also, with his body language. And all of that he manages to do in a very short span as the role of Shukhlaji is of a mind of BABY which mostly reminded me of 'The Wolf' from Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction', of course a funnier version of his. Taapsee, Rana, Danny and Rasheed Naz did a pretty decent job. Although, I felt the talent of Kay Kay Menon was completely wasted.\n\nBABY is clearly neither short, crisp and intelligent like 'A Wednesday' nor effortless like 'SPECIAL 26\u2032 but still it's a sophisticated, modern and bold attempt of Neeraj Pandey that implements its resources to good use. The negatives can be its lack of originality, especially if you've seen ARGO and ZERO DARK THIRTY and an average, predictable second half which at times looks like a bit of a drag. Overall, it can be watched for its riveting direction, hilarious humor quotient, thrilling background score and the brilliant. AKSHAY KUMAR."

Sometimes we felt being involved in their project. Start to end it was very much entertaining and enjoyable movie. 9 out of 10 is my star ranking for this movie."

I really felt proud that such kind of movies are being made nowadays which increase the standard of Hindi Cinema. Talking about the movie, particularly USPs:- a) Great acting by each actor, especially Akshay Kumar and Danny. b) Direction and Screenplay is just flawless, No faltu dialogue's by any actor. c) Camera work is just superb with breathtaking shots of Nepal, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. d) Script is so edgy that the Movie keeps you glued to the seat till the end. e) Background Music is just perfect and carries the movie forward in a right pace. f) Good action scenes, including a rare fight sequence between Tapsee Pannu and Sushant Singh, where she hits him with gusto, instead of cowering in a corner and waiting for the hero to come and rescue her. g) The Subject of Terrorism has been handled efficiently by the Director Neeraj Pandey, he has very well blended the touch of patriotism, secularism and family values.\n\nOverall a must watch movie. Highly Recommended. Watch it in Cinema Hall, a lot of Hard work and Dedication has gone into making the film. NO TORRENT, PLEASE !!!"

However, considering the imagination used in this secret mission, some are happy to accept.\n\nAkshay Kumar's marvellous performance.\n\nDanny, Anupam Kher, KK Menon and Rashid Nass in the lead roles.\n\nBest Story-Screenplay-Dialogue-Direction and Sanjay Chaudhary's exciting BGM are very nice."

The hacking scene of Anupram Kher was not perfect, Director could make in different way and better than this, there was lack of suspense scene."

The trailer and teasers of this movie have made it evident that this is a patriotic film. So you know that you are paying your money to watch a fast paced, meaningful, patriotic, action thriller.\n\nWhat Is Good:\n\nPerformances: Excellent\n\nAkshay Kumar returns to the action genre. He had done many action films towards the beginning of his career but later moved on to do comic movies like Hera Pheri, Gararm Masala etc.But with movies like Holiday and BABY he makes a very strong come back to the action thriller genre.\n\nStrong character performance by Danny. Very good cameos by Anupam Kher, Sushant Singh and Kay Kay Menon. All of them delivered exactly what the doctor order. Watch out for the lady actor who plays the part of female undercover agent. Excellent.\n\nProduction Value: Good\n\nFilmed at multiple locations in India and a short portion in Istanbul and a part in Saudi Arab.\n\nMusic: Good\n\nThere are no songs. There is a just a one liner nothing more than that. Background score is very good and makes the movie fast paced and interesting.\n\nPlot and Story: Very Good\n\nThis is a special agent movie. Those who give a damn. Live and Die for their country. While the idea is not entirely new but the treatment and presentation is lively.\n\nScript, Execution, Direction: Excellent\n\nNeeraj Pandey takes his work to the next level. This is definitely better than A Wednesday and Special 26. Narration is fast paced, specially the post interval portion is super. Some sequences are really nail biting and leave the audience on the edge of their seat.\n\nWhat Is Not So Good:\n\nIt is very difficult to find faults with such a movie that serves it purpose so well. Only thing that comes to mind is that few sequences are not very convincing and certain pre interval portions could have been better."

Following the footsteps of his previous two movies this film is also a thriller but this time it is an espionage thriller revolving around a fictional special task force named \"Baby\". It is a temporary unit formed as a part of experiment after the attacks in Mumbai on 26/11. Backed by a well written story and a riveting plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat, it packs a powerful punch that leaves you satisfied.\n\nThe film has some real good performances both in-front and behind the camera. Akshay Kumar once again proves his mettle as a brilliant actor. All the supporting actors play their part and I must credit Taapsee Pannu, she really gave a bad-ass performance. Neeraj Pandey once again proved that despite being young he really is a very mature director.\n\nInspite of all the good things, it also has its share of problems. The most annoying one is that there was not a real single high point of the film. It pretty much started and ended on a similar note, no adrenaline pumping thrill. The villains had very little role to play and not enough time was spent on developing the relation between Ajay (Akshay) and his family. In the end I did not feel anything for anyone, I enjoyed it but there was no after-taste to it. It was a good thriller but it could have been way more than just that.\n\nBut still I really would recommend all of you to watch it, its really worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director-Writer Neeraj Pandey's first two films 'A Wednesday' and 'Special Chabbis' were a absolute treat considering standards of Bollywood. Both were stunningly thrilling edge-of-seat experiences. Also both had believably good script even if some minor flaws could be caught here and there. With 'Baby' he continues with similar direction and writing style, sadly the screenplay here is very hollow. Plus having a abominated run time of 160 minutes where nothing new or surprising happens, it really drains the thrill part. Still Baby is watchable compared to other mundane Bollywood movies coming out these days, it definitely will click with the general Bollywood audience.\n\n'Baby' is the name of an elite Indian anti-terrorist squad established after the attacks of the 26/11. It has been named so because of its temporary and infant status. It's Headed by Feroz (Danny Denzongpa) with help of Ajay (Akshay Kumar), who is professionally skilled in espionage. Most of their job involves carrying out surgical ops to crack terror related intel around the globe. The first-half establishes this plot in a very boring fashion. Team Baby learn about plans for major terrorist attacks across India. At the same time terrorist Bilal (Kay Kay Menon) escapes from prison. Most of the story involves tracking down different people having information about his location. While all these missions have considerable amount of tension built- up but are void enough substance to back them up. Characters just pop- up without much development and then suddenly are gone. The vastly inferior screen time of Tapsee, Dagubbati and Anupam Kher was ridiculous. Their characters had some great potential in the script, unfortunately it is not utilized at all. Akshay Kumar does the required threshold but nothing special. Both his looks and acting were almost similar to the one in Special 26. The script is stuffed to many characters and throws very little light over them except Ajay. If you dig deeper there are many small goofs, especially during the ops. Situations and things turn up just to facilitate the easy and simple narration. The pacing and thrills pick up towards the end though with a not so surprising climax.\n\nThe problem with Baby is not its premise but its execution. Everything is just kept plain and simple even if the situation demanded more depth to it. Most of the story is quite predictable expect for one or two small twists. On the positive side, it isn't filled with unnecessary songs and romance to ruin the atmosphere. The background-music was good but felt repetitive and forced. The first-half felt poorly edited. The plot advances very little in the first hour. If it wasn't for an engaging and edge-of-the seat last act, Baby would have been a very average film. The third act was the savior I would say. Baby is an ambitious attempt by Neeraj Pandey but lacks a good script. It is highly engaging at times, but feels very bland when the team is not on missions. Those who crave for thrill-elements without any care for other aspect will like it but for me it was quite average and disappointing considering the other works of Neeraj Pandey. But surely it is the first watchable film of 2015 without any doubt.\n\nRATING:[2.5/5]"

I watched it many times, and the situations, the background music give me the same thrill again and again. If you love thriller genre, you should obviously not miss it.

But most of these films suffered from the Bollywood \"song and melodrama\" syndrome which ended up diluting the thriller element. Hence, Baby, written, scripted and directed by Neeraj Pandey (A Wednesday and Special 26 fame) comes as a welcome surprise.\n\nIn its running time of 160 minutes, I didn't get distracted or felt the urge to check my cell for even a minute; a feat only Hollywood thrillers have achieved so far. Cutting straight to the action from its first scene, the film details a covert operation executed by a handful of undercover agents to bust a dreaded terrorist organisation. Some influence of \"Argo\", \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and Nikhil Advani's far inferior \"D-day\" are evident. But Pandey deserves credit for keeping his narrative gripping and entertaining right till the end.\n\nOn the acting front, Akshay Kumar is brilliant as the lead agent, infusing the right amount of physicality and restraint in his performance. Danny Denzongpa suits the role of the IB chief perfectly. Anupam Kher makes his presence felt even in a small role. Kay Kay Menon, in a negative role, exudes menace. Taapsee Pannu is super impressive even in a small role.\n\nThe movie has been shot beautifully in locales of Turkey, Nepal and Saudi. The technical department is of high standards as expected from a film of this scale.\n\nUndoubtedly, Baby is one of the finest thrillers I have seen in Hindi cinema. Hollywood influence aside, it will still keep you on edge of your seat throughout.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Hats off to Neeraj Pandey (also the director of A Wednesday and special 26).Everything was spot on: whether it was Acting, Direction or Screenplay. No unnecessary songs,and amazing background tracks. With many 'edge of the seat moments' one just cannot lose interest.I guarantee you will leave the theater with a smile.Action scenes were impressive and so were the dialogues .Anupam Kher was icing on the cake with his witty remarks.I wish every once in a while films like these are made to neutralize the mindless cinema that we all(including me)love.Thanks to Akshay Kumar,this movie has definitely upped the swag of Indian agents.First half is not at all boring,as some online critics are claiming,it has a great build up.A must watch for all those who have lost faith in Bollywood......

Akshay lives the character pitch perfect and is absolutely phenomenal, and so are all other actors including Danny and Anupam Kher, however a special mention for Taapsee Pannu, who shines in a short cameo.

If you think I am joking, then consider this: a person who lived in Pakistan for 7 years as a spy for RAW is now India's National Security Adviser.\n\nActing is even better.

I think it is the best performance in his career. Danny,Kher,Rana,KK also did fine job. Tapsee's action sequence in hotel is very nice.

Firoz Ali Khan (Danny Danzongpa) leads an Anti-terrorism group named BABY that has the ruthless- decisive Ajay Singh Rathod(Akshay Kumar), technical expert Shuklaji (Anupam Kher), macho man Jai(Rana Daggubati), soft yet brutal Priya(Taapse Pannu) and some more, who protect the nation from various damages and also eliminates the minds behind them. The quests and actions of this team, when the nation is threatened by Bilal(Kay Kay Menon), Mohammed(Rasheed Naz) and company, make up the plot of the film. Writer- Director Neeraj Pandey(Special 26 and A Wednesday fame) keeps you engaged from the first frame to the last with edge of the seat intense action-crime flick, and some added drama in the first half. Nevertheless, the second half and especially the climax makes this one an interesting offering. No distraction of songs are there to break the flow in the 160 minutes duration. The background score fills up that space blending perfectly with the scenes. Akshay Kumar shines throughout the film, being one of the finest performances seen lately. All others have done their part with complete justice, be it the interaction between members of the team or the the menace of the terrorists, everything leaves its required impact. Shot in exquisite locations like Istanbul, Saudi Arabia and New Delhi, BABY packs in an amazing venture to get insights of Terrorism and it's smart expunge. Go for this sensible cinema having ample of action, drama and humour moments. AB"

There are no 'one guy taking on 30' sequences or crazy loud dialogues which are stereotypical of this genre. It is a simple story of what each Indian wishes to see. It is a story of hope that something of this sort will be achieved in days to come. It is a realistic story of terrorists and what lies in store if we don't keep a step ahead of them. The movie takes inspiration from a few other movies with the direction of events. The movie has quite a few limitations in the finer points of direction and editing. Yet it is a refreshing movie with a positive message, something that is seriously lacking in the times of the Khans and their multi-crore obsessions. It is a movie in the times of Modi when hope is the key to a new India."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like Neeraj Pandey's stories. His A Wednesday! (2009) is a masterpiece and Special 26 (2013) a good satire. Baby is good, but not great. But consider it as 2015's first watchable film.\n\nThe opening credits serve as a prologue which tells us that an Indian elite squad (codenamed BABY because of their martial infancy) is sent out to infiltrate huts of terrorism around the world so as to prevent any act of terrorism in India (and/or elsewhere, but let us focus on the exclusive Indian patriotism here). Ajay (Akshay Kumar), a father of two, is the skipper of this squad and mostly acts as a one-man army. Basically, this squad carries out unofficial surgical operations outside India. The story starts to make sense only after you are successfully pulled inside the plot which maneuvers between places around India and the world.\n\nA brawny first half will make you uncomfortable with some boring sequences that will surely raise few questions on the editor. The humor is destructive rather than constructive as the audience awaits a dose of real thrills. There are one or two scenes that MAY make you feel good from a spectator's perspective, but trust me it looks cooked. Enter second half and greet Anupam Kher in his appreciable performance as a quirky strategist. The pace catches up in the last forty minutes and if it were not for these crucial minutes, I am positive the film may have never come out its self-inflicted sabotage.\n\nThe plot is ambitious and no wonder Pandey has sampled some real life events into his story. They work and as far as an unsuspecting viewer is concerned, it all goes well. If you dig deeper, the narrative has nothing substantial to deliver. Yes we talk about killing these mercenaries before they plan another attack. But when every other bad guy dies prematurely, the fun quotient drains. And that is what happens in Baby. It is all so simple yet so difficult.\n\nDenzongpa and Kumar are good, not great. I somehow missed Daggubati; Kumar's actress (from that seemingly sexist Airtel ad) had more screen-space than him. The dialogs are funny and the one thing that really works for the film is the combination of drama and humor that goes hand-in-hand with all those weighty happenings. Even if you start to wonder where the thrills are, the witty dialogs will take care of you. The raw sequences of interrogation and infiltration dictates your attention.\n\nWhile the photography is good, the cinematography is below average. Direction is the usual Pandey, nothing to talk about. There is some good writing in here (a la A Wednesday!) but otherwise Baby is a slightly exaggerated drama. The namesake stunts are punchy and as the story turns to the climax, you will surely feel a satisfaction that if not in reality, a fictional India is doing something bold and not busy promoting superficial campaigns like Swachch Bharat & Make In India.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Baby is a tasty dish for our palates, but it ends up being more of a meaty affair than an intellectual thriller. A one- time watch!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

And three cheers to Superstar Akshay Kumar for a restrained but powerhouse performance. Every department of this movie is superb. Be it direction , acting by an ensemble cast, editing, story, screenplay, cinematography, everything is superb. The word of mouth is fantastic and even the critics rating are great too. This is cinema at its best. Baby is not against Muslims as some vested interests are trying to make believe, people who have not viewed the movie. It is against terrorism. In fact there are several Muslims shown as heroic and patriotic. Danny Denzongpa plays Firoz, who heads the secret mission, is a Muslim. Ashfaq,the Indian agent in Al Dera is a Muslim.A young Muslim boy shows up the courage to expose the terrorists, and is appreciated by the hero Akshay Kumar. More than Akshay Kumar, the hero of the movie and his team, it is the Muslim characters in the movie who help in the fight against terrorism. So this movie is not anti-Muslim . In fact, Muslim and they are shown as heroic. The film is not even anti Pakistan and has several Pakistani artists. In fact Pakistani actor Rashid Naz has given a superlative performance as the main terrorist. Only terrorism is the villain. And the movie hits out at terrorism. Danny Denzongpa is fantastic, Aupam Kher puts in a spunky performance, Rana Dagubatti is good is a small role., Kay Kay Menon in a small role mesmerizes, Sushant Singh is good, Tapasee Pannu is awesome and does the best action scene done by an Indian actress ever. Madhurima Tulee is apt in her role and supports, and Murali Sharma is eye catching in his brief role. Baby is a classic movie, I think the best movie made in India , in this genre ever. And director Neeraj Pandey is fast becoming a cult film maker what with a track record of A Wednesday, Special 26 and now Baby, Exemplary! And Akshay Kumar is fast becoming the most versatile actor ever, what with him juggling between so many genres and so many different roles, and doing them well. Roll on the TAX-FREE status in India ..please\u0085..this is my humble request to the Government of India , so all Indians can see this spectacular and patriotic movie.. All this is so motivating and moving and patriotic. Bravo Baby... This technically brilliant movie which is the best ever in this genre should get its due and be appreciated. Baby should be given a TAX-FREE status by the Indian government. This should be the appeal of all Indians. And I think Super star Akshay Kumar and director Neera Pandey both deserves a National Award."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Baby\" is that near-perfect textbook espionage thriller we have been dying to see: straight and business-like, fast-paced, without frills, and immaculately detailed to the point of occasional verbosity (we also saw that in the TV series \"24\"). But this is also a film that attempts ambiguity about which the nasty terrorist country is (with sops like the presence of Pakistani artists \u2013 Rasheed \"Khuda Kay Liye\" Naz as the main villain and Mikaal Zulfiqar as a good guy), which was something Hindi cinema did pre-\"Border.\"\n\nFrom the audience side, however, the film has some prominent deficiencies despite its lavish budget \u2013 the action has little diversion except a mention of Akshay's domestic life off and on but no one else seems to have a family; there are no songs (but for a half-song) even in the background and thus no relief from the standard and loud background score; and above all, the film clocks in at a length of 160 minutes, and no surprises in the narration whatsoever. Rockin Jump -300x250 ACT- India Ink-300x250\n\nWith Akshay occupying center-stage at all times, alongside Danny Denzongpa thrown in as the Intelligence chief, we only have fleeting appearances by others. Taapsee, Kher and (effectively even) Rana have roles only in the second half as agents. Madhurima, poor thing, gets a minuscule role as Akshay's wife. There is little attempt to enter the life and emotions of the other agents. This is no \"Special 26\" where Akshay was one of the main characters, but an out-and-out \"hero\" film depending on his super-stardom. But even here, the film repeatedly comes up with an anti-climax-like feel-good factor in many missions, where everything goes right and the slight tension is almost immediately defused.\n\nTechnically brilliant with crisp dialogues, the film is about a crack team of intelligence officers out to prevent crimes against India and on a perennial mission to kill the villains who are planning or executing them. The team called \"Baby,\" as it is new and confidential, is finally vindicated with the elimination of the masterminds who wanted to eliminate India. The action zooms from Istanbul and Kathmandu to Indian metros and the Arabian Gulf. It is quite extraordinary and real (the stunt coordinators led by Cyril Raffaeli may take a bow) and on the plus side, the one-dimensional and cold characters are sharply etched. About 30 minutes of the total movie are on bringing back a dreaded terrorist to India and the complications that ensue.\n\nIf the film is watch-worthy, a huge chunk of the credit goes to Kumar, whose performance is truly impressive despite his uni-dimensional characterization. Everyone else is good, especially Danny and Kher."

        "review_detailed_main": "Baby is Bollywood's most grown-up action drama yet. Its scale is lavish, zipping between India, Nepal, Turkey and the Middle East, and its performances excellent. Akshay Kumar is terrific as Ajay whose core of steel you can almost feel. Akshay presents top-rung action - you practically hear opponents' bones breaking under his stabbing kicks. But you hear Ajay's mind ticking too as he foils plots, plans hustles and thinks of excuses before his wife Anjali (Madhurima Tuli). Akshay is at his best, deadly serious in combat, wryly engaging with straight-faced humour, pleasantly asking a suspect, \"Kharonch kyun aayegi...?\" before interrogation.\n\nOther performances sustain Baby - Danny Denzongpa is superb as Feroz, unit chief whose love for nation and team often escape his quiet bureaucratic suits. Tapsee Pannu has a dazzling little role while Rana Daggubati provides muscle to the lean, mean team. Anupam Kher as sour-tongued strategist Shuklaji delivers with tart aplomb while Kay Kay exudes menace through unnerving, unblinking eyes.\n\nYou feel menace too when the magnificently acted Maulana Rahman (Rasheed Naz) makes devilish speeches, evoking terrorist Hafiz Saeed. Baby features multiple vibrant roles, including Hasan Noman as a smooth investigator, Murali Sharma as a minister's pompous-ass PA and Sushant Singh who faces a \"Rod. Aur gel.\" during an understandably quick interrogation.\n\nBalancing characters, conspiracies and cities, director Neeraj Pandey admirably keeps Baby rich, yet tight, researched, non- sentimental and steely-eyed. Neeraj's craft has grown - he's taken trademark touches from films like Special 26 and A Wednesday, setting them here on a grand scale, with a breath-taking climax. The cinematography - desert dunes in nothing but shaded moonlight - is elegant while dialogues are robust. One of Baby's crew tells Ajay, \"Tension kya lena? Ulta, aapke rehte, mazaa aata hai.\"\n\nQuite. This Baby's day out is deadly good fun."

And that second half will glue you to your seat! such a thrill, such a tension,the effort put by director is so brilliant that you will feel like cheering up. None of the characters are wasted. Everyone has a important part to play in. The acting is superb. Everyone, and I mean literally everyone has acted so well that sometime you feel like you are not even watching a movie. Anyone who loves watching Bollywood movies, should not miss this classic. It's a classic, a masterpiece and kind of movie that is made once in a decade. Simply stating it, Its one of the finest movie ever made in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar is brilliant."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rarely has any bollywood movie made me write a review about it. I was not expecting much when I entered the theater but this movie was brilliant.\n\nThe first half is good but it is the second half that makes it a must watch. It's an action packed movie filled with great performances and direction. Akshay Kumar is brilliant as an army man, so are the other actors like KK, Danny, Anupam kher etc. It's not one of those movies which will break box office records but it will definitely win your heart. I was let down by Akshay Kumar as he was doing silly comedies for few months (Special 26 and Holiday were great) but he came back with a bang. I won't tell you about the story because the story is good and I don't want to spoil it and you will feel much better if you watch it by yourself. The movie basically deals with terrorism.\n\nSo overall I give it a solid 8 rating. Just go and watch it and believe me you wont feel cheated but if you like movies like Chennai Express,Dhoom 3 and Ek tha tiger then You might not like it. People who like movies like D Day, A Wednesay and Lunchbox will definitely enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "How often would u get to see a movie without songs in Bollywood and how often would that movie would be fascinating. Baby is those one of the rarest of the are movies to make it to this list besides Madras Cafe. Gripping is the word. The first ten minutes itself set the pace of this action thriller. This is a completely nail biting tale and has you hooked to it. Neeraj Pandey sets the standard really high and has a daring take at terrorism. The story is on the face and the script with dialogues such as \"India ek pareshan mulk hai\" and \"Main religion category mein Indian likhta hoon, Capital mein!\" completely bowls you over. Akshay Kumar fits the role with ease. He has always been the quintessential action hero and in this too he excels. Although I do feel, the content overpowers this film and so it's not Akshay's best.\n\nDanny Denzongpa is seen after Bang Bang and he gives a power packed performance here as well. The casting being perfect, he holds his character extremely well.\n\nAnupam Kher enters in the second half and is quite funny with his quirky character as Shuklaji.\n\nTapsee Pannu impresses with her action scene and shows her potential to star in films which have a heroine pulling off some action and kicking ass.\n\nRana Daggubati is truly like hulk in the film. He does not get a chance to talk much but then again his personality speaks volumes for his role.\n\nRashid Naz, the Pakistani actor, who plays the antagonist is brilliant as Maulana. You truly hate him all through the film.\n\nOn the whole, BABY is one of the finest films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Not only because of its excellent cinematic credentials but also because of the balanced 'Thought' behind the film. Neeraj Pandey once again proves that he's a genius. This time he proves, it's possible to better Perfection. We say, hey baby, don't think, just go for BABY. Cinema at its very best!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it's just not for you.\n\nAkshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.\n\nMOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duo Akshay Kumar has played a superb role. Its time that he should realize the fact that he looks really amazing doing films like holiday, baby and Special 26, and that he should stop doing mindless commercial movies. Danny and Anupam Kher are great at their roles. The action scenes are amazing, and cinematography is good. The best part of the movie is its direction. Neeraj Pandey has made two awesome movies earlier, and with this film he sets the standards even higher. Why cant Bollywood have more of Neeraj Pandeys and Hiranis and Anurag Kashyaps? Why cant Bollywood churn even two quality films every month? On negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies. And regarding the negative reviews, just do not pay any heed to them, for THIS GEM IS NOT TO BE MISSED. Neeraj Pandey as a director has done a brilliant job."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a waste of time! The first half, that was okay de spite many of its flawed and uninspired scenes, was completely undone by the stupid, tension free, predictable second part. Baby does have its few moments of 'awesomeness', but they are few. And they are always destroyed by the clich\u00e9s, jingoism and melodrama that Neeraj Pandey had thrown in large measures to 'hold' together the movie.\n\nAkshay Kumar rocks in his role. And he is the only one to look forward to. Danny and Anupam Kher are wasted. Danny is Akshay's boss, but he always seems to be the one who seems to be begging for Akshay's help. Anupam Kher's role play more as a comedic entry than a serious, meaty role. Tapee Pannu as a female agent is good and the sequence involving her is the best thing you will watch. Hans Zimmer like music is a pain in the ears. Awful.\n\nI think it shouldn't come as a surprise either. A Wednesday suffered from the same flaws, but since it was done on a smaller scale, the flaws were not so glaring and since it reinvented the genre of a \"kickass common man in an Indian scenario\" giving voice to the atrocities suffered by a common man, it seemed a hard hitting entertaining movie. But Baby is something that has been done umpteen number of times. So it needed to reinvent the genre itself, overcome the stupidity and jingoism associated with it, but sadly it succumbed. And being a fan of espionage thriller, I am disappointed.\n\nUnoriginal, unfunny, stupid and without any intelligence whatsoever, a pity for a movie whose story relies on a lot of 'intelligence' to crack down the terrorists. Taking its inspirations from multitude of Hollywood movies (heck there is a sequence copied from Dark Knight), the movies feels uninspired and badly done. The second part goes Argo-ish, but it is never able to maintain the tension- a prerequisite for a thriller movie, I would say.\n\nBaby is loud, over the top and utterly stupid."

The technology is playing a vital role today for training various people for Jehad , without even moving from their place centralising their thinking capacity. A soldier not even thinking of himself and his family fights against all this till their last breath, risking even their identities and lives. A Movie delivering a message- not to bias a country or a religion with the anti social activities, before getting the full information. No doubt it has been banned in the neighbouring and gulf countries as this may create violence. Good job done by the actors . An interesting watch, till the end"

        "review_title": "Baby: Essentially India's First Espionage Thriller",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have a problem with Hindi movies. Well, at least most of them. They are pretentious. They play to the gallery. They also suffer from a sever bout of sycophancy. But every now and then, there comes a film that changes my opinion, albeit for the time being. Baby is one of them.\n\nIn post-26/11 India, there is a need for an elite counter-intelligence force that can handle any future threats to the nation. Enter Baby, which is formed as a five year trial run. Danny Denzongpa plays Firoze Ali Khan who heads this elite force and is joined by his man Friday, Ajay, played by Akshay Kumar. The film takes off on the premise when it is learned that insurgents in Pakistan are planning an attack on India.\n\nThis is director Neeraj Pandey's third directorial venture and boy is it good. He has managed to keep it real and with amazing consistency. Among all its merits, the biggest would be the fact that the film moves at an amazing pace. There is not a moment's respite and there is always a twist waiting to move you off your seat. The most important ingredient in a perfect thriller.\n\nThere a few standout scenes that Baby something even more special than what it already is:\n\n1. The slap scene at the minister's PA's office. It's shot in a lighter vein but it makes you want to applaud for the way Akshay plays it out with that straight face.\n\n2. The other slap scene during Sushant Singh's interrogation. Again, a scene shot it lighter vein. Neeraj Pandey has managed to pull off these scenes excellently.\n\n3. The big twist at the hotel in Al Dera (won't spoil it for those of you who haven't watched it yet). Amazing twist. Nobody saw it coming. Take a bow, Neeraj.\n\nBaby is flanked by one of the best supporting cast performances I have seen in a long time. Rana Dagubbati is superb as the beefy second in command to Akshay. Taapsee Pannu is a surprise package. She is outstanding in her almost cameo-like role. Madhurima Tuli is needlessly around as Akshay Kumar's wife. An angle that seems to have been created to keep the family audience in mind. Nevertheless, her presence in the film is irrelevant and almost hampers the pace at times. Anupam Kher is surprisingly out of place. He plays a been there done that role of a forever irritated technician in the team. His performance just feels a bit out of sync. Mikaal Zulfikar deserves a special mention for his brilliant portrayal of a person who plays the role of an Indian asset in Saudi Arabia. We first saw Rasheed Naz in the superb Pakistani film Khud Kay Liye. In Baby, he excels as the hardliner cleric with the ease of a thorough artist. Kay Kay Menon plays the mastermind Bilal Khan. He has very few lines and lets his eyes do most of the acting. Brilliant.\n\nBaby needs to be watched to witness the mastery that Akshay Kumar shows in his performance. He seriously needs to do more of such films. Neeraj Pandey deserves a standing ovation for Baby. He keeps at being the \"no holds barred\" filmmaker that he is and hits another one into the stratosphere.\n\nAdding any more words won't change the fact that Baby is a film that must be seen and experienced."

Well I liked the way how everything is clearly mentioned in Neeraj Pandey's movies. A salute to all them, who don't even care to be known for their work. I liked the way how the mission with 5% success possibility gave a fruit of 1000%. Go and watch it my friends, a great release on Netaji's birthday!"

I would also like to mention that Baby is not against any Country or Religion. Baby has also changed the tradition that a Bollywood Heroine is attacked by villain and Hero comes to rescue. The fight sequence of Tapsee Pannu is worth to watch. Baby has glorified the power of women Hats off to Neeraj Pandey for such a brilliant Movie. Each and every character plays a pivotal role. Akshay Kumar has given his best performance and that too as an action hero ,this one is a real masterpiece."

Although, the script is not too super intelligent or fresh, but is genuine. The direction is good, all actors have acted very well, locations are good, NO STUPID dialogues, NO UNNECESSARY SONGS - In simple words - A Straight Forward NO Nonsense movie.\n\nUnderstand, that the Neeraj Pandey have not hyped anything like in Hollywood. In real life, everyone works with limited resources and uncomplicated gadgets only... The methodologies are similar...That's how our Intelligence Bureau/ RAW is equipped with...

There are many scenes in the film that will make you feel you have watched this before. Absolutely nothing unique innovative or brainy.. even Anupam khers role is weightless and not creditable , one wonders why was such a film made ..is it a desperate attempt to highlight something that is not even there, they want you to think and believe something is cooking and a certain religion and a particular nationality is involved..but the question is Why? When everything is peaceful then why the insecurity thru this film? Are we indians really that scared that we need to make a bollywood movie to highlight our fears?..still thinking why was the movie made.."

Directed by Neeraj Pandey, otherwise known for 'A Wednesday', the film 'Baby' is about a tac-team which needs to put a stop to a terrorist attack in Delhi.\n\nThe movie is gripping from start to end, and never slows down. This is one of the few Hindi movies which I can say, was long, but never boring. The film's length is, in fact, a virtue.\n\nThe level of detail and content the movie possesses is truly something you might witness in a good Hollywood movie. Every aspect of the plot is well-covered, and there are little to no plot holes.\n\nThe action is refreshingly grounded and realistic, the acting a little less so, but good and more than forgivable, nonetheless. Even within his somewhat short screen time, Kay Kay Menon steals his scenes, hands-down. The rest of the cast puts on a pretty controlled act. Akshay Kumar in the lead role is a lot less goofy and a lot more likable and firm as his character.\n\nI do wish that Menon had gotten a little bit of more of a role, and I think that his talent was a little wasted, but I guess he does justice to his pretty pivotal character.\n\nOverall, with a winning story, a detailed and clever plot, sure- handed direction, and some truly impressive action, 'Baby' succeeds sky- high, emerging as one of the best patriotic/espionage movies ever. It is no doubt a must-watch."

With Baby it leaves Mr.Panday with hand raised high ahead of all for giving best of thriller movies since A Wednesday. Counter terrorism is a very complex subject and an issue for every country currently. Here the subject being counter terrorism, how these men fight against it for the country is shown in very professional way. And in real life, we the normal people are not even aware how these men protect us all without caring for their lives and families. We salute you guys. I hope many of you will agree that there would be quantity of around 100 movies being made during a year, but very less are Quality movies. With Baby movie, you will get the feel of a Hollywood action thriller movie, yes you surely will. The thriller and action sequences, the camera work are done in almost perfect manner. When it comes to action thriller sequences, Indian movies don't have much innovative way to show up things even if it is a hand-to-hand fight or fight with guns ( like: Bourne Series, Taken). The way how Rana Daggubati and other 2 officers eliminate the terrorist threat in the mall is the way how stealth operation is being done. Silent and surprise! Really pleased to see that those men are carrying guns with silencer and not the typical guns or Ak's and start blowing all the shift around. This type of quality action we can expect from only Neeraj Panday. (after watching Baby I can say...)I mean in how many Indian action movies have you seen this? I am not just considering this as the only point but still...I hope you can easily make it out if you are truly an action thriller movie freak right? Story flows pretty with the pace. The last 30-45 minutes are truly the thriller moments of the movie. Akshay Kumar has given his best performance. All other characters are equally contributing. Good to see Mr.Danny after long time in similar role after movie - 16th December. Baby movie is surely a roller-coaster ride. No complaints! No songs, 2 thumbs UP!!\n\nBaby, this title is a must in your collection of action thriller movies.\n\nWe hope Mr.Panday will continue this good work of making quality movies. You can surely bring change to action movies the way they are supposed to be made and shown.\n\nDon't miss this movie. A must watch !!!"

Though still his next quality movie i believe can be Airlift (still in production).Neeray Pandey, i believe, is actually the BEST director in Bollywood now. Never i could have imagine an Indian director giving such a great real-life feeling thriller, maybe even better than Hollywood movies. Hat's off no song in the film.\n\nFilm is not racist at all and not against Muslim religion. It is only against terrorists. Even the Pakistani actors did great.

It doesn't allow you to go out of movie for a single second. Kudos to Neeraj Pandey. He is one of the best film director in India today. As far as performance is concerned everybody is so perfect that no one can comment on that. Anupan kher, Taapsee pannu, Danny sir, Rana, Kay kay Menon, sushant singh. But I want to specially mention that along with story, script and Neeraj Pandey Akshay Kumar is the hero of the film stupendous performance. It the best is his career, he truly deserve best actor national award. If this film is would be a Hollywood that surely i would have a super box office success and also got many awards including academy. But sad we Indians don't give it due regard to this kind of cinema.\n\nPlease guys get out from mindless masala films.\n\nRequest to Neeraj Pandey and Akshay Kumar please make this kind of films more often in future."

I wouldn't compare this with any Bourne series installment but this indeed is a damn good film. The movie runs real fast and you won't get tired of watching some scenes which could have been edited. The story is simple yet made quite interesting. Its a thriller in every sense. The movie is shot in some beautiful locations which will give you a feel of a Hollywood flick. All actors were good in there roles especially Akshay Kumar who has given a very good performance. I guess we can expect a lot of good movies from him in future. There are some loop holes but we can ignore them, Neeray Pandey is just 3 films old but he is a great director to be. I am giving this 10/10 perhaps a couple of points extra because its a Bollywood movie and I want more such movies from them. Finally this movie is not anti any religion. Go watch it you won't feel regretted."

The film successfully glimpses the challenging lives of Intelligence people. It filled me with patriotism. I am sure Indian audience are getting maturer and would certainly appreciate more of such work. I hope the other directors in Bollywood also will soon realize the same and let us get rid of Dabangs, Dhooms and Singhams and make even the small town audience for whom they make such masala movies, grow up.

The boss man of the agents Feroz was a Muslim . It simply portrays reality the way it is instead of making villains with preposterous silly names like Dr Dan and Kittamkittu as in typical cheesy Indian fare . I do think this movie deserves award as best movie of the year in filmfare awards etc . Yes there are some plot or action holes but thats in every movie . I think some Indian reviewers are too used to the song and dance routine to appreciate What a great and well made movie this is .all Indians should watch it."

There was not much talk between characters and were up-to point. Each actor had their tasks cutout and they have performed to their expectation. I especially liked the role of the lady spy., and should see the intensity in her eyes. The last 45-50 mins will make you sit on the edge of your seat, believe me :).\n\nThis movie is altogether in different level compared to regular masala, all smiles/styles, filled with 6-7 songs.. khan movies.\n\nJust don't go with the media review as most of them are paid and corrupt. This film is highly recommended for everyone who loves well made and good action thriller movie. Kids can also watch but with parents only as some scenes are violent."

I think BABY is an important film to watch as it throws light on Global Terrorism being non judgmental (Terrorism has nothing to do with any religion or any country) about it!! BABY is thrilling, engaging, nail biting n gripping which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout it's running time but still entertains n moves you with it's good intentions of telling an important n true story about these unsung heroes (undercover agents n officers) of our country who are doing their thankless jobs just for our safety n security from day to day threats n sacrificing their own lives without revealing their identity to anyone (not even their families)...Salute to them !! BABY is a film which every Indian would be proud of n which deserved to be watched by each n every Indian...OUTSTANDING !! \u202a#Proud\u202c This BABY is smart, intelligent n sensitive :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I started watching this movie, I was not expected such a extreme piece of work from Neeraj Panday. Although I was very much impressed from his previous work in Wednesday, though the same quality was not in Special 26. But Baby is going to be just awesome. A perfect Thriller ,\n\nWriter-Director Neeraj Pandey has made a brilliant film that is not only technically at par with the best in the world, but it's also a dispassionate non-judgmental take on terrorism that's completely devoid of jingoism and is extremely gripping. Full marks to Producer Bhushan Kumar for believing in such a landmark film, backed by exceptional marketing especially when it's devoid of songs.\n\nFiroze Ali Khan (Danny) heads a special operations wing of commandoes called Baby. In a conversation with a senior minister in the beginning of the film, he states that the Government ought to win the confidence of the Muslim community in India, for Pakistan is taking advantage of the community's sense of alienation within India. In another scene Ajay Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) tells an ISI agent Taufeeq (Mujeeb Khan) how he defended a Muslim family during the Gujarat riots and why he puts 'Indian' in the Religion bracket in all forms that he fills. Somehow this sets the tone for the film that terrorists don't have a religion and no particular community ought to be associated with terrorism.\n\nThe screenplay is the hero of BABY. It flows lucidly, taking you on an engrossing journey of thrills, intrigue and surprises. Dialogues are peppered with bullets of dry humor that keep you entertained throughout. The verbal-expletive-laden warfare between Shuklaji (Anupam Kher) and Ajay is a case in point in this regard. Or when Ajay matter-of-factly tells Priya (Taapsee) as they're on the flight to Kathmandu to \"stop being my wife\" when she informs him about his snoring. The precarious uncertainty in the life of an Officer involved in covert operations has been portrayed in a subtle but telling manner. Ajay's wife (MadhurimaTuli) isn't aware of her husband's job profile but does tell him now and then, \"Bas marna mat.\" The scene where Ajay slaps the personal assistant of a minister (on his frivolous remark on the death of his colleagues) will result in an applause from the audience in the theaters.\n\nThe narrative of BABY flows like a well-made Hollywood film. Actors filter in only where required and they're not repeated just because it makes a commercial sense from a typical Bollywood perspective. Taapsee is part of one operation. Anupam Kher and Rana Dagubatti join the team in the scorching climax sequence shot in Abu Dhabi. Sudeep Chatterji's cinematography deserves a special mention. He has done an exceptional job especially in the chase sequences in Istanbul and the desert escapades in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAkshay Kumar has done an incredibly good job in BABY. He's razor sharp and there's never a dull moment whenever he's on screen. In a scene in an Airport washroom when he bandages himself despite excruciating pain is superbly done. He's exceptional during all his action scenes as well. The entire supporting cast is excellent. Danny is a picture of precision in giving the right expressions. He doesn't bullshit nor lets anyone else do the same. Anupam Kher weaves in magic in a cameo. He's entertaining and he gets the job done. Kay Kay as the dreaded terrorist Bilal makes his striking presence felt. Sushant Singh is effective in bringing in humour in a least expected situation. Rana Dagubatti as the tough officer Jai is competent. Taapsee is a sharp Commando. She shall be proud of this film. Rasheed Naaz as Maulana Mohammad Rahman has an interesting appearance and an even more interesting way of dialogue delivery. Mikal Zulfiqar, another Pakistani actor makes his presence felt in a cameo.\n\nSanjoy Chowdhury's background score is the heartbeat of BABY as it instills the necessary emotions at opportune moments in the course of the narrative. Shree Narayan Singh's editing is exceptional. Even though the duration of the film is over two and a half hours, the taut pace keeps you hooked. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply extraordinary and fast paced.\n\nOn the whole, BABY is one of the finest films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Not only because of its excellent cinematic credentials but also because of the balanced 'Thought' behind the film. Neeraj Pandey once again proves that he's a genius. This time he proves, it's possible to better Perfection. We say, hey baby, don't think, just go for BABY. Cinema at its very best!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This time around, not only does he have to stand up to brutal adversaries from the enemy camp, he also has to reckon with rivals within the ranks. Despite its largely realistic approach to the theme, Baby is an unconvincing portrayal of the life and times of a brave spy whose job is to thwart terror plots. The film draws many of its plot details from real people and incidents. But, in constructing its worldview about good guys and bad guys, it goes completely overboard with overt alarmism and finger-pointing. The principal villain of the film is a Hafiz Saeed-like maulana who, from his hideout on the other side of the border, plots terror strikes against India.\n\nMakers of Bollywood thrillers are obsessed with counter-terrorism ops. So in recent times, Hindi movie fans have witnessed the heroic exploits of many an undercover agent and wondered where the truth of such covert missions really lies. Neeraj Pandey's oddly-titled Baby does little to dispel the questions. Worse, it perniciously plays up prejudices in the bid to give its storyline a jingoistic context and mass appeal. After busting sleeper cells last year in holiday, a soldier is never off duty, action hero Akshay Kumar is back in business to send the terrorists packing all over again."

Of course Action as Akshay Kumar is performing leading role, comedy in the middle. The director should have introduced the character of Anupam Kher of being Shukla as technical support. One of the best job of the movie is that they have only one song has shot as it saved a lot more time for more direction in script. Movie has been shot throughout some foreign countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey which makes the direction somehow perfect.

Another best thing about the film is it never judges anyone from the world. Even after vaishnavi does something which usually must bring a rage during the vieweing makes us feel sorry for her is where the writing peaked. It has many beautiful monolouges to state some the scene where vaishnavi mocks about a phone which anand gifted here we arrive to a point to judge vaishnavi but immeiately anand does the same by using words to shame her character where both become the same.

BABY is a group by Indian Officers to protect the world from the terrorist attacks. Denny plays the role of the chief, while Akshay Kumar is as Ajay, one of the member of the group Baby. Anupam Kher, Rana & Taapsee Pannu are also one of them. How they can able to catch the main terrorist & his agents is what the film is made of. Akshay is back after Holiday, very energetic performance. Anupam & Rana fit to their small role. I liked Taapsee in Baby, specially her fight sequence. Denny, Shushant & Kay Kay are as usual fantastic. The character of the P.A. of the minister is too funny. & the main villain, Mohammad Rehman, a.k.a. Rasheed Naz is too much dangerous. His speech made me speechless. Screenplay, Script & Direction - has been done by Neeraj. He wrote an extraordinary, full of action screenplay, which he can able to direct better then what actual it's. Some scenes are off to mark. Like, In Nepal, where Akshay is jumping on the steps of a temple. Or the helicopter shot shoot in Saudi, the desert scenes, chasing sequence in Nepal, the fight scene of Pannu & Shushant in hotel - these all and many more are marvelous. The film has little bit comedy factor, too. The P.A. is too funny. Even the love factor in Akki's character makes some lite moments in the film. Year 2015 has its big & bright release, called BABY. Go for it! You have to admire this type of serious work of the makers. Good films will never harm you. So please go and watch it. BABY, will surely give you a damn, Baby!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Baby is one of the best thrillers Bollywood has come up with. It was Neeraj Pandey's third movie after \"A Wednesday\" and \"Special 26\" and it's difficult to choose which one was best. However, I have seen this movie tens of times and have never got bored of it.\n\nStory: An elite counter-terrorist unit of India is on a hunt for an international terrorist planning a series of attacks in India and in the process of doing that, they hit a goldmine (metaphorically) which changes everything they had planned for. While the time is running out, they don't just have to make sure they succeed in their mission but also maintain the covertness of their operation. Perfect recipe for a high adrenaline thriller. The story is written by Neeraj Pandey himself and full marks to him for that. Besides the plot, the screenplay is brilliant with no nonsense melodrama. Even though the movie is on patriotism and counter-terrorist activities, the violence is minimum and the writer focused a lot on planning and execution of the operation without making any noise about it - which is the heart of covert operations.\n\nActing: The casting of the movie was near perfect. Akshay Kumar gave one of his best performances. His voice is perfectly suited for the role and he gave justice to that with his amazing dialog delivery. In addition, other actors like Danny Danzongpa, Anupam Kher, Kay Kay Menon were brilliant as usual. Kay Kay Menon, playing a role of a key terrorist who is brilliant with funds mobilization and planning, should have received a lengthier role, given his acting talent - largely due to his expressions and dialog delivery. I have always loved him watching on screen and he impresses a lot in Baby as well. Rana Daggubati had a crisp role to play and he did it with great panache. Tapsee Pannu's cameo was amazing and very inspiring. Rasheed Naz, with his role quite close to the international terrorist Hafeez Sayeed, did well enough.\n\nDirection: Neeraj Pandey had built a reputation from his earlier movies and he didn't disappoint at all in \"Baby\" as well. It's very difficult to make 2.5hrs+ thriller but Neeraj Pandey makes it like a BOSS. Crisp dialogs, well-written script, brilliantly conceptualized sequences, moderated action and tremendous focus on keeping the story in motion worked well for Neeraj Pandey - something which is the signature of his movies. While Akshay Kumar is the central character, he made sure all other characters receive its due justice too.\n\nOverall: Overall, the movie is one of the MUST WATCH movies if you are interested in high-quality thrillers. You must also watch \"Special 26\" and \"A Wednesday\" from Neeraj Pandey."

And so for me, the finale was the weakest link in Special Chhabees. For A Wednesday, it was a great thriller from start till end.\n\nNow coming to the Baby! The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.\n\nKudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.\n\nAkshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough!"

It was soooooo good! She certainly has created a brand for herself with this movie. The movie was practical in many terms, in aspects ranging from script to background music."

After watching all i can say it is perfect, flawless, superb acting by Akshay Kumar and other actors. I watched the movie by today and I was speechless after watching it was not what i expected. The movie duration is 160min but at last you will feel this movie should not stop. Akshay lives the character pitch perfect and is absolutely perfect, and so are all other actors including, however a special mention for Taapsee Pannu, who shines in a short cameo. The background score is so profound that it automatically raises your heart-beat. At some scenes you cant resist yourself to clap and on some to fix you eyeballs so deeply just out of curiosity(what's going to happen in the next scene). No unnecessary creepy Bollywood songs are there. So, you will witness a true action/suspense/thrilling cinema. So don't miss out, must watch in theater only. This BABY is mature enough to be called an instant classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.\n\nKudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.\n\nAkshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Probably my second review of all time and my first for a Hindi movie. I am compelled to write this review and contribute to what I think is rightful promotion for a masterpiece. This is an attempt, however minuscule, to encourage such brilliant movies from an industry otherwise known to produce drivel for mass consumption.\n\nBaby is yet another thought provoking, engaging, and very entertaining move from Neeraj Pandey. With movies like Special 26 and Wednesday it was always going to be a very tough act to follow. But Baby surpasses all expectations and more. The plot of the movie is not novel but the attention to detail, execution of the story, and the brilliant acting is what places this move in a league of its own. The topics are myriad yet very diligently researched and more importantly, so realistically portrayed, void of the usual Bollywood hyperbole, that it keeps you engaged throughout.\n\nThe acting is Oscaresque. Akshay Kumar is solid but the other characters are creatively developed such that at different points they are allowed to assert their mark on various scenes. Herein shines Neeraj's brilliance as he masterfully exploits acting prowess of the various cast members to carry the scenes. I would mention Anupam Kher and Rashid Naz for stand-out performances. The first scene of Rashid, where minions are cleaning his feet before he walks through a dark hall to give a fiery and divisive speech in front of hundreds is chilling to the bone. This one particular scene reminded me of the scary \"calm before the storm\" kind of set-ups shown in Inglorious Basterds when Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) calmly has a glass of milk before slaughtering the Jewish family beneath his feet. These scenes, the acting, the detailed plot, and an interesting twist a bit more than half way through make this movie an absolute must watch riveting experience."

Dany and Anupam 's performance were strong, while Tapseewas' was great in her 10 minute role. But it is Akshay that really makes the film terrifying. He is believably as Ajay and great. akki's performance is enough reason to see this film... The action is also done very well, which is nice. In addition, the cinematography and the sets are good, making the imagery really nice and the locations believable. However, there are two problems with the film.\n\nFirst, the script is predictable but Neeraj's direction is what made me sit it on the tip of my chair almost all the time. bravo Neeraj.He is the real star of the film, Neeraj is one of the best Thriller directors working behind the camera today.\n\nThe second thing is the climax, many say its the best part of the film, while I found it, its the weakest , don't get me wrong because I have seen Argo before and if you seen it then definitely you would agree with me. but overall the film is good and deserves 200 Cr,"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is something positive about Akshay Kumar.After a series of flops, he always gets a stupendous film to mouth-shut his detractors.Post the debacle of ENTERTAINMENT and a dud like SHAUKEENS, he bounces back with Neeraj Pandey's BABY,a fast-paced thriller based on a covert operation to thwart the international terrorists.Acclaimed for his previous ventures (Special 26, A Wednesday), Pandey mounts BABY on a grand scale and the results are tremendous!\n\nAkshay plays Ajay Rajput, an elite member of an undercover task force led by Firoz(Danny Denzongpa), who gets on a mission 'BABY' to nab the masterminds who plan deadly serial terror attacks in our nation.So we have a Fazlur Rahman like figure , known as Maulana Rehman(Abdul Rasheed Naaz) a fanatical leader whose devious and controversial speeches can boil the blood of any Indian and few of his tentacles anchored by the menacing Bilal Khan(Kay Kay).\n\nAmply borrowing the plot from the Hollywood drama, Zero Dark Thirty and a finale akin to Argo, Pandey keeps us riveted through the deadly chases and some nail-biting moments, while the narrative refreshingly switches its lanes from Kathmandu to Istanbul to Saudi Arabia.It takes him long to establish the slickness, but he compensates with some sharply written dialogues and subtle humor. His astute technical acumen comes to the fore with the splendid aerial shots and some of the rare stunt sequences choreographed by Hollywood action director Cyril Raffaeli breathe authenticity.\n\nDevoid of songs, Baby camouflages into an espionage thriller post interval, and the last minutes do ring a bell of nostalgia with Pandey's earlier film Special 26, where there is an underlying palpable tension and 'what-happens-next' suspense running in your mind.Akshay Kumar is super-terrific and perfectly looks the part of an unpredictable yet committed officer , who remains unfazed with the moral dilemmas as well as phone calls from his doting wife(Madhurima Tuli).Cast in a cameo,Taapsee Pannu startles us with her 'kung-fu' chops, while Rana Daggubati complements as the 'Hulk' to the 'Tarzan' Akshay.Veterans like Danny and Anupam Kher perform splendidly and I was particular swayed by Danny's restrained act and his two-liners with genuine insights, which lent gravitas to his role.\n\nWith a pertinently relevant release timing(post the terror attacks in Peshawar), BABY's subject celebrates the unsung heroes of our country who not only care less about dying for the country, but as pointed out by Danny's character, they thrive in the adamancy to live for the country with full passion. At the same time, the solution insinuates subversiveness towards the system or going the 'Mossad' way. Nevertheless, I had my gala share of popcorn-coke thrills!"

If you enjoy espionage films with a focus on realism, \"Baby\" is likely to be an engaging watch.

He started with romance, slipped to action than comedy than action than comedy and now in action again. But this movie is not only about akshay kumars performance but is also about other stuff. This movie is about a script writer's failure and a screenplay writer's success. This movie is about a directors success while cameraman's failure. Editing is good enough so is the costume design. Not too realistic though but good enough. Cinematography is terrible. Direction is pretty decent. Looked like first they were in tight budget than midway of the project producer decided to go full throttle(you can see the difference in set design and costume selection). The writers were not worried about being politically correct. Chases could be made more interesting.\n\nI tasted argo, casino royale, and some other movie too."

Akshay Kumar is terrific as Ajay whose core of steel you can almost feel. Akshay presents top- rung action - you practically hear opponents' bones breaking under his stabbing kicks.\n\nBalancing characters, conspiracies and cities, director Neeraj Pandey admirably keeps Baby rich, yet tight, researched, non- sentimental and steely-eyed. Neeraj's craft has grown - he's taken trademark touches from films like Special 26 and A Wednesday, setting them here on a grand scale, with a breath-taking climax.\n\nAll an all Baby is Bollywood's and Akshay's most grown-up thriller and this Baby's day out is deadly good fun!"

Full marks to Producer Bhushan Kumar for believing in such a landmark film, backed by exceptional marketing especially when it's devoid of songs. The narrative of BABY flows like a well-made Hollywood film. Actors filter in only where required and they're not repeated just because it makes a commercial sense from a typical Bollywood perspective.

First half is a little build up and comparatively boring but the second half sets the pace perfectly and justifies all the actions that director wanted to show. There were no dramatic scenes to create needless emotions. Dialogues were very discreet and action scenes looked very realistic. Best part was the inclusion of absolutely correct amount of perfectly suited humor. Movie is lengthy but so detailed and thrilling that you'll not want it to end at all. It keeps you at the edge constantly for a very long time.\n\nAkshay Kumar did almost a perfect job making us think why he doesn't concentrate on only these type of roles. At each instance, he was stupendously delivering what exactly was required. Other actors were just above average but supported Akshay amazingly.\n\nNeeraj Pandey's direction was repetitive but repeating the feel of his earlier flicks like Wednesday and Special 26 will not bother anyone. A lot of hard work was sensed in both direction and cinematography that is really appreciative.\n\nBackground music was attempted with little success albeit it didn't matter at all.\n\nOverall it was a wonderfully directed thriller that will literally show what \"on the edge of the seat\" means."

Action sequence done by Akshay Kumar and Tapsee are very original and even every bit of movie will seem to be real events though they are imaginary creation. Romance and Comedy efficiently supported by dialogs.Those dialogs will convey all feelings in small time.Movie is shot in different locations and present real situations and happenings of events in India after Taj terrorist attacks and how Indian intelligence create a small group named as baby to tackle such attacks. So,Its a one its kind movie and must watch.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Baby is directed by Neeraj Pandey and stars Akshay Kumar, Danny Denzongpa, Rana Daggubati, and Anupam Kher. All 4 of them and the rest of the cast did an amazing acting job. Akshay Kumar delivered one of the best performances of his career. It is about India's determination to end terrorism. This is a serious, action movie.\n\nThis movie was very enticing for its long 2 hour and 39 minute run time. It was very thrilling, especially at the end. I never knew what was going to happen next in this very unpredictable movie. Almost every scene surprised me. The only flaw I think this movie suffered was the romance with Akshay Kumar's character and his wife. It gave the film more emotional depth but it wasn't really necessary.\n\nOverall, I had a great time with Baby. It was a lot of fun watching it. Bollywood needs more of these types of movies. From A+ to F, Baby gets an A."

Whereas Special 26 is outstanding and a class movie.\n\nBaby is action packed, slickly produced and holds the interest for the most part. Everyone essayed their role very well and not surprisingly Anupam Kher was the best in my opinion, as Shukla-ji.\n\nWhat I did not like was the violence as shown in the torture scenes. There is really no need to depict more than a suggestion of violence rather than showing the act. I guess the wider audience likes it:(\n\nThe smile on the face of the local investigator as he allowed them to leave, was the best.\n\nWorth watching."
