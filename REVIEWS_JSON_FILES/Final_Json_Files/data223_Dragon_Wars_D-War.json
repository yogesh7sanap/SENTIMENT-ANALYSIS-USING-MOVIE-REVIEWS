        "review_detailed_main": "How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much."

        "review_title": "A review of \"D-War\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "To review \"D-War\" (sometimes called \"Dragon Wars\" or \"Dragon Wars: D-War\") with any real depth would be an exercise in utter futility. I mean that, really. The film is a big, loud special effects bonanza the likes of which have been seen plenty of times on United States soil, but \"D-War\" is unique in the fact that it is not an American production, but an Asian one, specifically of the South Korean kind.\n\nBut just because it's a South Korean movie with American actors, does that really make it good? It's a yes/no/maybe so type of answer. \"D-War\" comes to us from South Korean import Hyung-rae Shim, who announced the project back in 2002 and has spent the last five years getting it off the ground. It's received mostly negative reviews here in the U.S. and in South Korea (where it set box office records for an opening week with an estimated five million viewers within a nine-day time-span), but the movie's special effects and action sequences are undeniably stunning. But it's a shame about the story and characters.\n\nSupposedly based on an ancient Korean legend, a 200-meter-long Imoogi (a giant serpent) called Buraki is denied a chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined to perform the ceremonial rights run away and perish in their escape. 500 years later in Los Angeles, the man is reincarnated as American news reporter Ethan (Jason Behr), who as a child was given a powerful pendant by an elderly antiques dealer named Jack (Robert Forster) and now has to find the reincarnated woman, Sarah (Amanda Brooks), before her 20th birthday.\n\nSure enough, in special effects sequences that seem right out of any Asian monster flick made in the last 50 years, the dragon Buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army of demonic warriors to continue his 500-year pursuit of what is rightfully his. Lots of explosions, guns, and destruction as ancient slams head-on into 21st-century military technology, and Ethan and Sarah try to find a way to stop Buraki and his army before he destroys the city.\n\n\"D-War\" is a film that looks and sounds amazing, in theory, but the execution is so poor that you'll rightfully feel that you've been cheated by the time the credits roll. Make no mistake, Buraki and his minions look pretty cool and plenty menacing, and the destruction they bring about in their action sequences is nothing short of breathtaking. In this regard, Shim has surely done his job in presenting \"D-War\" as a no-holds-barred sci-fi/fantasy action epic.\n\nOn the other hand, the film's human players are drastically short-changed and given cheap, hokey dialogue and scenes that rarely connect. It seems that the only reason they're here is to give us something to root for, which is not in any real way genuine. \"D-War\" unfortunately comes off as something a lot closer to the poor American adaptation \"Godzilla\" (1998) than anything that is uniquely Korean. Another problem is that the story seems to take itself a little too seriously, with cheap humor that doesn't get anything greater from us than a weak little laugh. The acting and direction seem mediocre at best (so that you do feel a little sorry for the hokey performances of American heavyweight Robert Forster and up-and-coming Jason Behr), which is a real shame because Hyung-rae Shim is obviously a capable talent who knew what he wanted to do here and surely enough had the means to do it. His head seems full of ideas but the problem is with the execution of those ideas; maybe he was trying to do too much without really working out the material in greater detail. And the ending, a would-be \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" special effects showdown, seems pretty cheap too.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, believe me, but \"D-War\" is a mediocre attempt at something that really had potential to be spectacular. But maybe it's because I'm an American. Maybe you'd have to be Korean to understand the mythical themes about that classic battle between good and evil. It's just too bad that the finished product of \"D-War\" appears to be like any other \"B\"-grade monster movie than the extraordinary idea that the director had in mind.\n\n5/10"

It's something different. It's totally corny and implausible, but it's DRAGON WARS, it's not trying to win any Oscars. to people who say the visual effects are the worst they have seen, PUH-lease. The effects are about on par with Dragonheart and the Godzilla remake. Of course, this means the effects are ten years old, and films like T2 and Jurassic Park still look like they were made last year, but that's beside the point. The effects aren't THAT bad.\n\nThe acting is average. Nothing special. Better than Keanu Reeves or Clive Owen. See, what I'm trying to do here is show you that a movie like \"Gryphon\" or \"Raptor Island\" or \"Alone in the Dark\" are much much worse than this. Stop giving unfair comparisons. The last 20 minutes of the movie actually had some good action, and the final battle was great. Lighten up. Just have sit back and MST3K it if you want. But it's cheesy monster mashing fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this movie with high hopes. Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought. I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects. All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things: -The acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. -The storyline: The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clich\u00e9d, not thought-out, and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clich\u00e9d thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and clich\u00e9. -The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out. It's gotta be better than this, cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible."

All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.\n\nStory: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10\n\nI don't drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie"

They really loved it and that made me feel good. After the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.\n\nThe CG is good. Acting and directing are horrible. Storyline is extremely simple. But, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.\n\nIt's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing.

But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact, and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Sadly, by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had the sudden, sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film. And worse: I knew just how badly every point would all suck.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.\n\nAs for knowing all the twists of movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales this one is not worthy to fill, it conveniently sprouted extra sub-plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.\n\nIt was infested with close calls, miraculous escapes, and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.\n\nThis film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor.\n\nLet me try to explain.\n\nImagine you could get a hold of all the coolest-looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade: First take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.\n\nNext, take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a \"subtle\" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them lots of film noir narration, so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading-pool depths of their thoughts.\n\nFinally add a raspy-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras, angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong, and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.\n\nNow run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous.\n\nAt several points during this picture, I found myself saying out loud, \"Make the bad movie stop,\" and breaking into tears.\n\nTo call this a B-movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.\n\nIn short, if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for hideous, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars might just be the film for you."

But instead of simply translating it into English (either with captions or dubbing), they separately filmed some American actors and inserted them into the movie. Then, during portions where the Koreans talk, occasionally the narrator summarizes what they said...no captions, no dubbing...but a LOT of confusion. This is a case where a film bombed and much of it simply was because the film wasn't translated well to English-speaking audiences! It fel much like watching a film in a foreign land and understanding nothing until, on rare occasions, someone sitting behind you explains a BIT of what is going on! I think the filmmakers would have been kept the film in Korean...period.\n\nThe story, because of the way it's told, is pretty confusing and I'm not going to bother recounting the script. Suffice to say that there are a lot of CGI monsters, explosions and wire fu.....all set to a story that just left me baffled. And, it left me wondering what non-Korean speaking person would sit through the movie.\n\nOverall, there is some nice CGI, some lovely acting by Korean folks and nothing of any value for non-Korean speakers! Next time you want to market a film abroad, do a better job of it! And, in light of this, I can understand why the film is #68 on the IMDB Bottom 100...at least the international/English speaking version. Pretty much unwatchable....but at least it looked nice."

To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing, but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of ... well ... use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Prior to the premiere of this film in Korea, every time I watched the news, there was some story about D-War.... mainly about the Korean director, who was a comedian awhile back, and how it cost $150 million and 6 years to make. But the biggest factor for this film's hype was that it was a Korean film being filmed in LA with American actors. This film was all based on hype and national pride and as a result it totally did not deliver. I don't care if you're Korean, American, European, or anything else, but if you can honestly look someone in the eye and say that this film was excellent, then you have got to be a great liar.\n\nTo give this film some credit, it HAD the opportunity to become something great. It was actually a good plot, but it tanked on so many levels, from the failed CGI, to the poor script, to the poor acting, and to the insanely evident cheese factor. Oh, and just because the actor's were no namers, it doesn't mean that it was bad. It was bad acting because they were just bad actors, plain and simple. The script was way too cheesy and the bad acting just made things worse. Also, despite the fact that it cost $150 million to make, it seems the majority of it was used to get the license to film in LA. Yes, I KNOW that this movie is about dragons and I shouldn't be too scrutinizing on the CGI, but Jurassic Park was based on dinosaurs and that was made over 10 years ago and managed to have better graphics than this. The CGI didn't converge well with the rest of the scenery and made a terrible clash.\n\nI think I was soooo lucky to have watched Transformers AFTER D-War because if I saw it the other way around, I would have walked out of D-War. D-War may have set the record for best opening in Korea, but to be perfectly honest, it was all based on national pride, which isn't a bad thing mind you. But once this film hits America, it's going to bomb. It won't have the same popularity as Shiri, Old Boy, and Lady Vengeance which didn't have a big opening in Korea, yet found fame in the global film industry."

I wondered if it was edited by a team of Korean script writers because it was so bad I gave up trying to follow the irrational twists and turns it made. I love Korea and just felt embarrassed for all Koreans. Other movies I have seen here like King of men, host, old boy, are kick ass original movies of international calibre. That this terrible movie represents Korea to the world is really painful to accept. The director gets no credits from me for his effort or drive or desires. I only care about the product. 2 out of my three points for this movies comes from the CGI. Which I would give to any good CGI based movie. It was good enough to make this movie great if the script, acting, direction and editing had been a lot better. If Shim Hyung-Rae can come back after taking a smack in the face like the direction of this movie deserves and produces something reasonable, then he will truly deserve to be called a movie director. I really hope that happens but I'm not going to hold my breath. Sometimes dreams just don't come true."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the weekend, I had a chance to visit with Korean filmmaker /director, Mr.Shim Hyung Rae here in Korea, home to the Yonggu Arts and Entertainment Company. As we toured the rather spacious Digital Production studios located in a secluded area near Kimpo Airport , I got a sense of what really happens behind the scenes during the post production phased of a CGI film. D-WAR's the title of his latest movie and dragon war props appeared everywhere and were used in several sequences of the sci-fi thriller, five years in the making . Although I knew that Shim Hyung-Rae had a \"reputation\" that preceded him, I could not help but wonder if D-WAR was simply a remake of his previous movie aptly called REPTILIAN. After the first five minutes into the extended preview of D-WAR however, I knew that such conceptions I had of a boring remake was not only far fetched but a misnomer. The way computer science and technology are mastered here made it perfectly clear that the director has come a long , long way from REPTILIAN, a very low grossing film. Not only does Mr. SHim succeed in the use of a real plot this time but he casts real American actors not to mention a compelling drama that takes us back 500 years to a period of ancient history known as the Chosun Dynasty.\n\nBut the director's \"message\" is just as relevant as it works it way through to present day Los Angeles. Even Mr. Shim himself is convinced that he's no longer a \"mediocre\" film maker as he plys his trade as a creative tour-de-force in directing CGI films.\n\nWill D-WAR defy any other description other than a \"blockbuster\" ? That question remains to be answered since the movie is set to be released this summer when we all get the chance to experience the absolute conquest of mankind . I did breathe a sigh of relief during a private screening and I was able to see some familiar faces on the big screen. The movie cast includes American actors such as dreamy Jason Behr and the hero Ethan Kendricks who must save Los Angeles from an army of ATROX soldiers.\n\nI figured most of the ATROX droids,clad in black armour were probably cheaper by the dozen to hire but as I found out later they were not hired extras but life size figures that were made from heavy metals and stored safely for future takes ! That was enough to convince me that there seemed to be a greater magnitude to this sci-fi flick than meets the eye.\n\nThere's even a newborn baby that appears all too real but she too was made from an incredibly realistic computer rendered model. I took careful production notes about the advanced computer animation process that was used and I was also shown how the crying baby was preserved in glass and an exact replica of someone's first born.\n\nAs we winded up the tour, the most pressing question in my mind was what becomes a legend most for Mr. Shim, a long time veteran in the film making business who has made over 20 films. The answer seemed to emanate from his most ambitious project: The I-M-O-O-G-I-'s of course! That's a Korean word for a mythical creature that evolved over time and it's in D WAR that the IMOOGI attempts to morph into a defiant dragon.\n\nIn closing, I'd rate D WAR a solid B+ for its exciting visuals and explosive scenes that keeps a pace all its own. Also in production for Mr. Shim's next movies are GOSEONG LEGEND and a computer animation feature based on the life of myriad fishes in the sea.\n\nANNONG !\n\nIRENE NAKANO /HARVARD U.

Koreans are well known for such childish behavior (When Korea dropped out of the soccer world cup 2006, Koreans attacked the FIFA server so heavily that FIFA had to block all IP addresses from Korea ...)\n\nTo put is short, this movie is bad.\n\nAnd boring.\n\nThis movie is not just a wannabe mix of Hollywood's StarWars, Lord of the Rings, Black Hawk Down and Jurassic Part. No, it's a very, very bad wannabe mix of all that. With all respect, Mr Shim, what have you been doing over the past 5 years of directing that movie ?\n\nI think he wanted to do the sort of epic sci-fi action movie. But for that you need much more than just a cluster of mega-flop computers. Instead of relying on actors, the director relied on computer power. Even worse, the director tries to impress the audience by showing some selected martial art sequences which are nothing but blunt copies of 'Crouchint tiger, hidden dragon'. Those sequences don't even fit into the overall making style of the movie.\n\nFor sure we can not reward this director for finding new and innovative ways of action-movie making.\n\nWhat the sci-fi action thrillers Jurassic Parc and Co. have in common is at least a decent plot, thrilling moments and some good, authentic acting. But this movie doesn't have any of that.\n\nMoreover, the actors don't reveal any special characteristic of the person they act. It's so sterile. A kiss, what even in mediocre movies is a long suspected and awaited moment comes here as an unexpected sudden and sterile act (at the beach ... how romantic) The director should have used the computer for the main actors as well, it wouldn't have made any difference and he could have saved time and money.\n\nNo thrills, no surprising moments, no dramatic, nothing.\n\nDon't waste your time on that movie. I recommend to rent a DVD of Jurassic Parc 1 instead. Even if you saw that one already 4 times."

I read a news article today that World of Warcraft is being made into a movie with a budget of 90 mil (coming out in 2009).\n\nThe computer graphics didn't mix well in places here and there, and I thought the storyline was terrible.

Some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City.\n\nIt wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great. There are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. I sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when I see summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different, and I thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's(Behr)hair looked so Asian.\n\nYes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?"

For starters the movie just isn't well made, every lesson that is taught in film school is flung out the window. Clich\u00e9d plot and cheese are expected but the film goes to a whole new level. For starters there are far to few shots and the shots that are used are crap. The soundtrack is almost non existent only showing up every now and again. The acting, now the acting is something new, I've seen bad acting but this has almost no acting. The worst example of this is a bit where a girl walks out of a club and is cornered by 4 thugs, a man in black walks into the picture, throws them all away one by one and just walks out, and when i say throw them i mean grudgingly moves his arm a couple of times. This isn't an isolated incident either.\n\nThere is also lack of continuity or explanation from scene to scene. The computer effects are alright but still manage to look as if it isn't real, but then most computer effects do so that can't be faulted. The lead actors try to convey a sense of worry and panic all the time showing no chemistry to each other or change in mood the whole film.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is yes this film looks great but it isn't, its dire. I wouldn't let a review put me off watching this piece of crap so i doubt this review will but once you do, you will know what i mean. As stated I've liked crap movies before, I've even seen trates i liked in movies i didn't but this is unredeemable."

Anyways, Koreans like stealing legends and traditions from the Chinese, so, what can we expect?\n\nSecond, the acting, the plot, and the directing are sooooooooooooooo bad that it succeeded in making me just gave up watching after the first 30 minutes and registered for a IMDb account at once to write this comment.\n\nLastly, the CG is just OK. The motion of the bad soldiers are so stiff and not-looking-like-real at all. Eragon is much better, Transformers is way much better. And even the CG of Lord of the Rings from 6 years ago is still a lot better than D War."

And when Ethan and Sarah get caught, they have been transported to the Land of Mordor? How? Why? Where is it?? How did the Mordor come about??? I don't know. I'm not even a movie critic!

This film has everything from stars wars to lord of the rings incorporated into the story and effects....so what?...Thats why i enjoyed films like this as a child.\n\nIt reminded me in parts like the 'never ending story' which as a child i truly enjoyed!.....So those adults out their that still have a little bit of child within them, go take your kids and enjoy this entertaining movie!!."

The ads hyped a dragon on dragon war wherein mankind was at risk. And it was, but not as implied, and thereby disappointing some movie goers who expected good dragons versus bad dragons, utterly destroying a big city. I won't detail the story, but let me correct some poor reporting: There IS a story - a very rich story, at that! But it was not the story indicated in the few ads that were run.\n\nThis is a story- and effects-driven vehicle wherein the South Korean tale of the Imoogi is told via memories of our lead character. It could have been a well-balanced work, adding in the character-driven plot lines; however, the acting herein was so poor, as to drive this film down into the annals of the \"B\" action/horror flick.\n\nThe effects are awesome! The treatment of the Eastern Dragon after transformation was nothing short of a pure work of art! This is not just another monster movie. The story line and overall finished product far outweigh any Godzilla movie of which TOHO ever dreamed.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe film quality is poor. A better quality would have lent a great deal to this work, but even the best quality would not have overridden the stiff performances and fake smiles. Though it did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the work, it did lessen the enjoyment somewhat.\n\nFrankly, the Lord of the Rings/Star Wars-worthy CGI combined with poor acting quality and brilliant style, left this production feeling more uneven and unprepared for filming, as if the actors themselves did not have their hearts in this work.\n\nAll in all? We were highly entertained by both the story and the visuals, but we cannot decide whether this should be rated as a fantastic \"B\" flick, or a decent \"A\" film.\n\nIt rates a 9.9/10 on the \"B\" Scale, which is about a 7.4/10 on the \"A\" Scale, from...\n\nthe Fiend :."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a fantasy-lover that absolutely MUST go out to see every fantasy flick that comes out can be pretty excruciating at times. Before D-War, I hadn't seen an honest-to-god fantasy flick since At World's End (I'm not counting Stardust, which was just a romantic comedy masquerading as a fantasy flick). So by the time D-War came out, I was starving for a decent fantasy film.\n\nThat's not to say I had high hopes for D-War. I wasn't expecting Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Hell, I wasn't even expecting Pirates or Narnia. I was just expecting to be entertained. Even a flick as frowned upon as Eragon managed to entertain me. But let me tell you, D-War makes me long for movies as \"good\" as Eragon. Yeah, it's that bad.\n\nAs with most fantasy films, D-War comes to the plate with two strikes against it; clich\u00e9d plot and bad acting. This is something that any fantasy aficionado is quite used to, however, and these things alone aren't enough to completely ruin a flick of this genre. As long as it manages to be aesthetically absorbing and maintain a level of excitement, it can succeed.\n\nWhere D-War completely flubs is in its pacing. The film starts off extremely slow, almost grinding to a complete stop several times in the first 45-50 minutes (bare in mind this flick is only 90 minutes long). By the time the hour mark rolled around and I had barely seen anything even remotely resembling a thrill, I actually pulled out my cellphone, turned it on, and looked to see what time it was so I could guess how much longer my suffering would endure.\n\nThe second half of the film is where the action starts piling on, but after all the dull exposition and rising \"action\" of the first half, it's hard to get excited about the action in the second half. And there really isn't all that much solid action. Pretty much everything you'll see in the film is what you already saw during the trailers. Giant snakes masquerading as dragons running rampant through the cities, giant armies of canon-fodder troops taking up formations we've already seen in countless films of this nature since the mid-90s.\n\nIn all it's a brainless, mind-numbingly dull adventure flick, a great deal of it I've already seen too many times. Unless you have small children, you might want to skip this one entirely."

Also it wasn't edited by a retarded monkey. Seriously, \"D-war\" or whatever they call it was so choppy and discombobulated that you won't know where you are in the movie.

They were talking so much that about 10 minutes into it I wanted to strangle each one of them, slowly. Fortunately, about 15 minutes into it I, and everyone else, decided to join in with the kids because that was the only way sitting through that trash heap of a movie.\n\nSeriously, I would have preferred they just turned the volume all the way down and let us talk amongst ourselves for 90 minutes.\n\nI don't want to get into detail as to why the movie was so bad. I don't want to relive that experience. I'm almost crying now just telling you it was bad. Please just trust me, don't go! If you must see it, wait a month and watch it on USA, wait, no, Sci-Fi.

The good thing about it is I was laughing throughout the entire movie. From the ridiculous plot to the goofy dialog, this just seemed like it couldn't get any worse. The only actors in the film I recognized were Robert Forester, in what has to be the low point of his career, and comedian Craig Anton who used to be on MadTV. Neither of these actors are reasons to see this stupid, stupid movie.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, deals with some old legend about dragons, and dragons and Korean warriors coming to LA, and the only hope of stopping them are two people who were reincarnated versions of these two Korean lovers. If you think my synopsis on what was happening is fuzzy, try seeing the movie, yours will be too. The plot was virtually nonexistent. Half of the movie was either a dream, or a flashback which didn't help us understand anything. Because of it's complicated story, the movie has Robert Forester explaining what's happening for about 15 straight minutes, and it explained nothing.\n\nI really hate bad clich\u00e9d movies, and amazingly this fits under that category too. The movie includes some light jokes, that were obviously meant to be funny, where instead they came off less funny than the rest of the movie. They had the 2 leads fall in love after only knowing each other for a literal 30 minutes. It had corny dialog that made me cringe. The special effects were very mediocre, just above what you'd expect on TV.\n\nIf you want a good laugh, check this out. Otherwise steer clear of it.\n\nMy rating: BOMB/****. 78 mins. PG-13 for violence"

        "review_title": "Main reasons for its popularity in South Korea",
        "review_detailed_main": "1. Patriotism\n\nPeople in S. Korea believe that D-War is going to do well in Hollywood and show the world that a Korean movie can be as successful as any other blockbusters made in U.S. They don't see D-War as a movie, they see it as a representative of their country. Hence the frantic support, just like they did for their soccer team in FIFA World Cup 2002.\n\n2. Nationality\n\nSomewhat similar to patriotism, D-War includes their national theme song 'Arirang' at the ending credits. Also during the intro of the movie one of the actors mention the words \"This is a Korean legend..\" which again amplifies the fact that it IS a KOREAN movie. Korean people just love that, as they are all eager to advertise the Korean movie to the world.\n\n3. Home-made CG\n\nUntil now, almost all of the CGs in the blockbusters made in Korea has been imported from overseas. However the CGs in D-War was actually done by a small Korean company. This was a major breakthrough for the Koreans and this adds more value to the movie in Korean people's perspective as they are able to boast about their CG skills to the rest of the world through D-War.\n\n4. Sympathy for the Director\n\nThe director of D-War 'Hyung-rae Shim' was actually a very famous and popular slapstick comedian. During the peak of his career as a comedian, he suddenly decided that he wants to create movies and went on to create quite a few low-budget movies. They were all criticized and failed horribly in the market due to their lack of quality. Shim lost most of his fortune he made as a comedian during this process and people began to sympathize for him. When Shim announced that he is making a huge blockbuster costing near $75 million U.S dollars, the public was very supportive of him and the movie as a whole.\n\nThe combination of all 4 factors mentioned above have turned D-War into a major success in Korea. However the critics have criticized the movie for its lack of plot and using the mentioned factors to lure people to see the movie. Of course non-Koreans don't care about any of these factors, they only see the movie as it is. This is why the movie won't succeed in the countries other than Korea."

But for some reason, this film is one of the very few that gets criticized for having the sort of fans. Why, because the fans are from Korea and not US? I just don't get it. The haters make it sound like people outside of Korea are all objective in their views. Not true.\n\nGo find the worst movies you've ever seen. You'd be surprised to see that each of those films have 10 ratings too. I just don't get this mentality of haters that just because they didn't think much of the film, all others who say otherwise are lying. Tsk Tsk.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of haters that have rated this film 1, so stop whining.\n\nThe biggest misperception: Koreans are sabotaging the rating system. Truth is, if Koreans really did want to manipulate the ratings, it'd have more than ~350 total ratings.\n\nAnd in case you haven't noticed, most of the thread starters and posters that spew hate on this film ARE Koreans. So, put a stop to this idea that all Koreans have somehow unified to mess with IMDb rating system. It didn't happen, and the evidence is clear.\n\nJust wait for its release in the States -09-14- and see for yourself. It won't be too late to rate the film then. Just because a few fans would rate the film 10 based on reasons that should not be relevant when rating a film, it doesn't make it right for you haters to rate the film 1 just to negate it. 1? 1? 1? Come on. 1? Really? 1? Again, -since it's worth repeating- even if you thought that, it doesn't mean all others who rate the film otherwise are wrong.\n\nYou haters act like the lonely, introverted nutjobs who were the only child in their respective family, and were babied all their lives. Here's a free lesson: People (can) have different opinions.\n\nI enjoyed this film more than I enjoyed SpiderMan3, Fantastic4II among others I've seen in recent months. Those films received a ton of 10 ratings. Seriously, were either of 'em deserving of a 10 rating? I think not, but I won't put them down nor will I give those each film a 1 rating just for the sake of negating the 10 ratings like some of you are doing to D-War. Again, cut this BS idea that Koreans have swarmed the IMDb. Only about ~350 votes right now have been tallied, including about ~75 1 ratings. Enough said. Koreans can be very exuberant. If they wanted to swarm this place, it'd have 20,000 votes easily by this coming Monday. Easily, I might add. Don't confuse exuberance with what you claim 'false nationalism.'\n\nD-War isn't up to the standards set by the LOTR. I happen to think LOTR is one of the best films ever produced, by the way. But it isn't a B-movie that the haters are attempting the smear this film to be. If you're a fan of SF/Legend/CGI fan, go see it. Or at least afford this film enough respect to withhold the judgment until you see it. Don't let these perpetual haters discourage you.\n\nThanks for reading, everybody!"

I hate flat, lifeless character-interacting scenes, I was not amused by its cheap humor that evoked very small laughter from audience, and I was at a loss during spectacularly unconvincing and unrealistic finale. In case of CG, the monsters are more or less convincing than hideous monster from 'Deep Rising'. Two attack scenes, good on their own, are just average showcasing of CG without purpose in the movie. The final showdown does not take place in L.A., and I'd rather see that leftover sets and monsters and soldiers from 'The Lord of the Rings' appearing in the middle of smashed L.A.\n\nLast year, 'Lady in the Water' introduced outrageous Korean folk tale with not-so-Korean names to U.S. audience. This year, 'D-war' will provide them another one, which is told by literally ubiquitous Robert Forster. I was glad to see Scott Wilson in 'The Host', but Robert Forster in 'D-war'? U.S. critics will probably have the field day with comparing Mr. Forster and Mr. Wilson in their respective movies. It's disheartening to see that Academy award nomination didn't help Mr. Forster's career, and the only consolation is, like Peter O'Toole in 'Phantoms', that Mr. Forster speaks some preposterous lines without laughing. That's the sign of veteran actor who started the career with 'Reflections in a Golden eye' 40 years ago. Anyway, he's still working, so don't worry folks.\n\nSpeaking of director Hyung-rae Shim, I won't say anything offending to him. He just tried hard to make the film he wanted, and now he gets his wishes. However, he does the most annoying thing I have ever seen on the screen. He seems to think quite seriously of himself and the movie, and, with lame inclusion of 'Arirang' at the end of movie, he shows production pictures with some serious statement. I hope he will never show translated version of it or whatsoever to U.S. critics. They will have gut-busting laugh. It is just like the student who submits lousy report after long, long time with some notes saying 'I tried very, very hard against all odds and this will be my magnum opus. Help me please'. I'm a graduate student who has been as ruthless as Anton Ego to undergraduates about their grade, and big minus point will be guaranteed if I have to grade the one like that.\n\nOne of the standards of late Gene Siskel is, 'Is this movie better than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?'. Mr. Shim, the answer for your movie is 'NO', and maybe you will have to prepare pretty interesting documentary 'The Making of D-War' for DVD supplement. Or, based on your 'reported' stubbornness and determination, maybe I should ask Roger Ebert about how to make Werner Herzog get interested in you. Maybe you can show Mr. Herzog that you also can move the big steamboat ship to the top of mountain. Maybe Mr. Herzog will get interested and make the documentary about your next big gamble. Now, that's the movie I'd like to see."

To be blunt, the lead acting was pretty bad, only made up for by the supporting actors like Craig Robinson, who also provided the bulk of the laughs in the film...and believe me, the laughs were needed. The special/visual effects and CGI were bad. Quite bad. I have pretty high expectations for effects, but come on, anyone can justifiably say \"wow that dragon looks pretty crappy.\" There were a few action scenes, namely the one with the dragons fighting helicopters, that were not half bad. The plot had potential but it was butchered by a poor and clich\u00e9 screenplay...\n\nThe bottom line is...Dragon Wars had potential, but they blew it. Just a lazy film and a lazy production, not completely horrible but not good either, and really not worth your time."

The bad glue-on facial hair made them even more laughable - most Asian men are incapable of growing proper facial hair - there are exceptions, but that's why you see very few Asian men with beards - but these dudes had some serious goatees.\n\nThe writing is terrible. It's like they did a survey of all the Hollywood action movies and picked out the most common lines, then tossed them all higglety-pigglety into the script.\n\nBlack Man:\"It's time you took this\" (hands White Man a gun) White Man:\"Come on, you know I hate those things\" The Black sidekick is SO ridiculously stereotyped it's almost nauseating. The fact that the main characters keep abandoning him to the bad guys in a fight makes me wonder why he would even be in the next scene, even if he survived.\n\nThe film takes place in LA, but then for readily explainable reason, the final battle scene is in some fire-roasted plain in some alternate universe - Where the Hell did this Hell come from? Dunno! At the end of the movie, all the Koreans started clapping - I have NEVER heard Koreans clap at the end of a film - even at the Pusan International Film Festival, applause is sparse - but there was almost a standing ovation a the end of this fiasco.\n\nI stood up and gave a loud raspberry. Then I went to get my money back.\n\nWhen I went back to the box office, I was FUMING - they took one look at me and handed me my money back - no questions asked.\n\nCongratulations, D-War, you've done what no Hollywood film has ever done - made me demand (and get) my money back."

Most of the CGs in the past Korean films has been done in Korea as well. Korean CG making is not at a very low level, they have quite a lot of demand and experience due to the prosperity of online game-making and film-making. Of course nowhere near at Hollywood level mainly due to much lower funding, but not that bad either. What separates this film and the previous ones were that MUCH more money and effort was invested to CG(there were hardly any films before in Korea that had used CG anywhere as much as this one), and that's what made some fanatics of this film think it is something revolutionary(for Korea that is). But again, I think they should realize that being revolutionary in Korea hardly means anything to the world.\n\nMy advice: Watch this only if you plan to see it with your kids."

There is no coherent plot, there is no coherent story line, there are no coherent actors (I'm pretty sure they had to be on something to be in this flick and think what they were doing was acting), and the CGI was almost worse than the old school use of claymation.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this movie is that it gave my boyfriend and I a lot to laugh about - first off at ourselves for being lame enough to see this movie, second after reading a lot of yahoo user reviews and reviews on here (one man said he'd shoot himself in the knee cap if anyone asked him to see this movie again) we felt highly entertained (though one could just read those reviews and avoid the movie and be fine), and third at how we could not name ONE MOVIE we've ever seen that was worse than this one.\n\nSo if you LIKE terrible movies, like REALLY terrible, then this is for you. If you like things that won't give you a headache at how RETARDED they are, don't see this."

During 20 years of watching Hollywood movies, I came across and had to cope with many, many stupid and ridiculous plots. I can't complain about this one. The scenes r visually profound and creative, and above all, very mythical & foreign. No American heroism, no same old Hollywood good vs evil/ hero vs villain fairytale--where there's always gotta be this one and only savior for all. What is unique about D-War is that its story and plot revolve around those mythical creatures and monsters rather than human hero& heroine. Monsters are beautifully rendered onto the screen and well-disposed to the taste and imagination of modern audience. Personally this movie was rather a renewing experience. Just.. sick and tired of Hollywood blockbusters involving thoughtless violence (that is somehow always gets justified at the end) and those salacious and sarcastic affairs, humors between the characters that r just getting worse and worse every time.\n\nJust Watch It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n*...Strogly recommended....*"

Only the recent Transformers movie has more city-wide destruction and carnage. This movie makes the old 60's and 70's Godzilla movies look boring.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a new batch a faces on the big movie screen. The quality of acting varies widely. This movie gets a high rating on visuals alone. The subtitles don't help anyone follow the already confusing story. It's hard at the end to determine which dragon is which. Kids should love it and adults will have some well done special effects to watch."

It was badly written, badly edited, badly directed, and badly acted. There were maybe a dozen ten year olds (clearly the target market) in the showing I saw, and two of them left halfway through. I can't imagine seeing it again to know if there were larger audiences.\n\nThe ten minutes spent explaining the plot at the beginning would have been better if it had been ten minutes of back story. The whole movie would have been better replaced with the 1507 Korea back story.\n\nThe producers spent a lot of money on CG effects, some of which would have been better spent on the script. Nearly every character in this movie was so clich\u00e9 they could have been played by a lobby card. The main characters had no chemistry, the police were incompetent, the feds were evil, and the military was reduced to helicopter pilots going 'Uh-oh' before crashing.

First of all the back and forth of the time line to set up the story was poorly done, you easily got lost and confused. The rest of the city seemed to be unaware that it had been attacked by gigantic reptile creatures and were living their lives in blissful ignorance. Then there was the strange scene changes...where the hell did that city come from?

Dragon Wars did not have good CG; go onto a Peer-2-Peer file sharing community and find some 5 minute short animations that have no point and are free/legal for trading and you will see some good CG that serves no other purpose than to get that creator's name out into the world and they far surpass what \"D-War\" has put out. Here, I'll shorten this up a bit by saying \"D-War\" was likely created by some people with a little extra money to spend and WAY too much time on their hands that had heard some legend or just an old dragon story somewhere and thought they'd make a movie out of it. I couldn't get online last night and had nothing else to watch, otherwise I would have stopped. Now that I have thrown this 2 hours of my life away into limbo, I hope I can spare you the same fate. Let me go so far as to argue against other user reviews: this movie is not a good kids movie, not a casual adult movie, and it was not \"something to blow time on a rainy Saturday.\" Read a book on you rainy Sat. before you bother watching this travesty of a film.

It's only 90 minutes, which make it better than the overlong Transformers. It's best in the middle, when the U.S. army fights the monsters in the streets of LA; you can focus on the spectacle, and ignore the drivel that surrounds it. But the beginning has too much exposition (some claptrap about good and evil dragons, reincarnated lovers, and destiny), and by the end I was having trouble telling the good and evil lizards apart. Dragon Wars steals shamelessly from iconic movies like Godzilla, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and The Terminator, but doesn't come close to achieving iconic status itself. This is the sort of movie that's best to watch at three o'clock in the morning when you're stoned. Do yourself a favor: save your money and rent The Host on DVD instead."

I have no idea how the they came up with the imoogi thing, and using actors from the western coast made it even harder to accept. I guess it's a kid's movie afterall. I only find it interesting on the fighting scenes of the second half of the movie. After you seen a lot shitty movies, you just don't care about the plot anymore."

A cross between Spiderman, King Kong, LOTR and Star Wars - if you see it you'll understand. Also lots of cheap laughs aimed at the 12 year olds that worked for this big kid too.\n\nSure, there's little disagreement that the story sucks, the acting is barely passable, the plot confusingly complex and full of holes but you could say exactly the same thing for Star Wars if you hadn't been culturally saturated with the Star Wars mythos.\n\nAnd at least you won't have to put up with Jar Jar Binks..."

I wonder what elementary school they currently attend.\n\nSo many stupid things were said or done during this movie, it would be impossible to recount them all. It sure looked like the \"evil\" dragon won the last battle. I hope so, I ended up pulling for the evil forces to eliminate every other actor on the set. The leading male actor was beyond bad.

It's hard to find what the budget was. The consensus appears to be around $70 million. That's almost Hollywood blockbuster standard. I think this movie is going to have the same reception in America as in Korea. Bad from the critics but a big success with the public. The group that I went with ( there were 6 of us) all loved it."

Made me waste $6, 1-2 hours of time in Korea during summer break\n\n\"The Host\", \"Old boy\" are both korean movies that are A lot better than this.\n\nAnd to respond to some of the comments given on this movie saying it reached an overwhelming record of views in Korea, it was because this movie was advertised so vigorously on all korean channels every freakin' 10 minutes before and during the show in the theaters in Korea. with such overrated comments about this movie in the newspapers and the media saying \"Ground breaking computer graphics!\", \"Epic Sci-Fi film of our nation!\" and no im not joking/lying. maybe they don't understand what Sci-fi means?\n\nanyways... /end rant"

Politically Correct Americans will cringe as they are faced with a variety of kitsch stereotype characters that are borrowed from other American films. The Korean pandering to what it perceives as the American audience is heavy handed and super obvious and detracts from what makes foreign films interesting- the foreignness. The director works very hard to try and compete in an American fluff action film market and in doing so gives up style, creativity and imagination. The action sequences look like they were lifted directly from Jurassic park or star wars and are unrealistic at best, cartoonish at worst.\n\nMake no mistake- this is a VERY FUN B movie if you understand that this is a stupid B movie- it is gloriously cheesy including a dark army horde headed up by a Darth Vader style villain complete with an organic version of the Empire Strikes Back's famous battle scene on Hoth, only this time it is in Korea using dragons. There are lots of OH NO GODZILLA scenes as well.\n\nIf you remove all expectations from the actors to act, and instead expect the movie to play out like a crappy comic book- then you will enjoy this. IF you wanted to see a movie about dragons that is cool and exciting- skip this movie.\n\nIt seems to be a law in film making that every dragon movie and every vampire movie has to suck. A small handful of films have escaped this MacBeth-like curse. That's sad since those themes are the two most popular themes in legend you would think someone would take the time to treat sacred legends as sacred instead of a schlock filler for their lack of imagination in creating a script.\n\nSIDE NOTE: Americans that ignorantly bought into the terrorism fear campaign orchestrated by our unelected dictator-in-chief Herr Bush may cringe at various scenes of aircraft flying into New York buildings- it may remind you of the twin towers too much."

        "review_detailed_main": "You can tell whoever made this wanted something big, something on the scale of a Lord of the Rings type film, but with some modern settings; however, it fails. This is probably due to a lack of budget as most of the effects are none too good as the dinosaurs from the 1993 Jurassic Park look more alive. Then again, as fake as the dragons look, they feel more real than the actors performances in this thing. I also get the feeling the makers just wanted to get to the rampaging as there are just so many characters relegated to seemingly important plot points but with no backstory! They just appear and do stuff to advance the plot and vanish like the wind!\n\nThe story, two dragons need to eat one particular girl to become more powerful! One is evil and one is good. A news reporter sees something that triggers a flashback that triggers another flashback and we learn of the tragic and stupid tale. The reporter who is played by a guy that was probably voted most bland man of the year in 2007 then must find the girl who makes Kristen Stewart during her Twilight run look Oscar worthy and he must grab her by the arm and pull her as a big snake like dragon comes after them! We then get an attack on L. A. before going to the set of Mortal Kombat II for the finish!\n\nThe effects at time look okay, but even when it looks like all this awesome stuff is happening and there is devastation the buildings look absolutely fine underneath. It is like you see debris flying everywhere, but no actual damage. The acting is beyond subpar and as I said, so many characters popping up with virtually no story, like the doctor and the hypnosis which accomplished nothing.\n\nThe movie had some entertaining moments within it, too bad they could not do a bit better with the technical stuff and get better actors. I am unclear why they chose to film this in L. A. rather than somewhere in Korea, it would have been nice if the lead guy was not so useless as his former self was way more cool."

It might have been more worthwhile for the director to have placed Barbie and ken dolls on screen. There are millions of incredibly talented AND attractive actors begging for work out there - what happened?\n\nJason Behr, so watchable in Roswell, seems to be on Prozac and is acted off the screen by his own hairdo and fashion choices. You know an actor isn't giving their all when you tune out of their line delivery to wonder where they got that great 70's shirt.\n\nAmanda Brooks is truly dreadful. She seems to have been cast for a vague resemble to Sarah Michelle Gellar (the last scene has her costumed and hairdo'd remarkably like Buffy) - but unlike Gellar she has all the emotive power of a wet flannel. Watch her during a dramatic moment when Behr puts his life on the line for her - she looks vaguely concerned, as if Behr has developed a slight cough - maybe she should get some Vicks? WAKE UP!!\n\nThis could have been a solid B movie, fun all the way through, but sadly it has true DVD status given this viewer's keen desire for the evil dragon to eat the leads."

About the time Dragon Wars hits its halfway point, it becomes an all-out special effects bonanza that tries desperately to emulate the level of insanity and destruction that directors like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich were known for. And if that's all you're coming for, I suppose it's not the worst thing in the world.\n\nBut it's everything surrounding the ridiculous \"war\" scene that's the problem. This movie doesn't have a plot so much as it has the suggestion of events, buffered by repeated bait-and-switch dream sequences. Can't understand what's going on? That's fine, it's probably just another dream. Still can't understand what's going on? Welcome to Dragon Wars.\n\nIt's best to not question it and go with the flow, because the movie isn't going to make any effort to help you understand why any given thing is happening. Given that Dragon Wars is apparently based on an ancient Korean legend, perhaps it's just something lost in translation. But if that's the case, there's still no excuse for making it this incomprehensible. Characters come and go without any explanation as to who they were or why they were relevant, and random, inscrutable things seem to happen only to be hand waved away as being \"just magic.\"\n\nIt's hard to convey just how little regard the film has for its own level of coherency. I've somehow ended up seeing this movie three times now, and only by reading a plot synopsis on the internet (by people who are likely familiar with the original legend) did any of it begin to make any sense whatsoever.\n\nAt the very least, you could consider this to be a poor adaptation of whatever Korean legend it is technically based upon. But you definitely can't pretend it's a good movie. Not in any way shape or form."

The characters are good looking, young and dressed as fashionable to be. As much as they are good looking, the characters are boring and unintelligent through out the movie. The story of the legend is laid out like a Princess Bride style story telling narration, then jumps right into scenes with high quality CGI, unfortunately that's its only strong point, the CGI.\n\nThis movie looks like a well done, very clean, Hong Kong style movie. It doesn't even compare to most of the Korean films that have done well. This movie is to entertain kids for a couple hours but it seems it COULD have been interesting movie for adults 18 to 35, but it looks like they aimed the story to be for kids from the jumping around scenes, shallow character development and high number of very expensive CGI scenes which have a resemblance to scenes done by Lucas Art and the Star Wars movies.\n\nIn comparison to other Dragon movies, it's not even close to being as good as the classic of Dragon Slayer and also sub-par film, The Last Dragon, which was a joke of a film but it was entertaining with a comedic element to it. Both these past Dragon films have characters whom one could relate and follow through out the film while D-Wars is a cold, CGI filled film with real live human action in it for some reason."

All of this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.\n\nThe story was standard, but the portrayal of the story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen. Why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The serpent dragon's actions itself was very poorly written... and the serpent dragon's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie, several times the main characters should have died.\n\nThe director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not watched after it was made, I love movies, but had to force myself to finish watching it, thank god I did not buy this, I borrowed it from a friend.\n\nDo not buy this, do not rent it, just watch discovery channel... much more exciting."

The CG was not credible, and really calling a big snake a dragon does not work.\n\nThe story, well it had potential, with some changes here and there, but no, for some reason they decided to keep it. I'm not sure if the movie was made for adults or children, but I don't think it works for either.\n\nI believe far to much money was wasted on this production, I think they would gotten better results they had burned the money and tried to heat a cup of tea with it."

The computer generation is not the best I have in past few years but it is not that bad. The way the dragons look in this movie is actually awesome that was probably the best part about the movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "DON'T BE CONFUSED by the controversy!!! This movie is just AWFUL!!! AWFUL!!! AWFUL!!! (I won't go into the details as others have done so already.) It's not worth the money to see it at the theater. Anyone who attempts to cloud the issue are either people who have stakes in D-war or fanatic fans of Shim Hyung Rae. (Shim Hyung Rae is a very influential comedian in Korea.) You will ask me then \"Why should I believe you? Like why should you care whether I see D-war at the movies or not?\" Well, to me it's a matter of principle. A good movie should succeed. Bad movies should fail. This is not the case with D-war up till now. And this frustrates me. Sort of like seeing a criminal get away with a heinous crime and being helpless to do anything about it. I felt as if I had to do something against this awful movie that gobbled up my 7000 won and wasted 90 minutes of my time. Anyway everybody agrees that D-war is a bad movie not worth the money to see at the theater. But nevertheless, over 7 million people have gone to the theater to see D-war in Korea. (In fact, this is the main reason why Freestyle Realising was encouraged into opening D-war in more than 1500 screens on 9/14) How did this unthinkable thing happen? Several reasons come to my mind...\n\n1. Tremendous marketing effort...\n\nThe guy who markets D-war definitely is a professional worth his salt. He's a ruthless individual who makes use of any and all opportunity. Like for example, a few days after D-war opened in Korea, a gay director made a negative comment about D-war in his personal blog. Normally this shouldn't have amounted to anything as few people visited his blog. But what ensued afterward is a gay bashing thing like I've never seen in Korea. (Normally, homosexuality is a non-issue that Koreans are too embarrassed to even talk about in Korea. But not this time.) The marketers of D-war claimed that Shim Hyung Rae was a \"good Korean\" who made \"good movies\" that were suitable for children's viewing, while other directors in Korea made homosexual or violent movies that were bad for children. Of course this is quiet ridiculous. Shim's movies are just AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL and so completely TASTELESS.. (I'm 100% sure that D-war is actually more harmful to children than a pornographic snuff film.) If you wanna see an example of Shim's work, see Yonggary aka Reptilian. You should be able to download it somewhere. And you'll see what I mean. The only difference between D-war and Yonggary is the CG.. The drama part has not improved at all. It's become worse. Well, actually, at least Yonggary was sort of watchable. You could write it off as a really really really badly made cheesy amateur B- movie. But not D-war. D-war is definitely NOT a B-movie. You can clearly see that enough money ($70 MILLION dollars in all) has been spent on it to at least qualify it as a non-B movie. So you can't but help drawing comparisons with other non-B movies and it just makes it simply too unwatchable. It just sort of makes you feel like a complete fool. No, I didn't say that right. You sort of feel as if you're BECOMING a complete fool by watching D-war. As if you're being contaminated by something really sickeningly disgusting. Even people who like watching \"bad\" movies should stay away from D-war. How can I explain what the affect of watching D-war is like? Like for example, imagine you went to the hospital to get surgery to remove your appendix. And the doctor gave you brain surgery instead and removed your pre-frontal lobe. That's what seeing D-war is like. It's just simply AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL...\n\n2. Korean Patriotism.\n\nKoreans are among the most nationalistic people in the world. Most Koreans feel that it is their \"duty\" to go see D-war because D-war is being exported to the States.\n\n3. The trailers..\n\nOh, the D-war trailers for D-war were beautifully crafted by the D-war marketing people and I can't give them enough praise!!! Too bad the actual movie is nothing like the trailers.\n\nWell, actually, I've changed my mind. Please DOOOOOOOOOO see this movie!!!!!! So there would be more people to join the cause against this movie!!! I'm beginning to think that maybe there should be something like an \"director's license\" or something. The public should be protected from people like Shim Hyung Rae. Like if you were to make a list of people who shouldn't be allowed to make movies, Shim Hyung Rae would be at the top of the list."

While I certainly have a healthy respect for other's opinions, this was clearly children rating movies. What use to make IMDb good was the fact you could trust the rating system (unlike Yahoo that is overwhelmed with 13 year old give a 10 out of 10 to any fart movie that comes out). Sadly, IMDb has strayed from is roots...\n\nNow back to the movie...In some 500 year repetitive cycle it seems that dragons can make their way to the starry heavens. Of course, there is always an evil one that wants all the glory and this will prove no exception. The story line includes a 20 minute back story and narration so we have some vague notion as to why we are watching this poor excuse of a movie. As a note, if it take you 20 minutes to explain the premise of a storyline then it is not worth telling.\n\nThe acting is wooden (too bad for Jason Behr who once showed promise) and the special effects belong on a Sci-fi original movie. The good guys are bad actors and the bad guys are even worse. Strangely, the storyline seems to wander which is surprising since so much time was spent telling us why all this is happening. I would love to find something redeeming in the film and the only thing I can come up with is that the critics were spared a pre-screening since this movie was so bad that it should have not only skipped the theatre but the DVD release as well. It wasn't worth the ticket price (I did get a free pass from AMC Theaters after viewing it) and isn't even worth a rental or wasting 1 hr 40 minutes if it were free on TV.\n\nHere is some good advice, don't listen to 13 year old and don't go see this movie."

Please let this not be a trend. This is one of the most inept films I've ever sat through. Dull, terribly edited and directed, with an incomprehensible plot and just plain bad CGI monsters. There are times when this reaches the coveted so-bad-it's-good level, but it takes way too long to get to the titular war. When that starts happening, it's laughable and entertaining (for all the wrong reasons, of course). The two leads are utterly boring. Jason Behr in particular seems like the homeless man's Skeet Ulrich. And it's pretty sad that they kill off the cute minority girl (Aimee Garcia) and keep around the homely white chick (Amanda Brooks) to be the heroine. It's kind of sad in general that Korean filmmakers would have their legendary heroes reincarnated as faux-hot white people. I guess they were thinking they knew their audience. But then again, they don't. Why would anyone feel Americans would like to sit through a movie where their military gets decimated by a bunch of lizards? I think even war supporters are more than a little sick of seeing soldiers die, and more soldiers die in the approximately 20 minute-long D-War than have died in the Iraq War. There's one awful(ly humorous) scene where a pilot flies his helicopter into a skyscraper. We see the man jump out of the copter, as if he's going to escape, but, no, KABLOOEY! I feel sorry for all the nobodies who had to appear in this movie. Sure, they got a pay check, but who would really want to put this on their resum\u00e9? I particularly feel sorry for character actor and Oscar nominee Robert Forster. He clearly got paid the most for his appearance, seeing as he's the most recognizable face. I know character actors do whatever comes their way, but there is the occasional time when you should choose to retain your dignity."

First of all I watching the previews and then 20 minutes goes by, and then it dawns on me this movie started 15 minutes ago. All I could say was \"Rescue Me\" this is horror that I didn't even know it started. There were no titles at the beginning. But this movie was so full of flaws, not to mention the cheesy acting. Who ever thought this movie was good has absolutely no taste. Another note I was dragged to going and seeing this movie. This was not a movie I wanted to go see in the first place. But sure enough I thought about 20 times leaving this crap bomb. But let me say this movie is called Dragon Wars, and The 2 main creatures weren't even dragons but giant snakes. The only time you saw a dragon was at the very end when one apparently earned it's wings for some unknown reason, But at this point I was just wanting to get the hell out of the movie. There were too many scenes in this movie to count when I shook my head and laughed at the stupidity. Two scenes in particular were when the army was attacking the super evil army from years in the past, and they were shooting at absolutely nothing. Another scene was how conveniently the 2 main characters find out that they are part of a destiny to stop this unstoppable force and magically find each other in this mess. This movie was made for the effects only, and that is all it had going for it. But with a Craptastic story, acting, and characters you just don't care about. Its pointless. And that 1 out of 10 review isn't a typo. Its for real. Avoid this crap fest at all cost.\n\nDragon Wars (D-Wars) (2007) Review: 1/10"

I look forward to sequel, \"Dragon Wars II, I lost my Marbles\". Were any animals harmed while filming this movie?"

While not for high brow critics looking for Academy Award fare, this is far better. A movie that pleases everyone and makes going to the movies fun again. Love watching Dragons attack Los Angeles. What could be better! See it on the first weekend! The story goes from ancient Korea and the legend of the good dragon and the bad dragon and the love of two people and transcends time to modern day Los Angeles, where the star crossed lovers are reincarnated and still under peril from both the good and the bad dragons. The dragons fight it out on the streets of L. A. in search of the girl who has the power to save to world. It's a roller coaster ride filled with some of the best special effects this year. And very funny too. A +"

The evil side was too strong when confront with modern army. Kind of old Dune stuff that could shield bullet, first time seen in films. Those moving giant rocket carrier, very superior for Hollywood. Maybe the idea is coming from S.Korean games or Blizzard's famous game \"Warcraft\"."

Most of the time, I spent the viewing thinking, \"Wow, this is a hybrid of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Godzilla\". The acting was awful by Jason Behr, and the rest of the cast that shall remain nameless...and mainly forgettable. However, one thing cannot be denied in this film, and that was the special effects. The dragons, the weird creatures that were never fully explained, were all very well done, and had that same muted naturalistic look like the autobots and decepticons in Transformers. Come to think of it, it was done very much in the styles of Michael Bay, and the score was actually done by Hans Zimmer's troupe that actually worked on Transformers. I watched the special features and learned that Director Hyung-rae Shim was making his first attempt at breaking the international scene. He mentioned that rather than using a design company for his special effects, he created his own. This, I have great respect for. He said, in so many words, something that I agree wholeheartedly with: There are two \"T\"'s in movies, Talent, and Technology. Perhaps he needed to work a bit on Talent part of those \"T\"'s."

The actual story is fresh and the computer graphics were good (come on. ADMIT IT. and on that budget??) BUT The storyline was bad. The script was worse. The acting was quite puke inducing. The arirang part at the end screamed inferiority complex on part of Mr Shim.\n\nPlus, I've been reading some of the reviews and there are comments on the number of years it took to make this pretty crappy movie. The only reason that the movie took so long to produce was because investors kept pulling out and the production company was broke most of the time.\n\nPoor guy. At least kids like it.. right?"

This movie was literally, the FIRST movie I've ever watched that if I wasn't with my kids (who were, shamefully to me and my genetic code, enjoying themselves) I would have walked out and demanded my money back.\n\nBetween the lame one-liners and the terrible CGI effects (I'll explain why later), and the so-so script, it was just too overwhelmingly bad to stick around for.\n\nThe reason why I say the CGI was bad: If you remember watching old CGI movies where the color of the CGI characters was washed out slightly, making the CGI creatures or men seem like they were not part of the movie...you'll understand why I say horrible. They kind of reminded me of up dated Last Starfighter special effects. In D-War, there were these huge battle scenes, where one army was lined up and you could literally see some of the 3D animated characters \"hopping\" if you've ever seen bad CGI, I hope you know what I mean.\n\nThe acting, script and one-liners were on par with Eragon, which is to say, putrescent.\n\nSave your money...if you want to see a good \"city fighting scene\" go rent some old Godzilla flicks...they are more enjoyable than this...at least then, you can laugh at the cheesy special effects rather than the presumably good special effects that are far from."

The characters are flat, unrealistic, and at times just plain ridiculous. The plot is nearly nonsensical.\n\nAt first, I thought that ninety minutes was rather short for a movie of its nature, but it turns out that an accumulative thirty minutes of it was completely trivial and could have been cut. Twenty minutes into it I desperately wanted to leave, but sadly I was not the one who drove there (not that I didn't contemplate the hour long walk). I have never been so bored watching beasts devour and/or maim a city full of bystanders, no matter how intense the musical score is trying to make it.\n\nI am embarrassed that I sat through this thing.

There's no Korean legend about a girl sacrificed every 500 hundred years for a snake transforming into a dragon, or any other purpose, period. The small flying dragons with wings have no place in a Korean or any other eastern legend, they are from a western legend, if any. The creature with a rocket launcher on its back? Give me a break. They are more likely based on legends of Star Wars. The only relevant legend is that Korea, like any other eastern Asian country, has a legend about a dragon and a saying that an old snake transforms into a dragon. But, a 50-foot snake? That comes from King Kong.\n\nDirector Shim is a marketing guru. When he was questioned about incoherent script/story line of his movie, he said that his movie, dragon war, is not for the local Korean audience, it is targeting the American market and American people. Shim said that Americans mostly don't care about movie script or story lines. Shim repeatedly mentioned that American movies like \"Lord of Rings\" or \"Spiderman\" didn't have a good story line but made a huge revenue in the US market.\n\nHe was quite right. Dragon war was #5 movie in the first week in the US. Shim already said that, based on the success of dragon wars in the US market, many major distributors are asking him about dragon wars 2 and he is considering releasing dragon war 2 in 2009 summer, the main movie season, directly competing against other major Hollywood movies.\n\nShim is a very shrewd business man and his movies are all about making money."

I bought this film this very weekend with high expectations, and finished it just now. I came straight online to see what other reviews it got and I am glad to see that I was not the only one who was left mind- boggled at its inadequacy. Where to start...it really was that bad!\n\nFirst off, it was too short. From experience, most films under this are usually cheap and not well produced; understatement of the century!\n\nNow I'm English - fair enough the director, is 'supposedly' a very popular comedian in Korea, but do you see Peter Kay running about directing films? No. Simple as.\n\nThe Plot - Transformers attempt with Dragons is what most people expected. Difference is, Transformers had a plot - this had nothing. It was not made clear at all when the plot kept branching off, maybe this was through time restrictions, but I guess they just blew the whole 75mil on CGI! I found myself constantly laughing with clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9. How did two random strangers meet up, and in the same day, understand what was happening without actually explaining how their fates were linked, and GET OFF WITH EACH OTHER? What the hell was that about? Okay, they loved each other in a previous life, but seriously, cm-on.. Oh, and the random inaudible gurgling from the 'guy in black'. Too much went wrong with the plot to explain the rest..\n\nACTING (oh dear) - I had to mention the chase sequence through the tunnel (Ethan, Sarah and reporter friend) first because I just couldn't believe what I was seeing! Okay, he was told of a snake but they could have at least showed some emotion when a 300 foot long snake is chasing you - THEY JUST KEPT TURNING AROUND - ?!?!? - I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. At the end, it was the old 'did you see that'. Oh dear.\n\nOkay, if you're 8 with no clue what is ACTUALLY going on, then you'll love it, or if you're Korean who had actually heard of this before the film. Anyone else - do not, I repeat, do not waste an hour and a half of your life over this monstrosity. If Koreans enjoy this, then I have to say, they have a warped sense of entertainment. That was a shocking performance in all aspects except CGI. The creatures to be fair were well made. That's all I'm gonna say. Oh, and did anyone see the choppers which manoeuvred like F16's? It was a joke from start to finish, I am tempted just to destroy this film now. But hey, you could play a good prank and give it to someone to watch, claiming it's the best film you've ever seen - they would probably come for you in the night!\n\nP.S L.A >>> Mordor - WHAT....THE....*AHEM*....HAPPENED.....THERE..."

These creatures are quite \"real\", especially the last dragon's motion that \"truly\" behaves like an oriental dragon. The human fighting is also attractive too. The master suddenly shot fire from his hand & jump over water so \"naturally\" that you won't notice he is hanging by wire. Some big kung fu movies can't even match these.

The CGI was impressive & made the film even better although i don't think it was worth the $70 million or however much they spent on making this film as you could see better CGI in films such as Appleseed, final fantasy VII Advent children or Beowulf. the characters were well introduced & had good development over the duration of the film. the storyline wasn't perfect but was still quite interesting & held up until the end when it got a bit confusing & seemed a bit rushed. apart from that it was a pretty good film which i think if you get the chance you should see but only if you think it is your kind of thing as this would not appeal to everyone. well worth a watch."

This movie sucked the big one in soooo many ways! Poor acting, stupid dumb characters, bad directing and edited like a bad fan movie, next to zero plot and what plot there was could have made barely 30mins of movie, terrible set pieces, badly directed cgi... etc... etc... etc...\n\nLooks like they blew the budget on the cgi and forgot about the rest, even though the cgi was fairly poor by todays standards (see transformers)... in fact, that's my advice to you if you are thinking about seeing this movie, SEE TRANSFORMERS!... even if you've already seen it 50 times already, see it again and don't bother with this RUBBISH!\n\nI feel like suing for the hour and 40 minutes of my life I can't get back! ;)"

I've seen school plays acted and directed better than this. Seems to me that the makers of this movie have spent the biggest piece of their money on colorful presentation of computer graphics and saved nothing for actors. ... ...I don't want to spend more words.\n\nReally, skip this one.

It felt at times like watching a computer game but that is probably unfair as even computer games give their characters some body or background. The acting was indeed animated and rather like the days of gaming on the Amstrad! Robert Foster deserves to be given a much more challenging role in a much more sensible and structured movie. A far cry from the glory days of 'Jackie Brown', Foster can only move on to better things.\n\nI really don't know who this film is for. I can't even see the easily pleased falling for this one. If you go to your local cinema, just to catch a flick trust me, there will always be something better on. If you feel that by some strange desire you must see this film I would encourage you to drink your favourite beer or spirit to excess before taking the plunge!! Be warned."

In an instance, I'm a quarter-fan of Jason Behr (no fully as you notice), and expected a flawless performance, indeed Jason Behr never failed my intuitions, but like other commentators pointed out as well, maybe the crew behind and the other cast brought the movie down. The story would be enthralling but was overly emphasized and applied in the film, the special effects was way too crazy but at some points made the scene quite unbelievably boring. I wish could have been fixed further more before cracking its shell and prance all the way to theaters, but the film was a failure."

At some points it's almost painfully illogical and cheesy and the acting was more or less none existent but there is just so much nice action going on throughout most of the movie it's just a great ride. It even had a couple of really funny moments (the mighty bad knight getting hit by a car twice in 2 or 3 minutes for example really made me laugh, well executed *g*).\n\nThere are many movies with better special effects but in my opinion what you get here is just fine and you get loads of them. If you like monster movies like Godzilla where the whole city gets destroyed, this is just what you wanna watch. When the show down starts you really feel like in the middle of a huge war zone.\n\nYou have to be able to switch your brain off while this movie runs but if you are able to do so you will be rewarded plenty.\n\nI give it a 5/10."

It is all too overcomplicated and would be much better just being what it is: a good monster flick. The destruction of LA is well-done, but I still was, honestly, pretty bored. Nothing new, just looked a lot like Transformers etc;\n\nI'm afraid this will only be popular (outside of Korea) with a small audience: it just doesn't create enough plausibility to really work.\n\nWorth watching on TV but not worth your eight bucks at the movies - the special effects work well on the big screen, but the rest is just yeuuuu....\n\nSorry guys, no monster hit."

Seriously.\n\nThe actors give poor performances, as well as the entire supporting cast. The dialogue is also a joke. Even the voice acting is crummy and the soundtrack unremarkable, but the reason this film deserves a 7 out of 10 is truly the realistic effects and brilliant battle sequences.\n\nIt's exactly like a Sci-Fi channel original movie with bad acting, silly writing, and dumb special effects... only in Dragon Wars, the special effects are phenomenal. If you're a fantasy nerd, and want to kill an hour and a half of your time, then crack open a couple beers and enjoy D-Wars.

The only thing i liked was the cgi, and it seemed to me like they spent all their money on a special effects guy who did a great job btw but then had him write the script. Yes its that bad.

However, the action was fairly well done, the battle in the city was the best part of the movie, the action shots were pretty impressive considering how poor the acting and the plot was in the movie. Again, you cannot watch this movie and look for a deep plot or story mainly because you will not find it, but the movie is entertaining, and even funny at points, just because the fact that there is a legit war going on between humans and dragon/dinosaur type things.

However, the over use of unnecessary subtitles, coupled with a horrible storyline made this an abysmal waste of time.\n\nSpecial effects were OK, but in this day and age of CGI and computer animation I would expect no less. Unfortunately as cool as some of the scenes were it couldn't save the acting, storyline, and just overall laughability of this movie.\n\nI would probably let my kids watch it only to show them an example of how bad a potentially good movie could have been. Plus I don't think they would make it through the first half hour with all the subtitles. There was very little blood for a violent dragon infested movie so depending on what you are concerned with I do say its fine for my young ones. They have been brought up in a household of online gamers and understand the difference between the real and unreal when its on TV, but people do get eaten and lots are killed, its just not graphic in nature when it happens."

I rated it a 2 for two reasons, the CGI is fantastic, and there are 2 scenes where the main bad guy in the plot gets it by a car, and they are the 2 times in my life where I have laughed the hardest. Other than those 2 things, it really was a bad movie. The idea of incorporating the old kung-fu master is SO corny and stupid, that I was able to guess it from the beginning. You need to be really young, or really appreciate CGI to think this movie is better than 3 or 4 stars. Why this movie is doing better than some other very good, but unknown movies/not in theater movies is beyond me. Overall, ONLY watch this movie if your kids REALLY beg you to, because you WILL be bored."

D-War struck me as potentially the worst, and most confusing, storyline in the history of the business. For the movie buff with little patience, D-War will make you count the tiles on your ceiling. The story gave little hope to the actors abilities as the script was written in riddles from the start. The only positives i can give to finished product was that one of the main characters dies in the end, finally getting rid of the wooden display of theatrics. Like many of its brothers (godzilla, king Kong), the main story was acted out on the mean streets of the USA, the perfect battleground for an age old myth. The reality was invisible and frustrating and i was counting down to the obvious final scene. I read D-War stands for \"Dragon War\", don't believe the hype kids, it stands for \"Did i just spend 2 hours out my life watching this crap!!-War\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "My friends and I used to watch this when we have had bad movie nights. It's so ridiculously bad you will laugh pretty much every time the movie is supposed to be serious or dramatic. The intro features giant Jabba- like turtle creatures with cannons and people being slashed to death by giant swords without even suffering a visible rift on their clothes.\n\nIt also shows defenders with colorful carnival costumes making a hopeless defense, freeze the picture when it shows a group of defenders at the wall, you have to. Be aware of the scene in the intro where the dude and the girl fall from a cliff to escape the snake. It looks like the guy is first considering to defend her but then suddenly goes \"fuck this\", grabs her and jump down. You also have to laugh at the flying old ninjas fighting in the forest. This movie simply has a countless number of hilarious scenes where none was supposed to be.\n\nThe fact that the giant snake is never seen by any citizen when roaming around the city in the beginning of the movie is so annoyingly unlikely. This movie is impossible to be take seriously. If you're about to see it you MUST 1: Count how many times Ethan and his girl runs/drives away from the giant snake and then stops to talk and relax, at for example the beach or at a restaurant before the snake suddenly reappears and the same thing happens over again. And 2: How many Asian people are named Kim or Chen in the closing credits text at the end. Might be cultural ignorance or something but we couldn't stop laughing.\n\nFrom a serious POV it deserves no stares at all, it's a mess. On the other hand it's a ridiculous mess. If you want to watch a good, solid, serious fantasy-movie, RUN, RUN FAST. However, if you want to watch one of the funniest \"not supposed to be a comedy\"-movies ever it's a MUST. This movie hangs in the balance between the fact that it's unbelievably bad and the fact that it's one of the funniest movies ever, which makes it a 5.\n\nIt's like the leaning tower of Pisa, the constructors failed and that's what made it famous."

The story line jumped around and gave you no real feel for this movie. The actors were second rate on all counts and would have been better with Japanese actors wit sub titles or at least equal. CG had many mistakes in it, they tried to use the blur effect to demonstrate fast moving animation and it just made my eyes hurt. Don't go pay for this very poorly done and obviously rushed film. I think it will be on video in the next month or so. In the bargain bin in 3 months, not that it will justify a rental or even a 1.99 purchase.

I will give it some credit and say that the scenery and settings are beautiful and the effects while not great are at least decent, an asset I was dubious about in all honesty. The dragons do look imposing and do have presence which does elevate things a lot. But oh my goodness so many things spoilt Dragon Wars. The direction is nothing but flat, everything just lacks life and nothing stands out. The dialogue is very poor, with cheesy one-liners and hackneyed flow of the overall script, while no time at all is spent developing the characters, all they are at the end of the day are standard and in some cases annoying clich\u00e9s. I have no better news about the acting either, Jason Behr is hopelessly wooden and has no charisma whatsoever. Robert Forster was the best of the entire cast, and even he was generic. But what really made Dragon Wars as bad as it was was the story. It is one thing to have a simple story, but when it is over-simplistic and structurally thin that is another matter entirely. Everything lumbered on with no sense of heart, surprises or excitement while any climatic scenes felt rushed. Overall, the production values and dragons are not bad, but everything else pretty much is. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

This is exactly how not to make a summer film. I felt bad to see an Oscar nominated actor Robert Forster) be part of this garbage. There is something completely pathetic about more and more companies trying to copy the tried and true and completely overly done Hollywood formula. I realize monster CG fights are cheaper to make now more than ever that they can now afford to make, but not only are they done poorly, a lot of us are tired of all special effects with little to no story! *cough* \"Spiderman 3\" w/ it's hundred plot points and twenty different characters for example. I laughed at the absurdity of the story, the dialog, and the absolute terrible acting! Now as bad as this was S. Korea did do another CG Monster flick called \"The Host\" and it was pretty good. It wasn't great but it seemed Oscar worthy compared to this. Their best decision though was working on getting a pretty good script, and getting their monster done by ILM. (George Lucas' Oscar winning special effects company Industrial Light & Magic.) I think that if you were to watch this w/a bunch of buddies and didn't take it all seriously, and made fun of the terrible wooden acting, the crummy special effects, then maybe it might be a fun watch, I don't know.

First of all, this movie was not meant for every ages, since when did we as an adult start watching happy feet or transformers? I personally do not want to waste my valuable money to watch these movies with my friends considering my age as 18. However, I do go watch these movies with the KIDS such as my LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER respecting the fact that the KIDS would like it. Of course a movie like this that was meant for the kids are not gonna satisfy every aspect that we have because of the fact it was meant for the kids. It would have been better to have a strong plot for the adults to enjoy as well, but for the kids, this movie surely do open their eyes and the parents can teach the kids saying how there are all different kinds of movies and cultures out there. I highly do give a credit for a director considering a fact that it must have very hard for him to make a movie like this in U.S. as a first Korean director. Therefore, because I respect the director's effort for the movie and the cultural facts of this movie, I highly recommend this movie to open kids' and your mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never heard of this movie and just watched it on ShowTime Arabia while on business in Kuwait and thought it was much better than I thought it would be. Several points of criticism would be: 1) the energy level for the two leads (Sarah & Ethan) was a little too low; 2) several plot holes (i.e. the dragon seems to mysteriously know where Sarah is at a given time and then can't seem to know where Sarah is at a given time); 3) the anemic response by the Dept of Defense of a significant attack on LA, when all they can do is send in a few Apache helicopters? Where were the fighters, etc; 4) the final dragon-on-dragon fight at the end goes on a little too long. On a positive note: 1) the special effects were excellent; 2) the military jargon was spot on; 3) I liked Craig Robinson (from NBC's The Office (USA)), Elizabeth Pena is always good in any roll and is really due for a major part in large Hollywood movie, and finally both Robert Forester and the FBI Agents & Sec of Defense were fine. Of special note is the energy and emotion brought to the screen by the Korean actors, all excellent and in many ways better than their American counter-parts. I think D-War could be somewhat better if it could be tightened up here and there to shorten some of the battle scenes (Korean fight 500 yrs ago, LA battle, dragon-on-dragon)."

It's like Optimus Prime being the star of the transformers. Not LaBeouf. That's why the title is \"Dragon Wars\" not \"human wars.\" And i don't see anything wrong with the two imoogies'performances.

She gets reincarnated in modern days and it's up to him, another woman and Craig Robinson to find this woman now called Sarah and protect her. The war elements with the grneric looking star wars creatures are pretty creative even if bad looking. Acting was not too bad. Everybody gave it there best and overall it's an entertaining film."

Also, I felt no sympathy for the characters, and didn't care if they died, because the movie did a TERRIBLE job developing the characters. I also didn't enjoy the stupid jokes. Almost everything about this movie is very corny. Also note that some things didn't make sense, and story was kind of hard to follow.

The Imoogi makes its way to Los Angeles, wreaking havoc and destruction. With the entire city under arms, will Ethan and Sarah make it in time to save the people of Los Angeles?\n\nIf you want to see this film, it's because you want some cheesy fun. What I can tell you now is that this film delivers it. It delivers tons of it. It delivers so much, you will get tired of it. I would say this movie is split into 3 parts: The first 20 minutes is the origin of the story, the next 50 minutes is basically a chase movie, and the last 30 minutes is non-stop action.\n\nIf that sounds good for you, watch it. If you are seriously looking for a serious film that has a good plot line, don't watch it. I can tell you now, the story is laughably bad. The whole movie is unintentionally funny but is also very funny with its gags. So what you get from this movie is 90 minutes of non-stop unintentional with some intentional laughs with action!\n\nNow, usually, I say, \"Ignore how stupid the plot is; just go with it.\" In this case, I couldn't do that. The story is just so very bad...it fun to laugh at it, but not to go along with it as much so that you could enjoy the movie. For the special effects, they are undeniably great and the action scenes are visually extensive.\n\nThere's no doubt if you want to have a fun time, you will. There's no doubt that you'll laugh at almost everything in this movie. There's no doubt that the action was great. Overall, if you liked what I've just described to you in this following review, watch it!"

Why are we here, now, and how did we arrive here.\n\nExample... Why would a team of heavily armed and geared-up policemen run on a beach towards a cave, stop at the edge of a ravine, wait for a monster, be scared of the monster, run away without shooting, run out of the cave, and then start shooting.\n\nOr... Why would our hero at one point need a car and go to max speed to escape from an attack by the main monster, while a couple of minutes later he can do it by simply running.\n\nThe dialogue is minimal and mostly simple. Things are explained in a silly mythical way that makes no sense at all, like something else is explained. Things happen without explanation beforehand nor afterwards.\n\nThe monsters in D-War can be compared with the monsters in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. The special effects are quite nice, but are of TV quality, not big screen quality (like LotR, Godzilla or King Kong)."

I grew up watching Godzilla movies and I love them all (except the American one). I was expecting something like Godzilla and that is what I got. This movie has a kinda silly back story but no worse than other fantasy movies like the Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust or the Magic Compass. The acting is all decent, better than the Star Wars Prequels. The action scenes and special effects are frickin awesome! I thought it has some of the best \"giant monster attacks city\" battle sequences I have ever seen and the last 20-30 min are non-stop fun.\n\nThe scenes filmed in Korea are beautiful and very well done. The costumes and sets used are first rate. My biggest question is why they decided to set most of it in the USA. It would have worked better if the whole movie took place in Korea.\n\nIt's all about expectations. I heard this movie sucked, I lowered my expectations and I loved it. Though I wonder, who expected this movie to be an Oscar contender anyways? I think this film is far better than most Hollywood equivalents that had far bigger budgets, a-list actors and a huge studio promoting them."

The same way a 13 year old will.\n\nThere is a plot, but it is extremely basic, not developed at all, has no meat to it, as well as being difficult to follow due to bad translations for backstory events (Ancient Korea). The characters get no depth, are emotionally shallow and have bad actors trying their worst to just get to the end of the shoot. The action set pieces are OK when averaged out. There are a few epic scenes where the CGI really does its work (and they are petty good), but then another battle sequences take a few pages from a bad power ranger episode, so there is no consistency.\n\nAnd the final scene will leave you EXTREMELY confused. It looks amazingly like Middle-Earth's Mordor... with no build-up! One second, the outskirts of LA, the next you expect Frodo to throw a ring at a volcano.\n\n3 stars ONLY for its FX"

The story was idiotic and was sometimes to simple and sometimes to complex,the acting was dull,complete with blank expressions and dry line delivery and the film lacks logic or anything resembling brains. For instance there is a scene where a fortress city is under attack by a huge army complete with giant lizards monsters(dragons?)with cannons on their back. They blow apart the wall and invade. Now these creature are extremely slow and I mean slow(a 98 year old granny with arthritis is faster) yet when one guy falls down about 15 feet in front of one he doesn't have enough time to get up and run away,he just lies there and gets crushed.This action scene also looks really cheap,complete with swords that don't cut into bodies when they are slashed and cause people to twist in odd directions when slain.Then when the army is done and has captured a very important person,I wont say who it really doesn't matter,they only send about 50 guys to escort her rather than the hundreds they had to spare. On top of that some old guy comes flying through the air(literally) waves his had and blows up like 18 of them and the proceeds to have a hand to hand fight with the remaining guards and looses! If he could blow people up by waving his hand why didn't he do it to everyone,maybe I just wasn't paying attention. And the dragons themselves are pretty idiotic to. They can chase and keep up with cars going 80 mph but when chasing humans become incredibly slow.I could go on all day about how idiotic,boring and lame this movie is but that would be a complete waste of our precious time on this earth. To put it simply this is and incredibly dumb action movie that provides no entertainment due to poor acting and a horrid script and bad action. Avoid at all costs unless you want to see a terrible movie"

From start to finish, none of the leading characters have any meaningful impact on the events of the plot, \"things just happen to them\".\n\nThe bad guys clearly achieve complete & total victory several times throughout the film, at which point D-War should simply end, yet the film editor just splices on another scene in which the leading characters are running away some more. Several times, they aren't even saved \"magically\". It's not even \"deus ex machina\", they just badly edit the plot to keep going.\n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this movie. Then do a good deed for humanity and destroy every copy of D-War you encounter!"

I firmly believe that most action films should be taken with a large grain of salt, but this one just fails miserably. Too bad they wasted a decent budget and credible effects on this drivel. \"Reign of Fire\" dealt with dragons and although it too was flawed, it succeeded more than this. It's sad to see some actors sleepwalking through a film for a paycheck and Hollywood wasting money on a sub-par film simply because they think with CGI they'll turn a profit. Better luck next time."

This movie is about mythological creatures and the struggle between good and evil, not good character development and meaningful dialog. Visually the movie is excellent.

I was completely wrong, buying this was a misjudgement; didn't take it back though because it was so cheap. I found myself bored after about 30-40 minutes, I was waiting for the satisfaction of a good battle or two as this was what I expected from a movie titled ' D-War'. When the battles did finally commence properly after multiple dis-satisfying flashbacks that the characters dreamed about I was not amused. For one the battles were very close to the end and two the battles were short lived. As I was watching is movie I could not help but deter my attention to something else as I was watching it (my iPad) and when it was finished I was pretty relieved. I stuck it out until the end, with my final opinion being that the plot took too long to unfold, the acting was mediocre and the action hinted by the title was dis-satisfying.\n\nIf you want a cheap movie to put in the background as 'noise' then go ahead, but if you are looking for an entertaining movie night, do not add this one to your list. You will most likely be disappointed."

If the bad dragon had an army of follows why wasn't there an army for the unknown number of good dragons?

Sure, put your brain in idle and have fun watching. The story is about two dragons, a good Imoogi and a bad Imoogi, and 500 years. There is a battle in the past, featuring what can only be described as massive walking slugs firing flame throwing artillery. Oh, and a robotic army. And in the present, Sarah Daniels is the Yuh Yi Joo, which is the thread of a plot, but few will really care. The CGI is actually done quite well, which is really the movie. There is a lot of comedy present, which helps to cover up the many flaws in the movie. A spirit man walks into the antique shop going right through the fence, and an old woman sees it, tries to follow, and wham! There perhaps is too pretentious of a plot attempt, when most of those buying tickets could not care, as they came for the explosions and special effects.

The only function these nightmares seem to have is to show some CGI special effects which are terribly cartoonish . One wishes the production had limited the number of effects so that when they do come they'd be more convincing\n\nThere's also another element that let's DRAGON WARS down and that is it's trying to be as inoffensive as possible . This is personified by the opening flashback scene in ancient Korea which sees the villains attacking a village with their dragon army . It's not on a level with Peter Jackson's RETURN OF THE KING but it had the potential to be impressive . I said \" potential \" because the editing is done in a very blink and you'd miss it technique similar to QUANTUM OF SOLACE which will have you thinking the more violent bits of the scene have been left on the editing floor"

But what is there to be proud about this movie? This movie simply reminds me of the ridiculous TV series \"Power Rangers.\" Just for the sole purpose of appealing to American audience, Haim Saban and Shuki Levy, the producers of \"Power Rangers\" glued together ridiculously incompatible Japanese TV show with some American footages filled with mediocre to horrible acting by performers like David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson. Shim essentially did exactly the same thing. Because he wanted to make money in the US--which he candidly admitted in his sneak preview speech --Shim made \"Dragon Wars,\" a ridiculous combination of some Korean folk legend with some ridiculous acting and outrageously stupid storyline in the style of the worst of Hollywood. Why would a Korean hero sword fighter reincarnate as a nerdy American journalist in Los Angeles? Why would a Korean maiden with magical power reincarnate as a young, blond Amerian woman in Los Angeles? That was done for the sole purpose of appealing to American audience. The director apparently did not care about this implausibility in the storyline. The director also did not care about a major goof. The boy who played Jason Behr as a child of about ten has blue eyes. However, Jason Behr has hazel-brown eyes. Eye color does not change from age ten to age thirty. That is biologically close to impossible!!\n\nJust for the sole purpose of appealing to American adolescents and young adults (who are the target audience), director Shim glued together elements from many successful movies from various countries. The dragons reminded me of Godzilla. The villains reminded me of villains from Power Rangers and Lord of the Rings. The villains' attack on Los Angeles reminded me of the battle scenes from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. The young Korean hero and his master reminded me of various Chinese martial art movies. This movie was just a rip-off of these successful movies. In spite of his boastful speech during the sneak preview, Shim's work showed nothing unique or creative. This movie proves conclusively that artificially gluing together elements from various successful movies does not create a unique or successful movie. It was a disastrous failure.\n\nIf one wants to see a unique monster movie from South Korea, I recommend \"The Host\" which is much more unique, creative and enjoyable."

'Cause I think that only a ding-dong dimwit would've realistically expected that sort of thing from the likes of Dragon Wars.\n\nAnother one of Dragon Wars' pluses was that, often enough, it was so pathetically stupid that it was actually quite funny. It even got so ludicrous at times that I literally burst out into almost uncontrollable laughter.\n\nIn some ways I'd actually go so far as to say that Dragon Wars surpassed the likes of Transformers by a Korean, country mile. And, I'd certainly bet you that if this monster-of-a-monster-movie had been directed by, say, Michael Bay, rather than Hyung Rae Shim, then reviewers here on IMDb wouldn't have been so savagely anxious to trash it as they so mercilessly did.\n\nAnyways - When it comes to Korean legend, I really can't believe that upon this film's release the people of Korea didn't come forward and publicly protest about how utterly stupid this movie made their beliefs appear to the rest of the world"

        "review_detailed_main": "I should note that \"Dragon Wars: D-Wars\" showed some very pricey CGI, which were somewhat better than other sci-fi films on UniM\u00e1s (previously TeleFutura). But the good graphics will be my only positive remark about this South Korean import (that I saw in Spanish - quite the international experience). I assumed this movie was based on a comic book, but either way, this film might've been overlooked in the multiplexes chock-full of movies adapted from every comic book except \"Archie.\" (I'm sure there'll be one; the TV movie from over a decade ago where Archie & friends grow up ain't worth braggin' about.) But back to the dragon movie. Again the graphics were good & those monsters would've made some pretty cool toys. But the story of a journalist accompanying a poor, tortured young lady on a wild adventure 'cause she's the reason for those dragons terrorizing Los Angeles seems silly & necessary only to display those kickass dragons. Surprisingly, there are some familiar faces who aren't lead actors: Craig Robinson, Retta, & Billy Gardell. They now appear respectively in \"The Office,\" \"Parks & Recreation,\" & \"Mike & Molly.\" In conclusion, \"Dragon Wars: D-Wars\" is best watched on TV w/ the volume turned up when the cool scenes are on. But anytime you see scenes with dialogue such as the suits trying to deal w/ this dragon disaster, adjourn to the kitchen or bathroom, but leave the television on when the monsters return."

There's an evil guy with powers and a dragon. The heavens sent two warriors to defend the girl. It happens every 500 years. Blah Blah Blah.\n\nIt's all very confusing with a lot of Korean names. And quite frankly, most of it doesn't matter. The CGI battle in Korea reminds me of the Star Wars ground combat. It's a lot of explosions for very little excitement.\n\nThen it's modern day LA. Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) is a TV reporter, and Jack (Robert Forster) owns an antique store. Together they are the reincarnation of the two heavenly warrior sent to protect Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks) against an army of magical dragons and warriors.\n\nAfter a slow section where everybody find one another, the movie turns into more CGI battles. Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks are not the best actors around. There's only so much that Robert Forster can do. Craig Robinson does a couple of funny bits but they hardly matter. The battle in LA is kinda fun, but that's the only watchable part. It ends in a confused mess around a CGI fortress with the dragon. I couldn't tell you what happened."

For directing I give 0 point. For editing I give 0 point. For acting I give 0 point.\n\nThe story idea is actually interesting but let's face it, the screenplay is a big joke. The screenplay of 10,000 BC (see my review of the movie 10,000 BC) is better. Shim Hyung-rae just cannot develop this interesting story idea into a good screenplay. There are big holes in the script, too many to be said here. Simply take Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace and splash it with Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, there you got the script. There are many things happening in the story that are not explained, just happened like that. I mean why the police keeping the girl in custody? Why the FBI know beforehand that they have to find the girl?\n\nThe acting? Whoa! No expression at all. This Tom Cruise look alike just cannot act. The girl is a bit better but there is absolutely no chemistry at all between the two. Watching a marionette play is far more interesting than watching these actors act.\n\nThe directing and editing are far worst than the actors.

Hell, he doesn't even get a Werther's for being such a good boy.\n\nWeird old Jack's story goes something like this (possibly): every half a millennium, a Yuh-Yi-Joo is born who has the power to transform an Imoogi into a powerful celestial dragon. 500 years ago, evil Imoogi Buraki, aided by his Atrox army, a swarm of Bulcos and squadron of mighty dawdlers (I kid ye not), was narrowly thwarted by the Yuh Ji Yoo's appointed protector. Soon, Buraki will return to seek out the latest Yuh-Yi-Joo and it is up to Ethan, the new protector, to ensure that it doesn't succeed.\n\nFifteen years later and Ethan (now played by Jason Behr with floppy hair) has all but forgotten his strange encounter with the old man (probably on account of his story being so crap), but gradually begins to understand his destiny when the massive serpent turns up to trash the city in its hunt for a mysterious girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks).\n\nWritten and directed by Korean Hyung-rae Shim, but starring an all-American cast, D-War is a colossal mess, a big-budget CGI-packed monster movie that throws an awful lot at the screen (including an elephant being eaten by a snake and a huge oriental dragon) but still somehow manages to be about as exciting as an episode of The Waltons: the script is all over the place, virtually every performance is diabolical (although you have to feel for the actors wrestling with such lousy dialogue), and the huge-scale action scenes, although visually impressive, completely fail to engage the viewer due to the sheer inanity of proceedings."

It is just a puny little effort to make a CGI/SCI-FI block-buster...and it has gone horribly wrong.\n\nI watched TRANSFORMERS. I din't like it either. But at least it was OK for it genre. The typical American film with loads of regular crap to keep the brainless audience, who by the way constitute the majority, sit through it. Any guy honest enough to watch meaningful movies would agree with me. I still can't understand why TRANSFORMERS is so highly rated in IMDb.\n\nAnyway, at least this D-WAR is not so highly rated.\n\nAnyway who wants to watch this movie...Beware.\n\nThe movie begins to ramble about some Korean Legend that could only be fit for an 8-year old to show interest in. Ironically, even the main character (ETHAN) after listening to the story-telling session by the 'Old Man', asks the question we audience want to scream at the director: \"WHAT ARE U TALKING ABOUT?\" At least at this point the audience is able to vent out their frustration. Probably, the director knew that such a question would come up from the audience?\n\nAfter a good fairy-tale( or should i tell 'DRAGON-TALE'), the action starts. The secretary of defense comes, the FBI comes, they talk in a dimly-lit conference room. They plan to attack the monster. Then the fire-power comes: the Apache copters, the hell-fire missiles, the tanks, the armoured cars. But the funniest part is the ammo from the Dragon army. How on earth would one strap on Rocket-launchers, Grenade-propellers to the body of the creatures? And at the same time, the Dragon-people are carrying swords and riding weird-looking mutant ostriches? They could have given Laser or Taser guns. The same ammo and army in 1507 and 2007. No change of technology. What a load of crap!\n\nThe characters have got literally nothing to say. Maybe one can give some credit to the girl SARAH. She really acted fine IMHO. Others were all just passing clouds in the short-lived memory of the movie.\n\nAnd the Dragons were good-looking too. Nice CGI there.\n\nIn the end, when the director's name comes up, one gets this feeling to really punch him in the nose. I mean, what does he think of the audience? Have we gone that crazy...that CGI-crazy..that he could through this rubbish into our face?\n\nThat's all i can think of telling. If u really want to waste your time or are a CGI fan, then u can give this a try. If u are not, give it a skip."

It goes without saying that they're horrible, although eagle-eyed viewers may notice a slumming Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN) turning up in one of those world-weary mentor type roles.\n\nMeanwhile, I do have to admit that the CGI is impressive. Those massed pitched battles are carried out with gusto and a maximum of destruction, and the creatures on show put to shame the kinds of low-budget CGI monstrosities that prop up many a television movie. But, in the end, without a decent storyline to support them, who cares about the quality of the effects on show?

I do remember it as being an okay movie, but had entirely forgottten about it, except for its cover.\n\nThe storyline in \"D-War\", as written by Hyung-Rae Shim, whom also directed the movie, was actually fair enough. It was, however, a somewhat strange combination of fantasy and modern day action. And the fact that ancient Korean people would be reborn as Americans was a bit strange, and that transition from storytelling in ancient Korea to modern day USA felt a bit odd in my opinion. It would have made so much more sense if the movie all took place in Korea, both ancient and modern time.\n\nThe acting performances in \"D-War\" were good. And there were some familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Jason Behr, Amanda Brooks, Robert Forster, Craig Robinson, Chris Mulkey, Geoff Pierson and Billy Gardell.\n\nThere was a lot of things in \"D-War\" that made little sense. For example, the majority of the times that the Imoogi was chasing Sarah and Ethan, it would easily have snatched them up, if only it would have moved a few inches more. But it was pretty cool of the Imoogi to respect the plot and never just go all the way, which would have made the most sense. Or the fact that every car on the LA boulevard seemed to be made of highly volatile material, as they exploded on impact as the Imoogi slithered down the boulevard. Sure, it looked cool with all the destruction and explosions, but it just made zero sense.\n\nAnd the villain in the modern American part of the movie was just a joke. It was so difficult to take that guy serious. And actor Michael Shamus Wiles's over-acting performance certainly didn't help make it anymore of a likable character.\n\nThe majority of the CGI in \"D-War\" was good. Sure, it is somewhat antequated already, despite being made in 2007. It was great CGI effects back then, but the effects are already showing signs of aging. Still watchable, for sure, but some of the CGI was a bit questionable at times.\n\n\"D-War\" is an action movie, with emphasis on action. And in the process, the storyline sort of takes a backseat. It was okay, because the sheer amount of action is sufficient to make it a watchable movie. I have to admit that I remembered the movie more fondly than what it turned out to be. So I guess sometimes it is best to leave things in the past.\n\nMy rating of writer and director Hyung-Rae Shim's 2007 movie \"D-War\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

Actually, I think that phrase was coined to stop people buying Dragon Wars on an impulsive whim. It's poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed, while Robert Forster (Academy Award nominated for Jackie Brown) turns up for the cheque and looks bored and embarrassed in equal measure, but your not watching a film called Dragon Wars for it's strong characterisation and cinema verite style, your watching it for some wicked cool dragon fights. Does it deliver? Nope, sadly. There's like one dragon in the whole film, there's no dragon-on-dragon fights and the dragons look crap (they don't even breath fire!). Apparently, this film cost $75 million, which is weird because it looks like a cheap Power Rangers episode. Dragon Wars doesn't even qualify as a guilty pleasure, because it's just rubbish. Avoid please."

Blaming for all from heaven is the way Korean movies start things but why the director and scriptwriter didn't realise that it's so fantastic and not interesting.\n\nFurther more, it was so surprising for me to see Korean feudal army fights with the dark force which is totally a copy of ancient western army about costume. This weird combination is so sick and didn't work at all.\n\n2. Special effects and script Special effects for the movie is good, really really good. I have no complaint about this aspect. Unfortunately special effect is only thing make this movie a movie, otherwise it's nothing.\n\nNot yet, the movie contains the crazy and stupid script that I've ever known. I don't know how to describe, just imagine that every detail in every single scene is so illogical. One you watch, it will get under your skin, it will twist your brain till you can't calm yourself because how stupid it is. In other words, script is just simply a background for the crew shows special effects.\n\n3. Action and drama.\n\nI wouldn't rate this movie as action or drama, why? Cause it fails both.

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite harangues from spectators and cinematographers alike, it's only fair to say that D-War has every right to be a success in the United States. After all, the movie does boast a simply amazing A-list cast of American actors who were obviously attracted by something powerful enough to agree to work with director Shim Hyung-Rae. How many Korean movie directors can say that ? The long anticipated opening day for Dragon War in America was Sept .14th and here are some of the reasons it could succeed:\n\nFirst of all, there's the sheer novelty of having the scariest looking serpent and mini-dinosaurs spill out onto the big screen with incredible spontaneity. D-War is therefore totally major, a first for Korea and definitely a work that has inspired many of us who have never lived abroad. It's special effects justify the fact that it's the most expensive movie ever made in Korea by a Korean, even though some of the scenes in D-War require an appreciation for Shim's prior background in comedy. Several campy moments actually keep us in the creative loop, so to speak. And even those of us with absolutely no sense of humor are given the chance to make the same loop, thanks to some of the zany characters, like the zoo keeper who nearly gets clobbered to death by an elephant carcass. But why should it matter where Shim spent $33 million ? It should come as no surprise that it has always been his dream to become a filmmaker and he was willing to pay the price win or lose.\n\nSecondly, audiences in English-speaking countries will not have to be told in advance that it's a foreign film with some subtitles, which should help it succeed where others before it have failed, most notably \" The Host\" , another Korean monster movie that failed theatrically in areas such as the U.K. due to language barriers.\n\nIn closing, D-War, like all films, is a universal medium; computer special effects give it enough leverage over more traditional methods a la Godzilla. So perhaps the main reason some members of the entertainment industry seem to have problems following D-War's message is due to their limited thinking about monster movies in general. Maybe they ought to try to remake the whole damn movie more intelligently, using different camera angles or drawings, with different scaling, instead of having the director look so derelict in his duties. Surely he must have something to boast about after six years of being so committed and passionate about this movie. So please. How you rate D-War shouldn't be based on whether you agree with such things as the size of its marketing budget or its chances of succeeding as a Korean export. And even if you don't need no good advice, go see D-War. Just remember to get a good seat, sit down and shut up!\n\n--------- I.N. Jongno, Seoul"

The director made this movie for international viewing and is why he made it in English also he used American actors and world famous American composer who did not do it for money (cause there was not much to get). south Korea is not a very rich country and not known for movie making and trying to appeal to the American people I think they did a great job making this movie. It does not have the special effects as let say transformers but for the money spent I think the special effects are great. I and my family seen this movie at the theater and just watched it again on DVD. We all enjoyed it. There are a few shots that could have be done different that would have made the movie a little better but all in all I give the Korean film makers a 10 star(part for effort) and hope there next sci-fi with a little more money available will give us more great entertainment.

I was surprised to realize while watching the film, it has been a desperate wish of mine to see a dragon flying and moving.\n\nThis movie was really funny. This was something I didn't expect either. I wish the script had more funny moments than serious plot moments. I started laughing at $10 one. My favorite was the quarantine scene. There wasn't a single unfunny joke in the whole movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often in film for me. Something I also didn't expect to be good was acting. It's very placid though. There is a curious lack of good exaggeration. I really didn't think there was anything bad with acting. I thought it was definitely high above the average, flat lines. I was bored with the shape-shifting, bad guy. I was bored with two main characters. I was bored whenever dialogs relating to the plot came along. Destiny plot in a Fantasy theme setting is too much repeated for me. I wish movies were less similarly copy-formatted. I wish there is more variety of background settings, characters, and plots."

But that's all I can praise from this movie.\n\nYup. You heard me right. The only thing that I see as a plus in this movie, is the graphic and the special effect. Every tiny little bit of the effect is very good. The dragons look real enough for me. And how every destruction, explosion, and the way the dragon pass through every road, and the damage it caused, everything related to graphic and special effect is a plus.\n\nAs for the story, it's just so-so.

        "review_detailed_main": "It amazes me just how American some of you reviewers can be. I specifically say \"how American\" because this movie was written and produced by a KOREAN (who isn't actually an action producer), writing about a KOREAN legend, with a focus on Asian dragon history (not Western dragon history, that is, European and American), of which Korea is part of. When you take into account that this is a Korean production, from a country which isn't quite as big and multi-cultural as the US, and if you knew anything at all about Asian mythology, then MAYBE you could actually appreciate the story and quality of the movie. (btw, I apologize for CAP words. I am not yelling, I'm only doing it for emphasis, given the lack of HTML features)\n\nAs for CGI, I believe I can safely say that I've seen worse SFX in the Final Fantasy movies and Star Wars 1-3. Yes, WORSE! And I was amazed at the quality of those movies (I'm a huge fan of both franchises, especially FF). I can't believe anyone could call D-War graphics bad. The realism and quality of the Imoogi (great serpent), whom we have no recollection what they could possibly look like, except from ancient art, alone should show you that they've put considerable money and effort in creating an amazing work of art. The effect of the immense and realistic evil army was impressive, reminding me of both Star Wars and the LOTR trilogy.\n\nAdmittedly, the acting could have been better, but all the actors involved have had limited Asian culture and CGI movie experience, so it's understandable that they didn't do so great. Also, Hyung Rae Shim doesn't have much experience with the American culture, so collaboration is weak, which lends to the problem of the scale of the movie.\n\nOf course, Jack (played by Robert Forster) actually did an excellent job in his part, which unfortunately, was rather limited to granting tidbits of information about what was going on for all of us to know, and to getting Ethan and Sarah (played by Jason Behr and Amanda Brooks, respectively) out of some sticky situations, like the hospital and on the bridge by driving over the Evil General (played by Michael Shamus Wiles). But, honestly, his roles in the film pretty much was limited to plot expositor, to point us, the audience, on the path of enlightenment (which most of you apparently have missed, sorry to say).\n\nAll in all, I'd give this movie 8/10 for excellent graphics, strong story line, and interesting portrayal of redemption, with rather weak acting and the struggle to coordinate the two primary cultures as my two main negatives.\n\nBTW, being Half American and Half Korean, I'd probably have a small advantage over any of you, by way of knowledge and consideration, but when you also consider I haven't been in Korea since I was 4 years old, and have been raised Christian American (thus, little or no exposure to Buddhism or Asian Mythology), I'm about as ignorant as most of you. If I think this was a good movie (and if IMDb is ranking this movie 6th overall this week (21st September), and 10th for weekend gross earnings), then for those people who refuse to judge a book by it's cover (or a movie by way of poor, negatively biased reviewers), I'd recommend watching this movie, or waiting till it is released in DVD and rent it, then consider what I've wrote about cultural consideration."

( Not adaptation but translation) So, there's some cultural gap in dialog custom and the way of talking because the script was compiled directly from foreign mindset.\n\nThose who have a good sense of language would find this script very experimental and those who haven't would be annoyed by short, dry and compact conversations which are made in English between Americans.\n\nExcept the script and bad acting basically derived by the awkward script, everything else is awesome. Storyline is beautiful,and action is literally blockbuster itself.\n\nI saw the Bourne Ultimatum yesterday and it was very lame for me. Just a runaway and tracers. Very simple, no story if the viewpoint of those who say there's no plot in Dragon Wars is applied.\n\nI was very bored during watching the Bourne Ultimatum and so annoyed by incessantly shaking cameras.\n\nResident Evil? Did you see the lame graphics when the birds fly? If you can overcome the crude script with open mind, you can enjoy Dragon Wars.\n\nI have some excuses for the actors who are being blamed for bad acting.\n\nJust imagine you wrote a scenario in English and translated it into Korean and casted Korean actors. If your movie is on screen in Korea, Korean audiences will find it unnatural and say 'acting was terrible'.\n\nThis movie is foreign in nature. The fantasy and legend are very unique and special effects are great."

And if compared to a lot of the horrible monster films of the 60s, 70s and 90s which some people give so much credit to, D-War is by far a disappointing mess.\n\nThe story, in my view wasn't bad at all, at least the prologue . We start with Ethan Kendrick (Cody Arens) and his father at an antique shop trying to sell a dagger to Jack (Robert Forster), who pretends to have a heart attack to talk to Ethan alone about the story of his destiny. Forster narrates the story well I thought, he tells of a good and a bad Imoogi (Korean dragons) who become celestial dragons if a girl with a certain mark on her shoulder, that appears every 500 years, is sacrificed to them, called Yeo-Yi-Joo. In 1507 Korea, the girl is born and a wizard/shaman named Bochun and his ward Haram are entrusted to protect her till her 18 or 20 birthday, which is when her power is activated. The bad Imoogi, Buraki and his Artox army (you heard right, ARTOX army) ravage the village or kingdom in search of her. However Haram and Yeo-Yi-Joo have fallen in love, being her life long protector, which we are assured by Forster should surprise no one (except apparently him and the king who ordered the whole mess together). as they flee for there lives rather than sacrifice her to the good Imoogi, Buraki chases them to a cliff, and rather than die by him, they jump, and die \"as star-crossed lovers\". Ethan is the re-incarnation of Haram, Jack of Bochun and an unknown girl which he must find (Sarah) who is Yeo-Yi-Joo, as the time for a new dragon war nears.\n\nNow that prologue is fine in my view, and had the film been about Haram and Yeo-Yi-Joo falling in love vs. following there proscribed destinies, an exploration of the strict caste systems of Feudalism vs. there ever growing tenderness, about Yeo-Yi-Joo's father (the King) and his grief at the death of his wife and the curse of his child, playing up the star-crossed lovers angle, and of course Giant snake fights and Artox armies with feudal age missiles, than this would have gone far and beyond the standard giant monster film, and even a very good film in general. But that would take a director with more talent (though something can be said for his work on action scenes) and a bit more courage to film for the sake of art rather than to score bank in the States (which is why the majority of the film is with American actors), and we have to have a reason for the snake and the Artox general to fight and chase Sarah and Ethan all over LA.\n\nNow from that statement you would get the notion that this is a terrible film, which it is, but it is because of things rather than despite (which I know is only different in how you organize a sentence but I think I can make a case for a bigger differentiation) , its horrible acting rather than despite good acting makes things easier to forgive, because it means there is some untainted qualities to like about a film. If you tell your friend \"the movie would have been great if it wasn't for the...\" it means there was something there to enjoy, but if you say \"even though it had (insert positive remark) it sucked\" it means whatever good quality it had was nullified by something overlapping and worse.\n\nBy far the worst aspect, was the acting, which makes sense, Shim's not a great director, and like anyone who isn't bi-lingual in said languages you cant really tell if what your actors are saying came off as over-the-top, cheesy, slurred, awkward and like Nick Adams in \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" your likely to be directed into hamming it up pretty strong. The second nail is the plot after Forster finishes talking, it goes nowhere and fast, it pretty much boils down to excuses for the snake to chase from location to location smashing things. By this point plots are pointless and intrusive, but they intrude anyway with revelations which add nothing, a love story which is anti-compelling, and federal officers running about for a quasi sub plot that goes nowhere in an anti climactic anything-but-tense moment in an empty garage. Altogether, considering the type of film and the obvious state of mind you go to these movies for, you'll hate part of it, the subordinate part (story, plot, human characters, any attempts at blossoming relationships) and love the rest (the dragons, battles, the inevitable monster clash winner-take-all ending to save the world).\n\nThere is one thing that can be said for Shim, his determination to make quality CGI without Hollywood, entirely in Korea. I think in years to come Korea will thank the work done here by Younggu-Art's for making Korean action/fantasy films able to compete with America, Britain and Japan, and they might very well become a sort of Asian Pixar out of there achievements here.\n\nThis is the kind of film you watch with your friends, pointing out the plot holes like hidden message Easter eggs (of which there is no short supply) and being dumb founded by some of the more impossible leaps of even fictional faith and the least convincing effects (the dead elephant, the entire bridge scene). The kind of film you hope to be pleasantly surprised by or nostalgia with quality explosions. The more I've seen it and thought about it the more my disdain for the worst parts turn into welcomed additions. The kind of film you go into shouting \"D-War! woo!\".\n\nA sincere 7 out of 10"

I watched the Special Features on the DVD, which I found to be further enjoyable. Before yesterday I knew nothing about this movie. The artwork done in developing this movie was brilliant.\n\nIn watching this movie at the start I wondered if it were some kind of comedy or a spoof due to the acting and silliness of some of the scenes that were almost childishly stupid. But, it was due to these scenes that added a flavor and charm to this movie you seldom see. I was unaware the director was a comic or was Korean (or that the film was Korean). In view of this and knowing Korean culture as well as I do, I can now give a better comment and appreciate this film more. I wish that the director had not hidden the Korean flavor to his movie. I liked the concept of the setting to be in the USA, but I do feel that more of the roles should have been Korean to give more balance to the imoogi legend theme as well as to the movie itself for the audience to be more accepting of those rough scenes with both comedical and poor line deliveries, etc.\n\nAll in all, I was wowed by the creativeness and imagination put forth in this film that is not seen in many these days. I do like Korean movies and would like to see more. This film was a work of art, for sure, and is entertaining. It does need fixing, but I wouldn't tell people to not watch it."

So in 2007 it tries again and gets really close but still doesn't get it. In the final D- War the good dragon and the bad dragon fight and the bad dragon loses. It swallowed a fireball and died. The main girl dies too. Darrell from the Office is in it.\n\nThe Dragons evolve from serpents and so the main bad Dragon is still a serpent because he hasn't obtained the Yu Yi JU. He tries hard. Very Hard. The main girl has the Yu YI Ju in her, but it really comes down from heaven on he 20th birthday. When that happens she dies. The main dude get sad but he gets better by the end. This also make the good dragon sad and it cries. More than a dragon should cry, but I guess they were pretty close. Overall a quality movie."

The fight scenes were really well done and the graphics were down right amazing for the most part. You could really tell where the CGI ended and the models began in a few scenes though. The writing and script seemed to be very well done. Sadly, I'm sure that there are a few scenes on the editing room floor that would have helped the plot line. Backstory was provided in an enjoyable format so you don't have to know anything about the Korean folklore to understand the movie. The acting was above average for a film where the concepts were translated from Korean into U.S. concepts. There are a few things in the movie that we North American citizens probably just won't ever grasp very well. That's really just a gut feeling and I can't justify it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film for a life-long science fiction and fantasy film."

The CGI in this film actually carries emotional weight which is not only rare but very difficult to accomplish (CGI is really a 'cool' medium, as Marshall McLuhan might remark). And what the director is really trying to accomplish with his storyline is not composition so much as orchestration - the construction is musical rather than dramatic.\n\nDoes it achieve its intent? no, not completely. But neither is it a complete failure by any means. Rather than trying to figure out the film, go with the flow of it and you'll be surprised at how entertaining it really is.\n\nP.S. I'd rate it a seven, but give two extra points because it doesn't deserve the low rating it has here at IMDb."

If they were hoping to find the girl alive, why did they first bomb the village and then searched for her? The chances were very good they could have killed her during the attack.\n\nNevertheless, the film is a fast-paced joyride of thrilling action and incredible effects. The Atrox Army battle in Los Angeles towards the end is insanely entertaining and well on par with the Hollywood blockbusters."

The acting was a pretty bad and the story and plot were quite weak as I fully expected, and all the other elements of a great movie, ie. plot, back story, believability, character development , character chemistry... were pretty much weak, but there was genuine heart and effort in this movie, great potential too, and if this was picked up by a better director and actual writers then this would easily start a cult trilogy with a lot of fans.\n\nThe aforementioned weak story and other things i said were still there and the problems everybody seems to have with it seem to stem from their expectations, when they saw it, they expected to see a masterpiece, when I saw it, I just wanted it not to suck, or they saw it in theaters and paid to see it, boy, that would've sucked badly and I sympathize! I caught this basically for free on satellite, so my expectations were low, I didn't lose much other than an hour or so from my hectic life, and I got to spend that time with my dad, so my experience was totally different from others and I and my dad were quite pleased.\n\nAll in all this movie's great if you aren't expecting more than a relaxing hour or so, don't pay money, or sit in a dusty movie theater seat. This movie is what is; a joyful, lighthearted escape from reality with some great action, impressive cgi, and a pretty leading lady... can't act, but she is cute!"

And It truly deserves the Gross it gained as well as the awards.\n\nFor me If you don't like this Film It is Probably because you can't understand it. I would encourage anyone to watch it. It is the movie of the decade. Simply put... ?D-war? is one of the greatest motion picture experiences I imagine one could ever have! It deserves every ounce of praise it has received, every award it has won, and every Top Ten list it has made.\n\nWhen was the last time you watched a movie and after felt so good that you wanted to kiss everybody in the theatre? Well, perhaps I exaggerated a little but this movie was everything I was waiting for.\n\nThe moment D-war came to the screen I yelled so much I nearly passed out! It wasn't only me, everybody was. The director got everything right with this one. From their unimaginably fantastic entrance to their masterfully created battles, this movie was fun from the start to the end.\n\nNow before I go I have a word of advice for you who haven't seen it yet; don't listen, read or believe the reviews from those lunatic dinosaurs also known as movie critics. I thought you go a movie based on a cartoon from 80s to have fun. Nobody expect a complicated plot like in citizen Kane.\n\nThis movie was for our generation, the younger generation who were grown with Dragon-wars. You, critics, should stay away from movies that have absolutely no connection with because you simply don't understand them.\n\nDirector Hyung-rae Shim has fashioned a magnificent work of art that will, in all likelihood, be hailed decades from now as one of the greatest achievements in Cinema. This movie rocked in every possible way, bring your parents, your friends, your friend's friends, even people from street to watch it and prepare to be amazed :D"

In a time when all Marvel movies feature such overacting and stupid, repetitive plots, this movie stands out by far. While even Robert Downey Jr. (supporting actor by the Oscars) is an idiot onscreen as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth ruins the Thor franchise, Robert Pattinson reenacts a brooding tween as Batman, and Heath Ledger oozes overachieving try-hard into every shot, everyone wants to complain about acting in movies like this and others that strive for wholesome adventure with lesser-known actors. Take a chill pill next time you cry about The Dark Knight or Spider-Man. Movies like this are the backbone of an action genre that maintains high budgets with no thought input. Is it truly fantastic? Not to me. But I have an unrelatable high standard for action movies."

It was made in Korea and for that, I give very high credit!\n\nWho ever saying negatives about this or any other movies, Please~~~.\n\nIf you are looking for Ammy Award Movies, you are in wrong line of category. Remember, this is SCI-FI (with some legend based and most of them are), not like Gone with Wind.\n\nThis movie was made for FUN viewing not to make you think about humanity or leave sentimental value.\n\nIf you want to enjoy nice CG and Sound Effect, any fantasy or sci-fi film will get you there, regardless the story line.\n\nTalk about story line, what do you expect? Sci-Fi is Sci-Fi. You don't expect George Lucas or Steven Spielburg to make all the movies, do you? And you will not watch or criticize all other makers?\n\nGive me a break.\n\nIs everyone riding Mercedez? no, we ride Ford, Pontiac, or Japan made.\n\nSame thing.\n\nI go see movie to enjoy and thank each director and actors for what they did and their dedication.\n\nAs long and I enjoy and my kids have terrificcccc funnn, that is all I count.\n\nFor those who are negatives, yeh, you know life is not always fair or is it?\n\nStart thinking positives and be thankful that there are people who are willing to make and do better.\n\nI give 9/10 for FUN and Good time. Go, and see it!\n\nYou won't be disappointed. (disappointed only if you seek Award Movies)."

The plot makes no sense, the characters are cast horribly, the dragons are given ridiculous names, and the action scenes are about twenty minutes longer than necessary. This movie may become the next Ishtar, I'm calling it now. It's worth your money to see this monstrosity if you expect it to be just that, if you go in expecting a good movie, for the love of god save your money!\n\nI've had it with these motherf*ckin dragons, in these motherf*ckin wars!"

I was confused, that anyone could put into words the wonderful feeling of falling in love. Being wrapped in something like that, where every bad feeling is now good, and every doubt is turned into unshaken certainty. Every rose smells sweeter, and every Sour Blow Pop tickles you just the right way.\n\nThat is how I felt walking out of D-War. The beauty in everything shined forth, and I could see it. The past 16 years, I was blind, but now, thanks to Shim Hyung-Rae cinematic masterpiece, I see the world through new eyes! I wish to share that feeling with everyone in the world!\n\nThis film is a film that everyone, who is physically or mentally able in any way, should watch. I hope that all of you get to see this film, and I believe that the very moment that last blind person has his eyes cleansed, the world will be happy and at peace with the cosmos."

Had this been directed by any good director fixing plot and acting issues, this would have been 8-9 out of 10. Unfortunately I had to give it 6/10 for those weaknesses."

The acting is not great, but is tolerable if you just like a fun film with a lot of things being blown up and lots of fighting big bad monsters! It is in no way a top shelf movie, but if you like sci-fi and things going boom this is a fun movie! The haters that trashed this movie must want every film to rank up there with Independence Day and those much higher budgeted films. It isn't in that class at all, but does OK for what it's budget was. I wouldn't pay full price to see this film in a theater, but would easily consider it worth viewing in my home theater!"

It has great special effects and CGI generated dragons, serpents and other mythical creatures. There is one scene with giant serpent climbing on the high building which reminds me on Godzilla, and one where helicopters chasing flying dragons through the city streets. Story is little weak but for this kind of genre, it isn't much important. This is a good movie and I would recommend it to everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why do I think this? First of all - the dragons. When you're first hit with a huge army of dragons with laser cannons on their backs, you simply aren't expecting how good they are. And they are good, far better than the CGI in 'The Wall', for instance. Then one looks out the screen, and that hooked me. I spent the next 80 minutes open mouthed at dragons and monsters chasing cars, climbing skyscrapers, eating people in swimming pools, destroying hospitals.... If you love monster movies like I do, you can't wish for better monsters than this. They all have personalities, they're all brilliantly made and I loved every one. Wish the company hadn't folded - maybe there'll be a sequel one day anyway.\n\nRemember, you're watching a legend. Legends are fairy tales, so they're bound to have plot holes and be faintly ridiculous (A talking wolf puts on glasses and Red Riding Hood thinks its her grandmother? For real? Like I'm supposed to believe that? Yes, because it's a fairy tale.) The legend part of this movie's beautifully done, with the old sorceror and the runaway lovers. I think if they'd made the whole film about that I'd've loved it. But they brought it forwards into the 21st Century, made it a cops-versus-monsters movie and had an absolute whale of a time doing it.\n\nWhen you see it, go along for the ride. It's a theme-park rollercoaster, taking you past and through loads of magical beings. If you stand on the ground beside it, yes you'll laugh at those on the ride having fun. If you get on the ride WITH them, you'll have a breathless, fun-filled, carnival time filled with creatures so real you'll want to reach out and stroke their scales. Honestly, I've never seen anything done that well in a Hollywood movie including Jurassic Park. (The dinosaurs in that aren't anywhere near as crystal-clear as the creatures in this.)\n\nIt's the only movie the studio ever made - the guy went ever so slightly heroically bankrupt before he could make any of the other movies he had in mind. Personally I think that's a real shame, I'd've loved to have seen them all. But I'll forever champion D-Wars as his magnificent legacy. I've seen it many times now, online and in the cinema (cinema 3 times, online I've lost count!) and it'll always be my friend when all else fails me.\n\nThankyou, Korea, for D-wars. May the dragons return in a new movie someday - I mean they've got the programs written, why not use them in something else?\n\nIt's in no way a bad movie. The acting's realistic, not Hollywood-affected. In the first 15 minutes you're queueing up for the ride. Once you're ON the ride - you just don't want to get off. I wished it had been longer.\n\nRead what I've said, watch it again and enjoy.\n\nChris."

First it is a Korean made film with great special effects with a smaller budget then most films made by united states film companies. It was a film that captured a lot of different emotions and kept our attention all the way to the end. It had a good cast including a good performance by Jason Behr. I would not let these low reviews stop you from seeing this movie. This is a movie I own on bluray and plan on watching again. I gave it a rating of 10 only because it deserves a much higher rating then a lot of viewers gave it. So give this movie a try especially if you like mystical or fantasy type movies."

The CGI parts of the film, although a bit out of place in areas - i.e. SWAT in canyons and valleys etc. these were reasonably above par for the film. Okay the first large battle felt like a copy of the 'Phantom Mennace' Gundam battle (shudder), but on the whole the battle sequences were enjoyable, but seemed to have nothing to do with the storyline. Plot/story gaps as big as the serpents in this story - but dis-engaging brain and enjoying visual effects - not the worse film ever..."

People are acting like it came to their house and beat up their mother.\n\nNo, D-War hearkens back to the days of yore, when special effects laden monster movies, filled to the brim with crazy ideas and \"exotic\" mysteries of foreign cultures would fill the shelves at your local video store.\n\nSure, the plot is a jumbled, convoluted mess, filled with tired clich\u00e9s about \"chosen ones\" and \"you can't escape your destiny\"s. Hell, it even has that staple of 50's creature features, where a native person is dragged away while maniacally telling anyone who'll listen that \"the beast has wakened\" and to \"heed my warning or we're all doomed!\".\n\nIt's a silly movie, with a silly plot, that is actually far more simple that it appears: There's a girl and the bad guys want her and our destined hero has to protect her. That's it.\n\nBut D-War knows what a genre audience want: Lots and lots of action scenes and monsters. And you'll be hard pressed to mention a movie that packs as many monsters, explosions and action into an hour and a half movie, as D-War does.\n\nThere are no Oscars on the horizon for D-War. But it's mindless entertainment, so grab a bucket of popcorn, a gallon of soda and be prepared to get blow away by the very impressive special effects and breathtaking action sequences that take up the latter half of the movie. Say what you will about director Hyung-rae Shim, but he is an impressive visual artist.\n\nIf you enjoy the kind of cheesy monster movies where giant monsters rampage through cities and battle the military with massive destruction as a result, this is your movie. You know who you are.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it far more that Michael Bay's awful Transformers or Roland Emmerich's atrocious Godzilla. And so should you."

Maybe the plot is too weak and some scene is ridiculously naive. Maybe it's the director's fault, he just wanted to make a film combined with eastern and western culture, but he made a mess. The special effects is really good and the real dragon in the last scene is really wonderful. The East Asia dragon is different from the evil western dragon.It's a mythical creature with a huge snake-like body covered in fish scales, and adorned with horns, a beard, claws and feet.This dragon can bring the rain to the earth and the people are grateful to that. This legend is originated from China and spread to Korean peninsula and other parts of East Asia. At the end of the movie we hear the traditional Korean folk song and it's really beautiful. Maybe this movie is too short and crudely made, but i have to admit that this movie is a great surprise."
