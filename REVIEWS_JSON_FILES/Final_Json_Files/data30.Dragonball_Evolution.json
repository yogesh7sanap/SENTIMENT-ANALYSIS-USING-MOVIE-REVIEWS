        "review_detailed_main": "Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.\n\nFor one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the \"bullies\" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.\n\nI could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask \"Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?\" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.\n\nAs a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls."

        "review_detailed_main": "For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga/anime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball: The Magic Begins (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122050/) made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama, but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline, which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.\n\nNow, another live action Dragonball movie has come, called Dragonball: Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet, a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much, especially Piccolo, the main villain, who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released, a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as \"Not Dragonball, but another action movie\".\n\nThis writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie, and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a \"real\" Dragonball, but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different, but the way the movie progressed, the introduction of characters, the fight scenes, oh wow, you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about, except for the \"Kamehameha\" move and the 7 dragon balls, just with the financial backing of a millionaire.\n\nEverything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.\n\nThe fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains, cities would be destroyed, the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie, everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!\n\nThe only \"good\" things about the movie were the special effects, although the energy blasts seemed very weak.\n\nMy advise is, if you're going to pay to watch this movie, DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right, the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!"

The only reason why I gave it a 3 out of 10 rating was for the special effects and production value which were semi-decent. I don't understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with. It's the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\" I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting. The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that don't know about Dragonball, kind of like how Watchmen did. Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it, this movie was a travesty...I guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me. Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories."

The multi-million dollar budget has amounted to a teen drama mixed with power rangers. The final product is insulting, to say the least.\n\nThe creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.\n\nTo finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.\n\nIf you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don't need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many."

What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "What is wrong with this picture man? Nothing personal to James as a director. I love his Final Destination series, but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials.\n\nThe entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball, it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials.\n\nTo me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser, I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.\n\nDragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB, it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word \"Evolution\". But when they say evolution, I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution.\n\nA lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie."

The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.\n\nWhy do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.\n\nThe film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.\n\nOverall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Dragonball Evolution",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From \"Americanizing\" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.\n\nYou have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.\n\nAs far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.\n\nSpeaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.\n\nAnd the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.\n\nThis is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG (excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys). Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? \"The One\" was badly done and James is just the worse director ever, I tell ya, he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw, did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel, and if it does, it will most likely end up re-shooting the entire film (remember of The Hulk). King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat, character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter, he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.\n\nCasting: God damn it, wrong cast dude! Carla Hool, please go back home and do some home work first! Who hired the casting department? I recall the same casting director did the Forbidden Kingdom also cast this movie -- Popping AuYeung. She sucks! Did such a bad job casting in Forbbiden Kingdom and in Dragon Ball. I wonder why is she still surviving in the industry at all. Jamie Chung tries too hard to be cute, and she is ugly. Master Mutaito is a black guy? Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. I can assure you that it's not really her fault, James just doesn't know what he was doing. Eriko Tamura as Mai is just a redundant character, the wardrobe department tries very hard to dress her up sexy while she is not. By the way, her boobs didn't override her bad acting and ugliness. She must have missed Acting 101 class.\n\nVisual Effect: At some point of the movie, when Guko turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like \"Rubber Chicken\". Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects, it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film, Goku was training with Gohan, the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D (cardboard stand) in the background. Blue / Green screen spill was all over, color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years, and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!\n\nArt Design / Production Design My recommendation is to get Stephen Scott, Simon Lamont and the bunch who did Hellboy to work on DragonBall. The original DragonBall story heavily involves with aliens and action, and I believe that they are the right group of guys to do this film. Their creature designs and makeup fits in this category. Piccolo looks like alien from Mars, one of those \"Mars Attack\" films from the 60s. Costumn in the entire film doesn't match the theme at all, looks like they shop wardrobe from Wal-Mart. The story will be more interesting if it were to take place more into the future (like in the movie Minority Report). The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. The matte painting of the city lights and buildings doesn't fit into the picture at all. It is like cut and paste without considering the style, time and place between Roshi's house and the city backdrop.\n\nStunts / Action Choreography: Poorly done dude! One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. Whatever James did, it looks worse than Street Fighter done by Steven De Souza back in 1994. Yeah, Van Damme could've star in this Dragonball movie. The \"ki\" effect is all over the place,the establish shots of the fight covered up by \"ki\" effect and I couldn't even locate the characters on the screen. They add to much vapor on the \"ki\" effect.\n\nConclusion: If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is, then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget, it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix, Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation \"Ghost in the Shell\". Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course, skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.\n\nPlease re-shoot this FILM!!! I can assure you that all the fans worldwide is looking forward to a re-shoot with different Above the Line and casts"

        "review_detailed_main": "From looking at some of the reviews on here, I will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another. I am reviewing this film on the credits.\n\n1. Relation to the original series. 2. Quality of script 3. quality of actors/actresses/acting 4. quality of effects 5. Final product.\n\nThis film bears two relations to the original. The characters and the Dragonballs. There is nothing else to link the two. This is so sad when you consider how much they had to work with and all they could produce was this. The characters also bear little resemblance to their anime predecessors. None of them do what they are supposed to do, except Chi Chi, who didn't do much anyway. Where's Roshi's turtle shell. Why does Bulma carry several fully automatic weapons? And why is Yamcha now a ladies man? To their credit though, Roshi's behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived.\n\nThe script for this film is its downfall. It's just awful. The writers have tried to fit too much into a short period of time. This film needed to be 2.5 to 3 hours long to even come close to allowing all the characters to be fleshed out. Attention should have been paid to Transformers when they were making this film. If you want to make a film based on a TV series, as those who watched it, not a bunch of suits that are paid to watch it and come up with a story. Many people who enjoyed the show could have given suggestions throughout the whole movie making experience.\n\nAS bad as the film was, it doesn't take anything away from the actors themselves. They did the best they could with the tools they had. If you ask a builder to build you a house out of sticks, don't complain when it falls over.\n\nThis film had all the effects of an 80's movie. Think of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and the scene where the Freddie battles the kid in the wheelchair. That's the level of effects in this film. And I will leave the dragon, Shenron, so you come to your own conclusions. I don't want to seem prejudiced.\n\nThis film lands not just way off the mark for a spin off movie, it's in another continent. They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element, which would have saved it, but no. They even try to throw in romance, but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example, Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh, but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers, its all it deserves."

The most disappointing thing about the film was the misuse of the oozaru and the short timing of the end battle between goku and piccolo.\n\nOverall the movie was good and it kept me entertained and still I think it was worth the wait the movie soundtracks and music are excellent and I think the cast did a pretty good job playing their characters, the best performance has to be Chow Yun Fat, he did a awesome job as master roshi and roshi kept me laughing quite a bit and also Joon Park did a wicked job as Yamcha, he sounds just like the cartoon character which was amazing. Justin Chatwin try to do his best as goku and he did make me laugh a bit but he was just too serious and the Goku I know is funny and carefree.\n\nEmmy Rossum and Jamie Chung were good as Bulma and Chi - Chi and James Marster made a wicked piccolo but his time in the movie was short and kind of reminded me of Vemon's amount of time in spider-man 3 but piccolo was another good thing about the movie.\n\nThis movie is not going to be the best movie of the year or win any Oscars but it's still fun to watch and enjoyable and I seriously recommend this movie to true dragonball fans who actually know the meaning of adaptation and don't mind a bit of change in something you liked for years.\n\nMy rating 8 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The runtime is 1 hour 26 minutes. It is undeniably short and so you cannot expect some fantastic plot but non-stop action and some good action scenes. I would say that Dragonball has achieved being a mindless flick with non-stop action. But I must say I am a little disappointed with the action scenes and how short it is. First thing, the action and fighting scenes-they are messy and short. One fighting scene runs about 3-4 minute and they are not that fantastic. There is nothing special about the fighting scenes as some of them look messy. Even the final battle is short. I feel that it is quite short and if it is true that it cost US$100 million, it is very expensive. The special effect is not that awesome that makes you go \"Wow!\".\n\nThe story: Yeah, as expected, the story is truly simple for all ages to understand. The strong point of Dragonball is supposed to be the fighting scenes but they are disappointing. The story is about Goku going on an adventure to find the seven hidden dragon balls after his grandfather tells him to before his death. From there, he needs to find master Roshi and some others company them on his quest to find the dragon balls before evil force finds them. As usual, Brian Tyler 's music is good and epic. His music makes the film more watchable.\n\nOverall: Kids will like this non-stop action adventure and the adults, depending on their taste, might also enjoy it. I have to say that I don't know much about Dragonball so I enjoyed the fun ride. Those looking for a mindless flick, may be interested in it. Those who hate plots that are lame and messy fight scenes, this may not suit you. It is slightly better than average."

Acting seems out of place at so many parts ..\n\nParts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you .\n\nI'm not really against the actors and their fitting ..they could've fit if there was a better directing .\n\nWE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG !!

Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB, DBZ, or DBGT? Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this. For one, the whole base of the story is completely off, not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame. This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction.

        "review_detailed_main": "My childhood is ruined. I have witnessed the death of a beloved franchise millions have come to adore and respect. This movie is not an adaptation, nor is it an homage of any sort. It is a mockery. A sheer insult to all those whom cherish Dragonball deep within their hearts and souls.\n\nWhy does this video-tape recording (I absolutely refuse to deem it 'film' status) fail to such a devastating degree? It does not capture any of the charm, wit, excitement, humor, or bad-assery to be found in its source material. James Wong has simply taken the title, characters, and... errm, hairstyles, and has furtively stapled them to the bloody forehead of a poorly scripted, heavily underdeveloped movie about collecting seven golden balls that when gathered, will summon a flying dragon who will grant you one magical wish! How fantastically whimsical!\n\nWho cares.\n\nThere is nothing compelling about this film. It's painstakingly difficult to care about any character in this film, and that goes for Goku as well. Right from the get-go, you bare witness to a horribly underwhelming fight session between Goku and his Asian(?) grandfather Gohan, who carries a bizarrely flawless American accent.. go figure. The reason I imply confusion behind Gohan's Asian ethnicity is that his grandson Goku is, well... nevermind. It isn't even worth getting into; the casting for this movie made no sense. No consistency whatsoever. Disgusting.\n\nThe dialogue is cheesy and executed improperly in every way conceivable. You want cheesy dialogue done right? Go watch the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer released last year, truly a masterpiece as far as anime adaptations are concerned. What is improper about it, you inquire? It causes you to cringe without the ability to hold back. Every single word muttered is a bleak reflection on each actor's terrific inability to act in any way, shape or form.\n\nSpeaking of form.. Don't even expect half a thrill from this movie's excuse for action sequences. These actors cannot fight under any set of circumstances. The wirework is so blatant and poorly imposed that I swear to have caught eye of a couple unedited out wires left in some of the more acrobatic scenes.\n\nReally? Come on, Hollywood. Come on, Fox.\n\nThese sort of mistakes became a thing of the past DECADES prior. If a movie based on the almighty Dragonball franchise is going to suck this severely OUTSIDE of the fight sequences, at LEAST refine those few scenes (Dragonball's saving graces, so to speak) into something worthy of admission price. Get a couple professional choreographers on the set to help out, if you don't mind. (what a strange and unusual concept, huh!?)\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again; if this entire project had been up to the legendary Stephen Chow, we could have had a sheer masterpiece on our hands. (refer to Kung Fu Hustle, what I believe to be the most faithfully Dragonballesque live action movie ever made)\n\nI shall continue no further. This movie does not deserve any longer of a review. In fact, slice this eloquently written verdict in half and it would still be far too flattering in length.\n\nI feel that if FOX wishes to maintain any credibility they have left with their audiences, they will hold back on dumping this atrocious landfill upon the United States' precious array of cinemas. Of course, we know this is not realistic.\n\nIt's nice to dream."

It's an insult to toriyama it's an insult to the franchise and it's an insult to the fans of the dragonball series. Goku is a highschool student while in the series he'd never even met a girl before.

It, in no way, resembles the original comics or anime beyond the names, some of the concepts being loosely adapted, and that's about it. But when I sat down to watch this and expected an absolute mess of a film, I actually found a mildly entertaining comedy that felt more like a Dragonball Parody than anything else. Yes, I'm keenly aware that wasn't their intent, but when you look at symbolism in film or books, sometimes what you see is not even close to the intent of the creator, but we believe that's what we see anyway. My first introduction to Dragonball Z was the Dragon Ball Z Abridged series on YouTube, and, as such, I've never taken the series seriously in anyway because, quite frankly, the source material really isn't that good on an animation level, narrative level, or even an action level. The original series is actually pretty bland. So when we get a movie that functions more like a parody and less like that bland boring nonsense the franchise started as, yes, I can actually enjoy it that way. It's sad we can't get more of this because I had a blast watching this. My favorite movie? Hardly, but it got me to laugh most of the way through the film (probably not for the right reasons) and, as such, deserves commendations on that alone. And if you really are on of those burned fans who can't accept the humor of this film as being a completely crap-version of Dragon Ball and legitimately want a good live action Dragon Ball, just stop. It'll never happen and this will likely be the closest you'll ever actually get."

Meanwhile Goku falls in love with his school mate Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) .\n\nDragon Ball are basically numerous spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement, full of repetitive dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy, but that hasn't prevented kids and teenagers from eating them up . It contains cartoon violence and minor sexual innuendo than anime series . Occasionally features stunted and disjointed action, as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters fitting partially to animated series . The abundant computer generator images , which labor mightily to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look . These adventures can be good for novices and youngsters age 10 should drawn into the story but not for the established fans . James Wong adapts the rich myth of the Dragonball series that grew from a Manga into various popular animated series by means of hundreds episodes that are brought to life with this 20th Century Fox and Stephen Chow ( Kung Fu hustler )production . James Wong is a good writer(21 Jump Street , X-files) , producer (Black Christmas , The others , Milennium) and director (Final destination 1 y 3 , The one , and X files episodes) , but his filmmaking in Dragon Ball is ridiculous and embarrassment . Rating : Below average ."

        "review_title": "How did this come to Theatres? And who signed off on it?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, let me start by saying. At age 8 I found out about Dragonball, I watched the entire season, all the way into the uncut fully Japanese airing of Dragon Ball Z, and then segued into GT. I am 23 now and have long stopped caring about anything ANIME. However, when I caught wind of this, I ignored all the e-chiming in my forums and IM's and immediately located the trailer. Needless to say I laughed and thought it was another Prank (like the Zelda trailer back in 07).\n\nSo, with that said, know, this is coming from someone who nerded out to Dragonball series for years, and have long since grown out of that liking into almost disliking the entire thing. However I was drawn to check it out anyways.\n\nThis movie, is probably the worst series -> movie ever made. This movie is good to use to make other movies grand. Ever want to push through a horrible movie just to say you watched it? Well kill two with one stone, watch this one, then go watch the other and you'll have such a biased stance on films in that moment you'll love it. Dragonball Evolution fails on every point.\n\nSo before I dismantle this movie, I will note one good thing about it. It had: Emmy Rossum. Granted, her role wasn't classy like her other ones, but she is a nice actress to come across, and she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols.\n\nSo for the non-nerd people who may go see this for any other reason than \"being a fan (or old fan) of the show(s)\". This movie fails at being anything worth a fighting or action movie. There is one cool fight scene, and I promise you, you can save time and just go watch the clip of The Forbidden Kingdom fight of JC and JL.\n\nSorry, but watching a pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting to my own eyes. I almost gave up on modern American Kung Fu movies when I saw Forbidden Kingdom, but after watching that weaselly looking Gokou, I have officially given up. We can only hope that Stephen Chow makes another movie soon to give us hope that China is still in the race to make Kung Fu movies.\n\nThe graphics of this movie reminded me of the bulky techno special effects from Super Mario Brothers. Yea, the one with John John Leguizamo. The energy fights were anything but spectacular. Want an idea of what they looked like? Go watch that Covenant Movie (yes, the one about male witches being cool, right?). Remember the end to that movie with the energy ball fight? Well add blue and red to those balls and there you have it. But dare I say - THE COVENANT MAGICAL FIGHT was more intense, and better done than the DRAGONBALL ENERGY FIGHT.\n\nAlso, when the characters would produce intelligence on the plot and foreground to background of the history of this world they live on, it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about Sumatra. It was as if the actors were holding their scripts in their own hands and reading right off of it. Luckily, Rossum, didn't do any explaining, so her image is at least not so tarnished from this movie.\n\nFinally, for those wondering, isn't Dragonball from Asia, and don't all the characters from the first and second series have Japanese related names. (I say first and second as Pan and Bra don't really fit). However in this movie, there's only 4 Asian characters. The rest of the characters look like they got lost on their way to the MEAN GIRLS 2 set. (No, there isn't going to be another one. Sorry.) As for old school fans of the Anime. As you can read, this movie lacks anything cool for any outsiders view. The fighting is horrible, the graphics are lame, the acting is atrocious. As for comparing it to the show? They got the characters names right, and that's about it.\n\nJust watch the trailers and teasers. You'll be able to see. Even the profound KamehameHa move sounds like it is done by a pubescent teenager.\n\nAvoid this movie, at all costs.\n\nNote the director's name, avoid that as well."

I took two nine year old boys, a 7 year old boy, and a 5 year old boy, and they had a great time. They talked about it non-stop for hours that evening. I went to see the movie because of the great Chow Yun-Fat, and I was able to somewhat enjoy the movie on its own terms. I wouldn't recommend thinking about it too much on the way home. I do admit that it's probably best that I didn't know much about Dragonball heading into the theater and thus I didn't have very high expectations going in. Therefore, in summary, I would personally give the movie about a 5 or 6 out of 10, but as entertainment for my boy and his friends, I give it an enthusiastic 10 out of 10."

I have never seen/read the original, and I still found this to be a bad film. The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you enjoy bad films like I do, it's worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Remember the day you were exposed to the cinematic brilliance of There Will Be Blood,the great character study of Scorsese's Taxi Driver,the unbelievable quirkiness and charm of Magnolia, well,you better be forgetting them because Dragonball:Evolution is coming through and it will blow more than one mind.\n\nWhat you have here is a movie so emotionally devasting,that you will feel the need to be hit(twice if needed) by your friend if what you're seeing is actually real, this movie challenges the viewers to come up with their interpretations just like David Lynch's Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain and the mind-screwing Neon Genesis Evangelion(hopefully Fox picks up the rights of the show, so we can have another carefully crafted masterpiece like this one),the story is nothing short of riveting almost as good as Karate Kid and Kung-Fu Panda combined together-\"Goku is a social misfit(just like he is in the anime) who gets bullied by the token black-guy and can't get the girl(just like in the anime - it feels like you are being wrapped into it)then his grandpa Gohan is killed by Piccolo(the aftermath of his death didn't feel exactly like Uncle Ben's death in Spider-Man, which was a relief cuz I had a weird feeling it would be similar)then Bulma appears and takes him to this guy Roshi,and then they go on to some cannon searching the so-called dragon balls,all right, and then they find Yamcha, cool, and hip as always with his funny one-liners,then he falls in love with Bullma and then Piccolo pops out, and the final fight between good and evil begins,they fight on and on and on... then in the middle of the fight Goku feels the need of taking a du... er... he transforms in some sorta ManBearPig-like monster(nice reference to South Park) called Ozaru and then Piccolo takes full-control of him or whatever I didn't pay much mind since my eyes were blurry from some of the action scenes and tears of joy of this tour-de force experience, some people may complain on how the story was shortened and rushed,but hey, it's not like you actually know your stuff, let the talented-one get it right,as cramming everything together in 90 minutes was the most obvious thing to do -DUH,the characters are so complex as they unfold throughout the movie,kids may have a hard time watching this cuz of the PG rating because the movie relies way too much on social commentaries against our society and the way we see life - for instance- the scene where Yamcha stars to talk out that cool-sounding stuff is obviously taken off from the harsh-times our economy is going through, you might be fooled on this one since Dragon Ball or Dragonball(whatever you may like to call it) was meant to be kiddy show, but here they kid you NOT.The character are a little different from their anime counterparts but it doesn't matter at all especially considering how you can actually connect with them in a emotional and witty way albeit complicated manner, we have Goku, brilliantly-written I must say though, lines such as \"teach me how to be normal\" and his awkwardness throughout the high-school scenes were a delight to the human eye, and kept me on the edge of my seat in an infinite loop of awe, Bulma, well, was a b... interesting character and so are Roshi, Chi-Chi, Yamcha - who were too depth for my own good though. And those nice-looking monks(so happy that Bill Murray was somehow injected in the scene), now let's get back to Piccolo, his motive is unknown, we don't what he really wants... destroy or control the world, that's the question, right? In my humble opinion I think it's up to the viewer to answer these questions just like what happened with The Joker in The Dark Knight so that makes it intriguing by default(and very cool, too). Nothing about this masterpiece felt like a cop out, I swear.\"\n\nThe battle scenes are (Y)AWWW-MA-ZZZZZZZZZZZ-ING, I'm not kidding you. One can notice that the idea for them definitely didn't come straight from Spider-Man or The Matrix, the cinematography was beautiful shot I may have collapsed during the movie because of its beauty, thankfully I was revived by the doctors in the theater who were bitting their own nails out of the pure excitement to see this \"legend\" come to life. At the end of the movie my whole-theater had a mad orgasm that could have been heard in the whole galaxy. I'm more than hopeful that this movie will beat the poop out of TDK and Titanic at the box-office and will spawn more sequels than Police Academy and The Land Before Time combined. After this movie I am proud to say that Tom Rothman is god, the way he rushes project... whoops, I mean the way he picks up franchises randomly and put them into production as fast as he can so the fans don't have to wait any longer without looking for a extended profit, he is a very kind individual, a man worth of trust, and we should all be thankful for that, may Jebus bless yer little caring heart.\n\nI AM also so glad that my children will grow up with movies like this and not those overrated Miyazaki's movies which are boring and lame besides every single movie(released or yet-to-be-released) will fall flat in comparison to this milestone of cinema. Especially taking into account that it takes place in a culture blinded by Kayne West, Fergie, Crapformers, American Psycho...\n\nFor my money THE SINGLE BEST MOTION PICTURE OF THIS CENTURY. Still, Isn't that great that everyone's children will grow up with this sincere and honest movie. Kamehaha-IT."

At the moment I can't imagine what kind of tragic loop hole in the studio fiscal numbers could have prompted them to do this but I pose the question; why Dragon Ball?!! If for some reason this film was the result of poor research and disregard for authenticity, then both Ben Wong and mainly Ben Ramsey should be stung up by their feet and pelted with bile and human waste. It doesn't even help that they added evolution instead of Z which would have really spawned a violent reaction from a large fan community. Hands down, already one of the top 4 worst film adaptations ever made. Don't waste your money or time on this slovenly ball of Hollywood horse manure. I still don't know why or who gave this film the green light. I mean GOKU IS CAST AS A WHITE TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL!!!! That to me is an indication to forget this film ever existed. This is definitely a bad move for Dune Entertainment. I'd say try the Wolverine film instead of this crap. But even so, why have any faith with the same group the messed up Max Panye, and made X-Men 3. Ha! I don't care if they read this, they need to anyway.\n\nDANIEL KAHN NELSON"

You make your own story so it can fit the time.If the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be 5 hour plus movies. I thought it was an awesome movie.It didn't portray the actual manga,but it fits more the profile of a tribute to Dragonball. So summed up this movie was a TRIBUTE."

The actors try really hard to save the movie and in the attempt sometimes overdo it. Especially Chow Yun Fat, didn't expect that such a good actor will not be able to handle Roshi's role (which is very funny) but here we get only a few smiles that's all.\n\n3. The end sequence though good ends up pretty soon. Also the transformation does not last much.(You will know once you see the movie)\n\nGood Points:\n\n1. The powers and the dragon are cool as usual and with the characters build so well there is no doubt that lot of people will like this movie.\n\n2. The flow of the story is true to the Series and there is a hope that the future movies will have more.\n\n3. The pace of the movie is good and the ones who are knew will for now be happy with the action and the speed of the movie.\n\n4. The character changes to Goku makes him more real and the acting is surprisingly good from an actor with very less movies under his belt Justin Chatwin did justice to his role for most of the part.\n\nI will give it 6 because of the look and feel of the movie.\n\nThe movie is good overall but do not expect a Peter Jackson's styled masterpiece here :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a Great movie!! People have to remember that this is an adaptation of the original. They called Dragonball Evolution because it is an advanced version of Dragonball. People say that Goku's saiyan heritage wasn't explained well in the film, which is why they will explain it in the sequels. Many fans say that the movie is nothing like the manga and anime. The similarities are painfully obvious, and there are many similarities(I'm not going to list them, but their are a lot).\n\nMany fans did not like this movie because of the same reasons. Goku is in High school, The story is different, the characters look different, etc. It's always the same thing. All you guys have to stop complaining. Change is necessary for a good adaptation. For example, the X-men movies, the Spiderman movies, Batman movies, Ironman, and Transformers were all different from their original versions, and look how they turned out!\n\nIn conclusion, this is one hell of a movie! I Recommend it to Action fans, sci-fi fans , fantasy fans, or anyone who just wants to watch a fun and exiting movie!"

I was surprised to spot Ernie Hudson among the cast. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February.

What I got was a soulless cash-in with pitiful production values, an absolutely abhorrent script and an over-reliance on cheesy CGI effects over the 'niceties' of quality acting, characterisation or plot.\n\nThe cast are abysmal and I had to feel particularly sorry for Chow Yun-Fat, who's utterly embarrassing in the expositionary role of the wise old monk. Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA's Christine, but this type of movie is NOT a good career move. As for Justin Chatwin's lead, well, he's just a spiky-haired prat. Elsewhere, there's an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers. Director James Wong once produced THE X-FILES and directed two FINAL DESTINATION films, but on the strength of his work here I'd say his talent has long since left him."

        "review_title": "A travesty",
        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball is arguably the best manga/anime ever made. It has an immense amount of popularity that has transcended cultures and become a profitable mainstream commodity worldwide. It has stood the test of time and has been a great inspiration to so many after it.\n\nWith that said, this movie is a travesty to the product name. The rich characters and carefully crafted story of the manga are carelessly shotgunned onto the screen. The dialog is poor, the acting never gets any better than what we'd find on a mediocre evening kids show, the CG bounces unevenly between barely passable and awful, and most importantly, the fight scenes (and lack of) just plain stink.\n\nDragonball has always been about being epic and larger than life. One glance at the cartoon would demonstrate how they would spend a ridiculous amount of time on building up a fight and then pay it all off with a great one. The manga was always about fantastical ideas, crazy fighting styles, even crazier special moves, and the all important which fighter is stronger debate that was made exponentially better once power levels got involved in DBZ. Simply put, none of this magic was brought over, and too much time is spent on things Dragonball was never known for. Dragonball was never about romance, as it was about family, friendship, and respect.\n\nIn fact, the Goku/Chi Chi relationship was never emphasized in the comic and always took a back seat to the important matters at hand, like saving the world and working together to accomplish that. The film must have spent like 25% of the time trying to build up this relationship when the manga might have spent 0.1%. I honestly do not believe this kind of lowest common denominator to attract the interest of the female audience was necessary at all. Dragonball never had trouble creating a fan base, so this really feels like one of the many big missteps of the film.\n\nIn terms of the characters, they really made a mistake in blending the young and old Goku of the original story, which resulted in one that just seems unlikable. Goku was always a bit goofy and was certainly flawed, but he was never a dope like the one we see here. People not familiar with the manga will probably come off with absolutely no idea why Goku is so well adored by all the fans. Next, the ultimate bad boy Piccolo is completely underused with very little screen time. Yamcha is nothing like the one we know, and is made to be a bad comic relief of some sort. Chow Yun Fat's Roshi is close to unwatchable. You cannot blame Chow Yun Fat for trying his best, but he's just a terrible miscast for the role. Fat does the cool stuff well, but this stuff just isn't in his nature, and it shows. Rossum's Bulma actually comes off alright and is probably the best character adaptation out of all of them. She looks great in the role and does pretty much everything you'd expect out of Bulma.\n\nDragonball is the crown jewel of the manga/anime business, which makes it only that much more disappointing that the people involved with this film clearly did not understand what people liked so much about it in the first place. It plays like a B-movie with D-class quality in everything except budget. Fortunately, Dragonball is just too big for even this big tub of junk to cause any long lasting hurt to the franchise."

The story was very shallow and failed to leave any impression. At one point, I started laughing by seeing a black man acting as a buddhist monk in a remote mountain. In the end, I left the theatre aghast with myself and admonishing myself for making a such a poor choice.

        "review_detailed_main": "Who said little green men don't exist? According to James Wong they do and, according to James Wong, they make excellent baddies. He couldn't be more wrong, as our antagonist \"lord Piccolo\" makes his way onto the screen, without a flowing introduction, several sly laughs Eco around the cinema as I hear from one corner \"Do I have to sit through 90 minutes of this\". Fortunately, with the movie opening nationwide tomorrow you still have hope of saving yourself, Lord Piccolo is the very least of this movies problems I assure you. I've heard from fans of the series, a series which i don't watch, that the movies follows the story reasonably closely. Now it's clear why I didn't watch the series. The plot is paper thin a mere excuse for an onslaught of cheesy on liners and attempts at wetting our appetite for the painfully obvious twist that's clear a mile off. You'd think that the director of ridiculous but tense thriller \"Final Destination\" would be able to conjure up the same tongue in cheek playfulness with this. And yet any sense of self ridicule is miles away, it feels almost as if Wong thinks he is making a good movie. So for a good hour and a half we are subject to colors thrown at our face, some of the worst direlogue I've ever had to sit thorough and acting that would shame Keanu Reeves.\n\nJames Wong adapts the rich mythos of the Dragonball series that grew from a manga into various popular animated series with this 20th Century Fox production starring Justin Chatwin. The plot revolves around Goku (Chatwin), Earth's greatest champion, who must defend the planet against an invading race of alien warriors hell-bent on dominating the universe. Wong directs from his own script, with Kung Fu Hustle's Stephen Chow producing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters co-stars as the film's villain, Piccolo, with Jamie Chung playing Chi Chi and Emmy Rossum portraying Bulma. Hong Kong legend Chow Yun-Fat rounds out the cast as Master Roshi, Goku's mentor in the film. The story develops at a breakneck pace, granted there is little story to develop, while its good to know the movie is so short, the less of it you have to endure.\n\nThink back to this time last year, a certain manga adaptation was released under the name \"Speed Racer\" this hard, cold, emotionless shell of a movie sported the same recycled material that Dragonball Evolution does. It's nothing but cutsie visual jokes mixed up with some of the worst dialogue in film history. Our protagonist delivers this line with a stale drone \"I am Goku. I am Oozaru. In order to defeat you, I must be one with myself\" and it's only downhill from there. The acting is all over the place ranging from the over eccentric Master Roshi played by Chow Yun-Fat (who really needs to fire his agent) to the mellow underused Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who is by far the best actor present. Though I'm not sure whether or not to blame these actors of to blame James Wong for the way he directed them. I've seen each and every person here gives great performances in different movies and it is possible for them to deliver dialogue without sounding like a reject from Street Fighter.\n\nVerdict: Tearing through its mystical, who-gives-a-toss storyline like a drunk bat bouncing off cave walls, Dragonball's cocktail of cheap effects, eye-rolling clich\u00e9s and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure. Dragonball: Evolution is so lazy and cheap in every aspect of its execution that the end result is almost unwatchable. It's clear no effort has gone into yet another Fox production - The Day the Earth Stood Still anyone? - why anyone would pay to this is beyond me, if your forced however, make sure to order the nachos cause there's plenty of cheese. For my overall rating I give Dragonball Evolution 1/5."

I would advise you all to think twice before you decide to spend your hard earned money to see this movie. By the way, when I stated that this movie was painful to watch, i meant it.

Now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime and then envision a lucky break where you were asked to direct a brand new movie adaptation of that piece of your history. And finally, ask yourself, so you think it possible to remove every single aspect that made that memory so special? Could you do it? Would you, as a fan, be literally capable? Well the people behind Dragonball Evolution certainly managed too, as they manage to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of a much loved series.\n\nBack when I was young I always found a great deal of fun to be found in the anime import Dragonball Z. I was by no means a die-hard fan; I watched only the first few seasons and even as a grade-schooler I could pick out consistent pace issues and gaps in logic. But yet, it was goofy, bloody, wildly inappropriate fun. It would stand to reason a director could draw at least some of the spirit of the Dragonball universe by simply watching the shows or reading the sources material and yet James Wong (who also directed The One and Final Destination 1 and 3) manages to do just that; change fun into camp, over-the-top violence into PG rubbish and alter any of the interesting back-story and lore of the series into an unwatchable tedious origin story.\n\nPerhaps I am missing the mark hugely, but vibe of the film is all off, and I assure you I am not an adaptation Nazi, nihilistically picking out every detail not identical to the source material but I just kept uttering under my breath \"What IS this?!?!\" To that end I am not sure who this film will impress. It will surely not draw in new fans, and as you may have gathered, I am of the impression fans will not be too thrilled either. The opening half of the film is droning, tedious schlock, which then gives way to ridiculous camp, which finally falls into an at least half-successful final act. There is also the possibility that Dragonball will simply never work as a live action adaptation, the anime medium just suits the feel and bizarre pleasure of the story and characters.\n\nThe plot (a term I use loosely) is beyond excusable and consists merely of young warrior Goku (the fresh faced Justin Chatwin), his master Roshi (a mildly entertaining Chow Yun-Fat who must be strapped for cash) a feisty gun-slinger named Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and a creepy hippie conman named Yamcha (Joon Park). Joining forces, they seek to collect 7 mystical Dragonballs, which when brought together grant their holder one wish. But on their trail is the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) and an assassin (Enriko Tamura). The plot suffers further from the bit part from Piccolo which leaves the story with barely a central antagonist, and the plodding pace, unforgivable dialogue and general lack of momentum compile into just a pile of rubbish.\n\nThe final battle finally brings out the style of fighting most fans are accustomed too, but it's too little to late and an insane twist involving Goku is beyond cringe-worthy. The only thing Dragonball Evolution is good for curing is a leg cramp, because 10 minutes of this film and your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out of the theatre.\n\nRead all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm almost glad this film exists not because it's good in anyway but because of how bad it it. And I find that the terribleness of this title has everything to do with the Hollywood studio system in particular FOX STUDIOS. Throughout the years Fox has obtained many notable franchises and completely crapped on all the mythology and character building those series had, and instead making a base level POS turd that would make them a few millions. Case in point all the Fantastic Four movies, Alien, Predator, and X-men. Now they slide their slimy hands into anime. making one of the sorriest excuses of a film I've seen in years. Yeah the characters have the same names and there are winks at the series for fans but the essence of the series is never captured and the entire film feels like western studio drivel. And honestly I find this inexcusable. Granted i wasn't expecting some great storytelling with a Dragonball movie as the show was mostly driven by the action. But come on what the hell is this movie? I hope no one pays to see this, more than that I hope no one ever sees this. I saw this film for free and wished I hadn't wasted the time. My advice steer clear of this flaming Kamehameha of $###."

The acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad. It seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtube.\n\nThe matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars, and i still prefer the Chinese version.\n\nThe problem with this movie is not the history, the problem is that it lacks of the essence of DB. I wouldn't be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny American teenager."

Didn't care if there were not-known actors. And i swear the first 52 seconds of the movie passed and I said: \" I want my money back\" But i didn't leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball ? No- this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry. Extremely cheesy- acting, plot, story, this movie is 1hour 20min long what the f*ck ? It almost feels like they want this piece of misery as soon as possible. GOD THIS MOVIE IS SO SH*T. You already know what happens near the end. Everything deserves a -50/10. When the credits came I nearly shat myself. I went home sat in the sofa and watched the Original cartoons. Do yourself a favor and do the same.\n\n1/10 Abysmal."

The movie was a little rushed, yea, but thats because they want to get the DRAGONBALL story over with, so that they can start with DRAGONBALL Z. This is basically all of the main characters background story, or how they all met. Thats ALL it is. Its like an intro to the sequels.\n\nPersonally, I thought it was great! Even though it was rushed, it was still a fun, cool, and very entertaining movie!(for your information, its a family movie) This movie is more directed towards young kids, and they will LOVE this movie."

This movie is more power-ranger like than what we enjoyed during our childhood, they do not deserve any money for this movie, if i could i would give it a minus 10. in fact i register here just to post this comment!!!\n\nHollywood stay away from japan!!!"

I honestly felt ashamed and dirty watching this.\n\nThe worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar: The Last Airbender. With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate 'AIR BENDING' technique. And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slave.\n\nOnly good thing in this movie was Bulma, Chi Chi, and that chick w/ Piccolo, Asian boobies! They didn't even show nimbus, the kame house, Yamcha had no scar, no tien, no krillin, GOKU Doesn't HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked. Period. The End.\n\nThank god at the end though I walked into Observe and Report and watching a naked dude get shot point blank made me feel better about myself"

Whenever you are going to make a film using names, items, settings, etc. from a franchise as big as DBZ you would take into account that nearly 98% of your viewers will be fans of the franchise. (DBZ) Apparently James Wong does not agree. But, hey, everyone knew withing 5 months of preproduction that they weren't going to follow the story so we all did this. We all accepted that it wasn't a DBZ movie and watched it expecting at least an OK movie considering they had a budget of *cough cough* one hundred million dollars! *holds pinkie to mouth* OK heres the serious. The movie was atrocious. It was closer to the power rangers than the z fighters. None of the characters remotely resembled the anime selves, in looks or attitudes. Even just as a movie it fails. Its like something an 8 year old would love. I wont even say 9 because my 9 year old brother watched my burned version and he hated it!Terrible acting from everyone, except Fat. However I wont defend him; he choose to do this because he had no money I'm sure. Another thing that ticked me off was in the scene where Chi Chi cant open her locker. Well first off you later find out she's a world class fighter so, couldn't she just rip it off it's hinges? Second off, Goku sees so he blows all the lockers away using his Ki energy, and Chi Chi doesn't freak out? She just replies, \"hey you used your Ki.\" Even in the show, which had animals as people in it; everyone freaks out at how unreal it is when they use energy blasts.\n\nWhatever i don't care if i get deleted for this, it needs to be said. JAMES WONG CAN BLOW ME"

What a mistake. This film is so bad and so terrible that it doesn't matter its title or the character's names. How can I explain it?. The worst Power Ranger chapter is deeper and better than Dragonball Evolution. I'm very disappointed 'cause the FOX made this poor and stupid movie. I don't know how they approved it.\n\nPoor performance, a script without creativity, in fact, there's no reasons to watch it. I hope the FOX doesn't earn enough money with Dragonball Evolution in order to cancel possible sequels, but only the audience will say the last word."

And barely months ago, I seen the first trailer available for Dragon Ball Evolution. Oh man, you cannot belief my disgust. \"It's not a dragon ball movie\" screams my sub-conscious. For goodness sake, it doesn't even feel like Dragon Ball universe.\n\nAlright, I have to watch the movie anyhow (admit being a huge fan of the series minus GT). In fact, I just returned from a showing in Brisbane, Australia. Okay, I went into the theater with little expectation. Yet I was willing to bet on the tiny little possibility that I will like the film. I was like \"please.... let there be a little thing that surprises me, let there be something DBZish that I can relate to\".\n\nLet me set the record straight. I was TOTALLY DEVASTATED.....\n\nIt's almost like watching yet another teenage movie, except DB characters names were used. It was like watching kung-pao and said it was a set in the \"crouching tiger, hidden dragon\" world. (mind you, I actually enjoyed kung pao).\n\nI think Dragon Ball Evolution will eventually become a page in history of \"what's not to do with manga\". A earlier reviewer said \"DB evolution was created for people who hate DB\". I saw that comments before watching the movie, and now I totally agrees with it."

Since this person said it was horribly made, and I am such a big fan of DBZ I thought that maybe I should sign up and put my own opinion.\n\nFirst of all, I think that the movie started just as it should for people that have no idea what Dragonball is all about. I found the story line, acting, and special effects to be phenomenal. I personally cannot wait until the next one comes out. Obviously you have to be as big of a fan as I am to appreciate the excellent quality of this live action version of Dragonball. To wait as long as I have to see this movie the author of the main post on IMDp is obviously not a fan but just a critic that didn't do his homework and has never watched the anime version. At least not enough of the anime version to understand the storyline. This person only wanted to see huge Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha Waves and total destruction of cities and floating boulders from so much raw Ki power. That is not possible at this juncture of the story line, IDIOT!!!! The fight scenes, well one word- Awesome!!!! I personally suggest that anyone interested in Dragonball should watch this movie and understand it for what it is, if you know anything about the story line of the anime then you will know what I am talking about. I don't know the Japanese translation of the show however if the English dubs of the anime are in accordance with the Japanese spoken language minus the profanity then this movie is right on. This is the beginning of what I hope to be a series of great live action Dragonball movies. As always though someone from another country has a bur in their butt about the Americanized version of and over seas phenomenon.\n\nIn closing I thought that the movie was great. Thanks for reading."

And I'm also not a boring troll who will sit and trash any movie he can for fun. I happen to love the whole Dragon Ball saga, and I have since I was little, but I'm also a realist and know that things need to be changed for cinema.\n\nThis movie, however, is a piece of crap on so many levels.\n\nFor example, I'm also a big fan of Harry Potter books. I hate the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' due to so many liberties being taken with the film. However, after re-watching it, I still have to respect that it is a good, well-made film. 'Dragonball Evolution' is just straight-up terrible in every possible sense of the word.\n\nThe \"story\" here is basically, a teenager named Goku is given a mystical Dragon Ball from his grandfather. After twenty minutes of bad teen dialogue, awkward stumbling through lines and the worst back story in history, Goku sets off to find Master Roshi to alert him that Lord Piccolo has returned.\n\nNow, some of the fight scenes are decent, most of them are not (a lot of unnecessary slow-motion). That scarcely makes up for the wooden, horrible acting on display. Justin Chatwin is probably the most un-emotional actor I've ever seen. I've never met a more unlikeable hero; in fact, I hated him. Anyone who knows Goku from the television series.. Could you imagine hating Goku? Lord Piccolo is also the worst cinematic villain in history, at no real fault of James Marsters. Piccolo was scarcely in the movie, and he did nothing. Also, the way he was introduced was basically.. \"We locked up Piccolo. He's back! Aw crap\" and that was it. Piccolo also has a random girl named Mai who is a shape shifter and does all of his bidding. So, the only thing this movie really stirs up is apathy, as I couldn't even force myself to care about any of the characters.\n\nAll in all, if you are the type of person who likes to watch bad movies for their comedic value, this one is priceless. From a slow motion crying scene to the most predictably bad cheesy dialogue ever, this one has it all. To be fair, Chow Yun-Fat is pretty entertaining as Roshi. Oh, and there is no shortage of cleavage shots, for you guys out there.\n\n2/10 on a film scale 9.5/10 on an unintentional comedy scale"

        "review_detailed_main": "Listen, if you're going to adapt a thirteen episode season of a beloved anime into a film that is less than 80 minutes long, atleast try to capture the essence of the source material. Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here are shoddy cosplayers reenacting a script that was clearly written during a short lunch break as the writer was watching a completely different anime at the time, because sweet starry balls this was not 'Dragonball Z' at all! A white American Goku must find seven balls so that he can make a wish, which in turn will stop the evil forces of darkness. Let's re-visit some ground rules. First rule: if you are creating a western adaptation, ensure you don't succumb to whitewashing. Either have an all-white cast or not at all. Making the lead protagonist white and the supporting characters Asian is an insult to fans, audiences and the source material. Second rule: Authenticity. Stay true to the source material and don't, oh I don't know...make a complete left turn by butchering an already simple story. Third rule: cast decent actors. Not even Yun-Fat with his absurd overacting could provide a distraction from the woeful acting on display. Final and most important rule: make a good film. When the best scene of the entire film is Jamie Chung getting unexpectedly donkey kicked in the chest (unintentionally hilarious!), something isn't quite right. Goku has all the charisma of a restless sloth. The fighting sequences were plagued with half second jump cuts. The story was uninteresting and not even remotely developed. \"We need to find all seven dragonballs!\" 5 minutes later... \"the enemy have all seven dragonballs!\". Goku transforms into what looks like a werewolf, not an ape. Goku didn't care for his grandfather (still doesn't). Goku effortlessly lights a candle twice, but fails the third time. Goku beats up his future girlfriend and she doesn't care. Goku looks like a discount Aaron Paul. Goku is in this. This film is 79 minutes too long. I'm done. So, essentially, avoid this fan made film like the plague."

        "review_detailed_main": "Goku is a high school student. He's a bit of a loser, he gets picked on by bullies, and has trouble talking to girls (especially Chi-Chi, on whom he has a crush). However, Goku has a secret. He has these powers, which make him incredibly powerful in just about every way possible. He is an orphan, and lives with is grandfather, Gohan, who trains him to fight. But he warns Goku that he shouldn't use his powers to fight schoolyard bullies, only on the great powers of darkness that are inevitably going to show up fairly soon, or else people will get bored and leave the theatre. On his eighteenth birthday, he is given by his grandfather a mysterious spherical object called a Dragonball. There are only seven of these in existence, and anyone who collects all of them will be granted one single perfect wish (I assume that means one without any conditions. So is wishing for more wishes allowed?) So anyway, Goku is distracted from his school work by Chi-Chi. Later that day, she is having trouble opening up her electronic locker (the film is set in the near future, or a parallel universe, or something like that), so, in order to impress her, he uses his powers to open it for her. This does indeed impress her, and she invites him to a party she is having that night. However a group bullies shows up at the party, and call him names. Goku, not wishing to disobey his grandfather, but still wishing to cause these people as much pain as possible, gets into a fight with them, but instead of inflicting any blows, he merely dodges the attacks made against him so that his aggressors hurt themselves rather than him. This impresses Chi-Chi further, and they talk. You get the impression that they're about to almost kiss, however the actual plot (finally) kicks in, and Goku rushes back home to find his Gohan murdered by a green alien played by James Marsters, called Piccolo. He is after the Dragonball that Goku inherited that day, so he can use it for his own evil purposes.\n\nSound familiar? Well, it should, because there is very little, if anything at all, that is original about Dragonball: Evolution. It begins as a generic high school drama filled with clich\u00e9s we've all seen a million times before, and have no real desire to see again, especially in what is supposed to be an action film. Eventually, it becomes an adventure movie, as Goku teams up with a girl called Bulma, who wants to locate all the Dragonballs so that she can be famous; Yamcha, a thief who wants to harness their power to gain immense wealth; as well as Master Roshi, a perverted, middle-aged man whom Gohan, before dying in Goku's arms (just before, of course, the obligatory \"believe in yourself, and you can do anything\" speech) tells him to locate. I believe that Gohan and Roshi were friends, or something. I only walked out of the cinema about an hour ago, and already I am forgetting what exactly the movie is about. Yes, you guessed it, they're looking for the Dragonballs, before they fall into Piccolo's sinister hands. There's not really much else to talk about that concerns the film, to be honest. There is an adventure, but you've undoubtedly seen something like it many times before (all that's different is what they happen to be looking for). There's action, but it's poorly executed (especially after the recent Watchmen, which had a similar style of action; only it, as well as the movie itself, was executed in a far superior manner). There's also romance (between Goku and Chi-Chi, as well as Bulma and Yamcha), but it's so contrived that it's laughable (a romantic scene between the former two ended with a sarcastic round of applause from the audience, myself included). The scenes that are meant to be humorous are far less amusing than the ones that are trying to be serious.\n\nWhile I wouldn't consider myself a fan of either the manga or anime upon which Evolution is based, these are both far superior works to this movie, and definitely worth checking out.\n\nAs for Dragonball: Evolution (in case you haven't already worked it out)\u0085as far as I'm concerned, it is a bad movie. However, I would actually recommend watching it, because much of it is unintentionally amusing, and it does give off a so-bad-it's-good-vibe,\n\nBut still, a movie that's so bad it's good is still, well, bad."

I honestly think they should just remake this movie. There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes. The villains also sucked. The dialog was very poorly written as well.\n\nFrom the start, you have very unlikeable characters. Almost everyone was very poorly cast. I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine, but Bulma was absolutely terrible. I hated her and really wanted her to die.\n\nThe ending made me very angry also. I was hoping that there would be some epic fight, but again, I was very disappointed. After this \"fight\" was over, I was left scratching my head in disbelief.\n\nTerrible dialog, awfully cast characters, and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD release.\n\nAnd flying Hummers?

I mean are those kis? Are those kamehame? They light stuff? wow amazing...\n\n6) The special effects are terrible. They look like Adobe After Effects\n\n7) The oozaru... LOL\n\n8) The dragon... LOL is that Spyro?\n\n9) The final fight scene is ridiculous\n\n10) The ending is more ridiculous them ridiculous\n\nNow the good:\n\n1) Hot girls\n\n2) Wait... there's actually seven dragon balls in this movie!!\n\n3) Oh my! There's a guy called Son Goku! Just like in the anime!\n\nI advice you to not, TO NOT see this movie. You already know its bad, but you have no idea how bad it really is.

Unexpectedly Gohan will transform into the Ozzoro leaving Piccolo no option but to destroy the moon, or say goodbye to the earth.

At the beginning of the movie, Goku cracks a lot of corny jokes, which really gave me the feel of the anime. Dragonball the anime was always full of terrible jokes so I thought maybe Wong did this on purpose. However, after venturing farther into this movie, I think it was an accident. James Chatwin may be the worst actor in the business after this movie. In some parts he reminded me of William Shatner when he was Captain Kirk on Star Trek. Also, the fight scenes maybe lasted around 2 minutes tops. I mean really Mr. Wong, what the hell were you thinking? It hurts me to say this movie sucked, but there's no better word to describe it. If this movie got a new director and script, then a sequel is very possible. Character development is key in Dragonball, and this movie had none whatsoever. So don't go into this movie with your hopes up. Instead, be optimistic that someone else will pick this script up and re-vamp it for a better, clever, and more violent sequel. It is possible, but right after seeing this horrible adaptation, my hopes are not high."

Case in point: the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Goku's remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul (not a theme exclusive to Transformers, obviously, but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here). He's a horny, frustrated, manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world (this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha technique).\n\nI'm only a casual fan of the original series, but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I tried to count the many, MANY canonical errors this movie made and I lost count at about ten minutes in. It got to be very concerning for me, as if not a single person in the cast or crew had ever seen a Dragonball episode in their lives. The script is so far gone from the original plot that I can not even imagine what must have gone through the writer's head as he composed this garbage. Surely he did not intend to further the gripping tale so timeless and successful that it sparked a decades-old franchise, so what might have been the reason behind this movie? It is a question that has offered up another question that I can not answer: how different can a licensed piece of work be from the original and still claim to be related?\n\nIn the original series Goku was just a little kid with a monkey tail having all kinds of wacky adventures searching for the Dragon Balls. Bulma had hair the color of a robin's egg, Roshi was older than the hills, and Chi-Chi was the princess daughter of an enormous beast of a man appropriately named \"The Ox King\". Apparently my inferior Earth logic can not comprehend the neural paths required to transform this series into a teenage high school drama. Teenagers should not even be watching this program anymore!\n\nThe first episodes to premier in America were in early 1996. Even if you were six years old when you got hooked on this show, where are you now? You are in college, still drinking illegally but well past living with your parents and trying to \"fit in\" with the \"normal crowd\". Even if you ARE in high school, you are five to ten years past watching anything decent on Cartoon Network, much less an episode of Dragonball.\n\nMy point is that the apparent target audience of this movie is Dragonball fans first and teenage drama fans second. The plot being as far removed from the original story as my car is from the moon, Dragonball fans will hate this movie. They will hate it and everyone associated with it. I am genuinely surprised that in the 8.5 hours (as of this writing) the movie has been out, someone has not been murdered because of the rage it creates among its rabid fan base.\n\nIf you have never seen Dragonball and have no expectations for this movie, go ahead and see it. You are the only people I could possibly recommend this movie to. However, you will be sorely disappointed by its lack of a driving plot, stunted length, numerous unanswered questions, and the fact that you will see no naked breasts on the screen. As a movie alone, it is still worthless. At no point did I find myself asking, \"I wonder what will happen next,\" but again I might be biased, the aforementioned rabid Dragonball fan that I am.\n\nSee this movie for yourself if you do not believe me, but please, do not see it in the movie. Download it illegally, for I will not live with myself knowing I furthered the popularity of such a disgraceful piece of trash."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dragonball Evolution\" has a great distinction. It's currently #20 on the infamous IMDB Bottom 100 List...the list of the worst rated major release films. This isn't totally surprising, as the list currently has quite a few films based on videogames*....such as \"Street Fighter\", \"BloodRayne\", \"Alone in the Dark\", \"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Far Cry\". But it does boggle the mind to try to understand how a studio can throw this much money at a film project and STILL come up with garbage. For $30,000,000, they created a film that's lower rated than \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"!!\n\nGoku** is a high schooler who as been trained by his grandpa to master his great fighting skills...though Goku has been sternly instructed to hide these skills and not fight. But after Grandpa is attacked by forces of Lord Piccolo (some weird green guy who looks like Gazoo), he tells Goku to find Roshi to tell him that Piccolo has returned. Then, grandpa assumes room temperature and Goku goes on his quest. Soon he picks up some compatriates and hopefully they can successfully stop Piccolo and whatever naughtiness he has planned....and part of that involves Piccolo finding all seven dragonballs.\n\nWhat follows is a film that is just about all fighting...one fight after another after another. The plot, what there was of it, I found confusing*** and the dialog was often rather dopey. And, speaking of dopey, this film repeated one of the worst cliches. In \"Star Wars: Episode 3\" you have young Vader fighting inches from lava without even breaking a sweat or spontaneously combusting....and the same occurs here.\n\nOverall, a confusing and bad film with a rather anticlimactic ending. But I also think that it's not quite Bottom 100 bad. I think the reason it made the list is that lovers of the franchise were so angry and disappointed in the film they tended to score it especially low. Still, either way, it was a poor movie....at best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Yes, I know Dragonball was also an anime...a very popular one at that. And the fans of the show apparently were NOT pleased with this film...much like they were when \"The Last Airbender\" came to theaters.\n\n**Why does Goku look like a typical American teen and yet grandpa is Asian? What's with that?!\n\n***Maybe fans of the show/videogame won't be as confused as me. I just found the plot to be a mess."

The first one ranks amongst the best of the trilogy; the second one was all about steroids and screaming matches for ten minutes until they had no room, and the third one tried to combine most... but by then it was over. But the first one, a retelling with some twists on the legendary Monkey King story eons ago, was amongst the most memorable.\n\nYou had a charming little tale of a young boy, lost in the road of life and blissfully unaware of what the city, the world, had to offer him. Joining a spunky intelligent lass on a quest to collect the seven DragonBalls. Seven grant a wish, but this path would not be easy: midget demons were after it, an entire army of soldiers with dark intentions were after it, not to mention desert thieves and bandits. To the common stranger, you might as well have called this somewhat of thinly veiled Superman story, or simply taking a classic legend into something funny, witty, and wise.\n\nThis piece of sh.t is an abomination. If the early photo designs of a dude in an Ambercrombie and Fitch t-shirt with a strangely chiseled jawline and rubbery Goku plastic hair did not phase you, then now you will ultimately learn your mistake in judgment, my friend.\n\nFrom the very moment I booted this up, nothing seemed to bother me. Why is Goku not Asian? I shrugged it off, and was kind there. They screwed this up in two other adaptations, but I figured, 'Well, it's not like I watch this show anymore, so...' Then I questioned the absence of Roshi's beard and sunglasses, his crave of porn. This too was absent. Where was Yamcha's mane? Why is Bulma ugly? All of these were simple marks I passed off, thinking, 'Well, it's not like Hollywood gets anything right anymore... they see something beautiful and take a dump on it.' Then I saw one pivotal plot point, and then I was done.\n\nI was done.\n\nI could not see this movie any more.\n\nFor anyone who should have seen DragonBall in some form or another - and you should have, it's been on for a century now in constant movie re releases - then you should know Son Goku. Goku is a masculine Hulk Hogan character who, stupid as he is, knows how to rearrange people's faces physically while being a gentle soul.\n\nSo forgive me when I ask, why is he being picked on by black people at thirty minutes into the movie and acting like an emotional, suicidal teenager? Can someone point me into the idiot who added that into the script? Why is he going to school with that haircut? With that kind of confused, poor attempt at a James Dean face, I'd beat the hell out of him too.\n\nAt that point, I took my rental and snapped the disc in two. It does not deserve to live. Nor does it need a sequel, or games.\n\nThis is when we allow 2nd graders borrow the 'Superman' script by Richard Donner for reviews and editing."

This manga-turned anime series was brought to life by Japanese artist Akira Toriyama who brought on air in Japan in the late 1980s before the show made its way to the U.S to become a cult sensation it still remains today. The genesis of the television show is a boy named Goku who travels across the world in search of seven magic orbs (known as Dragonballs) that will summon a dragon who will grant the finders one wish before scattering the orbs across the world for a next find. Along the way, he meets friends who assist on his journey and fight against the evil monsters that stand in his way. Growing up a DBZ fan as a kid, I was exciting about a DBZ, although I was a bit skeptical about live-action adaption to the television show. When a television gets a film adaption, fans want it be entertaining and pleasing to watch. Unfortunately, this adaption to the DBZ series is just a film gone terribly wrong.\n\nThis film, directed by James Wong, stars Justin Chatwin as the iconic character Goku, a high school student living with his grandfather Gohan (played Randall Duk Kim). On his eighteenth birthday, his grandfather gives a magical orb called a dragonball which can used by the dragon Porunga to grant one wish, but only when the other six scattered across the world are found. When the world becomes threatened by an evil alien Lord Piccolo (played by James Marsters), Goku bands together with martial art master Roshi (played by Chow-Yun Fat), scientist named Bulma (played by Emma Rossum), her boyfriend Yamcha (played by Joon Park), and later Goku's high school crush Chi-Chi (played by Jamie Chung) to fight off against the evil Lord Piccolo and find the dragonballs to save the world from his wrath. What could have been a exciting action- packed thrill ride becomes a horrendous adaption that's plagued by horrible acting, terrible writing, cheesy dialogue, and an overall lack of spirit to the television franchise.\n\nIt is astounding difficult to describe a massive disappointment this film is, especially for those fans of the TV show. The best way to start maybe the poorly written characters that fall short of spirit to their television counterparts. This story takes the liberties of making Goku into a high school student who develops a crush on Chi- chi which is blatantly false to the original source material. To matters worse, the film plagues the characters with laughable dialogue that sounds like from a cheesy teen rom-com. The performances of these characters are far too lazy to take seriously, and the writings of these characters make them difficult to care for; and for DBZ fans, unrecognizable. Later we introduced to Master Roshi who is given laughable performance by Chow-Yun Fat and awkward dialogue much like the rest of the characters. None of the characters are properly developed, nor the main villain Piccolo who remains one-note throughout the short runtime. As the film progresses, it transcending through a series of story elements that are completely unfaithful to both anime and manga series, and action sequences that should have been redeeming, but fall short of depth, not even closely resembling the fight scenes appeared on the show.\n\nDragonball; Evolution is a total disgrace to the television series, and a major disappointment to fans of the series everywhere. Whether you are a fan of the show or not, this film is definitely NOT one I can recommend. It stands as a definite example of what a television- based movie shouldn't be, and one that fails to stay true to its original source material."

I am very disappointed and this does not happen often, I am actually frustrated.\n\nThe characters don't look anything like their cartoon counterparts and it seems to be blatantly obvious that very little, if any, effort was taken to rectify this. To lay more emphasis on my previous statement let me give you one example, Yamcha's most distinguishing or noticeable facial characteristic, the scar was missing.\n\nThe writers have done a pathetic job, I seriously doubt if they have even seen the anime and I would like to summarize the director's role with just 2 words 'utterly disgraceful'. The storyline is a joke (not the funny kind either). The fight sequences were just lame and the worst part is that, it seems that nobody took the little effort required to make this movie even bearable.\n\nAs a dragon ball z fan, I have to say that I actually consider this movie to be nothing short of a disgrace to the dragon ball series. I still can't believe that someone is even willing to put their name on this train wreck.\n\nIf you are planning to watch this movie or due to sheer curiosity are thinking \"exactly how bad can it be?\". Take my word for it, expect the worst and it still won't reach your expectations.\n\nAs I said before, this movie can be summarized as \"A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY\"."

        "review_title": "Underrated very faithful adaptation of Manga/comic",
        "review_detailed_main": "The film was a very good book/cartoon/ to Live/action adaptation. Starting off, the point of the name of the film \"evolution\" means basically a step up from it being a straight adaptation of the kids cartoon show towards making it more for a younger/teen audience hence \"Goku in high school\" The beginning of the film has such a Dragonball feel to it when you see Goku with the sweat dropping from his face and then giving the signature \"Goku\" look in the cartoon. The scene also is very \"cartoonish\" too with Grandpa Gohan's lines \"prepare to eat dirt!\" and the fighting is also very impressive even having a very \"dragonball\" feel it to as well. Justin Chatwin has such the face of Goku it's not even funny as does James Marsters with the face of Piccolo hence perfect casting choice for the both of them. I could say more about how they gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga too! (listed below). However there could have been much more fighting with Goku and Piccolo. The most impressive thing to me was the look and feel of the Dragonball world they created for the film that really matched or gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga..There definitely is more and I'll add more when I watch it again. The film even played like watching a full-length episode on the TV!!..The film also had a very beautiful and impressive score that had a feel of \"hope\" and \"faith\" when watching it. Even the film had a great Buddhist message in it too matching the Manga/cartoon.. \"In order to become One, I must be two\" In order to become \"One with your soul\" you must become One with the Divine \"Yin-Yang\" The Divine Mother and Father \"Creator\" of the Universe. By becoming \"ONE\" with them you transcend the opposites of the your soul and are now born again in them as now a \"Buddha child\" of the Divine. The creator of the Manga and cartoon Akira Toriyama created it with this Buddhist principle and message since he really has a great admiration and respect to the religion of Buddhism..Definitely a great message for children to have great faith to overcome all evils of the world and follow God and become \"pure\" and \"holy\" in Him and remain \"ONE\" in Him as His Child of Divine Love..\n\nHere are more of things the filmmakers did to tribute to Manga/cartoon\n\n1. Master Roshi's home being on an island in the city tributing the cartoon of it being on a island in the ocean\n\n2. Piccolo's ship hover-craft\n\n3. The World Martial Arts Tournament\n\n4. The signature \"Goku\" look Justin Chatwin makes in the one scene in the beginning\n\n5. The fight scene in the beginning having a very Dragonball feel with Goku and Gohan fighting and balancing on two ropes\n\n6. Gohan being taught by Roshi\n\n7. Roshi teaching Goku about his powers\n\n8. Yamcha being a Desert Raider\n\n9. Bulma's hair and her working for her father \"Capsule Corporation\"\n\n10. Capsule Corporation\n\n11. Bulma's magic capsule pill device\n\n12. 7 Dragonballs gives the beholder one \"perfect\" wish from Shenron\n\n13. Dragonballs created by 7 Mystics to keep world in balance and at peace symbolizing how \"Kami\" created them for the same purpose\n\n14. The look of the Dragonball world created in the film looking very similar to the cartoon and comic\n\n15. Piccolo creating minions to help him get Dragonballs\n\n16. Goku becoming Ozaru when moon is full\n\n17. Goku using Kamehameha\n\n18. Piccolo searching for the Dragonball by destroying cities\n\n19. Goku having a relationship with Chi-chi\n\n20. Rice-Cooker Evil containment wave\n\n21. Goku eating more than regular people\n\n22. Goku's hair\n\n23. Both Piccolo and Goku (Saiyans) coming from another world who wrecked destruction on Earth and other planets long ago\n\n24. Goku's Supernatural Powers \"Qi\"\n\n25. Bulma's Radar Device\n\n26. Goku's Grandpa teaching him about his powers\n\n27. Goku coming from another planet and being raised by his Grandfather\n\n28. Sufi Norris \"Master Mutaito\" 1st using Evil Containment Wave to trap Piccolo in Rice cooker \"Master Mutaito\"\n\n29. The end climax scene with Roshi using concealment wave on Piccolo trying to trap him in the rice cooker\n\n30. The volcano scene with Goku trying to find one of the Dragonballs tributing how Goku in the Manga searched dangerous places to find it too\n\n31. Mai being Piccolo's servant who helps him try to find Dragonballs\n\n32. The Dragon Temple to try to summon/awaken Shenron with the 7 Dragonballs\n\n33. Gohan speaking to Goku in the Spirit trying to warn him and fight Piccolo using his Qi..tributing Kami and the good gods of the Spirit world guiding Goku and helping him become a warrior throughout DB and DBZ\n\n34. Goku in signature uniform fighting Piccolo at the end and defeating him with the most powerful Dragonball move from the Manga/cartoon and using the phrase \"Kamehameha\"\n\n35. Paozu City tributing Mount Paozu where Gohan raised Goku\n\n36. 7 Mystics tributing \"Kami\" and Master Mutaito 1st using the Evil Containment Wave \"Mafuba\" to contain/seal Piccolo in rice cookie thousands of years ago\n\n37. Roshi liking \"Hot\" girls\n\n38. Roshi dying after using Mafuba on Piccolo\n\n39. The Stone Temple tributing Orin Temple\n\n40. Goku carrying heavy weight to become stronger while Roshi teaching him\n\nIf you think they didn't tribute or weren't faithful to the cartoon \"King Piccolo Saga\" then after reading this hopefully you changed your mind."

Goku's transformation into an ape was poorly done. I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma; she did well. Chatwin was alright. I think the movie should have to be re-shoot better fight scenes, extreme power for destructions (that is what Dragonball was known for). The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasn't really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more. My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer; it made me unhappy. I wont recommend this movie; this should have just been put on the shelves for TV/cable viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK were to start, with this awful movie. First fan in and out. ,have the original anime series on DVD (well the ones that are out). Second At least it is considered a start, a good start...no, terrible start, but a start nonetheless.\n\nCharacters, master roshi, good actor choice no one can argue, but he had to be more perverted towards bulma/more perverted anyway and has to be more clumsy in my opinion. The character as Goku, my lord, clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9. Knowing the results before they happen leaves no experience to go on with the movie (it isn't hard to guess after each incident what will/would happen next). And how come Goku wasn't getting trained to much or use of his stick (by Roshi), tell about 'rushed' results. Last for Goku is..\"The HAIR\", young, old, new, anything, Goku is known for the hair, not somewhat a 70's cut like in this movie, but actually hair that is so out there like the anime's, people know him just by the hair (hair result in movie = failed). For piccolo, the fan that wrote on IMDb, Piccolo, 'looks like a vampire and his costume is matrix to a T', nailed it on the review. It's 2009 and piccolo looked like 1999 horror movie, and his clothes??? where is the cap and hat that weigh him down in training come on give me/us something!! Yamcha wasn't bad (by bad, his acting was OK), but kind of useless (his character). I guess the director never really saw or understood the Yamcha character from the anime (i wont spoil, watch the movie, understand the cartoon and you'll see). Yamacha supposed to be some what a good fighter, epically in DB not so much DBZ or DBGT, although in all of them Yamcha stands out most in DB as a strong/somewhat equal fighter to Goku. In this movie, he was just a bandit, with no talent except to rob.....bore! Now for the females, meaning Chi Chi and Bulma/hell even the other 'bad' chick. All are beautiful(bulma more than the others), Chi Chi(second) was like a goku character, clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, knowing either what her line is/was going to be, or knowing what will/would/is going to happen to her, or around her. Bulma's role wasn't to bad (although needs more GREEN to her hair, maybe she can borrow some from the awful looking Piccolo), she was what she kind of is/was in the amine. Smart/and a good fighter. The cheesiness in her lines comes from what the director puts in the script so you can't fault her for those. The morphing chick mai, pretty but in the end useless. Yea she helps the evil character to conquer the earth but come on, her powers aren't and were never really useful to help someone like a Piccolo. You can tell when she morphs to someone else, and is going to be plotting evil or bad things (i wont mention parts in movie, but you will be strictly able to guess them while watching/if ever watching :)).\n\nIn the end i say 3, why? Because it does use the name dragonball, and does have dragonball characters, and tries to be/tie the 'dragonball' concept but fails, and fails miserably. So it's like a bad action movie, except fans of the original anime/and others will want to watch this movie just to see what 'bad' action for a DB/DBZ/DBGT fan really means.\n\n2 last notes - Visual effects, it looks 50/50 on arguments for these....unless they were low on cash, the effects plain out suck, i can do better with the comp I'm using to write this. No offense, people that think there OK to Good, i dunno what movie you were watching but the effects were below par..and far below par, like the script of this movie. Second - Oh yea, the dragon (shenron), did anybody find the dragon was like the size of a big whale or something (not to be funny?? Remember this dragon (Shenron) is supposed to be the size of the earth/universe/ something huge to show how important he is, and in the movie, he is like the 'baby Shenron' so tiny and looks useless (useless by how he grants the wish's), and why dosen't he talk??\n\nAnyways 3/10, that's pushing the 3."

Perhaps it was just me, but each characters direction seemed to be that of watching a colony of ants at work. In other words, you see that they were all doing something, but to the untrained eye you're not able to define their exact role. This was nothing more than 85 minutes of random events taking place. All I kept thinking was a quote from Peter Griffin \"my God! why don't somebody throw a pie!\". When the lights finally came on in the theater, the disappointed reaction from everyone (Dragon Ball fan or first time novice) was the same...

LOL Obviously it doesn't follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate. Call me crazy or stupid all you want. But as a die-hard DB and DBZ fan I went, I saw and I am buying the DVD. ^O^"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a HUGE Dragonball fan, I was psyched to the announcement of a live action movie a few months back; but as more information was revealed I started to lose faith. A few days prior to seeing the movie, I had lost all hope of it being remotely good. A 3/10 on IMDb spells disaster. After seeing the movie I can say that I am pleasantly surprised. Although the story was Americanized and modernized to hell and back, it did have its moments of faithfulness to the original manga/anime, specifically with the characters. Goku was very different from the anime, but it was good in its own way. Chatwin did a good job with what he had to work with. I was especially happy with Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi. I was skeptical of his placement in the movie until I saw it myself. He did a fantastic job of bringing the Master Roshi we know to life on the big screen. Lets not forget Yamcha either; he too was able to very faithfully recreate the original character. I was not big on Rossum Bulma but she did do a decent job. Marsters was a good Piccolo but he didn't get as much screen time as I had hope for. As far as anime faithfulness goes, there were several other things throw in that surprised me as far as getting them right but I won't go into detail, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. Overall, Dragonball Evolution is a decent modern martial arts film with some neat special effects, cool action scenes, but not a faithful adaptation to the series we all know and love. My final verdict is a 6/10 but I could be swayed to a 7/10. Don't let its inaccuracies prevent you from experiencing a new twist on the same old (amazing) story, its still worth your time if you enjoy a good old action movie."

My son could make a better movie than this and I don't even have a son! I mean common man none of the characters looked like the anime characters, I wish they could hit all the people who watched this crap with that lost memory gun they used on MIB and sacked the whole film crew that made this garbage and started from scratch, and maybe get a director that has actually watched the series not some guy with a Asian name just to sit more bums at the theater's, I'm so glad I didn't waste money watching this crap at a cinema!!!! But I still feel ripped off! I'm so angry at the moment because DB is one of the all time great anime's! And to be f#$#d like that really pisses me off! And too all those people saying that this is a GREAT movie\u0085..we all know who u work for\u0085fox must be paying u well because it must be hard sleeping at night with the smell of BS coming out of your mouths!

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball, my precious childhood cartoon, how much I hate to see you fall to the hands of such a pitiful director.\n\nWhat on earth was twentieth century fox thinking? James Wong is by far one of the most under-classed directors in the field, and they decided to put him on the Dragonball project? Has anyone looked at his movie history? He did the Final Destination movies, the first one was good but the rest were laughable. Also The One with Jet Li. To think that it would be really hard to make a movie stink with Jet Li in it. Guess what?...James Wong managed to do it.\n\nAlso, what on earth was he thinking with the cast list? Justin Chatwin? What has he done that is noticeable? Oh and Joon Park. He has done two movies in the U.S. He was a driver in Speed Racer and now he is doing Yamcha and Dragonball. He did the audition in shorts and a t-shirt and he was given the part...excuse me? How can a director make such a poor decision when coming to auditions? Emmy Rossum was a good acting choice, but what is the point of good acting if you also have poor duologue? The writer also, look at his history. He has done almost absolutely nothing. Basically what twentieth century fox did was take the worst of everything and everyone to try to make a movie for fan-boys/girls. Look out it turned out.\n\nNow that I am done with the ranting, let me quickly summarize how this project should have been gone about.\n\nFor a director, they should have told James to take a hike and hire someone who actually has a good amount of experience. If it were up to me then I would put Zack Snyder on the project. The man is a brilliant director with a visual mind unlike any other. Look what he did with 300 and Watchmen. I could definitely see him doing the same for Dragonball. As far as the cast, it is simple, find people with experience. The cast of Watchmen was not very noticeable before the movie but they did great with this movie because the director actually cared about the movie when it came to auditions. For a scriptwriter, It is not a hard concept, find a smart well known scriptwriter and have him adopt from the Manga. James Wong just seemed too lazy to do any of this. Anyone who is not James Wong would have known all of this which proves how under-classed he is.\n\nDo us a favor Hollywood. Redo this movie someday and tell James Wong to take a hike and do it right. Thank you for ruining this experience for me James, really."

It was painful, that's the only way I can describe it. The story is extremely clich\u00e9, and the plot and theme is less than mediocre.\n\nBeing an avid fan of the series. It is hard for me to say this but, this movie is a 1/10. They did not follow the story of Dragonball, they simply took the Title and the Names of the characters.\n\nI can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogy.\n\nWhat a shame, and what a disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK I'm reviewing this while watching it so Yeah apologise for the ruff edges , my main issues with this movie is not the casting however it is an issue , its the apparent disregard for the story there are massive plot gaps previously cover'd in the show like Gokus grandpa being killed by piccolo instead of being killed by Goku when he transformed , Goku not having a tail etc.. stuff like that , if you've ever watched the Dragon ball , or Dragon ball z then this movie will aggravate you the the point of migraine\n\nNow lets move to the casting issues lets start with the Pros: master Roshi , Yamcha and even Goku to and extent are played surprisingly well and keep to the shows characters Roshi is a dirty old pervert , Yamcha is a money chasing scoundrel , and Goku is the good guy pure and simple\n\nCONS : and these are the real bones to pick Chi chi , Bulma & Piccolo are played ridiculously badly they have no Clue what there doing it feels to me that James Wong (director) watched like 3 episodes and said yeah lets butcher this , Bulma is flat there's no real spark from her no chemistry with Goku or Yamcha , Chi chi is some teenage cheer leader type doesn't really come across as the warrior princess from the show & Piccolo Ah where to begin Using James Masters just didn't work he just doesn't have the presence required to play such a Strong character his performance just came of as weak and not very engrossing.\n\nNow that weave got that out of the way i can tackle the Movies flaws as a whole most of the movie as drawn out with very little action , some shallow references to stables of the show like the Kame Hame ha etc... but to me it's missing way to much to even call itself a dragon ball movie so Manny characters don't make an appearance such as , krillin Goku's best friend , Tien , ChuSu , Mr Po Po , Corin the list goes on and for a move called dragon ball it cant quite decide when its taken place its seams to jump and take elements from later and try and mix them , for example goku is 18 in this movie and in the show by that time he has met Bulma ,Yamcha,Master Roshi and beaten the RR army and defeated king piccolo were in this hes had an uneventful childhood as soon as he reaches 18 all manner of crap happens also in the end battle when you expect to see a excellent fight sequence your instead treated to Goku's supposed transformation in to Ozaru in the show a Giant destructive ape in the movie a guy that badly needs shaved .\n\nin conclusion and i apologise for ranting , but i grew up with these shows and it really aggravates me when directors bastardise them like thieve done here , I've waited for years to see this show brought to the big screen and to see some of the epic sagas play out with real actors and see what a Hollywood budget could do to improve a beloved franchise ...., if this movie is anything to go by Not a frigging LOT if your a fan of the SHOW then for your own sake AVOID this Luke warm Puddle of excrement calling its self a movie ."

I tried to watch the scenes with no fighting but they were just so boring, I think the acting was awful as well. I hope this movie gets put into the hands of real film makers, and that the next one is fully complete and can actually be as well done as the anime was all these years."

If I could stop the movie, take a good picture of them, I thing it would worth as a background of a background (that no one can see).\n\n2.

        "review_detailed_main": "Before seeing this movie, take into consideration what was done with the new Star Trek movie. That being said, I looked at Dragonball Evolution as an almost alternate universe from the original anime. Yes, there are in fact some MAJOR differences from this movie and the anime; simply looking at anything at all in regards to this movie, the viewers can see that Goku is an adult in the movie, whereas in the anime he starts out as a child.\n\nWhen people go to the movies to see something that was originally a comic book, or a book, they need to EXPECT for there to be some changes. Look at Spiderman, in the TV show, the spider that bit him went through a radioactive beam and then found it's way to Parker. In the Spiderman movie (2002), the scientists changed the DNA of the spiders to genetically enhance them.\n\nThe same has to be done for Dragonball: Evolution. The director probably knew that things would be different in the movie than how they were in the anime and in the manga. Yes, Goku's hair (as can be seen in the posters and whatnot) isn't exactly the same as it was, but how goofy would Justin have looked with that hair due? They wanted the whole thing to feel more NOW.\n\nI feel that they did that quite well. They wanted to introduce a new Goku, and they did it.\n\nWhen watching the movie, come out of the box a little and look at what they did. Not just how different it is; take into consideration the time, the audiences that would go and see it (Not all of the viewers would be super hardcore DB/DBZ/GT fans!), and the fact that they wanted to test to see how well it could be done.\n\nIt's VERY hard to turn something that's been drawn for so long into real flesh and blood."

        "review_detailed_main": "as many other reviewers, I grew up watching DB. Between some good action series (dark angel) and action movies (Fantasic Four) I thought Fox was going to do a good tribute. But no. This movie was terrible. Plot was changed deliberately it had almost nothing to do with the original saga. Fight scenes were good but minor and other than one or two cheap \"After Effects\" power blasts (won't reduce myself to call those abominations kamehameha or mafuba) the movie failed to impress me. Not only they disprespected us old-school fans, but also a great and very known Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, who composed a song SPECIALLY for Toriyama and the movie. And guess what? Fox didn't use it!! Well they did, but only in stupid credits that song was fantastic for an action scene. What a joke!! If you want to see a good \"live action version\" of Dragon Ball, go with \"Forbidden Kingdom\" (Jackie Chan and Jet Li). Not really based on Dragon ball but on Monkey King (DB too so they have some similarity) This movie just doesn't worth it. Except three hot chicks and a fantastic (altough terribly misused)song by Ayu, there is nothing I can save nor recommend about this movie. Are you a DB fan? You can avoid this. I give it two stars instead of 1 because granted, its still way better than the one china did in 1991. But don't get fooled: both movies suck anyways."

Bulma didn't carry any gun (If I not mistaken). Well to be honest, I just may advised for those who still have respect Dragonball, I recommended you not to watch this movie as you will get angry after watching this movies. Sorry for all the cast, but I only be able to give 1/10. However for those of didn't like Dragonball, you might find this movie is interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you think that i am gonna start ranting about how god awful this movie is and why you should not watch it in a theatre then you are wrong because that comes after i tell you why that it sucks so much.\n\nThis movie is based on the adventures of Son Goku in the world of DragonBall. Toriyama Sama created this epic. he said that this was a manga (Graphic Novel or comic book) that he had been waiting to write for some time. He had already enjoyed success with the popular series Doctor Slump and Aralie Chan. It took 3000 plates(boxes in pages) and 6 years to complete. the series had 148 fights and more than 1 hundred characters.\n\nDragonBall was loyal to the fans, in its Anime Master Toriyama himself drew the characters. Even in the Video games the talented Toriyama Sama himself designed the 3D characters which stand true to the source.\n\nDragonBall has set a standard of quality that its fans have come to expect from it and when DragonBall Evolution was announced most had a mixed reaction as the previous 2 adaptations had not been very good perhaps due to the budget. FOX put a lot of money into this project that could put Dragonball on the big screen for the world to see but which it did the only problem is that apart from the name Dragonball and its characters at FOX's disposal there is no resemblance to the original series.\n\nI had a bad feeling in my gut 9 months ago when we found out that Toriyama Sama has been left out of the project for some \"plot changes\" that was when things started getting ugly and as we found out more about it and now its finally here. Despite of amazing DragonBall concept of Toriyama we get a washed up clich\u00e9 based typical American teen highschool crap that has been done like a million times and done better. This movie does not satisfy the DragonBall fans or typical movie fans because all FOX wanted was to cash up on the sifi superhero thing that is popular these days. To them DragonBall and all other such manga are just labels that attract an audience they feed off the financial value of it and then just move on. DragonBall has a strong fanbase consisting of people from all ages and parts of the world. FOX has let us all down by giving us this mockery of a classic, alas they could have earned millions if they had done it right but they still can if it is remade with improvements such as a BETTER DIRECTOR and Triyama back on the team so that FOX can really make money off of it which is fine if would just stop this trilogy from happening to us.\n\nI score it 1 out of 10"

Bad acting by almost all actors , very poor visual effects , i've seen movies in the 80's have better visual effects . Bad directing , bad screenplay , bad story , they've tampered the story so bad that i was so devastated after watching the film , had sleepless nights for days . Watch the movie and u'll see what i mean ! This is what happens when you take a film without seeing one ***king episode , rather the director has developed the movie after reading a summary!\n\nThe movie was so bad that u'd cry even in the scenes that the director meant to be funny and vice versa! My advice is that don't watch this film , do something more worthwhile like cursing the director!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dragonball: Evolution. The movie made by Fox as a live action adaptation of the popular anime series Dragonball.\n\nNow, I knew what I was getting into when I stepped into the theater earlier today, but that didn't stop me from being enraged at the blasphemy that unfolded in front of me. I know this review will be a little biased, as I am a Dragonball fan, but let me start off by saying that this movie is TERRIBLE. Fox really screwed up on this one. It doesn't even seem like they tried at all. Now, lets review the movie piece by piece.\n\nPlot: Fox had an entire wealth of story an characters and everything to go off of t o make this movie. What did they do? They tried to make their own story. they failed. Horribly. Let's address the length. 1 hour and 10 minutes roughly. Movies now adays are usually an hour and a half to 2 hours long, but AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. That's not near long enough to get any of the story to Dragonball out.\n\nThe movie went way too fast. There was virtually no time for character development. Scenes moved way too fast, the story went too fast, and overall the movie was too fast (which could be a good or a bad thing).\n\nThe story itself. It just doesn't seem like Dragonball. the plot just seemed like generic action movie. You could've replaced all the characters and it would've made just as much sense. There were so many flaws and inconsistencies with the actual Dragonball story (way too many to write about right now). Any Dragonball fan will just be asking Why? the entire time. Also, Goku going to high school. WTF?! Let's just move on\n\nCharacters: Let me just get this off my chest, JUSTIN CHATWIN IS NOT GOKU, AND HE NEVER WILL BE. Now, Goku's character, if you've never seen the series, is basically happy, dumb, and doesn't know the ways of the world. In the movie, however, he is typical anxiety, smart-ass teenager. The character is nothing like Goku in any way shape or form, physically, or in behavior.\n\nNext character: Bulma. Again physically looks nothing like Bluma. They put one streak of blue in her hair I guess to make people tell that she's Bulma. Since when can we not give characters colored hair? Seriously, what the hell? She seems like much more of a bitch than she does in the series. Not much character development there.\n\nMaster Roshi: Master Roshi is supposed to be a perverted old man who teaches Goku the Kamehameha. He teaches Goku the Kamehameha, but he is in no way the Master Roshi I knew.\n\nChi Chi: Goku's love interest. Since when is Chi Chi the popular chick? Other than that she just seems like a generic love interest.\n\nYamcha: First of all, he's blond. WTF? Second of all, they actually got this character pretty good, voice and all. It just doesn't match the look of the character. Also, WHERE'S THE WOLF FANG FIST?!\n\nKing Piccolo: All I can say is, Space Voldemort.\n\nMai: Just a random villain character because I guess they couldn't pick out any of the other various villains of Dragonball.\n\nOverall, the characters just have no uniqueness to them, none of that special Dragonball flavor that they're supposed to have. None of the characters seem like themselves, with the exception of Yamcha, and there's virtually no character development.\n\nSpecial effects: The special effects are very low grade in this film. The ki blasts look okay. The Kamehameha does not look like a Kamehameha. Piccolo looks like Voldemort. Shenlong looks like a generic dragon, and doesn't speak. Oozaru looked horrible (too small, and Goku didn't have a tail in which to transform).\n\nI'm sure I left out a lot, but I just don't feel like typing about this anymore. If you're a Dragonball, fan do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Watch it online if you just HAVE to see it. This movie is NOT Dragonball, only in names (which they surprisingly got right). Overall, terrible movie, and will never see it again. Also, they are actually making a SEQUEL!! WHY?!?!?! No......just no. Fox, you've already ruined it. Stop beating the already dead, burned, chopped up, and run over, horse.\""

Remember that DB comic was aimed at children and not to teenagers, like Dragon Ball Z was, and you will not take it as seriously and there fore enjoy it more.\n\nThis movie captures well, the feel and vibe of the DB world. The character are translated well from comic to film and were true to their comic book counterparts. The scenery was very well observed and yet made to look like they could exist. The direction took a lot from the comics and cartoons which greatly added to the experience.\n\nSure they made mistakes but over all I thought it was OK. lots of nods to the comic that were left unspoken to those who know their stuff. Over all I think it was a very good effort, remembering the budget, and I hope they make another one which builds one what the film makers have achieved. making it darker and more DBZ perhaps to appease the fan boys.\n\nI've read some strange things that people have written on this film such as issues of race or that it didn't follow the comic story lines accurately enough. I don't think audience the film makers are aiming for will care on such issues and therefore neither should you (the audience). Again put the film into context; and remember it is after all just a light-hearted film."

But during the end I saw some comments and they made me to write this. When I first heard about the movie, I decided not to watch it because I thought DB is way beyond any live-action adaptation (all the fans know why). When I saw the trailer I was however surprised by the movie makers' creativity when I saw a Master Roshi with silky hair fit for any convincing shampoo ad. I knew instantly that the movie team is gonna surpass 'Citizen Kane', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc. easily. I knew that the movie would be too intellectual and too realistic for a stupid idiotic DB fan fool like me. Some coveted jury members of Academy Awards even said that they wanted a realistic movie so that they could relate themselves with Goku (just like Batman i guess). I am a hardcore DB fan and I too, like any other DB fan, would like to meet these 'beings' from Planet Vegeta (although I like DB but I am sane enough to accept the fact that Goku is an alien unlike the ones who want to relate themselves with Goku). Apart from these, 'Citizen Kane', hah, way too inferior than this masterpiece of this century. Right now I am waiting for at least 10 sequels so that I can send them to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. They can make millions of copies, give them different names and drop them from air in countries like US and UK. People would watch them without suspicion and would definitely kill each other or commit suicide after watching such noble creations for they would think how worms like them dared to adore modern day \"MONALISA\" called sequels of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION. Finally, terrorist organizations can enjoy a result far more devastating than 9/11."

I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about! What we need now, is a Reboot, like with the Hulk, with a different director, and better writers. I think the cast could have done a good job, it was just the story, script and directing(Not to mention special effects!)That really screwed the movie over. If you want to be original, learn from movies like transformers and especially Casino Royale. Casino Royale, because it is an original story that that is executed in a way that stays faithful to the novel, keeping the characters largely the same, and keeping the basic and important concepts of the novel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball: Evolution is like the toy that comes with the happy meal, and a pretty cheap one at that. It does what it needs to, but is far from what you could get for the little tyke at Toys R Us, and as long as it doesn't break down (which should be about a day or so) then it should be alright. The film is based on a long graphic novel series and a very long television show (not seen by me, though the parody \"Dragonball Z Abridged\" is one of the funnies things you may have not seen yet), and it can appeal to kids and um maybe young teens based on whether they've read the books or seen the show or not. If so, it will probably disappoint by not being totally faithful- not to mention half of the cast is white and not Asian (the villain Piccolo, if one can recognize him under lots of green make-up, is played by Buffy's James Marsters)- but if you haven't seen the show or books it will... probably disappoint as well.\n\nIt's clich\u00e9 in story and in action, it features those scenes we see in these movies and stories like when an old man or someone is about to die and the hero holds him in his arms and he declares something important before dying (or, of course, being noble enough to die with dignity). And of course the course of action as to who people are and what they'll do, like Roshi as the eccentric tutor to the young Luke Skywalker-type Goku (Chow Yun Fat and Justin Chatwin), and what the big final battle will entail. Luckily there are a few minor surprises, or just crazy bits of business like what Piccolo can make Goku do in the transformation-sense. And there are some hot girls to have the young boys in the audience go \"ooh\" to be sure, including a girl formerly on the Real World, if that means anything much.\n\nBut yet, the movie isn't really hateable, despite what many would believe. It's not made with particular flair, but it doesn't disappoint the ways one might expect (currently another film with similar 'elements', such as mastering elements of water-fire-air-earth called The Last Airbender disappoints much more greatly on higher stakes). At worst its action is uninspired and some of the fights could use a little more 'humpf' to them - and there is a \"LOL\" moment to have when the two Asian girls are having a fight - and they look exactly the same! One perk I should mention is Chow Yun Fat, who knows better than anyone else in the film (perhaps since he's been in sillier works over the years) and knows how to chew scenery and have fun doing it. Any moment he's on screen the film comes alive in ways the other actors, at best delivering in competence, can't quite bring along."

Not once did I want to get up and leave.\n\nBad: The characters definitely feel a bit shallow (Picollo has like 5 minutes of screen time, total), the length of the movie is too short, the script needs a rewrite. Good: Actors did a pretty good job with what they were given.\n\nAlso: 25mintues seems to have been cut from the Asian version, that I believe will appear in the US release. I've got my fingers crossed that the added content helps the brutality of some of the comments.\n\nGo see the movie, keep your expectations as low as possible, and I think you will enjoy it.

        "review_detailed_main": "When you go to see this movie, don't expect much. Nobody else did. It was evident from the trailers that the special effects were lacking. What they don't show you is that, in places, the special effects are stellar... but those scenes just aren't important. Goku jumps into Piccolo and his jump looks like an 8 year old copy and pasting in Microsoft Paint. BUT, Piccolo drops an energy ball into the water and we bullet-time in on the water drops. The effect is visually interesting but not at all important to the story.\n\nThe problem with Dragonball is that it IS very hard to translate into live action. Nobody will ever be happy with how the characters look or the changes that had to be made to make the story go faster. That being said, a lot of things changed to make the movie faster. (I would have suggested either starting the movie with Grandpa Gohan dead or combining the characters of Roshi and Gohan. The second is a significant change but neither Roshi nor Gohan were important enough in this movie to warrant spending so much time with them.) Another thing evident from the trailer, Goku is older. Another thing, he has no tail. Minor changes considering nobody would want to watch a movie about a 12 year old.\n\nBulma, Chi-chi, Yamcha, and Roshi's introductions are all awkward. But, these were big characters who needed to be introduced fast. The gist of their characters is intact. Yamcha wants the balls to be rich. Chi-chi is secretly a fighter. Bulma now wants the balls to be famous (as opposed to the perfect boyfriend). Roshi is mildly perverted, toned down from the cartoon show, but, of all characters, Roshi keeps the most accurate representation of the anime to the movie. In particular, making Goku run behind the car, carrying an obscene amount of weight. Personally, I didn't want to watch 2 hours of Goku training with Roshi just to have to pay another 7$ to watch Goku and Piccolo fight next summer.\n\nThe dialog is awkward. Incredibly awkward. A few times, I actually felt uncomfortable listening to it. I asked \"did someone really just say that?\" and then I cringed more thinking \"did somebody really WRITE that?!\" Piccolo's origins are completely revamped, disappointingly. This is largely because the history of the Dragonballs was also revamped. I wondered why they didn't cut a few scenes (maybe with Chi-chi) to add in Kami and properly explain things. That way, when/if there is a sequel, Piccolo could be deployed a lot easier.\n\nThere was 1 change in particular that I thought was great. Instead of transforming in a full moon, Goku now transforms when he sees a complete solar eclipse. These are far more rare. Problem is, he doesn't have a tail and it still happens...\n\nIt was evident to me, throughout the movie, that this was a jumping point for another movie. I imagined them skipping clean over the rest of the Dragonball series in order to introduce Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta in the next movie. The basic points were established to get there. Goku crashed (on a meteor?) from a foreign planet with no knowledge of who he was. He's becoming stronger in Ki and has the Oozaru in him. Now that the main characters have been introduced (with a few glaring exceptions), the next movie could jump to adulthood with no consequence. We have no reason to watch more of Goku's childhood now. Especially since he's turning 18 at the movie's opening."

It's wrong from the very basic - the story - all out of line. Nothing alike to the anime. The only common is the names. that's it. Nothing more... or.. or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen. I have never heard of a Goku going to high school, asking for the way flirting girls, and as far as I know, master Roshi is not that young :)). How disappointed it was for me (I guess it was as well for DBZ fan) when I see how they made our hero up like that... the more powerful Goku look, the more this Goku disappointed us. They have such an awful crew. I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series. EVER! ... They don't know how our characters should look like, don't know how the charateristics of each characters. The Kung-fu is.... way off .... nothing even close to \"real\" Goku... Visual Effect is like a play with painting background...\n\nThis is .... :("

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dragonball\" in name only, \"Dragonball: Evolution\" feels less like the popular anime and manga series it was based on than a perfunctory \"Karate Kid\" knockoff that feels as lethargic as its local opening date (a Black Saturday). James Wong's (\"Final Destination\") corny, albeit polished, quest movie tailored for the male preteen crowd drops much of its source's mythology in favor of juvenile kitsch that zips through its plot with the full awareness of its target audience's short attention span.\n\nFor his 18th birthday Goku (Justin Chatwin) has been given by his grandfather and master Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) a dragonball, one of the seven orbs scattered all over the world that grants anyone who collects it all \"one perfect wish.\" It turns out that Piccolo (James Marsters), an erstwhile imprisoned alien, has mysteriously escaped and is also after the balls to seek revenge on the Earth, where he was banished from 2,000 years ago when he planned to destroy it along with Oozaru (Ian Whyte). It's up to Goku to keep Piccolo and his femme aide Mai (Eriko) from finding the rest of the dragonballs and destroying the world (oooh!).\n\nThe involvement of Stephen Chow as a producer all but indicates a cartoonish movie and its awareness of its source's daffy quality at least rightly fits in with its cast members gameness to not take everything seriously - as typified by Chow Yun-Fat's embarrassing turn as Master Roshi, Grandpa Gohan's former teacher and now sensei to Goku. Yet \"Dragonball: Evolution\"'s greatest fault is perhaps its inability to gratify anyone, with fans of the series likely to cry foul with the liberal modifications done with the story and the characters; and everyone else realizing that it's an unexceptional fodder for a slow weekend."

What the hell is wrong with the director? Anyone can direct a movie and make it suck. He needs to be shot. I'm serious, guy took a good anime and make it hell. Even Power Rangers is better then this movie! Why not have the director of X-men or Spiderman make this movie? They really screwed it up badly on this one.

There was some \"corny\" humor, but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts. Great effects, of course. Bulma did a wonderful job as main character, although it seems odd that she becomes so comfortable with gokus presence in her life in such a short amount of time. There's a lot of parts that are totally unreal, but I guess if you're going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots, you can't expect too much reality. For those who tend to pick apart movies, there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later, but all in all, a must see in the movie theaters. Hopefult they'll be a sequel :)\n\nPS. \"did you do that?\"\n\n\"...Yeah I did\""

But this movie wasn't really trying to be exactly like the show. For one thing, in the show Goku never went to school. In the movie he goes to school and thats where he meets Chi-Chi. Thats way off but not that bad. The movie is about Goku who who is set out upon his grandpa dying request to find the great Master Roshi and find all 7 of the dragonballs (he already has one). Upon his journey, he meets Bulma, Master Roshi, and Yamcha. They need to find the dragonballs before Picolo does or else bad things happen.\n\nThe acting is kinda bad and very noticeable. The fight scenes aren't that great but its alright. The movie is entertaining and thats why its pretty good. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February.\n\nDragonball Evolution 6/10"

In the movie Goku is the skinny young man (we have already seen that the movie will be bad, because the choice of lead actor was desperate), which has two problems. The first is that it bullied at school, what else is in love with the girlfriend of a guy who mistreats him. The story we've all seen a hundred times. Further course of action can be assumed. It easily beat the bullies, becomes charmer, and gets the girl. Yet finds out that his grandfather killed Piccolo. Then he tries to destroy Piccolo and save the world. The film is full of clich\u00e9s, stupid dialogue and bad special effects. If something is supposed to be good in this film these are special effects. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball serial skip this movie, because it will not disappoint you. If you've never watched Dragon Ball skip as you will save 80 minutes. In any case, skip this movie."

Instead of trying to just put the show onto the big screen for fans and others to enjoy, they have warped it into something that doesn't even closely resemble Dragonball. For the many people out there who don't know what Dragonall is, I feel like this movie is just going to turn them against the franchise In just those few minutes of the preview, there are so many inaccuracies that I almost wanted to cry. Unfortunately, I probably will not go see this movie. Maybe in a few years, after this movie has tanked spectacularly, they will make another that people will actually want to see."

Honestly, if your going tot he movies, I'd say go see Fast and Furious. But then again, I guess its a matter of taste. The only thing I wish about this movie, is, it was the kind of bad that made it fun to watch, but sadly, the production tried to hard to make it a good movie with all the special effects and stuff they could afford. I think if your gonna cash in on Japanese pop-culture, leave it to the Japanese to do it. But then again, there are some anime/mangas that just cannot be live action. Anyone remember Fist of the North Star? Its a lose-lose situation for live action anime movies not made in japan. Don't believe me, check out Deathnote live action or prince of tennis and compare to the original source material, and then watch DBE and FotNS and compare. But to FotNS credit, it was true to the source, at least somewhat"

This movie is only fun for yourselves if you've been smoking some particularly strange and illegal substances.\n\nDear God, this movie stole from Star Wars, The Matrix and The Last Airbender! In short, DBE makes the Taiwanese version of \"Dragon Ball\" (1992) look like a Greek tragedy in comparison. Yet it still ignores the source material. The CGI is crap, the special effects looks taken out from the Power Rangers, the dialogue makes Batman and Robin look thoughtful, and the characters... Goku is about as emotionless as a bag of rocks, and Yamcha looks like \"a tiger with Down syndrome.\" This movie works as an insult directed towards Akira Toriyama and his fans...and directed by James Wong.\n\nFor this example, I will be using a well known story, \"The story of Jesus Christ\", but I will do to Jesus' story what the writers did to Dragon Ball:\n\nJesus Christ was born in California and went to Henry Austin High School. He used to get bullied growing up. His mom, Mary was a full time nurse who never had any time off. Jesus had some powers, but kept them hidden from everyone. One day Jesus went to a party. Everyone was complaining about there being no alcohol. Then Jesus used his power to turn every beverage in the fridge into beer. Then everyone thought he was super cool and got drunk. Suddenly Jesus was now the cool kid in school.\n\nYou get the idea. But this is how bad they butcher the DBZ story. Just, kill this movie please. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost.\n\nP.S.: For all the positive reviewers, ladies and gentlemen, Billy from SAW is waiting for you in the next door theater, and he is pleased to present a sissy and rather bad anime named \"Super Doll Licca-Chan\" (WARNING: This anime show *for little girls* will make a permanent brain damage). As you watch this anime, and in the locked theater, you will try to survive to find the key, while Billy will release poisonous gas and after will set ablaze the theater. So, live or die...make your choice."

However, I do care about whether a movie is good or not. It started out kind of OK with a fun training session between Goku and his grandfather (shades of Karate Kid) and not long after with a clever \"fight\" where Goku wasn't actually allowed to hit the bullies because of a promise. I had hope then it wouldn't be as horrible as the reviews and trailer made it sound. This hope didn't last long as things progressively got worse and more boring. That fight with the bullies was actually the best fight of the movie. The few others were badly shot (especially the lava scenes), unspectacular and short. The plot was a mess of clich\u00e9s riddled with unexplained happenings. I'm still not sure what the villain's motivation actually was.\n\nI didn't really care about the characters and the acting was nothing to write home about. I thought the guy playing Goku looked the part (even though he's not Asian) and did good until the last part where his acting was deficient. I thought the villain Piccolo looked cool (James Marsters always does a good intense villain) although unfortunately he doesn't do very much. The secondary characters were not particularly memorable, even Chow-Yun Fat hamming it up. With such an expensive movie (100 millions apparently), you would expect the special effects to be somewhat decent even though the rest might be lacking. Unfortunately,they were lacking in terms of quality, scope and awe factor. Too often, they felt low-budget or b-movie grade (witness a particular transformation near the end). If they had at least gotten the silly humor, the quirky characters or especially the fights right, it would have redeemed the movie somewhat, it would not have been such a loss. If you're a big Dragonball fan you are likely going to hate this \"evolution\", if you're not, you'll likely find it boring and senseless after the promising start. If your expectations are really low (and face it, they probably are), then you might find it somewhat entertaining. This is a poor attempt at bringing a potentially huge franchise to the big screen.\n\nRating: 3 out of 10"

Hollywood needs to stop screwing up stuff that is better as it is. Heck this movie should be banned worldwide. Just so everyone knows I love the Dragon Ball series minus this god awful movie. This movie is worse then a lot of remakes I have seen. To me and a lot of other anime fans who love DB/Z/GT this movie makes us want to die or puke it doesn't matter which. I really hate this movie. I would wither watch Barney the dinosaur over this movie. I hate this movie because they messed up Goku. Also because they messed up all the characters and the events."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everybody is so negative about this movie so of course I had to be stubborn and go see it for myself.\n\nI think everybody was (and is) expecting a 'Dragonball Z' movie instead of just Dragonball (without the Z that is). If you want to see a whole lot of rapid fire balls, instant transmissions, gallic guns, Neo vs Agent Smith kind of fighting and Super Sayins ...maybe DBE 2 and this movie is not (not yet I hope) what you're waiting for.\n\nThis movie is based on Dragonball. The early years. ...A whole other story line but it's still based on Dragonball. And it wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. (maybe because I had no expectations, but still.)\n\nIf this movie wasn't called Dragonball and had nothing to do with Dragonball, this same movie would have been rated 6 instead of 3. I'm sure of that.\n\nAnd of course some scene's seemed a bit rushed, and Piccolo's outfit looks like Batman vs The Matrix, and Brian Singer/Michael Bay would have directed the **** out of this movie. ...Ah well! Maybe DBE 2.\n\nSo if this movie was an attempt to be like Dragonball Z then yes it's rated 3. But assuming it's based on Dragonball, call me crazy I give it a 6 because I enjoyed it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having seen only a couple episodes of Dragonball cartoons, I was not going to expect much. But I was able to see how the characters in the movie and action connected to the cartoon. While it clearly was not a great movie, it was not bad. Moving sometimes too slowly, we get a chance to familiarize with the characters and adapt to the strange humor. The action was so similar to the cartoon, it became obvious the movie was intended to be like the cartoon. So because of that, the movie-making team accomplished its goal.\n\nYun-Fat Chow(Chow Yun-Fat to some) was by far the brightest star. He carried out the cartoonish characterizations of Roshi well enough, that he was so easy to love for his performance. Impish and strong, devilish and charming, I wanted to see more of him. Emmy Rossum was great to watch as Bulma. She truly brought Bulma out of the proverbial inkwell. She was the least cartoonish but I am sure it is because her character was the most respected by the other characters. Sure Roshi, Piccolo and Gohan were highly revered, but in a different way from Bulma. Just ask Roshi who he feared most besides Piccolo. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Bulma and Roshi for the comic sexual tension. Chatwin was good as Goku. I liked his sly, shy and quick sense of humor.\n\nThe story was not bad. But I think the movie could have been shot a little differently so that special effects in the darker moments would appear more realistic. But then that might have affected the continuity.\n\nIt appears a lot of the cartoon fans did not like the movie for one reason or another, but I say give it a chance. While the fans deserve to complain, they should also understand how hard it must be to bring cartoons to life. As far as I am concerned Bugs Bunny couldn't do it and Fred Flintstone couldn't do it. But Dragonball succeeded where others have failed.\n\nI hear there may be a sequel. If characters are not changed, I'll see it too. Dragonball drags a 6/10 from me."

Not only is it a disgrace to Akira Toriyama and his wonderful Dragonball universe, it's a really bad movie. Everything about it was off. It shouldn't even have been called Dragonball. These dragonballs sure do stink real bad, and collecting em all couldn't create a wish big or good enough to fix this.... Unless they remade this movie with A LOT MORE MONEY, at least 3-4 hours long, good director, better casting, rated-R or at least pg-13 rating, better fighting, better storyline, better dialog.... Effin' everything that would make a movie stand out, there's no way Hollywood should ever touch this or any other classic anime'.

        "review_title": "An Entertaining Abomination",
        "review_detailed_main": "The summary says it all, this film is an entertaining abomination. Let's start with the bad... Most of the acting is awful, the writing is even worse, and the story is the original story only it's been ripped to shreds, which makes it become incoherent, especially near the end. A lot of things just don't make sense and there is no explanation for them. And this here is the major fail point of the movie... there are NOT ENOUGH FIGHT SCENES. There are like 2 or 3 fight scenes in the entire movie, and the best one is the very first one, if you've seen any Dragonball series you know that the main focus is the fighting, so why make a movie that lacks the main element of the original series? Even so.. I found the movie to be entertaining. Though the lack of fight scenes is heavily disappointing, the writers/director did manage to capture a little bit of that anime-type comedy charm. At some points you feel like you're watching a badly made anime.. but in live action.. which is pretty much exactly what you're watching, and that's funny for some reason.\n\nThe special effects in this movie are actually fairly decent, though the ki blasts seem too.. \"gentle\".. almost like smoke, when in the anime and the games they are definite balls of energy, not just wisps. The kamehameha at the end IS kind of disappointing, but it could have been worse.\n\nMy advice to anyone that wants to see this movie... if you are a die hard Dragonball fan.. don't see it. Or if you do go to see it, don't go with the expectation of seeing your beloved Dragonball remade into an action packed live action film of awesome or you WILL be disappointed and you'll probably want to burn the theater down. I watched this movie with extremely low expectations and I got some pleasant surprises here and there, but the movie was still bad. Even so, I'd watch it again.. even if only to make fun of it with friends. It really could have been worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "(An Important Note: I am not a hardcore \"Dragonball\" or \"DBZ\" fan. I'm only vaguely familiar with the storyline of the franchise, and could probably count the number of episodes of the animes I've seen on my fingers. I am merely writing this review as an open critique of the film based on its own merits and qualities, without comparison to the anime, manga or other preceding content it was inspired by. A film, even an adaptation, should be able to be judged on its own right, without necessarily having to match or perfectly adapt it's source material. Hence the words \"adaptation\" and \"based on\" being used instead of \"directly translated from.\")\n\nSo... yeah. \"Dragonball: Evolution.\"\n\nThis film... happened. (I suppose that's the best word to describe it.)\n\nIt barely broke even with its box-office numbers. It was a critical disappointment. And it was absolutely and mercilessly crucified and torn apart by fans of the source material manga and anime. Almost a universally panned (and then subsequently ignored) film, with only the rare supporter.\n\nBut does it really deserve the near-universal hatred? It is really that objectively bad as a stand-alone film? Is it really only worth the current 2 out of 10 user-average here on IMDb?\n\nI don't think so. Oh, don't get me wrong. It's still a \"pretty bad\" movie. But I don't think I could objectively call it \"terrible\", \"awful\" or even \"patricularly bad.\" This is just a plain, basic, underwhelming film that, while having a few cute moments, was condemned more due to its highly-regarded source materials than due to its own flaws.\n\nThe film follows a teen-aged martial-artist named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who is sent on a quest to recover the \"Dragonballs\"- mystical spheres that can grant a \"perfect wish.\" He will need to collect these in order to stop the dark plans of the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters). Along the way, Goku also meets new allies who help him on his quest, including Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Chi-Chi (Jamie Chung) and Yamcha. (Joon Park)\n\nAnd I will give credit where it is due. I think all of the actors tried their hardest, and some were actually quite good. Yun-Fat and Marsters coming off as the best, of course, and both quite excellent in their roles. But I also found Rossum and Park very good in their roles, and they actually were my favorite actors in terms of casting. Both had a charm, and were clearly having some fun with the material. (Particularly Park, who seemed to really embrace the fact he was playing an anime-inspired character.)\n\nAnd there were a few sequences in the film that were genuinely fun, and had some honest thrills and laughs. They may not have been as numerous as I would have liked, but the film definitely had its moments where it gelled together quite well.\n\nThat being said, this is still a flawed, messy movie. Ben Ramsey's script is very basic and clich\u00e9, and has its share of bland characterizations and plotting, which felt unnatural at times.\n\nAnd direction courtesy of James Wong (who has had some strong success with work on \"The X-Files\", \"American Horror Story\" and the underrated \"Willard\" remake) is a mixed-bag. While some sequences are fun and fast, others feel patchy and under-developed. And oh boy do I have to question his strange mis-uses of slow-motion photography.\n\nStill, I don't think these shortcomings really warrant the absoluteness of the hate this movie receives on a regular basis. Yes, it may not be good... and it's definitely bad at times... but not to the extent of the atrocious ratings it's damned with by many people here. And while I can understand fans of the source material having a degree of anger or loathing due to this evidently not being a good adaptation... I think it should be judged more as a stand-alone work. And as a stand- alone film... it's definitely a bit better than it is made out to be.\n\nI will give \"Dragonball: Evolution\" an under-average (but not terrible) 4 out of 10. People who are open-minded enough not to judge it based on its source material might wanna give it a shot. And people unfamiliar with the source material are very likely to be a bit more welcoming to its faults, whether or not they particularly enjoy it. (Simply because they won't have the \"disappointment\" factor that many fans did have.)"

I expected the Dragon Ball aspects to be changed to the director's whims (which they were from story elements, to character uniforms), however they went one step beyond. This movie was completely converted into something far worse than even the worst 80's low budget kung fu flick.\n\nWhen you remove all the Dragon Ball fan service as WELL as any shred of a credible story, the question posed to the studio is: Who do you think is going to enjoy this?"

        "review_title": "What Were They Trying To Do?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood isn't exactly the greatest at adapting pre-existing material to the big screen. It seems that almost every time they adapt a franchise, it goes something like this: \"Hey there--you know (insert franchise's name here)? You know the fantastic worlds you found there? The riveting plot? The adrenaline-pumping action? The characters that you loved? And the themes that resonated so clearly with so many people? Well we're gonna do something totally different and call it the same thing!\" ...If you take the approach I just described, Hollywood, how do you expect NOT to offend people? I personally don't understand what's so difficult about adapting a pre-existing franchise. I hope they learn their lesson some day, but they didn't learn it in time to save Dragon Ball from being smothered to within an inch of its life by way of the movie, \"Dragonbal: Evolution,\" which is probably one of the worst attempts at adapting a franchise I've ever seen...and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\n\nI won't describe the plot because there are plenty of other places you can read about that if you want to, so I'd rather get straight to the essence of my review--the movie is marred by a script that was written without an ounce of regard to the themes of the original series...and this lack of respect trickles down into the production values, the special effects, the casting, the acting, and the directing. Dragon Ball is a story about a naive and borderline-stupid young boy named Goku who, in his naivet\u00e9, sees the world differently than most humans (in both a comical and endearing fashion). Despite his evident lack of intelligence, his pure heart gives him a clearer view on what it really means to be a friend, to be a father, to be a husband, to be a martial artist, and to be someone who will always fight for these values without regret. This confident, selfless, compassionate, and somewhat stupid boy's attitude changes the lives of the many people that he meets as a kid and as an adult in a story that is both moving and hilarious.\n\nSo of course, what's the first thing \"Dragonball: Evolution\" has to do? Make him a socially awkward high school student who \"wants to get the girl.\" They wanted to make Goku relatable, and that's the most critical flaw of the movie. Goku's not someone that people can relate to, he's someone who's supposed to be emulated. The theme that the writers wanted to tout was that this movie is a movie about \"having faith in who you are,\" which is the central struggle of the Goku in this movie. The Goku of the original series is someone with complete conviction in who he is, and it is this conviction that serves as the thematic device through which the story progresses. Had the movie kept this intact, I would not have minded some costume changes and crappy CGI, as long as they kept the essence intact. But, as I said earlier, Hollywood seems to have a phobia with being loyal to pre-existing franchises.\n\nAs I said earlier, this lack of respect to the original message trickles down. The once-fearsome Lord Piccolo is reduced in this movie to a character with about four lines and no back-story. Muten Roshi is reduced to an over-acting \"you must learn, grasshopper\" martial arts master stereotype. The spectacular fight choreography of the original series is reduced to awkwardly-angled and hackneyed choreography where often you can't even tell what's going on. The fantastical world of the original series is reduced to a modern-day world completely devoid of t he imagination of the original. The series itself is reduced to a complete mockery of what it once stood for.\n\nOkay, let me back up a bit...I'm clearly a fan of the original series. Does this movie work for people who haven't seen the original series? Nope, unfortunately, it does not. Sure, the characters aren't loyal to the source material, but even newbies will recognize that the people they're watching in this movie are reduced to stock-type \"caricatures\" of other characters who have been done to death. The CGI and special effects leave much to be desired, there are plot holes everywhere, no back-stories are given to the characters...it's an unwatchable mess to newcomers and veterans alike.\n\nHollywood...why? You had such a great opportunity in front of you. And you screwed this one up just like countless others. Just be loyal to what's already been done--it's not that hard."

I looked on some sites and it seems that some people were saying that either Sean Faris or tom welling should play Goku. Sean Faris? Really? I don't think so. Now Tom Welling could very well do it however I think the hair would look out of place a bit and looking at him, he seem limber enough to do all the things that Goku is supposed to be able to do and yet he does have a strong-looking physique. Welling, doesn't seem to limber. Those are the 2 that I have found to actually look like Goku also.\n\nSome people are really mad at the fact that only a couple members of the cast are Asian. Well, as far as Goku, read the above paragraph. I haven't found anyone who is Asian that seemed to look like him. Send me a message of someone if you do. I think that it was more important to have the main character look the main character then trying to find someone who is Asian who doesn't. Chi-chi is think is perfect. Bulma, not so much. I think they could have found someone better for her. They could have gotten someone who would die their hair.\n\nOkay it's getting long now, Overall, I like this movie. There are some points where it get's pretty corny but what remake of a cartoon isn't at least a smidge corny. I think that if you never watched an episode of the show, you would enjoy it. I have seen about 2 episodes. That may be the reason why I like it. IF you watched it everyday as a kid, then you probably have something to say that you hate about it."

But because of all the hype the show gets Hollywood decided that its now time for a live-action DragonBall movie called DragonBall Evolution, which in all honesty is the most unoriginal title I have ever seen.\n\nLet me start of right away that even I, someone who is not a fan of the series can see that this movie has very little to do with the show or comics. Transforming bikes? Come on, is that really necessary? Also, for a movie about a show that is known for its large cast of warriors the cast in this movie is surprisingly small. The characters are paper-thin and the actors seem uninspired. Would it kill them to put some more emotion into their roles?\n\nOne thing that I expected to be at least descent were the special effects, but no, they also suck. The famous 'kamehameha'-attack looks nothing like the one from the show, and the fight-scenes overall look dull. Its sometimes like watching Power Rangers but made by someone who just finished his study of Adobe After Effects. This is like a bad fan-fiction movie that you stumble upon on YouTube.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie that is true to the source-material its based on, then avoid this movie because apart from a few character-names and a few trivial things it has nothing to do with the show or comics. Just pretend this doesn't exist. This together with Transformers 2 are easily the perfect candidates for worst movies of 2009.\n\nNow lets hope they won't make a live-action Naruto-movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just to clarify: I've NEVER slept on a movie. Not even through some really bad drivel. Not even the unmistakeably awful. Not even through Titanic.\n\nBut yes, the first time I saw this movie I fell asleep 20 minutes in and lost the whole showing. I figured it was because I was tired and had just spent a few too many hours awake, so I tried it again even though the little I could remember of watching in the multiplex seemed more like part of my nightmares.\n\nThe second time I went to the cinema again (good lord I can't believed I paid this much to the people involved) and made sure to be wholly awaken to see the movie all the way through. 20 minutes in I realized (to my horror) that no, it wasn't a nightmare. What little I remembered of the movie really was what the filmmakers decided to commit to screen. Half hour in I was so bored I fell asleep again.\n\nThen now I have the DVD rental (it came free with other purchases, I still feel ripped-off) and promised myself I'd watch all the way through, so I drank nearly half liter of coffee and went on with it. By the time Goku fights Piccolo for the first time I realized no promise was worth it and just popped the damn thing out to watch something else.\n\nI'm not a fan of the Anime or Manga, so I don't feel exactly betrayed (ripped-off, conned and used, yes, but not betrayed), especially because I've always thought the story itself would never translate well at any degree into the big screen. But the Anime itself (at least the first series) had interesting fights and ideas. The fights in this one are easily the worst thing in the entire movie.\n\nThe world feels like it is populated solely by the protagonists, and all interactions between characters don't only feel forced and contrived, but extremely unnatural to a point that not even blatantly reading the script and actively trying to act badly would accomplish. They must've made many, many shots in order to get a take horrid enough to put in the movie, because scenes that bad can't possibly be the product of a first try. The scene where Chichi discovers that Goku can manipulate Ki is unbelievably bad, but not in a funny way. It's not \"so bad it is good\", it goes beyond \"so bad it is horrible\". The story is poorly executed, the main protagonist is an unlikable blank sheet of a teen and by halfway through I wished so much that Piccolo was successful in his plan and blew up that stupid world that I just couldn't bear to know the movie would have a happy ending, and as such I didn't want to expose myself to it.\n\nHollywood, you may have raised the bar showing that it can be done with Speed Racer, but Dragon Ball have completely stripped any doubts that Speed Racer was just a gigantic fluke way beyond your capabilities.\n\n(Gods, I still can't believe I've slept through a movie, or that what I saw in the screen wasn't a nightmare)"

But it walks that fine line of, like, the 1993 Super Mario Bros. Movie, where I was constantly enchanted by what pieces of the source material it chooses to be faithful towards and how it twists itself into something that resembles the shape of Dragonball while also absolutely, unequivocally NOT BEING DRAGONBALL.\n\nTo put it another way, it's a very dumb, over the top movie that sometimes feels cut from a similar cloth as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but minus all of the sleazy \"hot babe alert\" tone or obsession with cinematic hyperrealism. It's trying very hard to stay true to Dragonball while also making sure stay within the confines of mainstream Hollywood expectations, with the latter winning out in most scenarios. Its heart is trying to be in the right place, even if it's being pulled in opposing directions.\n\nBut like with the 1993 Mario movie, once I let go of my \"this isn't Dragonball!\" complaints, I started having a lot more fun meeting the movie on its own weird terms, where Goku is supposed to be a normal high school teenager that gets swept up in an adventure to prevent the apocalypse.\n\nAgain, just to reiterate: it's not a good movie. But I ended up having way more fun than I expected. Bare minimum, it's a strange curiosity and sometimes that's all the entertainment you need."

Venturing into the theater, laughter was expected but instead, I was greeted by a parody of Dragon Ball so audaciously flawed it borders on comic genius. This film attempts to ground the beloved saga in reality but strays so far from its inspiration it seems the creators set out to disappoint.\n\nEfforts to mirror Dragon Ball's essence end up resembling reflections in a carnival's distorted mirror: warped, bizarre, and unintentionally hilarious. This cinematic endeavor serves as a masterclass in how not to execute a parody, blending misplaced sarcasm, misguided satire, and a remarkable inability to hit any target. Those seeking laughter will find it, not in the script, but in marveling at how spectacularly this film fails to capture what made the original so great.\n\nIn a twistedly ironic way, it becomes the perfect comedy: its misalignment so egregious, laughter is the only response to its boldness. With over 600 characters of critique, this review highlights the film's journey from potential to comedic folly, marking \"Dragon Ball Evolution\" as an unintentionally humorous chapter in the Saiyan saga."

Whatever, this could be minor problems if everything else was OK, but is not the case. Boring direction, cinematography and art direction... They just wanted some money and they made the movie without watching or reading anything of dragon ball.

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball Evolution ISN'T Dragon Ball at all; it's a cheap imitation of a MUCH stronger media franchise and fails to capture a fraction of its charm during its torturous 1-hour-30-minute~ runtime. I'm fairly certain the screenwriter never read the comic/manga at all and just read up on the Wikipedia entries on Dragon Ball without thoroughly studying what made the story so beloved and timeless. The same goes for the director too; the lack of care in this film is incomparable to anything else Hollywood's done with comic book movies, and for that alone I commend them for making such an embarrassing movie.\n\nThis movie is a cliche-ridden headache that has quite easily become my least favourite movie of all time. It's THAT bad! The characters are total disservices to their original counterparts, the fun and pure imagination of the manga is non-existent here, the Westernisation of the settings and aesthetics makes Dragonball Evolution a truly nauseating experience. Also, the fighting wasn't NEARLY as good as it was in the source material; that and everything else.\n\nDragonball Evolution doesn't work as a self-contained story, it outright fails as a Dragon Ball adaptation, and above all else it's not remotely escapist material at all; it's diverging from the source material and nauseating high school romance subplot makes for one helluva bad movie. Thank Christ it flopped at the box office.\n\n0/5 stars; I know, I can only vote as low as 1 star but by god this film deserves a specially designated 'zero stars' rating. I rarely think ANY film deserves to be discarded as such, but there you go. Dragonball Evolution is quite easily a contender for the worst movie EVER made."

It's quality wasn't exactly stellar either, though.\n\nI'm an artist, and a fan of the Dragonball universe. I wouldn't want to make a movie that was a mirror of what has already been made. That'd be like me trying to recreate the Dragonball comics. In terms of making a movie based on something as extensive as Dragonball, there are sacrifices that need to be made. There are over 100 eps of the original DB universe, and that needed to be shaved into a single movie.\n\nAll the base elements are there. Roshi is a perv, Goku loves his food and rigorous training at the hands of Roshi, Bulma has capsules (which was her big thing in the original series), there ARE capsules, Yamcha is a desert bandit, Grampa Gohan raises Goku, etc etc. The base elements are all there, and the director deserves some credit for even making that effort. Not every director tries that hard.\n\nNow, do I agree with all the liberties with the characters made? Not at all. Roshi was a hoot, but wasn't a bent over OLD man. Chow Yun Fat did a brilliant job with one of the series' most memorable characters, but there were some aesthetic changes that didn't sit right with me. Also, no Krillin. Yamcha, but no Krillin? Dang.\n\nIronicly enough, Dragonball Evo maintains the history of pacing issues renounced throughout the Dragonball universe. Except for episodes full of staring and gruntings, it was lightning fast the whole way through. It even felt rushed by the end.\n\nRiddled with flaws, and by no means the perfect take on the Dragonball universe, it was still kind of entertaining. :) It has all of the base elements necessary to make a Dragonball movie, and it's own unique twist of the story. They did alright, I think. :) Now they need to train their movie making skills to make a better movie. :) Train at 100 times gravity!"

They had the rights, it was about to expire so they slid this absolute deuce out onto the silver screen. The majority of the budget was spent on marketing just so they would at least break even.

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay to start this off lets all give them at least a little credit here because lets think about it. Had they made the characters and the world look exactly like it does in the show it would be pretty ridiculous. With Goku's big hair how it is, Bulma having blue hair, and dinosaurs in the world, imagine how that would look as a live action movie. Or if they had given Goku his tail and made oozaru like in the show? The show was a cartoon/anime creating a live action version of the show is not the same as when they made movies of cartoons such as the Flintstones for instance. The movie is called dragon ball EVOLUTION. it's not going to be exactly like the show and there will probably never be a movie like the show so be happy with what we get.\n\nNow as far as the movie goes most people are judging it by comparing it to the show but lets throw that aside. We have chow yun fat, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung (who in my opinion is one of the most beautiful girls out there) amongst other great actors. If you've seen some of their other movies their pretty good at what they do. So it's really a pretty good cast and the chemistry wasn't lacking in my opinion.\n\nAs for the movie I'm not going to tell you the story line or anything. But the movie was OK, its not the kind of movie to be nominated for an award but if you look at it as its own kind of movie and not a live action of dragon ball then you can really watch the movie and it really is an entertaining movie. it's not the kind of movie that you will watch over and over again but its not a waste of time either. the script is pretty mediocre but the fighting is pretty good.\n\nso overall i rate this a 5/10. I'm usually can be a pretty harsh critic but i try to put myself in someone else s shoes. Too many people don't understand what it takes to make something like this and are selfish. but get over it people and give them some credit.\n\n***If in any way i have offended anyone with this review i apologize. Nothing i said was meant to be offensive in anyway. Just my opinion and review of the movie.***"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is based on Dragon Ball, a manga by Akira Toriyama. What they makers of the movie basically did was create a totally new story using the same characters of Dragon Ball ruining all the greatness of what Dragon Ball really was. They even modified the original characters changing their appearance, their background, and the way they originally behaved. Example: The original Goku is Cheerful, courageous, adventurous, wild, naive, loving, caring, strong. His grandpa raised him when he was a baby but died before Goku was't even a teenager, so Goku had to raise himself pretty much, in the middle of the jungle where he lived, very far from civilization. In the movie however, Goku, is not cheerful, lives in civilization, goes to school, and gets bullied by kids. This is only one of the many examples of derangement from the original story. Here are more Examples. Original: Goku throws energy blasts. Movie: Goku uses air bending techniques. Original: Master Roshi is old and bald, powerful, perverted, lives in a house in the middle of an island with his companion turtle. Movie: Master Roshi is young, not perverted, lives in the middle of New York, the turtle doesn't exist. Original: Goku travels through the air with the \"Flying Nimbus\", a yellow cloud he sits on and flies with. Movie: The \"Flying Nimbus\" doesn't exist. Original: There are Wild Dinosaurs. Movie: Dynos are extinct.\n\nThe point is, watch the original if you haven't, because it's awesome and totally different. And then judge for yourself."

The story wasn't really entertaining at all, the acting made me cringe, the characters were uninteresting and boring and the action sequences were dull. Yeah there were one or two action scenes that kept your attention a little bit but everything about this movie just makes you want to try every method possible in trying to erase it from your memory. The writing is beyond terrible and the direction was just poor. If you have trouble sleeping, turn this on and you'll fall asleep within the first five minutes of the movie.\n\nAs a movie reviewer, I have to be honest with you and with myself. I'm a fan of the television series and I liked watching the shows and when I heard that this was going to be released, I had mixed views. As much as I really wanted to like this movie, I knew that it wouldn't really be very good. I thought that it would be average or below average but I cleared my mind of those doubts before watching this movie and after watching the movie, I realised I was right. Dragonball Evolution fails on almost everything on so many levels and is truly a disappointment. The characters were just awful and the one thing that bugged me the most about this movie was Picollo because his make-up was awful, he looked really out of place in the movie. I'm actually quite surprised that Stephen Chow has made some great movies such as the unforgettable and funny Kung Fu Hustle and then takes part with this tripe. From cheesy dialogue and dire acting to bad special effects and dull action sequences, Dragonball Evolution may entertain the children and young teenagers and possibly fans of the show but if you're looking for a great action movie, give this a miss.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

That was sent to earth to destroy it, then came a old man name Gohan that found the child and the rest is history. Whats next Dragon ball z the return of piccolo, come on man you basically destroyed the dragon ball world with that movie.

And call this movie DRAGON BALL \"THE Beginning\" start the movie off with Frieza destroying planet veg eta. Do it the right way and the 90 million fans will love you for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, yes I know. Glutton for punishment and all that. But hey, how can I resist a movie that has freaking Spike in it! I was actually mucho surprised at first. This movie is pretty good in the beginning. The actors are practically all unknown, but the music, cinematography and even directing (mostly) are a lot better than one would expect in such a film. The best part is the charming hokeyness that permeates everything, which can't be accidental. Total tongue-in-cheek stuff. I actually laughed a couple of times. I attribute much of this to Stephen Chow, who is one of the producers. I always seem to like what he brings to the table.\n\nTo my additional surprise, I liked Justin Chatwin quite a lot. He seems to have a sort of LaBeuf-esquire likability. Goofy bugger, but you can't hate him. Two of the supporting actors were simply horrible, though, Chow Yun-Fat among them. Chewed scenery like it was going out of style. The other one everyone guesses when they see him. Jar Jar almost has a competitor now.\n\nIt always comes down to CGI with these not-made-with-a-huge-budget comic/graphic novel movies. They simply don't have the funds to make it look good. And yet they always cram as much special effects shots in there as they can. Stupid-asses. Although, I have a suspicion that some of the crappy-lookingness was intentional, for comedic effect.\n\nWhere the film really starts to suck mammoth balls is the last thirty minutes. Oh, boy what a crock of diarrhea. Throwing energy balls and flying is all good and fun for a while (only, not really), but I like my characters to settle their differences via the good ol' mano a mano fisticuffs. Cut the wires and get real fighters for the roles! But with some acting talent at least, mm-kay? So, this rating is basically awarded for the first half of the film, where everything is simpler and more fun. James Marsters is also criminally underused. He is Spike for cryin' out loud!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hey, I have an Idea, lets take one of the most popular animes of all time, and change the storyline entirely, because even though that plot line brought millions of fans from Japan and America together in loving one character Goku together. Hey even better, lets cast Goku, as this Skinny white dude that looks like a total douche the whole movie, in fact, lets change ENTIRE PLOT SEQUENCES and things from the original movie, cause who wants to watch a a small 8 year old kid beat the living hell out of aliens from another planet.... I was so disappointed in this movie I cannot even begin to describe it entirely. First off, Piccolo looks terrible, Goku is a complete disaster from the original intent of the character ( a warm adventure loving innocent child who gets into adventures and discovers the inner power within him to defeat evil) somehow gets turned into a 17 year old kid who gets picked on in school and has to \"play it down\" and let the bigger kids whomp on him to be normal, but yet still has no problem showing off even while having almost no real saiyan power.... The sequencing of events was just terrible, and a joke. I think the thing I have to say out of all of this the most is that I was so sad about this movie, I literally burned my copy and told all my friends to never watch it as it was a travesty of the original story.\n\nThey should have stuck a little closer to the original story, and had some awesome cgi effects (which there were VERY little of) and kept Goku as a child to have that awesomeness factor of watching a kid beat the crap out of adults.\n\nIn the end, I wouldn't recommend my worse enemy to watch this movie if they were in any way shape or form a fan of the original dragon ball series."

Oh yeah did I mention the fight scenes were terrible. Fights were too short and I wanted them to more epic.

It's a silly fun kid's movie, however bad some people may say the movie is most will agree the CGI in a lot of the movie is pretty good and shows promise. Sometimes the Acting was silly I did not like it when Goku started talking slow at a few points in the movie it made him sound stupid. Before you go to this movie please remember a few things. 1. Its PG not M or R so there is not a lot of strong violence in it. 2. it's taken from Dragon Ball not Dragon ball Z. Also to add it's not a copy of the comic it a different version with similar characters from the Cartoon. Like the first Xmen movie. I suggest you see the movie if only to bring up the figures so we can get a second movie and get to the good part of Dragon ball Vegeta.\n\nREMEMBER!! This movie is a \"silly fun kid's movie\" not a copy of the comic, books and some TV shows are always better than movies as movies are restricted on time and you can't not develop the story as much. Go to the movie and have fun, don't worry about how good or bad you think the movie may be."

Now, hold that thought, because it is the only Dragon Ball-related thing in this entire excuse for a movie.\n\nBefore this movie even aired, the Internet Movie Database was already full of negative reviews, so I didn't expect much of it. But even then, I couldn't imagine how bad it would be.\n\nFirst, I have to say that I am definitely a fan of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It is absolutely a true masterpiece, and it made me love Japanese animations. You'd think that with such a popular show, Hollywood would try to make it even better by adding a 3D-effect to it in a live-action movie. But what they did was exactly the opposite: absolutely NO effort was put into this movie at all! The story and especially the characters are hopelessly westernized and some people might take this as a good thing, but it really does the story no good.\n\nThere are barely any similarities to the original series at all. Not even the name is correct. The original series' name was Dragon Ball, but here, they somehow decided to make one word for it. Further, the only things that relate the movie to the source material are the names of the characters and the concept of the Dragon Balls. That's right, only the names are the same, because the personalities are completely different. Bulma is just a trigger-happy rip-off of Lara Croft who falls in love with some hobo (Yamcha), Master Roshi isn't old at all and he lives in some apartment in the middle of a city, Mai is suddenly a henchman of Piccolo instead of Pilaf, and Piccolo is a lame enemy you'd expect in a Cartoon Network TV-series like Ben 10. But absolutely the worst example is Goku himself, the protagonist. At first, I didn't even know it was him! Where they high when they chose Justin Chatwin to be him (no offense, he was fine in War of the Worlds)?\n\nOh, and Krillin? He didn't even appear.\n\nThe most important thing this movie lacks is RESPECT. This movie is really disrespectful. Seriously, I couldn't imagine what they were thinking when they made this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if James Wong made this movie just to make the entire series look stupid. It's like they put the original plot in their mouth, chewed it for a minute, swallowed and then threw it up. The result: I wouldn't even call it a Dragon Ball movie. It's rather a pathetic fusion of High School Musical and The Incredible Hulk. I can describe this movie in one simple word: DISGUSTING! This movie is just an insult to Akira Toriyama and DB and DBZ fans all around the globe. This movie didn't make me sad, it made me angry.\n\nI have started an IMDb account just to post this review. Hopefully, that says enough."

(then they release another half a year/year later) Then they can skip some story and start some action on the next movie. Make some more movies.Go back with a flashback story in each movie,making people understand more and more of the story until it can just go on with the fighting and fun.\n\nI wish they could withdraw this movie,apologize.And start over. Find a freak of nature that knows everything about Dragonball,mix it with some matrix effects,and top it with characters that resembles.\n\nBelieve \"Frodo\" in LOTR be black? or terminator without Arnold? I sure hell can not. They are based on the true story and the characters had to be them. Search china.Gotta be at least one out of billions and Remake this.\n\nIf they made this cause they wanted to make a better one right after,I will laugh of the joke and wait for it.\n\nWhen you have the script you don't change it, you read it!

I bought this from ASDA for \u00a33, and I think I might take it back and say it was faulty, see if I can't spend that money on something a bit better.\n\nIf you've no idea what Dragonball is (well, shame on you for one thing) or if you just wanna shove your kids in front of the TV or if you ever get given this DVD (in which case have nothing to do with the person who gave it you again), then I suppose it's one way to pass an hour and a bit. Another way would be to remove your teeth with a pair of pliers or maybe stick hot needles under your fingernails-both of which are less painful than watching this film.\n\nFirstly, it's awful. Characters, storyline, everything...just *shudders*...terrible is the only way to describe it. It's not like there's even a massive fight scene or anything, or that the movie goes anywhere-it just plods along at it's own pace and does it's own thing, and then ends. Goku is portrayed as your typical high-school loser who wants the girl etc (wrong) and then realises he's destined to save the world etc etc. Your basic crappy plot etc. Basically, don't watch this film. If you want to see it, e-mail me and I'll post mine to you for free, gladly, as it's a stain on my otherwise immaculate DVD collection.\n\nOn a final note, why the hell was Mai working with Piccolo? She's one of Pilaf's people for shittings sake. And she kicked ass-that's not the Mai from the manga/anime!! And how awful was the casting of Yamcha who suddenly has shortish blonde highlighted hair and a face that'd been hit by a shitty shovel?!\n\nAny way, there you have it. This film sucks ass majorly. Don't buy it, don't even waste time downloading it. In fact, for a film like this, I'm all for piracy, maybe then they'll finally stop making crap."

Even the 'Super Mario Bros' movie was more endearing in its remarkable stupidity and laughably liberal use of characters. I don't even have fun mocking this film, that's how terrible it is. It's not worth examining to see where it failed, and it's not worth my typing this out. Manos: The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece in comparison. It makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock, Pierre Kirby like Shwarzenegger and Shwarzenegger like Humphrey Bogart.\n\nDon't watch it. Don't. Don't do it. It's the 'Jekyll and Hyde' game of the film industry."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Dragonball (the entire series, yes including GT) and I went to this movie not expecting to much due to the trailers and actors involved. I came out with tears in my eyes and it's not because the movie was emotional. I was crying because this was the worst possible destruction of a classic series. This abomination takes only names of the show and adds it's own story, which it wouldn't be so bad if the characters stayed the way they were in the show but the problem with it is that the story that is was replaced with is unholy.\n\nIn fact, let me type whats wrong with this uneven mess: ---Horrendous, god awful, wooden, terrible acting coming from everyone involved in the production (Especially coming from Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung) and the characters in the movie are so shallow and dumb and not in any way heroic.\n\n---A story so short, underdeveloped, inconsistent, filled with plot holes and not the least bit similar to Dragonball.\n\n---A frankly sad and ridiculous attempt at fighting is show in the film and all the fights lack emotion, last under 2 minutes and they're monstrously choreographed, fights in any other action film are way better.\n\n---Fake looking sets that have nothing in common on what is was based on and were to futuristic for my taste.\n\n---Cheap special effects that looked hideous.\n\n---An uninspired soundtrack accompanied the movie.\n\n---The direction by James Wong is the worst ever, if all that was mentioned above was any indication. I mean seriously Wong brought nothing out of the actors, took a very loose script of the show and made even more changes making it seem shallow, pathetic and bland, took away the spirit what made Dragonball great and inserted bad morals, made the characters nothing like show, directed the ''action scenes'' so badly, edited nothing that fits. He made a downright titanic clusterfck of a movie!\n\nBefore I forget, everybody involved in the making of this turd claimed that they were fans when in fact later they come out and said the movie is better than what is was based off and called the original show childish and stupid. So much for the statement that the actors were fans.\n\nAs you can see nothing good comes out of this film.\n\nIt gets nothing/10"

The only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema is because I paid to see it.\n\nMain points:\n\n-Goku's character is completely wrong, all goku wants to do is train and fight stronger enemies, and make friends... he does not care about being popular, or getting a girlfriend or any of that cr*p. Also the martial arts used are very basic. Lets finally mention, nimbus? power pole? no. -Oozaru is a complete failure. He should have been hundreds of times bigger. Also - lack of tail, full moon etc? Not just that but Goku cannot control his great ape state, let alone transform back. -Piccolo has no antennae.. also his back story is COMPLETELY wrong. -Grandpa Gohan's story part was all wrong. -Yamcha sucks. -Master Roshi was funny, and I've no problem with Yun Fat Chow but the role was really poorly cast. Also he has hair wtf?!\n\nFinally - THE KAMEHAMEHA DOES NOT HEAL PEOPLE!!! It would have blown a hole in his chest ffs.\n\nWong, do not even think of making a sequel."

Why did the Japanese allow it to be made into a live action film still keeps me wondering. Even if you have the highest paid CGI studios, you cannot achieve GREATNESS that was DRAGONBALL. This is nothing compared to the original manga (comics) or anime series and anime movies.\n\nIn the UK release of the DVD and BLU-RAY, the tagline or fun-line or punch-line says, \"THE KIDS MATRIX\"\n\nDoes anybody really know how hurtful that sounds ? Dragonball (comics and anime) came earlier! I'm a fan of the MATRIX, but where did all that influence come from ? ANIME! PURE Japanese ANIME! That's where film-makers refer from when they wish to create something fantastic. That's why MATRIX was fantastic.\n\nNow this movie DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION is far from pleasing any type of audiences. Except for kids who think this movie and the G.I.Joe Movie are \"dope\"\n\nStay away from this movie. Bad movie. Bad Twentieth Fox Century for ruining the legends of Dragonball, Hit-man, etc etc"

        "review_detailed_main": "In all the interviews before the movie was released, James Wong, Justin Chatwin and even James Masters told us how much this movie will remained faithful to the manga and anime, but also with an added bonus such as the modern setting and the realism so that it looks like it is set in the real world. Thus, I had my hopes high.\n\nWalking into the cinema, I sat down with my popcorn as the reel started to roll. A fast prologue explains that 2,000 years ago, the evil Lord Piccolo tried to destroy the world with the help of his monstrous demon, Oozaru and was only imprisoned by a brotherhood of mystics. The film then skips to present day, as young Goku spars with his grandfather. As a gift for his 18th birthday, Grandpa Gohan gives Goku a dragonball, briefly explaining that only seven of the balls exist and when they are united a dragon is summoned which can grant one perfect wish.\n\nOkay, it still sticks to the original story. Fair enough.\n\nBut on the same day, Piccolo emerges, freed from shackles, with his lady assistant in an airship, trying to find the Dragonball. All the while, Goku is at a school party trying to woo his high school crush, Chi Chi when his grandfather is killed by Piccolo who couldn't find the Dragonball. With his last breath, Goku's grandfather tells him to find Master Roshi, who lives on a small island in the middle of town, and find the rest of the Dragonballs to save the world.\n\nOkay, maybe some few changes. I can live with that.\n\nGoku then went on a \"Wizard of Oz\"-like adventure, where he seeks the Dragonball and meets a few friends along the way. At least the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion have more characteristic and development than Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha.\n\nEverything happened too fast. Goku had his training with Roshi on the way to find the Dragonball and learns the Kamehameha \"theorically\", because Roshi just tells him how to do it and in the final battle, he did it.\n\nThe actor that really (or, almost) lives out the character is James Masters playing Lord Piccolo. We can feel his anger and vengeful drive towards the Earth, though we still do not know why, or how he was freed. And unfortunately, he gets so little screen time that the movie-maker could have just use CGI and spare Masters from wasting his time. Chatwin was also a great actor and was a real Goku... if Goku was such a moody and one dimensional character.\n\nBut I guess what save the movie is the special effect and the storyline itself (which is from the manga; the \"Demon Lord Piccolo\" Saga). The special effect is really awesome (no where near Transformers or Watchmen, but still); everything looks real. From the background to the slow-motion fight scene and even the Kamehameha. And the plot was also entertaining, although it could have been done way better.\n\nDragonball Evolution looks like a very high-budget B-movie, or something straight to DVD or TV.\n\nAs soon as the movie ended, I was speechless.\n\nBut the there was a short scene during the credits. Stay if you want, but I know a lot of Dragonball fans would already know what it is.\n\nDragonball Evolution; recommended....if you have never read or watched the manga or anime and would like to just kill some time off the weekends."

Come on some of the stuff in dragonball will not transfer onto the big screen without looking annoying and cheesy if you want that just watch the anime. The story in this was pretty good except for a few parts oozaru did not need to be in there because it was pointless,the high school part lasted like 4 minutes all in and even though it was funny because goku acted dumb even in school and when he beat up people it was gokuish and comical as well but it was pointless and there was no need for it.Piccolo and yamucha did not have enough face time and it had the most anti climactic ending ever it led up to a huge fight then just ended really bad but the kamehameha was well cool. OK i don't know if this is a spoiler or not but the end lasted for like 3 minutes all in and even though it followed the basic storyline could have had a better fight they punched each other like twice then blasted each other a few times. The characters were great i loved everyone of them i don't care what people say they all acted great. But the movie was too short that was foxs fault cos they cut out a lot of scenes which made it look choppy and left a few plot holes but even though they could have left in some scenes they cut out the parts we all hated like the 7 mystics part and goku infamous line 'im not ready for this' it was a good movie all in maybe some bits were stupid but it was fun and it did have a dragonball feel."

I could see all the little teenage girls screaming his name and chasing him like how back in the day they chased the New Kids on the Block. How does this make him Goku? It doesn't. He really did try his best to play Goku, and for that I won't degrade the guy\u0085 he just isn't Goku\u0085 not young Goku or any other Goku for that matter. If they were casting this fellow to get teenage girls to watch the movie: than their heads were in the wrong place. They should have been thinking about the millions upon millions of fans when deciding who to cast.\n\nNext, Chi Chi. She was written too soft. This was not Jamie Chung's fault\u0085 this was the writing. Chi Chi was way more aggressive than this soft girl that knew how to fight. Until the very end, no spark in her. And even then\u0085 the spark wasn't that bright.\n\nMoving on to the rating: PG? Really? What made these people think that this would draw a crowd? I started watching Dragon Ball in the late 90s when it first hit the US\u0085 there are millions of others just like me, so what's the point in making it PG? I'm not saying make the thing R\u0085 but they could have shot for higher! Next the writing: The dialogue sounded like a soapbox sketch that some lamebrain threw together in a month. Enough said about that.\n\nThen there was Yun-Fat Chow as Roshi\u0085 I know they were thinking: He was in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u0085 but Roshi is old. Even in early Dragon Ball he is old. He is supposed to be Old Gohan's mentor\u0085 Yun-Fat was half the guys age! They should have casted someone else. It isn't like Hollywood is running out of old Asian dudes just because Victor Wong and Pat Morita are dead.\n\nLastly, someone please tell those lame brain writers of this film that the dragon freaking talks! And where were the other characters from Dragon Ball: like the blonde chick with a machine gun? Okay\u0085 the pros: Cinematography\u0085 shows what they spent their money on.\n\nThe fights without Justin Chatwin were really neat as well.\n\nEmmy Rossum\u0085 until she stepped into this movie: I thought it was going to completely suck. She really studied Bulma's character. She plays her exactly right and hopefully gets more acting opportunities in the future. That about wraps it up.\n\nOh and please as a favor\u0085 If any of you ever meet Ben Ramsey (the writer of this movie) please punch him in the stomach for me. Then say, \"You know why!\""

That's the least fans expect to see, not a covered up high-school story of a social loser that becomes cool.\n\nYes, I'm a fan that is complaining, irked and disappointed for the waste of such potential plot. Even if I saw the movie mentally prepared to accept a deep change of the story (that usually is not per se a bad thing, because it gives a different 'what-if' development that gives new life to the merchandise), I was appalled by the common clich\u00e9s and lack of creativity.\n\nSo to sum it up: Unwatchable for the fan, poorly entertaining for the casual watcher, because of its unoriginality. Special effects and battles do not save the movie as they are mediocre and we've already used to see so much better."

Well, because I have been watching Dragonball anime years and years ago and I was utterly disappointed even beyond the cushion of low expectations I prepared myself with. Yes, bracing yourself before going to the pictures isn't going to help for that film. The special effects were fine - in the early 1990's. The plot didn't do remotely justice to the anime.

The dialogue is stolen from every hero movie in existence, the acting is completely transparent and downright bad, the plot goes so fast and has no sensible path that it fails totally, the special effects are fairly boring, and the only good thing to say about it is that Chow Yun Fat is marginally entertaining.\n\nSecondly, that's why I enjoyed it. This movie falls under the category of \"so bad it's funny\" genre. For anyone who has seen the anime, many of you know that Dragonball is the basis for much of the things Americans hate about anime. The dialogue is mundane, the characters look like creatures from some other dimension, and the plot makes utterly no sense. No one ever seems to learn anything valuable, nor do their motivations seem genuine. The characters simply exist to provide a moment of entertainment, which they normally fail to do. And this is why people watch it: Dragonball is completely adept at being inept.\n\nIn reality, I think that this movie actually intends to poke fun at anime and itself with how horrible it is. No one could take Dragonball into a movie and have it make any sense. Going into the movie, if you keep that in mind and know that it will be an hour and a half of pure stupidity, you might enjoy yourself. I certainly did. Don't take it seriously, enjoy the special effects, and don't think too hard."

They knew it was going to be bad so why make this stupid film? They have ruined the Dragonball franchise and all the actors in this movie should be ashamed to be in some dribble like this. NONE of the characters portrayed even close to the original characters from the series and I'm surprised this movie wasn't directed by Uwe Boll. Oh wait one more thing, if for some god awful reason there is going to be a sequel based on the after credits scene, I will never watch another movie associated with any of these actors, directors, producers, distributors or whatever. And why the hell would you put another scene during the credits? Because as soon as this piece of crap is over, people are gonna rush to get the hell out of the theater so obviously no one is gonna see the scene. Don't waste your time watching, renting or even taking up time in your life to pirate this movie online."

I was not insulted at all by this movie and I actually enjoyed it, not in a serious way of course. Of course, it's nothing at all like DragonBall... Maybe very loosely but nothing like it at all.\n\nI knew it was going to be terrible, and terrible it was. The acting, especially by Yamcha's actor, was horrible. The only exception was for Piccolo's actor - he actually did a pretty good job. Also, the women, all of them, all have very nice views of their boobs, especially ChiChi. I labeled her mostly as Talking Boobs. The whole movie was ridiculous and made no sense at all, and that's saying a lot given how little sense the show made.\n\nIf you're the type of DragonBall fan who's willing to laugh at your fandom or you hate DragonBall, it's the perfect movie.\n\nBut take note, if you are DragonBall fan... Do have some DVDs of the actual show waiting for you. You'll need it for healing. I may have enjoyed it, but I still needed to redeem the show in my eyes."

And to top it off there is hardly any fighting in this movie which \"Dragon Ball\" is notorious for and when there is a fight scene it's just dull with crap special effects, I mean the special effects aren't terrible but it was pretty bad. This is a film that everyone that hates \"Dragon Ball Z\" and just laugh at it and also at the fans, cause if you watch the movie before you check out the cartoon version, you will most definitely not even give the cartoon a try. It also probably cost a lot just to get the license to make this film from the cartoon, but the budget was way too low for this type of cartoon to film adaptation. If Micheal Bay made this film I think he could have done a better cause at least he had a bigger budget to work with, and that is a big diss to James Wong. This was a bad adaptation and a terrible script. I give this movie a 3 cause I seen worse and the look on Justin Chatwin was hysterical in every scene cause his impression is like \"you guys have got to be kidding me\" and kids under 10 can at least enjoy all the color and stupidity.\n\n3/10"

As a massive fan of the anime i new that a live action adaptation would never be as good, But if you look at it as an updated twist in a classic it can be an entertaining watch. Chow Yun-Fat plays Turtle Hermit Master Roshi with out taking to much away from the well loved anime version. Since I have watched all the anime, and as most if not all who see this movie would know Our hero Goku, I was really not sure how Justin would play role. After all its GOKU! in the anime we meat Goku as a 12 year old boy, though Justin's Obviously not that young. Justin Plays an 18 year old version of our Hero who is still living with Grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) He goes to school where he is Picked on (cause Grandpa wont let him fight) by the Boy friend of Chi Chi (Goku's dream girl) played by Jamie Chung. With out giving the story away we can say that there's chemistry between Goku and Chi Chi. What would Dragon ball be without Goku's Arch Nemesis the Lord Piccolo who is in search of the dragon balls to make his wish of vengeance and destroy the Earth, Goku must find the 7 dragon balls with the help of Bulma who has a Dragon ball radar. All in all I would have to say if You are a Die Hard fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT You will watch it even if you think it will be a flop cause no fan would want to miss a live action KA-ME-HA-ME-HAAAAAAA. for those who have never seen Dragon ball Z. It can still be enjoyed as a superhero movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The rating and reviews for this movie are too funny. When children decide to become movie critics, they really emote the STUPID, with no concept of what qualities comprise good or bad. Just check the reviewers that rate this movie with one star and see how many of them have only reviewed ONE movie; this one. Apparently the kiddies really like some Japanese comics called manga, or cartoons called anime, that this movie was based on. And since the movie didn't adhere to the version they like, they all got their little panties in a bunch.\n\nI've never read or seen another version, and having never seen anything this movie was based on, I can give you a clean review from an adult perspective.\n\nThis movie was a fair watch. The action was good and there was lots of it. The writing was about what you'd expect for a movie of this nature; neither good nor bad. The CGI was pretty decent, and the actors playing the characters were all very likable and charismatic. And I must say, Jamie Chung is so good looking she makes me wish I was in my 20's again. I'd never seen her before and I had to look her up, but she's a real eye-popper. Faces like that always make me enjoy a movie more. Make no mistake, this isn't Casablanca or The Godfather, but rating it as average is certainly fair.\n\nAnd as for you kids that will give a thumbs down to my review just because this movie didn't match some cartoon version, you obviously have never seen a REALLY bad movie. If you think this was bad, you might look on-line and watch Night Train to Mundo Fine, Monster a-Go Go, or The Wild World of Batwoman (I think they are all available for free viewing, as nobody cares about copyrights on them). Those movies are truly BAD. Plots you can't follow, lack of continuity, microphones in frame, horrible acting, bad lighting and sound, and more clich\u00e9s than you can name. Seeing movies like those can really give you some perspective on what's bad.\n\nDragonball: Evolution just doesn't even come close to being as horrible as you make it sound. Sorry, but just because you throw a temper tantrum on-line doesn't make this a bad movie."

I remember running home from school everyday just so I can catch DBZ when it aired. That said, my beef with the movie is NOT because it didn't follow the anime closely. I'm not a purist when it comes to these things and I enjoy quality in whichever form I can get it.\n\nThe movie, for the first half was pretty fun. I liked seeing the modernized version of DB with Goku as a teen, dealing with high school bullies and all. It was pretty entertaining but unfortunately it only lasts for the first 15 or so minutes. After that the movie becomes a chaotic fast track.\n\nThe movie moved too fast for me. It didn't really take the time to stop and take a whiff of fresh air. The gang is always on the move and it ultimately turns out to be a lot of crazy, inexplicable mess. Not to mention that it was extremely cheesy and too cartoony sometimes. It might've been nice for the little kids but those of us who grew up watching DBZ are grown now.\n\nThe characters all turn out to be one-dimensional. There's NO character development from anyone's perspective. Goku may have had a tad bit of development but not as much as you'd expect for the main character. Especially when you consider the fact that the movie was all about \"Being who you are inside\" and all that corny mumbo-jumbo.\n\nThe acting was... god. Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung were the only ones who seemed natural. Emmy Rossum had great facial expressions but her voice seemed too animated for me. She didn't have any chemistry with the rest of the cast and sometimes I thought she may have been too uncomfortable. And DO NOT get me started on Joon Park. He was HORRIBLE. He reminded me of a surfer dude from a 70s movie(you know, when the acting was SUPPOSED to be campy). And as a Buffy fan, I gotta say that James Marsters was upsetting. He obviously didn't put himself into the role.\n\nThe directing was lazy. Straight and simple. The only time it seems the director put forth the extra effort was during a fight scene. Everything else was... blah. But, you should expect that from a movie where there's no effort in development. Bulma and Yamcha's \"relationship\" came from nowhere. One minute they were arguing and the next minute they were having a one-on-one. Ridiculous.\n\nOverall, it was an EPIC fail. It was just a fail."

As the group locate the dragonballs using Bulma's tracking device, they are attacked by Piccolo's sexy henchwoman Mai (Eriko Tamura).\n\nThe plot for this live-action manga movie is all over the place, the acting is wooden and the special effects not so special, but I still managed to have some fun with the whole sorry mess, possibly because I had my expectations set extremely low after recently watching the lousy Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, partly down to the fact that I had no prior knowledge of the Dragonball graphic novels (and so wouldn't be disappointed by inaccuracies), but mostly because I was clearly in the mood for some mindless martial arts fantasy nonsense with several babes in cleavage enhancing costumes.\n\nAnd that's precisely what I got\u0085 lots of silly kung fu action aided by wire-work and CGI and three hotties with their bosoms making up for their poor performances. Can't say that it has forever changed the way I look at film, or that it will even stay with me until the week is out, but I wasn't bored by its banality, miffed by its mediocrity, or angry at its inanity, which must count for something.\n\n4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for Chow Yun-Fat chewing up the scenery."

It was a movie based off of a cartoon ... really, they had to make changes to fit the needs. Don't go in expecting everything to be the same as you remember it from childhood (or perhaps for some of you, not so long ago), and you will be pleasantly surprised. Again, remember its FAMILY FRIENDLY. It is just like I said earlier, a live action cartoon with about as much depth."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a fan of both Dragonball and Dragonball Z for years. While it was not the first anime I ever saw it did get me interested in the genre. However, when I watched the film I tried to see it from a non-fan's eyes. Sadly to say even with my blinders on the movie did not live up to my expectations for an entertaining film.\n\nThe Good: In consideration of special effects the film did a decent job. The fight sequences were smooth. The make-up effects decent. Some of the stylized issues done with the film were interesting as well. I understood trying to make the film appear modern and at times this idea worked.\n\nSome of the actors did a decent job as well. Chow Yun-Fat played a decent Master Roshi and Justin Chatwin managed to capture the innocence of Goku. James Marsters did a decent job of Piccolo even if his screen time was relatively short. And Emmy Rossum crafted an interesting, but believable Bulma.\n\nThe Bad: If your fan of the anime you will be annoyed to say the least, so I will leave that discussion there. If you are looking for decent movie you may be upset. The film is campy and reminds me of the old Street Fighter, Double Dragon, and Super Mario movies, but without the charm. The plot is convoluted and uneven. I understand that the world of Dragonball is not our world. Yet, I still could not suspend disbelief. the multiple types of creatures and characters in the film, an aspect understood in the show, is never fully explained in my opinion. The acting for some the characters is over the top. Yamcha's appearance and acting in the movie is particularly random. I guess to sum up the main issue, the film does not know where it is going. It has an idea, and even some of the skills necessary but falls short before it can fully explore those ideas. I'm not surprised considering how epic the show was.\n\nOverall: I think children will enjoy this movie. I think the lowering of the rating to PG will garner it some decent amount of attention for kids. The film may one day be a cult hit but I doubt it. Overall, I again think the film reeks of those films we liked as kids and as adults for childhood nostalgia, but will fall short for anyone over 13 years of age. Hopefully, the sequel will take the grown up route that the Dragonball Z series took. In other words: more action, simpler story, and less thoughtful points."

This movie is not made for the fans of the Dbz anime series, even tho the creators probably thought they were making it so. The least they could do is keep to the original story-line, not just take the characters and make your own story (wich is worse). Even i would have come up with a better DragonBall movie than this."

Starting from Goku's training with Gohan's grandfather, continuing with the meeting with Bulma, Roshi and Yamcha, until the confrontation with Piccolo. The only good things that stood out are the design of the dragon balls that are good, some action scenes, some effects, Goku's suit that at least looks a bit like the original and at least Piccolo's design does make it look like an alien. Bulma's actress didn't seem too bad to me and Chow Yun-Fat is remarkable, but he falls short in his role as Roshi. There have simply been a lot of changes that make this movie very much derived from Dragon Ball. It had a chance to be something good, since it was produced by Akira Toriyama and Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow, but the director chosen was not the one. James Wong is a good filmmaker for having been responsible for The One with Jet Li and the Final Destination saga, but even so, he was not the ideal person to direct this film, since he declared that he had never seen or read anything from Dragon Ball, so I didn't know I was adapting. Unfortunately, this movie is undoubtedly a failed adaptation and a tragedy for an anime as emblematic as Dragon Ball. My rating for this movie is 5/10."

Sure, characters are missing (it's only a movie after all, limited in time,) the Nimbus and Goku's rod are gone, but the characters remained fairly faithful to the original concepts, the basis of the story is here, and the settings are great. We get not only the populated areas but also the sparse wilderness and badlands the show/comic is known for. Piccolo's green, we get to see some Saiyan ape Goku action...honestly I don't know why actual fans of the original Dragonball complained so much.\n\nAll in all, it's not great, but it's watchable, and fans of the original Dragonball should enjoy this as long as they keep expectations reasonable."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have always been a big fan of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z,\" while \"Dragon Ball GT\" not sure if that will hold up well (Might need to have a look back at it). I have heard that this was first announced that Hollywood was going to make a live- action adaptation of not only the show, but the manga and I do not know if this movie was going to work because it might either suck or surprise me the heck out of me. As the movie was already being filmed, set photos were posted and we all thought that this movie was going to suck. Trailers didn't help, photos didn't help, or anything that was being marketed for. I did say to myself that if this movie was good its \"Transformers,\" but if its bad, then it is the \"Super Mario Bros.\" (Referring to the live action movie). So I did watched the movie, and I was not the only one alone because we were all right that this movie really sucks so bad. If you think \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" is worse than this movie, think again because I think this movie is even worse than the second Transformers movie, and I think that one is more entertaining than this pile of junk! \"Dragonball Evolution\" is one of the worst movies that was adapted from a popular franchise, which it has nothing much to do with the source material. If I mean nothing much to do, which now makes this movie a slap in the face to all fans, including myself, who all love \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z.\" This has a butt-load of problems, and everything about this movie is all wrong. James Wong was not the right choice to direct the movie. It should have been Stephen Chow because he said that he was fan of the series. I never saw \"Kung-Fu Hustle\" but I still think he should have direct the movie; if not, then maybe it should have been the Wachowskis because they need knew how bring an artistic style for the visuals, and the action scenes like \"The Matrix Trilogy\" and \"Speed Racer.\" The action in this movie are not well done because they are not that exciting as what the show did. If you have seen what Zack Snyder had done with the action scenes in \"Man of Steel,\" then this is what the movie should have because the action in \"Man of Steel\" were awesome. The story itself is not well written, and does have a bunch of clunky dialogue that doesn't seem to have a \"Dragon Ball\" feel. The special effects in this movie are not stunning to look at, and are not that impressive like the effects in \"Avatar,\" \"Inception,\" or any other movies that have great special effects. The acting is not really that good for most of the cast, but they at least tried. Justin Chatwin as Goku was actually not that bad because he at tried to be the character that we all loved, and I thought he looked fine wearing that famous outfit he wore during the last action scenes of the movie (As well as doing the Kamehameha). Emmy Rossum looks nothing like Bulma, and having one little blue color on her hair was not good enough. James Marsters did not do a great to play Piccolo, while the makeup itself isn't that great either. Jamie Chung as Chi-Chi was not a bad choice, but doesn't bring anything new to table except being a lover to Goku. Chow Yun-Fat playing Master Roshi in this movie pretty much killed his career. As for the rest of the cast, were all done pretty awful. The movie does have some plot holes like Goku transforming into an Ape (Which looks nothing like it) that doesn't have a tail, Roshi healing Goku with the Kamehameha that doesn't heal because it should have been Goku eating a Senzu Bean, and Goku's outfit not being ripped after transforming into an ape and going back to being human. The movie tries to be realistic like movies such as \"The Dark Knight Trilogy,\" \"Man of Steel,\" \"Arrow,\" and many others. This movie doesn't need to be, and there is no way that it can be possibly work. I'd seen movies and TV shows that worked better to be realistic while this and the \"Super Mario Bros.\" movie don't work at all. I really don't like this movie, and I know that everyone has seen this movie are not completely satisfied; even Akira Toriyama creator of \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\" hated this movie because they pretty much ignore on what Toriyama had in mind with his ideas for the movie. If you are going to do a reboot live-action interpretation of the show and the manga, then do it right as you respect the source material. Before I conclude this, I do like to say that the song \"Rule\" by Ayumi Hamasaki was actually pretty awesome because it does get the feeling of \"Dragon Ball.\" I do listen to this song on my iPod, and I think it should be in a better \"Dragon Ball\" movie than this. Also, I really love Brian Tyler's score for the movie, which I thought it was awesome. So, yeah, those were some of the good things that I liked about while the rest of the movie sucks. Lastly, for right now, I rather go see and watch \"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods\" over this movie that is trying to cash in with the name that carries the title \"Dragon Ball.\" The new DBZ movie is animated, and it has the English Funimation Dub cast; go see and watch that one instead of this poorly adaptation of a movie. I never saw it, but I really want to. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."

The acting was a little shotty in places, but with a storyline this bad it would'nt matter who was in it. The worst part though was easily put on the director and producers. Whether it was the obviously fake backgrounds or the fact that they developed and showed how the characters were so badly. Overall they should try Dragonball Z again, but should put on a little bigger budget."

I want to be in the meeting where they thought having Goku go to high school dealing with bullies was a good idea.\n\nThe effects are awful, the acting is awful, the story will take mindless detours that wastes the audience and character's time. Not being faithful to the source material is one thing but being this bad is something else entirely.\n\nIt really is something that has to be seen to be believed. It is the car crash that you can't help but stop and stare. It is a disaster so bad, no amount of Shenron wishes would be able to save it."

The trailer already told me that the movie was gonna be very Americanized, have whack special effects, and a white Goku. Although it was exactly what I expected, the movie was still pretty fun. Everything was pretty lame, like the acting, the jokes, and basically all the characters. I guess the actor who played Goku got it right with the goofiness, but it still felt strange. All the actors were okay; they're weren't horrible like Street Fighter, but not \"great.\" I felt that the actor that played Bulma the best out of the whole group. The actor for Yamcha was miss-casted; he sucked balls. It was weird that Cho Yun-Fat played Master Roshi and an older actor played Grandpa Gohan, when Roshi supposedly was Gohan's master, but whatever. Overall, the movie is just what you'd expect. The resolution and \"plot twist\" was kinda stupid, and was totally different from the Dragonball t.v. show. If the movie was at least 2 hours long (it was only 84 minutes, what a waste) the plot could've been better and stuff."

The outrageously inaccurate portrayal of 'OUR' Dragonball is just shocking, it has got nothing to do with the comic and hell they thought it's cool to add crap Hollywood elements into the film which completely destroy the untouchable classic. First of all, none of the actors resemble the characters in the comic a single bit and just when I thought they would create a cool looking piccolo, doesn't necessary have to look completely like the one in the comic but I was in for a rude surprise to see one of the best character in the comic looking worst then ugly duckling, not to mention that his role is literally non existence, same goes to the storyline which again has nothing to do with the comic. Without vegeta, trucks, red ribbons bots...etc was actually the best thing in this movie else the damage done would have been unthinkable and the director might need to look for a temporary hideout."

Director James Wong who also directed other hit movies for example, Final Destination, Final Destination 3, The One etc, did an amazing job in recreating the Dragonball story, while featuring well-preformed actors, like Justin Chatwin (Goku) who also plays as Robbie in War of the Worlds and Nick Powell in The Invisible. Emmy Rossum (Bulma) who also played as Christine Daa\u00e9 in The Phantom Of The Opera, and Laura Chapman in The Day After Tomorrow.\n\nAlthough this movie was not exactly like the original manga storyline, it does not mean it is a let down. This new modern story was an interesting change for the original. Instead of Goku being being a dumb nut, he attended school. Instead of Goku being a little 12-15 year old immature child, he was an 18 years old, and more mature. Because the focus audience is still for children/teens, it focuses on modern problems in children/teen life, one is the bully problem at schools, Goku was not a well loved student in the film, but rather one of the victims of bullying. It also shows teenage love, like how they are shy to start of with but gain confidence throughout the story. Dragonball Evolution relates to the audience more then the original story.\n\nThe Fight scenes were a combination of The Matrix and The One, which is quite a good mix, and is worth seeing. The effects were well done. It was still funny and silly like the series. While relating the series to modern time.\n\nOverall the movie was great, and worth watching. The Fighting is great, the relation from the movie to the audience was well done, it was funny and the cast was perfect. I would suggest this movie to people that are into Dragonball, that would not mind a change in the original story."

It actually made me laugh, mainly at how bad it is, but still, it was entertaining to lose 2 hours with it on a stormy day with nothing else to do.

It also faces other bad problems, like bad acting, cheesy effects, a pointless love interest, and a crappy storyline. Also, the number of fight scenes is unbelievable. For a show that has so many epic fight scenes, you would think this movie would have tons, right? WRONG.This movie has like 3 fight scenes. Really, I counted. But it all comes down to this.

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball may not be an epic masterpiece, but it's so much better than you'd expect after reading the fans' rants here. It's a fun little movie that does a good job in capturing the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the anime. While the effects don't stand out as anything we haven't seen before, they service the story well without looking phony, and although there are a few plot holes, it's nothing as glaring as... well, a large percentage of the other movies out there. There were a few things that were probably explained or developed in scenes that may have been cut to keep the length down to something that's closer to a pre-teen's attention span, but everything moves so quickly that you don't have time to really ponder those bits before you're on to the next scene.\n\nJustin Chatwin has a lot of charisma as Goku, and does a pretty good job with the fighting. Yes, he's a teenager in high school, but from a practical viewpoint, a younger actor probably wouldn't have the acting talent to carry the movie (think Anakin Skywalker in Episode One), and would be prohibited from working long hours and doing some of the stunts due to Child Labor laws. I wasn't really expecting to like him as much as I did. No, his hair isn't sticking out in two-foot long spikes, but that would have looked silly in live action. Of course he'd get his hair cut to a standard length, otherwise everyone would laugh as he tried to get through doorways.\n\nJames Marsters is perfect as Piccolo. He's got the voice and the mannerisms just right, and has just the right amount of menace. Chow Yun-Fat is hilarious as Roshi. Really, the only actor who didn't work form me was Joon Park as Yamcha. He seemed to be just smiling and reading his lines, without putting anything of himself into it, and the character himself just wasn't developed to the point that you could tell why the others would trust him or why he'd be helping beyond anything that's just for the money. I can't imagine them being able to add more characters in, if they didn't even have enough time to properly introduce Yamcha.\n\nYes, there are changes here, but actually less than most other big-screen remakes of TV series. It's better than the Wild Wild West or Lost In Space movies, but then again, what isn't? And changes don't necessarily mean that it's worse. The new Battlestar Galactica made Starbuck female, made Boomer not only female but a Cylon, and the whole mythos is different, but it's great. And some of the changes that fans here are complaining about aren't actually in the movie, but were just in the trailer, such as the mystics creating the Dragonballs. They don't say that in the movie itself.\n\nSo if you go in without a completely closed mind, you'll probably find yourself having a good time. And be sure to stick around until after they list the cast in the credits for the extra scene."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragon Ball is an epic saga of a kid named Goku, who travels the world to find 7 mystical balls of power to stop them from falling in to the hands of evil. In his travels he constantly overcomes his own limits to defeat any opponent in his way, protect his friends and become the greatest fighter in the world. It was a great anime that had many memorable characters and some of the most impressive action sequences on television. Dragonball Evolution on the other hand is an hour and a half of disappointment, watching as franchise that has such an enormous fan-base be ruined, losing all the charm that made the anime it was based on great to begin with.\n\nObviously it's understandable for a film adaptation to make changes from the source material, but there is so little here that even resembles the anime that it's based on. It does keep the basic story the same. Goku and his friends are still trying to collect the dragon balls to prevent them from falling in to the hands of the likes of the evil Lord Piccolo. They also try to incorporate various other mythos from the show like the Kamehameha wave, but they fail at doing it well. All of the explanations of the universe and Goku's powers are rushed over so quickly that people new to the series will be lost and loyalists of the franchise will be annoyed at how poorly these mythos are incorporated in the film.\n\nAlso whilst the characters share the same names as their anime counterparts, this is about as far as their similarities go. Goku's personality is changed from being a light minded fool who cares about only doing good and being the best fighter he can be, to being a typical teenage kid who spends most of the film having a crush on Chi Chi. Roshi's nothing more than a generic master who Goku finds. Bulma is just a Lara Croft type character without any of the attitude that made her character enjoyable. The character closest to their anime counterparts ends up being Lord Piccolo, since at the least he looks like the villain that he's based on. Everyone else suffers from worse miscasting than The Last Airbender movie with all the cast having nothing in common with their respective roles.\n\nIt's also a dreadfully made film on a technical level, with director James Wong taking the epic world destroying fights from the original anime and turning them into amateuristic sequences that seem like they were made by a film student. They use a mixture of awful choreography with the fighters moving slowly and fast paced editing where each shot will last no more than a second at a time. Plus for a film with a 45 million dollar budget, the effects really suck. When the 2D cartoon that the film is based on looks more realistic than the effects do, it's pretty obvious that you screwed up.\n\nThis film fails in every way. It won't appeal well to people unfamiliar to Dragon Ball since the characters and story are so generic, whilst being a terribly made mess of a film. And fans are certain to hate it since it fails to recapture anything that made the franchise great to begin with. It doesn't even feel like a real film. It feels like one of those parody trailers you see in something like The Simpsons that spoof how bad Hollywood is at with adaptations got turned into a real film. If you want to enjoy Dragon Ball just stick with the anime."

Don't watch it, it's a very very very bad movie. needs to be remade by a better director and better casts."

Dragon Ball is nowhere near as lame as this movie. my heart goes out to all of us who felt like Goku was raped. i just wish the people who thought this up would suffer a similar fate.\n\nam i angry? yes i am. what am i gonna do about it? nothing. Hollywood will forever be Hollywood. uncaring. irresponsible. and inhuman. no thing will ever change."

I just recently saw the movie and my opinions about the movie somewhat changed. The fight scenes are silly some of the time, yet entertaining. The acting is tolerable and the special effects are okay. James Wan gave us a HORRIBLE adaptation to the manga, if not the anime. I felt that if someone who actually watched the damn anime or bothered to do the movie justice at all would direct this movie a whole lot better. However, this movie holds a place in my heart like The Last Airbender did, and I'll always enjoy it."

I'm not against change and I can imagine you need to modify a story to carry it to big screen. But still if you're going to adapt a series with such a big fan community, you need to keep it's essence.\n\nWhat ruined the movie for me was that Goku's background was raped and transformed him in something he is not. The hero we knew lived alone in the forest with his grandfather and had no contact with civilization, which made him goofy, unadapted to the world and funny. In Dragonball Evolution, we got a teen Goku who's worried about bullies, girls, etc. The protagonist we loved was completely inverted 15 minutes through the movie.\n\nBasically, the makers of this movie couldn't create an interesting DB universe because they didn't have the guts to capture the essence of Dragon Ball, making a movie we can only call a parody. As a fan you will feel insulted while watching this movie. First because it has absolutely no respect for the original manga. Second because you will notice a few details (Goku eating this big chunk of meat or running next to the car with a gigantic package on his back) that were good and have you think this movie could have actually been awesome done with more effort from the entire crew.\n\nAnyway, watch it with humor or do not watch it at all."

In my opinion this movie should deserve a negative 10 on stars but unfortunately there isn't that option and the only reason it gets 1 stars is the commitment James marster and some of the other actors put in for their roles. James marster which probably made this movie better than it originally was I consider him the true hero of this film. As for the movie itself the story is awe full, the characters except for piccolo are no where near as how they are portrayed in the series, the fight scene are incredibly cringe worthy. The writer only read a short plot line from IMDb before writing this movie because he was only doing it for the paycheck. A movie that can have the greatest potential in Hollywood is reduced to one of the worst movie ever made and probably the worst although birdemic is a close call for the worst movie ever made. When the actors says it's a bad movie and the director knows this movie is doomed to fail from the beginning than you know it's bad beyond reason."

Not a criticism, just an objective observation, factual and verifiable (i.e. Rated TV-Y7). This movie only steps that up to PG.\n\n2) The awesome reviews come from nostalgic recollections of the reviewer's childhoods. You know, back when you were only pretty sure Santa wasn't real but just knew you too could one day be a martial arts master and superhero. Scroll through and you'll see they start with- I remember when I was 6, or- Started watching with friends after school, etc.\n\nAll this to say, a 2 star average accompanied by such hyperbolic vitriol is the type of anomaly rating you get when you hit a nerd nerve, when you dare attempt to modernize stories of yesteryear that were embraced by nerdiest among us (not a criticism, I love nerd lore too;).\n\nEvery comic book guy will come out of their metaphorical basement to say it's the \"worst ____ ever\".\n\nThat's understandable, even amusing, but they're frustration is misplaced. Hollywood's attempt to reboot something fun from a then otherwise largely overlooked genre, should be appreciated, not derided. Not like this took away from some other anime movie getting made, as the years before we got the quality we have now have proven.\n\nIt just wasn't time yet. The biggest mistake this movie made was not predicting the overly precious recollection of their target audiences childhood. That, and also just not trying very hard... Despite all the above, it actually isn't very good\ud83d\ude02 It's just not NEARLY as bad as reviews make it out to be.\n\nI get it, it's a dumb movie, JUST like all things created for children (kids are great, but they're famously not as smart or able to understand the real world as well as adults), but that doesn't make it bad. It just means manage your expectations and know you're about to watch a 15yo live action reboot of a 30yo cartoon made for kids fascinated by super powers and fighting abilities that let them defeat their bullies in wild spectacles.\n\nIf what you want is well enough choreographed fights that use unusual methods (like single handedly defeating a handful of attackers and destroying their car without ever touching any of them), and also still appreciate late 2000's CGI (not as great as today's, but passable), then this scratches the itch.\n\nIf you grew up a diehard DBZ fan and want a movie that takes your childhood fantasies seriously to tell an adult story that adheres to your version of verisimilitude (which was as fuzzy as your understanding of that word at that age), then your nostalgia has set expectations that cannot be met.\n\nAn adult giving this 1 star and ranting that it's an insult to fans is like complaining that the mall Santa is insulting your childhood memory of Christmas.\n\nIt's a kids movie, get over yourself."

I guess many of us need this in order to come to terms with watching something so deeply routed into our hearts fall so fast and hard. Everyone is picking at one thing or another with this film and trying to explain why it ended up this way in the numbers and so on. But if you really look at the root of the issue it all stems from 1 miscalcutaion by fox.\n\nThey were trying to make the film amiable for everyone but aimed the films production and story at a demography that was far to young for the general public to take seriously. The movie is fine if you look at it from a 10 year olds eyes. The youngest viewers don't read to much into it. So the story ends up full of potholes, lackluster dialogue, and childproof fight scenes and effects.\n\nIn turn, the actual critiquing populous can only rate the film from their point of view rather than looking at it as a children's film. The script was aimed at very young boys but by it was promoted as a film for the general masses. Why not, its a billion dollar franchise that has lasted 20 years so it has to have a diverse audience to begin with. There wouldn't be to much work involved to convince ppl to watch it. But, after the first people watched it they didn't return to the theaters and told others it wasn't worth going. In general Only the 10 year old boys that it was aimed at may have been willing to go see it again\u0085 and they don't have any money or a deep set love for the series since it is before their time.\n\nIt doesn't seem as if fox realized the people who grew up with this stuff from 15 to 5 years ago were now at minimum in their teens. also, Writing and directing a script that limits its vantage point for they eyes of pre-pubescent boys severely limits the range of people that would be willing to watch the film or even give it a decent review.\n\nbut Oh, well. rather then trying to understand where they started to take the wrong turns.. They just look at the numbers. so getting a reboot or sequel with a larger budget for better production may be out of the question. Because to them it is our fault it didn't do very well. We are the ones that didn't go see it or see it more than once so those numbers suggest that we just didn't want dragon ball on the big screen. It doesn't have anything to do with fox getting the driving factors behind the anime and manga right. They could have written a completely different and new story but keep the characters personalities and motivations intact and it would have still been dragonball. But they chose not to do that. The story was difficult to follow the main character was a completely different person personality-wise and the epic earth shattering action scenes that made the series were non existent."

I love 12 year old fanboys who review movies that didn't meet their exacting specifications.\n\nOK, so to actually review the movie you need to be aware that fox took the creative aspect into heavy consideration for the movie. Much of Dragonballs story has been altered to bring the movie to Hollywood, and some aspects make no sense whatsoever unless you've watched Avatar: the Last Airbender anime.\n\nThey reference elemental attacks and the Kamehameha is an 'advanced airbending technique' which only makes sense if the Dragonball universe and the Avatar universe magically merge to destroy the Dragonball storyline.\n\nTaking the entire Dragonball series and setting it aside the movie makes almost no sense but is characteristic of everything Dragonball. They have essentially merged the entirety of the series into this one short movie which IMO isn't all bad.\n\nI could pick the technical details apart but in the end I was pretty satisfied with the first GOOD Dragonball live action movie. It is worth watching if you are a fan but be warned: it doesn't follow the story at all and many things are different than the anime series. Character names are there but that's where most of the similarity ends.\n\nI was only really disappointed by the tiny eternal dragon who somehow lost 99% of his mass in the conversion to film as well as his ability to speak, but having seen this one I definitely want to see the next ones.\n\nDragonball Evolution is about a continuing evolving story and even though Hollywood screws up almost everything it touches they did an OK job with the first one and Dragonball is all about sequels.\n\nI would give it a 5/10, compare with 4/10 for Spiderman 3, 4/10 for Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and 7/10 for Ironman.\n\nThe reason it gets 5 is for the altering of the original story, the lack of explanation to newcomers that Goku is an alien himself and other mostly story elements, typical Hollywood 'movie magic' and a few groaner moments that make you question why. eg, 'Piccolo escaped his magic prison somehow.' I hope they do better on the next one but this one definitely felt rushed and pieced together by a child who obviously had no prior knowledge about anything Dragonball."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a fan of the show in my youth, I once upon a time thought a live-action DragonBall movie would be awesome. I was twelve, please forgive me. Upon seeing the first trailers for this movie, I knew how wrong I was. Fantasy elements such as those in DragonBall just didn't seem to work in a live-action setting. Now that DBE is available for rental, I had to pick it up just to see how bad it came out. I am legitimately astonished. While DBE is certainly a bad movie, it somehow manages to avoid being terrible, which is more credit than I ever thought I'd give it.\n\nDragonBall Evolution is far from faithful to the source material, although nostaligia certainly was evoked. The dark lord Piccolo has managed to break out of his seal, and is hunting for the DragonBall's such that he can wish himself back into power. One of these dragonballs belongs to Goku, a geeky teenager who lives with his grandpa and trains in the martial arts, including some wacky airbending stuff and the word \"ki\". When Piccolo kills Goku's grandfather, Goku and fellow dragonball holder Bulma go on the run to find Master Roshi and stop Piccolo. Oh, and for Goku to woo hot fighter chick ChiChi.\n\nCertain elements from the old cartoons come across very well with live actors. Bulma's motorcycle-in-a-capsule is certainly quite awesome. But for every plus, there's five problems. Goku in high-school is almost insulting to the fans. The airbending techniques come across as a little too sci-fi since the world is made to look a little more realistic than in the cartoons (we accepted it there in a world where a dog was a police captain).\n\nSome of the biggest problems lie in the characters. Chow Yun Fat ostensibly brings some level of respect to the movie, but its one of his worst performances. In one moment where he celebrates a victory, he acts like Roshi straight out of the cartoon, something that doesn't work in live-action. Emmy Rossum really should be getting better roles than Bulma, and Bulma herself is made more action-oriented to fit in with the boys (although she's the only protagonist to play with guns). Joon Park is annoying as all hell as Yamcha, a Korean thief who talks like a surfer. Jamie Chung is definitely the hotter than anyone would have imagined ChiChi, but since when was ChiChi a fighter? Chatwin is decently likable, although the implications of a white Goku are a little unfortunate.\n\nAction is of course what the movie is about, seeing as the series prided itself on five-episode long fight sequences. The beginning scenes are quite awful, such as Goku's fight with high school bullies, with overuse of slow-mo. After that, the fights are a little more fluid and enjoyable, although far from memorable. But hey, we get to see Chow Yun Fat beat up the kid from War of the Worlds, which almost makes it worth it.\n\nIn spite of how easy it is to rip on, DragonBall Evolution was much more enjoyable than I expected. There's a lot of groaners, but less than I expected. Maybe its just low expectations, but I got a lot more out of DBE than I expected. Granted, I expected it to be a zero-star affair, and it managed a whole two. Good for it. But from now on, realise the limitations of adapting cartoons to live action. This movie will be too out-there for non-fans, and the fans will absolutely hate it. Moderate fans looking for nostalgia, such as myself, are really the sole audience for this."

Bulma doesn't have blue hair and acts NOTHING like she did in the original. Nobody is right in this atrocity. A fact: The director didn't watch dragon ball z at all. It's always a good idea to give a director who doesn't know anything about the franchise to direct the film. Bloody brilliant.\n\nThe effects. Oh those low budget effects. Two words: Hand Fart. Kamehameha looks like a freaking blue air pulse thing, and nothing about the moves had their explosive effect as they did in the original. The cgi sweat is plain embarrassing and I'm sure I could do better by inserting spheres in blender and covering them with stock footage textures.\n\nI'm not sure what they were thinking, but for the love of god: DO NOT MAKE A ANIME A LIVE ACTION FILM!"

A lot of the elements of DB are retained in some way, the humour, Roshi's less than chivalrous moments and the somewhat corny yet essential dialogue so those are pluses.\n\nEffects were decent, fight scenes were solid and it could have been a lot worse. Took me a few minutes to settle in and not look at it too objectively. If that was the first I've heard of DB it would have been fine but it's not a sterling representation of Dragonball on the whole."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's just get it out of the way: this movie isn't really Dragon Ball. If you come into it with preconceptions of what Dragon Ball is and should be, you're obviously bound to be disappointed since Goku and co. Are nothing like their manga/anime progenitors. At several points, just as I was beginning to enjoy it as a camp fest, I'd cringe a bit when hearing names such as Goku and Bulma which reminded me of DB and how disrespectful this movie is of it. But I managed to get over it after the first 30 minutes or so and actually had fun. If it didn't have to live up to its name, the movie definitely wouldn't be highly regarded, but I don't think it would be bottom 14 on IMDb either.\n\nI'd say it's alright as a standalone turn-off-your-brain B-movie. Nothing special or memorable, just middle of the road in most respects and below that in some. A lot of reviewers put the effects down, but I'd say that considering the low budget, they're surprisingly good overall. Of course, they ain't Marvel level, but most of them are pretty convincing by 2009 standards and some even rise above B-movie status... Except for the ones in the final 15 minutes or so. The Oozaru and Shenlong are utterly laughable! I guess the budget was running out when they got to that part.\n\nThe acting is decent overall and has some highlights such as Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi and Joon Park as Yamcha, both of whom are clearly enjoying camping it up. Speaking of camp, that's what this movie should be taken as. The bizarre hodgepodge of cliches from superhero movies, teen dramas/comedies, sci-fi, martial arts and mysticism can be nothing else.\n\nIf you manage to disassociate it from the Dragon Ball franchise and simply view it as a campy B-movie, you might just enjoy yourself!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing the bootleg and screaming as my eyes burned...I felt that Dragonball was dead. After seeing the bootleg, I felt a little raped as some of you have felt as well.\n\nSo I decided that I still needed to see the film on the big screen for a couple of reasons. One-felt like I had to since Dragonball was by far my favorite cartoon and had to pay respect to the creator who also was an executive producer of this film. Two-there were some extra minutes in this version than the bootleg...and yes, it's very obvious where the cuts are in the bootleg. It was really bad.\n\nSo I took my girlfriend who had no idea what Dragonball was about. Before the film started, I gave her a summary of the cartoon so she would at least have some idea of what the film was going to be about. She looked confused about some things, but that is understandable.\n\nSo when the film started, they gave a brief summary about what happened to Piccolo. There were some things I liked about the intro to the film, but there were some things that I did not like. It seemed a little to short for an intro in my opinion. Seemed like the people that had no idea about dragonball, or the characters, were a little cheated in a way. It was poor character development for Piccolo.\n\nIt then goes on and we meet Goku as a teenager. Now a lot of people have been complaining about Justin Chatwin (I have been to) and I must say....I take back some of things I have said about the dude. A lot of people wanted an Asian Goku...maybe to show respect...or simply because they thought he was more Asian than white. In my opinion...I don't really care. Some of his facial expressions were great.\n\nI'm not going to go through every single scene and break it down...so let's just go to what I didn't like and what I did like.\n\nThings I liked: The composed music is amazing. It brings the movie alone up a few ratings. Good job Brian Tyler, you have done it again. The extra minutes in the film made the film better without a doubt compared to the bootleg. There wasn't any hardcore cutting to where you are like \"wait, what just happened?\" A specific scene I am talking to is when the bully runs over Goku bikes. To those who have seen the bootleg and the U.S version, you know what I'm talking about. I thought the special effects were just OK. The big fight scene at the end was actually better to watch in the theatre.\n\nThings I didn't like: I understand that the cartoon had a lot of cheesy dialogue, but I feel it didn't work in this film. They tried to go for a more realistic sense and the dialogue just didn't work in a lot of places...especially with Goku at the end. The fighting needed to be better. I think the best fight scene in the entire film had to be at the beginning with Grandpa Gohan and Goku.\n\nI think everyone will agree with me on this one...\n\nGoku in high school is the main thing I did not like in this film. Goku asking how to get girls? No.....*shakes head*....just no. Why? Why not just have him at his grandpa's house? He didn't need to go to school...he could have just met chi chi...I don't know, I just think that part of the story should have been different.\n\nOK...If anyone who wants to see the film...but is just afraid...if you have any questions...go ahead and ask...\n\nbut i will say this...it's better than the bootleg...\n\nSo my official review of the film...\n\nbootleg version: 3/10 Official Version: 5/10 If there is a sequel...then I will say this...have better choreography fights. And the direction was not as bad as I thought it was going to be...but man oh man...get a better story and a bigger budget for the effects. PLEASE GET A BETTER STORY!! THAT'S ALL I ASK FOR OUT OF ANYTHING!"

If the company does not know where to begin....start with season 1 of dragon ball z.

The movie is fun and when you think of the challenge of bringing manga comics/animation to live action thats a big task. I thought the realisation of the characters was good and the elements they have taken made for good story telling. There is life in the movie and the enevitable sequels can get better. I will most likely buy on release as it is something fun to watch on a slow weekend afternoon. If you want a martial arts epic watch Legend, Enter The Dragon or Hero, if you just want to sit back and be entertained this is not a bad choice."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before even reading this review, you knew that the film was going to fail. You knew that there was no way that a modernized version of a brilliant anime that didn't even have the entire cast of characters (in the first episodes that is) was going to disappoint and deliver garbage. However, the difference between this remake/re-imagining of the animated cartoon and the typical Hollywood remake is the amount of effort. This was not some half-arsed production or cheap attempt to sell more toys and make quick money. This was an actual futile attempt to create a new storyline for the franchise that has been around since the 80s and jump-started the anime craze that eventually hit the United States in the late 90s.\n\nBut yes the movie is bad. Yes the movie is muddled with clich\u00e9s, over-blown special effects, wooden writing, and a weak ending. Yet, the energy and flair throughout the production stood out, and the potential for an evolving franchise that jumps from miserably bad to good is there. There is some bit of hope; you just have to deal with the fact that they aren't going to follow the original storyline at all. Maybe it's the fanboyism talking that if they listen; they can deliver a superior work of Dragonball. That or I might be utterly crazy. In the meantime, we shall gripe.\n\n1) Oolong, Vegeta, Turtle, Ox King, Puar, Krillin are not in the film 2) There are no extremely lengthy fights like in the television show 3) Bulma is a gun-wielding feminine cowgal 4) Yamcha has blonde hair 5) Master Roshi was not living in a very secluded island with a palm tree next to it 6) There is only one signature move mentioned in the film 7) Piccolo wasn't green 8) The Great Ape is reduced to angry Donkey Kong\n\nIf you are not at all ruffled at the previous complaints, then you aren't a fanboy, and can continue reading this so you know why the film fails. If you did get upset, stop reading, because odds are you are already protesting. Dragonball Evolution is most certainly not going to appeal to any of the true-blue fans of the show; those that saw Goku's travels from child to multiple deaths to wonderful memory. As for those who want to know what Dragonball is all about, skip this as well. If you are willing to accept a new vision of Dragonball, read on.\n\nTo make the plot synopsis simple: Goku must recover 7 dragonballs in order to prevent Piccolo from creating apocalyptic havoc across the planet. With the help of Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha, he sets off to try to rid the world of evil using the dragonballs. This film has all the nods to other \"young lad must rise up to overcome challenges despite incredible odds.\" The clich\u00e9s are fired so often, you can predict the next one. It's pretty clear that the writers knew about the anime and the characters, but didn't study about it deeply at all. Its one thing to know the show, it's another thing to truly know the show. Example: makers of Twilight Zone Tower of Terror saw every Twilight Zone episode 3 times. End result is an attraction that literally looks like a Twilight Zone episode. In the case of Dragonball Evolution, it has the characters, some of the familiar characterizations, but that's about it.\n\nBlaming the acting would be wrong, since they provided well with the material they had. Justin Chatwin as Goku is a mixed bag; he can play the role, but doesn't resemble Goku that much. Chi-Chi herself doesn't look like Chi-Chi, but Jamie Chung plays the role with a nice dosage of beauty and feistiness. Same goes with Bulma, portrayed by Emmy Rossum. Last but not least, the best performance comes from Yun-Fat Chow, who plays Master Roshi perfectly. Too bad the turtle sidekick from the cartoon was missing.\n\nBottom Line: Let's just wrap the review simply with this: It sucks, but could have been halfway decent if the clich\u00e9s weren't flying and there was more research plastered into the production. While a Dragonball movie outside the manga series actually following the franchise plot lines is inevitable (there have been two live-action films already) the effort placed in this installment was actually uplifting, even if the quality of the movie itself destroyed any positive feelings. Dragonball itself is an amazingly charming story full of rich characters, why not do a highly accurate adaptation? The only reason to see this movie is the only reason I went to see it: for nostalgia sakes, to reminisce the good times of Toonami. Don't expect miserable utter failure, but expect a bad movie with a few good moments and elements."

        "review_detailed_main": "My expectations for this live-action retelling of the one of anime's/manga's most beloved stories were generally mixxed going into the theater.\n\nBad: Son Goku played by an actor of non-Asian descent and without a martial arts background (as far as I could tell); reports that they wanted this film to be more \"realisitc\" as apposed to the mystical-fantasy realm of the original; and the massive amounts of bad reviews and predictions from critics didn't help either.\n\nGood: Produced by Stephen Chow (the writer/director/star of SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE, classics); directed by James Wong (who gave us the action packed JET LI'S THE ONE); and Chow Yun-Fat starring as Master Roshi (a bit young but hey, it's Chow Yun-Fat!).\n\nWith these \"good\" points, I figured that even if this was a bad film (which most martial arts films are) it would still be enjoyable and relatively faithful to the spirit of the original. What I saw, however, was a film that tried to live up to the original but falling way short of the mark and flat on its face. Not that it wasn't enjoyable, it was...it was that it wasn't Dragonball.\n\nI biggest complaint leaving the theater was that the film felt way too short. I know the director wanted to keep the character's to a minimum to build on characterization, but even with the characters present the story felt rushed with little time to truly enjoy them. The action also felt rushed, especially the final battle between Goku and Piccolo, deminishing the one thing that everyone loves about Dragonball: epic martial art battles. The attempt to make the story more \"realistic\" was more detrimental than anything else in this film.\n\n5 out of 10 for even attempting to make a live action film out of a story that spans hundreds of anime episodes and manga volumes into the length of an hour and a half. Still an interesting \"retelling\" despite its downfalls. Enjoyable but don't expect anything great."

A line in the film is \"I will avenge him\" and it's painfully hollow. I was expecting them to reveal that everybody was robots at the end. The only good actors in the movie are Yun-Chow-Fat, or however you say his name, and James Marsters. By the way, James Marsters- Piccolo- the villain- with the best dialog in the movie- is barely in the film. I mean it. On that subject, there are so many underdeveloped plots in the film. Especially the love subplots. Apparently, all i need to do to get a girl is open her locker for her. And what was up with Yamcha and Bulma? They immediately hit on each other, even after Yamcha traps them in a hole/cave. Next, the effects. Awful. The Oozaru. I'm shocked that that thing got past the editing room. That and those monsters that piccolo sends after the heroes. Oh, I almost forgot to question why, when these people meet each other- they automatically say \"Oh. I've got to help you.\" What the heck is that? On the good side, I enjoyed the last twenty minutes of the movie despite the effects. Like I said, James Marsters and Chow-Yun-Fat are good and Roshi was funny. But, there is just nothing to offer here. The movie's biggest problem is that it's stupid and the jerks at Fox clearly didn't care at all about Dragonball.\n\n4/10\n\nREBOOT PLEASE"

Of course, most people who react are die-hard fans of the original manga.\n\nLook, when I was a kid, I used to read all those Marvel comics, presuming they would be available in my little village in Belgium. On TV I was addicted to all those manga series on the French channels. I am also a die-hard fan! My closet is filled with both comics and manga series.\n\nHere's the thing. Let's take the X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, and God knows what other recent film adaptation, and they're in several cases nowhere near the written holder of the name. Let's get to the manga field, and take Fist of the North Star, with several 'big' names. What was up with the guy playing Kenshiro here? Dragonball Evolution is doing basically the same as movies mentioned above: it takes some elements from the original story, usually elements that cover several years of that story. It tries to make a whole. It fails, as expected (the final fighting scene is indeed terrible), but delivers in some way (the main character had potential).\n\nWhat would be good? Some kid with a tail running around naked, turning into King Kong, fighting childish monsters from the Red Ribbon army? No, you need adolescents, but then you must change the story. The whole idea of the dragon balls has to be introduced, so they integrated it in the change. They try to use the relevant characters from the original: a tech girl, a skilled thief, an old pervert martial arts expert, a dead grandfather, a chick that will hold the love interest of the protagonist, and of course a monster to fight with.\n\nNo, it's not the same as the manga. No, the actors probably didn't all check out what it's all about, which makes them seem sometimes bad. No, the hardcore fans will never be satisfied. But yes, it's entertaining for a clueless crowd, and it can be entertaining for people who keep an open mind. The movie industry is all about commercialization, not so much about tradition. I would take my kids to see this. I'm happy I saw it. I can see myself watching it again.\n\nI'm sorry if many will not agree with this point of view. I didn't expect much, and I got more than I expected. That's a passing grade in my book."

I may be wrong thinking he should be in the movie, but he trained with Goku and Master Roshi.. If anyone could shed light on that it would be much appreciated... And it appears that the director tried to make so much of an Americanized version of this film that he did an almost twilight type dragon ball, which does not belong anywhere in this movie. It was a great cartoon, and even better manga. I have not seen the movie yet, but i will go see it, even if just for reminiscent purposes, I just hope I am not let down.

None of the characters were anywhere close to what they were in the show. Goku wasn't a cocky a-hole. Bulma barely ever fought, and she sure as hell was never in a serious fight. Piccolo was a lone wolf type of character so the fact he had followers is just absurd. Goku grandpa died when he was very young, not when he was 18. Roshi was an up beat kind of guy, not a metaphorically speaking boring old guy. Yamcha was pretty obnoxious on the show, but not that bad, probably the most accurately betrayed personality. But he was also a good fighter so him being completely useless was stupid. The kameamea wave was much more simple, not a bunch of complex hand movements that make him look stupid. Oh and body's don't float in lava. Overall just a terrible movie, definitely the most disappointed I have ever been by a single movie in my life, and I saw Indiana Jones 4 so that's saying something. My least favorite movie of all time, I would rather watch Son of the Mask 10 times in a row than watch this movie."

I am a huge fan of the original series, and I have seen almost everything that came from the universe of Dragon Ball.

The result wasn't incredible, but in the end I found this movie watchable. Of course as the big fan I am, I found it awful. They butchered almost every good thing from the anime. They didn't include Krilin, Picoro was ugly (He was ugly in the series as well, but in a different, positive way) and Goku went to school. It is so loosely based on the original series that they can be considered as two unrelated and independent (Except for names) pieces of work.\n\nIt was so clich\u00e9d filled and the acting was terrible. The product is an extremely forgettable movie for casual goers and insult for fans. But I liked it despite its flaws. Perhaps it is because I never thought of this as a serious Dragon Ball project, therefore I exclude this title from Toriyama's work.\n\nBefore my conclusion I must mention the mighty Kame Hame Ha. What happened to it? It was a pretty decent technique in the series and games. But here is just some laughable thing that only serves to put out some candles, or cure diseases.\n\nI am really picky when it comes to movies, but this one might be the exception.

Either they were pirated, or a LOT of insiders decided to review express copies. The second doesn't seem very likely. Having seen the special effects myself, they look great - on the big screen. The ki attacks looked natural and fluid rather than over-dramatic and lightning-y. The acting wasn't nearly as bad as what I was told either, considering the characters that are being portrayed. In the end, it seems to me it was a load of internet junkies jumping the gun on what might not have even been a final production copy.\n\nMany say the story seemed rushed. It may have been somewhat, but more so to convey story than action. It was more cohesive to a long-time fan than a new-comer, but the point remains. Story and comedy have always been #1 for Dragon Ball, with a close second to action, and that seems to have been forgotten. Adaptations can't always have all of the original elements, as it doesn't work in one media as another. If you don't believe me, look at Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins.\n\nThere is also a notion from many fans of anime that American adaptations are inherently worse. Emotions aren't conveyed as well, action scenes aren't as entertaining or believable, and aren't written as well. The main opinion is that the Japanese are just a master race when it comes to acting and writing, and this usually comes from whiny American kids who don't actually know anything about Japan. To those people I say: READ THE CREDITS. Akira Toriyama, creator and writer of the original Dragon Ball, is the Executive Producer.\n\nIn the end, it just seems like it was never really given a fair chance. Nor was it seen as it was meant to be - in a theater. So if you aren't just going to automatically say it was terrible because you have a preconceived opinion from leaked footage, it's worth a look."

I mean, I actually enjoy most of the movie taking into account that this is not Dragonball Z but an adaptation to Dragonball, which turns to be more for small kids than grown ups. However I must say I was VERY disappointed with the final battle and specially with the Kame-Hame Ha. It wasn't exiting at all, instead was a very rushed ending and many loose endings (that will work like a charm if they make a good sequel).\n\nJustin Chatwin makes a funny Goku, which works for Dragonball (Evolution), however he will have to train REALLY hard as the sequels go by because his character grows up both body and mind while time goes by, so I hope he will be up to the task for the future. Mr. Chatwin, so far so good.\n\nI was kind of bumped about the fact that Piccolo is a very small part of the movie and that he don't really shows us the real menace he is. Instead his appearance is just for a few minutes and a very green Goku is able to defeat him without problems. Piccolo is a bad-ass, c'mon!!!!. You failed on this one. Not your fault though, Mr. Masters.\n\nThe rest of the characters were OK. Bulma, Yamtcha and Roshi did a nice job working together.\n\nWe really needed to see more intense training for Goku in the future films than the really lame air bending training that is showed on Evolution. We need to believe this youngster is going to defend us from Vegeta and the Sayians, so\u0085 GET TO WORK, SCREEWRITERS!.\n\nBy saying that I will give 6.5/10 points given the effort and the relative small budget (50 million) they had to spend.\n\nTo the hardcore fans: The movie is appointed for little kids, so try not to fill the air with negative energy. It's OK for starters. I'm agree on something though: GO HOME JAMES WONG!!!!. This type of franchise (and specially for the story to come) needs a director with (dragon)balls. The Wachovsky maybe?.

Seriously, watching this movie left me in physical pain, that's how bad it was.\n\nLike many, I grew up following Dragonball Z. Actually I had seen Dragonball first but only a few episodes and then it was years before I found DBZ and I was hooked. Sure in hindsight the stories were flimsy and contained more padding than a junior high school student but I was drawn in by characters like Gohan and Krillin as well as the fighting scenes when they did happen.\n\nEnough happy times, time for the plot of this movie. Goku is a young, happy boy living by himself in the woods, he is freakishly strong and has a tail and completely ignorant to the outside world until -- oh I'm sorry, that's actually the original storyline from Akira Toriyama. No, instead we have Goku in high school.\n\nGOKU IN HIGH SCHOOL!? Not even 15 minutes and already this film is ruined but wait, it gets even WORSE! Not only is Goku in high school but Goku is, as one youtube critic put it: \"a whining little crapsack who never smiles.\" Did I also mention that they took away his tail?\n\nThen we have Bulma, played Emma Rossum doing a fantastic impression of a wooden cutout...oh and they also screwed up her character. Yes in the anime she was shallow, cowardly and selfish but you know what, she was actually the most normal character in the anime, aside from being a super-genius that is.\n\nDBE's Bulma seemed more like a Bond-girl reject, a gun toting Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe. Oh and I love how she doesn't have blue hair because the creative \"talents\" thought it would be unrealistic...THE SHOW HAS DINOSAURS, SPACE ALIENS THAT CAN DESTROY PLANETS WITH A FINGER, TALKING ANIMALS, HOUSES COMING FROM CAPSULES AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST MACGUFFIN'S THERE IS AND THEY THINK BULMA HAVING BLUE HAIR IS UNREALISTIC!? And then there's Master Roshi...they just didn't even try to be faithful. Not even a beard, just Chow Yun-Fat waiting for his hopefully massive pay check.\n\nAnd don't me started on Chi-Chi, Yamcha or Piccolo. I'm actually amazed they found a way to make Yamcha's character even more useless than Toriyama did in DBZ.\n\nThis film is awful! Just a complete and utter neutering of a flagship franchise. Yes changes are expected BUT TO BASICALLY GIVE A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER TO WHAT AKIRA TORIYAMA PRODUCED IS UNFORGIVABLE!"

Don't even mention it. It doesn't deserve that. The acting is so bad, its not even funny. The characters are so far away from the original you would have trouble thinking this is even dragon ball. The plot. Oh the plot. Well it doesn't make sense at all. There is nothing from the anime or the manga that resembles this. The dragonballs were created by 7 mystics? Um no. Goku goes to school? No. Goku fights piccolo as a teenager? Not the first time. Goku is in love with chichi? He didn't even know about girls until after his gramps died of natural causes. There is just too much wrong with this movie. I don't usually review movies but this was just so unbelievably bad I had to vent."

Yes there was the fight scene and explosions and I could tell it wasn't going to suit the cartoon that well but to be fair, even fox knows that a movie with blond, giant haired body builders that are constantly on fire throwing each other through buildings isn't going to work.\n\nThe movie itself was a complete let down but the idea had potential. In the hands of someone who actually knew what they were doing this could have been a very good film. Unfortunately for the public, we were stuck with James Wong who got the whole thing completely wrong. Besides doing his own job terribly he allowed other poorly skilled staff to ruin the film. The special effects were horribly unbelievable and the costumes were pretty stupid. I also personally would like to punch the script writer who thought that because it was based on a-let's face it- ever so slightly cheesy cartoon show they could make it as sappy as they wanted.\n\nI'm not saying that Dragonball Evolution is a bad movie altogether. If it was redone by one of the marvel comic movie directors it could be very good but considering how much of an atrocity this movie was I doubt any one would like to go near the idea of a live action version of Dragonball anytime soon"

This sort of drivel should be discouraged by everyone, I implore you to burn every copy you find. Extreme? NO BURN IT.\n\nYet again Hollywood has managed to grasp a decent concept, then suck out all its innards and compose a film with its deflated skin, perhaps we should destroy everything that's good, keep some photos, so that the morons with millions can't get their hands on it. NO Goku doesn't go to some cheesy typical American 'high school', he doesn't get bullied and he certainly doesn't have fights at parties with jocks.\n\nMr Wong, I'm assuming, must be a big fan; 'wtf's going on with this?' I pondered as the film dribbled by, there is almost no resemblance in any of the elements of the film, I know I know its someone else's idea of Dragon Ball but Jesus Christ just don't call it Dragon Ball, that way you don't get the fans using your DVD as Frisbee's and you can keep the 12 year old's you've fooled and convince them to buy the lunch box.\n\nRant over, i just mainly didn't understand why Hollywood feels the need to Americanise absolutely everything, I heard they planned to make a feature film of the classic AKIRA...in New York? WTF. 1. not everyone lives in America 2. if you do, if you go to see a film like Dragon Ball, why would u want it to be in America? 3. Hollywood needs to die, its time"

        "review_detailed_main": "When the first notice was heard that a movie was going to be made based on the DragonBall franchise, everybody started saying things like their childhood was going to be destroyed, that there couldn't be a good movie based on it, that oh my god Gokuh is not Asian, etc.\n\nAnd when the first images and info were leaked, people just couldn't believe their eyes, that Gokuh was on High School when he was supposed to be a child, that he has no tail, that casting was plain wrong, and that Gokuh's hair was a failure if compared to the manga/anime's, therefore movie was faeces.\n\nSeriously, how can ANYBODY dare post a comment like that based on the hair of character of a movie that has no had any kind of official nothing released? (If you don't know what I am talking about, I am talking about the picture of Gokuh with a backpack in a parking lot, the first image leaked)\n\nI am saying this because I have read MANY comments like this, and I don't mean written by any stupid basement dweller blogging around, I have read these on truthful, reliable movie blogs (spanish blogs, I have to say), sources of information that are not supposed to take a side on anything, just inform with a little degree of subjectivity.\n\nAnd yet, people do not stop bashing their heads on the keyboard and see that the original DB manga/anime was not that good. We deem it good because we saw it through a child's eyes, we saw people flying around, shouting, throwing energy balls with their bare hands, GOD (which was a green alien) and those things that fit so well in the real world we live in.\n\nAnyway, there cannot be such a thing as a faithful DB movie. The original manga tells the story of an alien kid with a tail that becomes a huge monkey when full moon shines,rides a cloud and waves a stick that can become longer or shorter at command, is taught martial arts by an old man, has a friend with no nose, a friend who is afraid of women, a flying blue shape-shifting \u00bfcat?, a talking pig, and has to find 7 dragon balls to summon a dragon that will grant him one wish. I have to remind you geeks around the world who hate this movie, that the talking pig asks the dragon for some knickers, and oh my,the dragon gives him those knickers.\n\nNow imagine this on a cinema screen with real people. OH MY GOD it cannot be made, leave my childhood alone. Cluck you. Cinema is a business that can and does earn MILLIONS of dollars basing the scripts of their movies on things that already exist, whether these things are anime, manga, TV series, books, short stories, other movies. So if there can be a DB movie, there will be a DB movie.\n\nThey had to change things from the original, of course they had, everything would have looked plain stupid otherwise.\n\nGokuh is on HighSchool as his son was in high school in DBZ (right before the BuBu saga). And he is older because if you don't have a GOOD script(and I am thinking about AI, by Steven Spielberg) and the main character is a kid, your movie will be FOR kids. Who the cluck wants to see a kid doing stuff anyway?\n\nI have seen all the videos that there are around on the internet, and of course, people complain about action and humor and acting and everything, without regarding the original source, which was and is full of slapstick humor, and they complain about this very fact, arguing that if they change something, they should change it for good, this is, if they try to give it a more familiar and \"adult\" look, they should completely reject humor parts.\n\nI will make a FULL review WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE, I don't have my expectations high because I know EXACTLY what I am going to see, that is, a good dose of action, kicks, energy balls and entertainment. Yes, entertainment. Because entertainment is what the movies are for.\n\nAnd to finish, I have to say I grew up watching Dragon Ball and DBZ, and I was a really big fan, but hey, I grew out of it. I didn't like at all the first DB, I preferred DBZ much much better. And for those people that say that the final confrontation in the movie should be like the one between Neo and Agent Smith on MAtrix Revolutions...I simply have to say that in the Manga Gokuh cannot fly YET, mostly because he has not trained enough (why would he move around on a cloud if he could fly?). And I don't think that in the introduction movie of a saga (oh yes, I do hope they do more, usually sequels of \"hero\" movies are better than the first installments, suck on that) the main character will learn how to pull Kame Hame's, fly and fight, since all these three things are supposed to take a little training."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dragonball Evolution attempts to bring the cartoony and over-the-top martial arts/fantasy/sci-fi manga to the big screen. Mostly the transition has been handled well. The film takes considerable liberties with the source material but considering the over-all length of the original manga this is to be expected and the changes work on their own.\n\nCharacters are given adequate introductions and the film also features plenty of comedy to even out the fighting and action. However, the film suffers from scenes rushing by way too quickly and the villains for one are not given many character moments. It really feels like the film makers could have taken the time and textured the film's plot better before the inevitable CG-heavy final fight sequence which was thankfully handled very well.\n\nDespite some rather sharp contrasts with the original characters' appearances all the actors seem to fit their roles well, especially Justin Chatwin who is finally allowed to channel the bad ass towards the end of the film. The only character whose transition wasn't perhaps done as well as I hoped was Shen Long who pops up only near the very end.\n\nBetween the comedy and action, the inherent entertainment value of the piece Dragonball Evolution is well done adaptation of the world famous manga. If the sequel ever materializes I hope they take time to work on the film's pacing rather than just slapping on some more characters from the manga."

It could have been somewhat better, feature one or two elements of the anime, pleasing one or the other kid. It could have been making money, encouraging the producers to do sequels and so on. But now we have the chance, that somewhere in the future someone will come along and do a reboot. And that one will probably be an interesting piece as it will really need to deliver. Maybe the producers will even hire a good director. Let's look forward to that and just not talk about this ever again.\n\n0/10"
