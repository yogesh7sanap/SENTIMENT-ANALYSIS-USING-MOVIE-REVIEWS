        "review_detailed_main": "The movie concerns a hapless chauffeur called Tong (Jackie Chan) who hiding himself from a secret agent (Jason Isaacs) wears his special gadget-laden tuxedo with extraordinary powers . This discovery thrusts Tong into world of international espionage and intrigue and pairs him with an inexperienced colleague . As Jackie Chan and another agent (Jennifer Lowe Hewitt) will have to take on a villain who's wanting to rule over the world .\n\nFrom start to finish humor and action-packed is interminable . In the film there are intrigue , tongue in cheek , pursuits , frenetic action and includes lots of fun . The movie didn't fail at the box office and neither was a real success .\n\nAction carried out by Jackie Chan was realized by means of specials effects to difference other films in which he made his own stunts . Jennifer Hewitt is pretty gorgeous making with Jackie Chan a type of \u00a8Buddy movie\u00a8 film . Final confrontation between starring and the baddies is breathtaking and astounding . The picture will appeal to Jackie Chan fans.\n\nRating : 5,5/10 nice and entertaining ."

The premise was childish and at times i found myself cringing with embarrassment which is unheard of im a huge jackie fan and have been since battle creek brawl. Lets face it it doesnt take much to please us rush hour 1 and 2 shanghai noon mr nice guy etc have been fantastic. just put jackie in lots of imaginitive fight scenes with a comedy sidekick or indeed police story just imaginitive fight scenes. But with the tuxedo a lot of the fight scenes have been matrixed up and are cgi'd which we dont expect from jackie. the actual plot was like something from the english school film foundation. Lets hope shanghai knights and highbinders are better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the numerous failures Jackie Chan had in trying to break into Hollywood, and now that he has, it still seems that he never quite learnt the moral of is conquest. Simply put, this was equal, nay I correct myself, can be classed below some of his other failures in terms of quality. But fortunately he has become a big enough star for the film to be pulled off - but only just\n\nI won't try to sum up the plot, partly because it's be done by others already, and partly because it is so disjointed and skewed that it struggles to make any sense. Frankly, the intelligence level of the characters appeared to be equivalent to that of a carrot, and indeed the writers seemed to share that intelligence. Even Saturday morning kids cartoons (including Jackie's own) have much greater knowledge than this!\n\nAfter the success of the Rush Hour films, and Shanghai Noon/Knights, this film was a sheer disappointment. I love seeing Jackie Chan as part of a double act in his English language films, but The Tuxedo shows he can't quite pull it off alone. Jennifer Love Hewitt appeared as simple window dressing for Chan, and despite the miniscule amount of chemistry that did appear (better than none), Chan looked desperate in trying to pull of his one-liners.\n\nIt is hard to understand how the script left the storyboard as it did. The plot isn't the worst in the world, but the way the film was constructed left very little artistic and entertainment value. It was almost too rushed. And written without Jackie Chan in mind, I feel. It's too formulaic, too 'let's make a quick buck'.\n\nI am a devoted Jackie Chan fan and one of my life's joys was the fortune to meet him and to organise his appearance at Oxford University in 2000. It's hard for a fan to criticise his hero, but sometimes he must, especially when, as in this case, his loyal fans pay money only to be disappointed.\n\nThe Tuxedo has to be one of Jackie's lowlights. I very much hope that the man can continue to work on good scripts such as Rush Hour and leave behind the non-comical, formulaic scripts such as the Tuxedo that seem to have been written while on the toilet seat.\n\nSorry Jackie, but one I have to advise to avoid."

And when Jackie has to use a stunt double you know something is wrong. The slapstick humor is so and so and the action is... well not good. If i were to say something about Jackie Chan, i would say. Watch his old movies before he came to Hollywood because they are sooooooo much better. The story is of course ludicrous and is about a crazy rich man who wants to pollute the water supply for the entire us, except of course his water supply. Silly silly silly if you ask me, but then again, these movie build on action and not story. All in all if you are a Jackie Chan fan i would see it if you don't have anything else to do, but don't expect much, or anything for that matter. I rate this movie 4/10"

Not great cinema. All action movies are that way; this is funny because of the low-key irony.\n\nEven Jennifer Love Hewitt seems deliberately miscast, but hilarious as she vacillates between superintelligent nerd, ditz, valley girl and superheroine.\n\nWe prefer this to Austin Powers with its completely over-the-top, zero subtlety. Here the sexual innuendo would not be missed by a teenager, but would go right over the head of kids, making it a film any age could enjoy. But you have to want to laugh, not critique."

And it has Jackie Chan style humor that goes with it.\n\nWhen this movie was made Jennifer Hewitt was still a relative unknown, and it seemed odd that she was Jackie Chan's sidekick. She kind of lacked the softness or sexiness of a woman at the time, and didn't soften the touch of the team. But now she's well known, and it's much easier to pick out her signature style of being the \"Brain\".\n\nIt's amazing to see Jackie Chan mimicking the move that's supposedly the work of the \"Tuxedo\". Human Jackie Chan is making the tuxedo look like it's making the human Jackie Chan move like super human.\n\nMaybe teaming Jennifer Hewitt with Jackie Chan was bit experimental at the time, but after a decade, I can see how beautifully this movie is made, and how interesting the action is with Jackie and Jennifer as a team."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is occasionally funny if you don't get bogged down in trying to figure out the plot holes. Jennifer Love Hewitt is attractive and charming, but absolutely nothing her character does makes sense. Is she a secret agent, a secret double agent, or a secret triple agent? Does she have a sly sense of humor or is she merely tolerating someone else's sexist humor? Is she a skilled martial combatant or an incredible lucky newbie? The script never makes any of this clear. It's like this movie was written to make her look stupid (attractive, but stupid).\n\nJackie Chan's moves are entertaining, but as an action flick this is probably one of his worst. The problem is that in the story he's wearing a near-magical tuxedo that gives him superhuman powers. Instead of knowing that everything you see is Jackie busting his butt doing his own stunts, you're watching special effects ginned up with wires, blue screen, and computer enhancement. It's more like watching a Superman movie than a Jackie Chan flick.\n\nOverall I'd give this movie a 3/10. Watching it is better than doing nothing for 90 minutes, as long as you're not paying much for the privilege."

Jackie is an amazing man, with the stunts he can do at his age.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer Love Hewitt is easy on the eyes, especially showing us her body, but her character in here is pretty lame. The whole movie is pretty brainless but if you don't care and just want some laughs and be entertained, this serves its purpose. It's certainly a fast-moving 99 minutes and there's nothing wrong with that."

When you have made as many movies as JLH and Jackie Chan, not every film you have starred in will appeal to every critic, but this may be just the right kind of film for you. One other point- Many of the reviews I have read say something like \"This film is terrible, I'd rather watch Sin City, or We Were Soldiers,\" and while I like these movies myself, you need to remember that there are parents with young children who may struggle to find a film they are happy to show their children, and this movie may be more suitable for younger viewers, while still amusing parents.

Finally, with The Tuxedo Jackie hits rock bottom. Hollywood has finally dragged Jackie down to their level.\n\nI see that a lot of screenwriting hacks got fat paychecks on this unwatchable garbage. And some \"director\" by the name of Kevin Donahue (I think that's what it said) helmed this mess. I checked out his pic - the usual I've got long hair at 40, probably very good in the room - white male that gets to make money in Hollywood. I'm sure his Dad or best friend got him the job. Because it certainly wasn't his talent. He has none!!!!\n\nThis was the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. And I don't have high expectations any more. Using my usual yardstick of Dude, Where's My Car as a 5 (I only looked at my watch once when I saw it in the theater) The Tuxedo gets a 1. My friend who paid for us to see this movie apologized afterwards for dragging me to see it. (One of her friends was in it.) I think that's all you really need to know - the person who paid for the tickets apologized after the film!\n\nDon't pass go, don't see this flick, don't rent this flick, and tell others to STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!"

Maybe this is a warning to Jackie: stop making films where CGI and wires are needed. If you can't do it, then don't. While it did have some potential, the antagonist just didn't seem bad enough, kind of like Jonathan Price in Tomorrow Never Dies. Sad, and I thought that whole Jennifer Love Hewitt dynamic might aid the film."

Now being a spy isn't a easy job, you got to be fearless. No problem. But clueless, that's a problem. When the man he's chauffeuring is out of action, he steps up to the plate and takes his place. His partner Del Blaine(Jennifer Love Hewitt) has some type of issues in her. Very uptight, and so unwilling to open up, Jimmy Tong(Chan) does his little magic on her. The scenes are fantastic. The fight scenes are classic, and one when he encounters \"The Godfather of Soul\". Yep, it's James Brown! It's funny when he tells Tong to \"enjoy the show\". His suit takes him out accidentally. And the suit helped him do the moves J.B. does. I know that Jackie Chan is a little shy about his dance moves, but James Brown is a demanding individual. He wants the dance moves to be perfect. Of course when they did their scene together, J.B. says, \"You're fast, but I'm faster!\" In dancing yes, but martial arts? I don't think so! In real life J.B. did meet his match in the show business, but he's not jealous of J.C. Everyone in the movie deserve their spot in recognition. Jennifer Love Hewitt can kick butt too. Ever since \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", she was tough. In \"The Tuxedo\" she kicked it up a notch. Great movie! 2.5 out of 5 stars!"

I should have learned already not to assume anything about a Jackie Chan movie that I have not yet seen.\n\nJackie plays Jimmy Tong, a lowly chauffeur for millionaire and apparently world famous spy Clark Devlin. I always thought that if someone was a world famous spy, then they aren't doing their job properly. Then again, I always thought Jackie Chan always played action heroes who didn't need the help of some stupid gimmick to kick arse. When Devlin ends up hospital, Tong dons the super tuxedo of death and gets to work on stopping from a water dealing super villain and said villain's mad scientists.\n\nI thought 'The Tuxedo' was meant to be a kids movie, but it seemed a little to adult to be a kids movies. Then again, it comes complete with kiddie violence. Few people would expect a good story from Jackie Chan, but what we do want is a solid action movie. All we have here is a movie obsessed with wires and CGI, and a lacklustre plot. I know Jackie is getting older, but 'New Police Story' had a fair share of wire work, and it managed to be entertaining. 'The Tuxedo' in unimpressive and not very exciting at all.\n\nHowever, for all I've complained, 'The Tuxedo' has a few funny moments. The scene involving James Brown and Jackie Chan as the 'Emperor of Soul' being a highlight of the movie, even though is supposed to be some sort of action comedy...\n\n'The Tuxedo' is not as entertaining as it looks. It has its moments, but not the sort of movie die hard Jackie Chan fans should watch if they have anything better to watch - 4/10"

Without his acting ability his early movies would have been indistinguishable from any of a hundred other kung fu movies from the same era and he probably would have retired long ago.\n\nNo, this movie isn't exactly the same as his others. Jackie's stunts are now assisted by technology a little bit, but it really is just a little bit. It's not like Matrix Reloaded or Blade II where once the action gets a little hectic the actors are just replaced by CG models.\n\nLet Jackie act a little bit.

There were a few good action scenes in The Tuxedo and some humor as well but maybe this movie could of used some better dialogue script in it. This movie does also come as just another Jackie Chan type clone of a film where he does about the same stunts he does in all his other movies."

If you love Jackie as I do, and put \"Shanghai Noon\" as one of the favourites then you will be disapointed. The movie lacks actually everything. The chemistry between Jackie, and Love H. is really not there, he seems for the first time a little bit un-interested, and the plot is really not good. This movie is probably a must see for fans of \"Spy Kids\", but for us \"older\" Jackie fans I will wait for the coming Shanghai Knights. Owen Wilson and Jackie made Shanghai Noon a success based on a funny plot, and an AMAZING chemistry between them.\n\nJackie you rock, but you can do better than this - it's not the amount of movies but the originality and fun that we are used to you delivering that makes your movies so special!\n\n:) M"

So I have a certain tolerance for films like \"Rumble in the Bronx\" that have no plot or character depth whatsoever, as long as there's plenty of action and some comedy.\n\nUnfortunately, The Tuxedo stretches the genre in new ways, and I do not mean in the good direction. The gimmicks in the \"secret agent tuxedo\" aren't used in a clever manner and there's very little tension. The physical comedy just didn't work for me, and there were a few stupid character reactions (Jennifer Love-Hewitt) straight out of the cheesy Disney flicks of the 1970s, you know where the badguys get soaked with a vat of milk and somehow that defeats them even though they have guns. While there are a few action scenes of merit, overall the film was slow-paced and... I'm forced to say it... just not really worth watching. It just lacked the \"cult appeal\" that bad films have to have to turn bad into good.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- action movie fans, but only on a rainy day and only if you feel obligated to\n\n-- members of the American secret service who somehow have a British accent\n\nIt means a great deal that a Jackie Chan fanatic like me would give this movie only a 5 out of 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "Every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man, right? So that's why Jennifer Love Hewitt works with him. Or could it be that Jackie Chan was in an amourous mood during casting?\n\nAnyway, Chan plays Jimmy Tong, a cab driver. He gets a job offer to chauffer a rich multi-zillionaire (Jason Issacs). When the car gets bombed by a skateboard (it's actually pretty funny), Jimmy's OK, but his employer is in the hospital. He puts on his superior's suit and he can do crazy stunts. Take it off and he's a bumbling nothing.\n\nThen there's this whole scheme about poisioning water and the like (it's a clever jab at the bottled water craze) and Hewitt helps Jimmy solve the case. Believe me folks, it's not as bad as it sounds.\n\nIn fact, it was pretty good. Chan's stunts were the best from any of his movies and more outrageous than the Rush Hours, for sure. If he still did all his own stunts, then I salute him. They sure were a notch above his previous comedies. The humor, though not always high-brow, didn't stoop to levels like Austin Powers and such. Most of the humor was slapstick and pratfall, but it wasn't fish-out-of-water like Rush Hour.\n\nThe plot had enough complications for an action-comedy (maybe a few too many), but it left you feeling satisfied. Actually, the first words out of my mouth after viewing were \"That was a pleasant diversion\", which it was. Though impossibly not true to life, it created an alternate world, so to speak, where the good guys always win and the action is fun. Something that was odd about this movie is, although predictable, it had my heart going a few extra beats a minute during the ending fight sequence.\n\nEnjoyably fun and funny, The Tuxedo is one movie that you may not remember in two years, but you won't be able to put on a tux without trying some of Chan's crazy stunts.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nRated PG-13 for action violence."

The dialogue in this movie is fast and smart, and an executive of any production company, from the smallest Acme or DCJ Production company right up to MGM or Miramax, would be absolutely thrilled to see it land on his desk.\n\nAll these elements together form a film which is strong enough, funny enough, and smart enough to be the end-of-summer blockbuster we've been waiting for.

Chan clearly didn't take his role too seriously, but was just having fun with his character, showing off a dozen martial arts moves.\n\nIt's not an action masterpiece, but a popcorn-fun film with a touch of thrills and sci-fi.\n\nGrade B-"

I have always enjoyed watching Jackie Chan on screen- but this film (can it even be called a film?) is not worth your time. The Idea of putting on a computerized tux is a little cool no doubt, and if JLH's character's head was a little closer to earth, (not to mention being played by someone else) this movie could have at least been rated as mediocre. This movie is a waste of time. Never have I hated a movie more than the tuxedo. Movies that are actually worth watching would include: We Were Soldiers, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Braveheart, The Transporter, The Italian Job, Any one of The Matrix movies, Gone In 60 Seconds, Mr Deeds, Anger Management, any Harry Potter Movie, The Lord of the Rings movies, Second Hand Lions, Saving Private Ryan, Memphis Belle, and even Finding Nemo.

Jimmy transports a mysterious woman one day, who ends up recruiting him to be a personal chauffer for millionaire playboy Dean Devlin. There's only one catch. Never touch the playboy's prized tuxedo. But after some baddies make an attempted hit on his boss, Jimmy Chang has only one choice: to wear the tuxedo until Devlin is out of the hospital.\n\nOf course, this goes on to develop into a spy story, in which an annoying Jennifer Love Hewitt mistakes Chang for Devlin. And then, throughout the rest of the movie, the two go around doing funny things, including accidentally knocking out James Brown (guess who goes on stage instead of Brown?).\n\n`The Tuxedo' is surprising in a few ways. First of all, two things in the plot I didn't expect. One, I thought that it would be a typical comedy where a butler-type ends up touching his employer's prized object, and at the end of the film the employer finds out and blows the butler's cover. You know what I mean. Instead, in `The Tuxedo,' Chan's character is supposed to touch the tuxedo. His boss tells him to before being escorted to the hospital. Also, the ending is a bit\u0085well\u0085odd. Not what I'd expected. It breaks away from the typical guy-gets-girl ending.\n\nUnfortunately, the film also has many flaws. Perhaps its biggest is the fact that they use special effects on Jackie Chan. Who would ever want to do that?! The whole point of Chan film is that he does his own stunts! Maybe he does some of his own stunts in this film, but the majority of them are computer generated.\n\nAlso, casting Jennifer Love Hewitt was a mistake. Talk about bad acting\u0085whoa\u0085\n\nMaybe another one of `The Tuxedo's' major flaws is that it never knows whether to be a satire on James Bond films, or the next Matrix. The movie has no sense of stability. It's like a pack of playing cards stacked into a pyramid. Sooner or later, after you build up too much on a small base, it's just going to fall over because you have the base put together sloppily and it has been ignored.\n\nAlso, the film tries to go for juvenile jokes at many times. The very beginning opens up with a crude joke. Now, I don't mean crude as in `Shrek'-crude. I mean just plain dumb and juvenile. I worried when the first `joke' received laughter from children in the audience. Yet, later in the film, they go for sexually suggestive laughs. Even most of the laughs are unstable.\n\nAnd then there's the action in the film. It mixes between WB Looney Toons to `The Matrix.' Like the roots of the film, the action is unstable. I didn't know whether they wanted us to laugh at the action or feel a sense of suspense, especially the climax.\n\nOverall, I can't say `The Tuxedo' was disappointing, because I had already read many bad reviews on it. I wasn't expecting something excellent or satirical. So, with that in mind, believe it or not, I recommend this film. Perhaps it is because there are some good moments \u0096 enough to watch for, even if the bad moments negative the good moments overall. Not great by any means, but worth seeing once, especially if you're a Jackie fan.\n\n2.5/5 stars"

It is sad...\n\nChan needs to really read these scripts. His acting is horrid, especially the wrap-around with the girl in the art gallery...puke...And what's with every car having a license plate with no state on it...was the production too cheap to get fake New York plates...these filmmakers should take note that it is the little details that take the audience out of the story."

The reason I went to see this is simple. I really like Jackie Chan. No matter what you say about his American movies, like Rush Hour etc, he is always amazing to watch. Not so here. The producers decided to make it a little 'sci-fi' which doesn't work. Most of Chan's stunts are not all his own doing. You can 'see' the rope/string work throughout the entire movie. Wait...did I say 'entire' movie? What I MEANT to say is the approximately 6 minute of the movies where there is ANY action. The rest of it, which encompasses the dire script, is absolutely horrific. The dialogue is mind-numbing, and most of it is spoken by the highly irritating Jennifer Love Hewitt, doing what she does..er..best. Oh, and it's not funny, although the director probably thinks you should be laughing.\n\nStay away from this movie. My wife and I were sorely tempted to leave, but didn't only on the basis that we had paid. That's a very sad reason for staying."

I just got it as a Christmas gift on DVD and I wanted to share my thoughts about it: man, does this movie really rot! It's a toss up as to whether this is Jackie Chan's worst Hollywood film or \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" This must be slightly better because they gave Jackie the money to make the other one after this. I don't think he'll get buckets of money after \"Around the World.\" There is no chemistry at all between Jackie and Jennifer Love Hewitt. I was so disappointed because Jackie and Jennifer are among my two favorite actors and I got absolutely no feeling at all off the screen from either of them. The action sequences are good enough but the comedy falls flat and the story is only mildly interesting. If you catch this on free cable you might want to watch if you are a fan of Jackie of Jennifer but please don't spend a penny to buy it."

A special tuxedo that gives superpowers? Jennifer Love Hewitt with Jackie Chan? The whole bizarre plot point about water? Notice that reviews here never mention anything about the plot because it's impossible to summarize. It made no sense whatsoever.\n\nTo think I was in Paris and I was stuck watching this laughably awful film."

        "review_detailed_main": "While people might be complaining that Jackie had technical help in doing the stunts, you must remember he's getting older and working in the Hollywood system. Also, he did virtually all of the stunts here, the tuxedo was used to allow to him to do NEW things, not just a rehash of the choreographed fight scenes he's done in previous movies. I think this was a good idea. Although at times it may have appeared silly, it was fun to watch. Think of this, no one complains when they see obvious fake stuff in matrix or other movies, why should people do that here then?\n\nThe Tuxedo allowed Jackie also to stretch his acting and do things that would not have been LOGICALLY possible without it. For one, the very entertaining scene where he imitates James Brown, doing the foot moves and shaking his ass was one of the FUNNIEST scenes of the movie; something he wouldn't have been able to have done without the pretext of the Tuxedo. Also, his play with the sword was all him---filmed at higher speed, but all him.\n\nIn conclusion, before I had seen this movie I had read the reviews and thought it was going to be a lousy movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I was laughing a lot(he does Action Comedy people, not just action) and enjoyed the fight scenes he did. However, I think Jackie was trying to show off more of his creative and acting side here.\n\nI give this movie a 7, and wholeheartedly recommend any J.C. fans to see it. Also, anybody who likes vaudeville type humor will enjoy this too. Jackie is a cross between Jerry Lewis, Gene Kelly, and Bruce Lee."

You can't expect too much from Jackie, given that he's still learning English, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, while having improved a bit, still needs to study up on how to become a cinema star. Rent this maybe. You're much better off renting an older Jackie Chan import such as Drunken Master."

After Devlin is incapacitated by an attempt on his life Jimmy takes ends up in possession of Devlin's Tuxedo assuming his identity to undertake his mission and find out who ordered his assassination.\n\nThe premise unfortunately does not lend itself to Chan's strengths. The humor does not mesh well with Chan's style and feels more like it was written in mind for Jim Carrey or Ben Stiller. Some rather groan worthy gags include a spy counter sign involving the words \"nice rack\" that leads to predictable results and several pitiful pratfalls from love interest/co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt who has absolutely no chemistry with Chan and their scenes feel awkward and bring the film to a complete standstill.\n\nWorse still is the action sequences which aside from a sequence where Chan trashes a bedroom by turning on the Tuxedo's \"demolition\" mode(just go with it) most of the stunts use over done wirework and CGI that feels overdone and lacking in tension or impact.\n\nThe Tuxedo is a mediocre spy comedy that just happens to have Jackie Chan in it. Even if you're a Jackie Chan competitionist this will still feel like a waste as there's none of what Chan is typically known for and instead has overproduced set pieces, limp gags, and a general waste of everyone's time."

Don't get me wrong, I think she's a talented actress, but she seems completely unbelievable as a sophisticated character. We come to Jackie Chan movies to see his comedy and most of all his martial arts and spectacular stunts. He seems completely subdued in this movie, not so much verbally, but physically. He had some great lines that actually made me burst into laughter. But I didn't get to see any high speed adrenaline soaked fight scenes and worst of all, they used aids (wires, sfx, etc) to assist him. Very\n\n\"un-Chanlike\". Anyway, I can't recommend this movie. You don't see the real Jackie Chan and Love Hewitt is painfully mis-cast. Use your 9 dollars on something else."

Love by any means, i found myself loving her in this film. her character is a wise-cracking agent just trying not to screw up her first assignment. and while she sometimes comes off as bitchy and mean, the kind of girl that would be more than happy to offer up that slap in the face i was referring to earlier, you can't help but fall for her. deep down, you gotta love that little girl inside trying to make good in the face of her seemingly insane partner, played by Jackie Chan. Jackie's not half bad as Jimmy Tong, a guy without the kick-ass skills Chan is known for possessing. it's a nice change for him, and his chemistry with Jennifer Love Hewitt is just the kind of friendly banter that the film calls for. but the acting can't save the story from falling on it's face as hard and often as Chan's character is forced to. the tiresome water plot nearly dehydrates the rest of the film and leaves one looking to Chan and Love Hewitt's banter for a little refreshment."

For a comedy it has an awful few laughs and comical situations in it, so it's hard to tell what for a kind of movie the makers exactly tried to create here. Also the script is terribly lacking. The movie lacks a clear main plot line and has a silly villainous plot in it that's just way too ridicules, even for a movie like this one. On top of that, the main villain is hardly ever used in the movie and the movie mainly focus and Jackie Chan and his antics. Fans of Chan will also be disappointed by this, he hardly gets to show anything cool and is unfortunately given more dialog as fight sequences.\n\nNot even the presence of Jason Isaacs and Peter Stormare is enough to save this movie from being a disaster. Jason Isaacs is given a very bland role and not even he with his great charisma can prevent his character from being dull and totally uninteresting. Yes, Peter Stormare does play a good and fun role but one good role isn't of course enough to carry and save an entire movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt was also horrible in her role. I like her but she isn't much of a comical talent.\n\nNo way I'm ever watching this movie again.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

It makes me think that the negative comments were written by people working for the opposition. I AM amazed at the decision to cut the majority of the deleted scenes (I won't spoil it by telling you which). Get the DVD and enjoy the whole event over and over. For my tastes, it will be a default movie... one I will look forward to watching frequently."

I can't believe how many of you think she was funny. She was in over her head. One last thing before I go: a \"popcorn movie\" is not the same as a \"mindless movie\".

Still, he does get a good high energy fight scene or two. Also, the jokes are semi-funny, and there's even a little chemistry with Jennifer Love Hewitt since Jackie's character sort of has a personality in this film (shy guy).\n\nBut I can't help hope that films like The Tuxedo (or the even worse Shanghai Noon) don't become Jackie's new line of work.

The storytelling on the whole is incredibly clunky complete with cardboard cut-outs for characters, poor dialogue, stunts that suffer from a lack of energy and unnecessary(not to mention sloppy) CGI effects that miss the point of everything Chan stands for. The film is badly paced, with a lot of rushed and slow spots that dispand from any more believability the film could have had, and the direction is bland. While Chan and Issacs are good, Jennifer Love-Hewitt is terrible. She in general is not a great actress but she is one with warmth and endearment, but with such a poorly written and undercooked role she tries way too hard.\n\nOverall, not Chan's worst, but rather weak. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Tuxedo (2002)' is a pseudo pastiche of the spy genre, an action-comedy starring everyone's favourite acting stunt-man, Jackie Chan. As is typical for the star's American work, the fight sequences and stunt-work feel heavily neutered, chopped up and enhanced with special-effects. However, this picture doesn't make a complete hash of things when it comes to its action. It's much better than a lot of its counterparts, actually. Still, the thing has its focus first and foremost on its comedy, which is where most of its value resides. There aren't any belly laughs but some of it provokes a chuckle and it's a generally enjoyable time. Chan is as affable as always and the supporting cast do a good job with the relatively hammy material they're given. The film is, by no means, mandatory viewing. It arguably doesn't even reach its own potential; its potent central concept is only explored on a cursory level. However, it's a fun and fast-paced flick that ought to keep you entertained throughout. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, personally I've been a Jackie Chan fan since Rumble in the Bronx, but my appreciation goes back to even his early work, with my favourite movie of his being Armour of God 2(US Title).\n\nThis movie disappoints the deeper Jackie Chan action hero fans because of the obvious wirework throughout all but the beginning of the flick. Of course, there's a reason for this, and if we saw Pierce Brosnan doing the same stunts, no one would think twice about the wirework. But this is Jackie Chan! His reputation proceeds from his past and fails to do justice with the Tuxedo.\n\nYes, it's a James Bond device, yes, it allows him to do super human things, but if you're going to see the fight scenes that made and continue to make his legend (such as the end fight scene in Armor of God 2, or the chaotic fight scenes with Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, or the free for all with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao in Dragons Forever in the Cocaine factory [personal fav]) failed to materialize here. Tuxedo or not, only once do you see any insight into his fighting improvisational style, and even then the prop was on wires.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt, nice to look at, didn't have to stretch much for this role. Playing the dour role of Del, she didn't get to show much acting skill at all, as the character was fairly one dimensional. Eye Candy.\n\nIn my summation of this movie, this is a Jet Li style action flick with Jackie Chan instead of the wire-fu veteran Jet Li, mainly because no one else is close to Charlie Chaplain or Buster Keaton as is Jackie. Go to see it for his impeccable timing and Keaton-esque ability."

Instead we're treated to a film that is laughable, not because it's a good comedy, but because it is such an unbelievably bad one.\n\nFirstly the humour of the film is just too childish to contemplate. This comes from the fact that the whole plot is barely clinging to credibility even for crazy comedies. Instead of being farcical, the film turns into a farce every time someone kicks Jackie in the crotch or Jack kicks someone else in the crotch. The sexual innuendo is redundant and tiresome to listen to.\n\nEven Jackie comes off as a total ass for much of the film, rather than a lovable or even a vaguely sympathetic character. Additionally the film's CGI is shamefully bad and shows how much devotion the crew actually had for the film.\n\nAll in all The Tuxedo is an utterly miserable piece of cinema. Lesson learned, never watch a spy/comedy-film that opens to a deer pissing."

There were 3 or 4 times when I chuckled at the juvenile storyline. The biggest problem with the movie is that the storyline (even though it's juvenile) is extremely hard to follow. The segues are abrupt and there's nothing to link what just happened with what is currently happening.\n\nThe only good thing about the movie is that Jennifer Love Hewett looks ravishing in most every scene she appears in."

        "review_detailed_main": "This spy comedy is centred on Jimmy Tong, a shy taxi driver, who finds himself recruited to drive billionaire super-spy Clark Devlin. Devlin is investigating Dietrich Banning, the owner of a bottled water company who is suspected of plotting to make sure only his water is drinkable. When Devlin is hospitalised Jimmy ends up taking his place. He dons Devlin's tuxedo and discovers it is no ordinary piece of clothing; it is programmable to make its wearer a super-spy with all the skills that entails... and a few more besides. Jimmy works with Del Blaine, a female agent on her first mission in the field who mistakes him for Devlin and can't understand how the man she is working with got his great reputation. Still they must work together to thwart Banning's dastardly plan.\n\nIf you come into this hoping for lots of Jackie Chan's trademark brilliantly choreographed martial arts you may be somewhat disappointed as most of his action is clearly CGI-improved to show that it is the suit fighting not him... however there is more to Jackie Chan than martial arts; he has great comic abilities without ever feeling forced and this film takes advantage of that. The concept is clearly very silly but thankfully it provides plenty of good laughs as it spoofs the genre without going too far. Jennifer Love Hewitt is solid in the more 'straight guy' role of Del Blaine and Jason Isaacs is good as the real Devlin, even if his role is relatively small. The villains plot is clearly preposterous but it fits in with the silliness of the film; pity the villain wasn't a little more menacing thought. There isn't much to cause offence so this is probably suitable for younger viewers. Overall I enjoyed this; one has to be in the mood for silliness though."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first scene of \"The Tuxedo\" has a fawn standing in a stream. A nice, gentle opening... and then the creature urinates in the stream to usher in the opening credits. As Jennifer Love Hewitt's character says later on, \"That passes for humour around here.\"\n\nIn fairness, the movie isn't quite as crude all the way through, but this action-comedy-spy caper really needs some alterations as far as its script (by the Michaels Leeson and J. Wilson) and direction (Kevin Donovan) are concerned - the story of NY cab driver Jackie Chan getting recruited as a superspy's chauffeur, acquiring his boss's specially engineered tuxedo when the man himself is incapacitated, and joining forces with equally amateurish but eager young spy Jennifer Love Hewitt to get to the bottom of a fellow agent's death could have been a treat if the writing had been better. And if there had been a director who knew how to handle action and comedy; Chan's breakneck drive through the streets of New York and a car/skateboard chase are particularly poorly done.\n\nThe movie does improve as it goes along, with Chan making you believe his character (who's hopeless at martial arts) really is being manipulated by the tux, especially in the \"Pants Only\" scene - this movie does give him more special effects help than any of his other ones, but given that the plot involves people dying of dehydration and a swarm of insects it's forgivable; plus while he's not as old as Charles Bronson (who was still doing action movies for Cannon in his 70s, let us not forget) he can be forgiven for wanting to lighten the load a bit. Jason Isaacs is entertaining as the real superspy, andas our hero's partner JLH is fun and as appealing as ever - she's come in for some flak in other comments here and elsewhere, but she does all right; I think we should all thank heaven we got her and not Chris Tucker again. (And not only because he's not as sexy as she is.)\n\nNone of Jackie Chan's Western movies have improved on his Asian ones (including \"Rush Hour\"), and this doesn't change things, but at least \"The Tuxedo\" (unlike \"Shanghai Noon\") isn't overlong, and it doesn't (unlike \"Rush Hour 2\") forget what it's supposed to be... it sets out to be an entertaining movie, and in the end that's what it is. Although that said, I can live happily without any more references to John Travolta in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" (As opposed to any more gratuitous closeups of Jennifer Love Hewitt's body, but that's another matter.)"

If a movie can make me literally laugh out loud, it's a good movie. But this one gets you going on several occasions. The action and adventure portion is non-stop and witty. For example, in one scene, Jimmy Tong is wearing his pants, but not the jacket. The pants spring to action, leading Jimmy to fight with only his legs. You've got to see it to appreciate it.\n\nIt definitely worth the price of admission! 4 1/2 out of 5!!"

But it doesn't stop this film from being entertaining. Just leave the brain at home. JC has never really tried to make Oscar winning movies. He just wants to entertain. So stop panning this movie unless you have something genuine to say. JC is 49 years old this year (still fitter than this 31 year old writer!!), can you really expect him to be putting his body through the same punishment he was 10 or 20 years ago? No, is the simple answer, so what if there's a little camera trickery and CPU effects to enhance the film. JC's just out to make movies and entertain and Tuxedo does what it says on the tin! Lets face it, JC made films in the 70's which totally bombed at the box office, but are now considered classics. So all you negative critics may just be helping make this another classic!!!!!"

The storyline for this picture is absolutely dreadful...so is the acting. Jennifer Love Hewitt was miserable to watch in this film. Almost every scene with her was awkward and painful. The martial arts scenes were also hit or miss. There are a few good fight sequences and funny lines but not enough to make up for how cheesy this movie is.

Knew it would be cheesy af, was not disappointed.\n\nIt's worth it just for the part where a whole team of secret agents blocks off a busy city block and attacks innocent people just to give Jackie Chan a chance to hit on a Chinese girl he thinks is hot. I mean they literally have a guy repel from a building just to knock out a guy biking down the street, and they taze another guy that was gonna block Chan... and that guy is Colin Mockery from Whoes Line is it Anyway. Oh man, so funny... like not in they way they intended for it to be, but better. FYI I wouldn't call that a spolier because it's totally irralavent to the plot, but it shows how goofy this movie is."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I went into the theaters with the excitement, because there was a new Jackie Chan movie. I left the theater somewhat puzzled, because I didn't see a Jackie Chan movie.\n\nThis is not a Jackie Chan movie in the traditional sense. Jackie Chan movies are the great ones such as Police Story, First Strike, The Drunken Master series and Rumble In The Bronx. The Tuxedo is an American 'action' comedy that just so happens to have Chan in it.\n\nAll the stunts were done with wires, and it is very apparent. There is maybe 5-10 minutes of fighting and even then stupid American directing ruins them. Too much editing and cutting, and the camera is too close, so much of the fighting is lost.\n\nJLH did not belong in the movie; she just doesn't fit IN the movie. It was an extremely odd match up. Although she provides the movie's eye candy, I would rather have the good fights and stunts that the typical Jackie Chan movies are known for.\n\nThe story is somewhat weak, there was a weak buildup of what was supposed to be a real evil villain.\n\nI left the theater disappointed because I saw a really bad action movie. Maybe Jackie will go make some Chinese movies again so there can be another good Jackie Chan movie. Not this poor substitute.\n\nI can't stress this fact enough; this is not a Jackie Chan movie. This is an American 'Action' Comedy, which happens to star Jackie Chan. Little fighting, no true stunts, lots of wirework, and a poor story. I recommend just renting some of his better movies instead."

Unfortunately, he chose the latter, one of the Jackie's more recent films which I had avoided so far thanks to its being mainstream Hollywood fare aimed at a family audience. Still, I was willing to give it a go since it co-starred Jennifer Love Hewitt, whose looks and magnificent cleavage make even the lamest movies easier to endure.\n\nAs I expected, this film features very little in the way of decent action or story: the plot is awful, the comedy weak, the fight scenes far too reliant on special effects and wire work, and Peter Stormare and Debi Mazar are totally wasted in a throwaway roles. As I had suspected, curvacious Jennifer Love Hewitt is easily the breast thing... err, I mean the best thing about the whole rather sorry affair.\n\nI rate The Tuxedo a miserable 2/10, plus a generous extra pair of points for JLH's extra-generous pair of points."

        "review_detailed_main": "A hard luck cabbie, who just cannot seem to catch a break, named Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is hired to be the limousine driver for top secret super CSA agent/spy extraordinaire Clark Devlin when he impresses another CSA agent named Steena (Debi Mazar) with his fast driving expertise. However, when Devlin winds up gravely injured following an explosion, he asks Jimmy to take over his assignment and tells him to wear his specially equipped tuxedo. This tuxedo as it turns out isn't ordinary in the least. In fact, it's a technological marvel capable of providing its user with whatever skill is desired, whether it be fighting, dancing or gun assembly, just by selecting it from a fancy wrist-watch also included in the outfit. Yes, Jimmy Tong finds himself suddenly thrust into a new world of excitement by assuming the Clark Devlin role. Eventually he is paired up with a new CSA agent out to prove her worth in Del Blaine (Jennifer Love-Hewitt). Together they are to bring down whatever corrupt scheme of world domination one Dietrich Banning (Ritchie Coaster), head of a bottled water empire, may be planning. Only can Jimmy find the confidence within himself to get the job done?\n\nIn many ways, this is something of a poor imitation of the Pink Panther films, only dumbed down even more to appeal to a mass audience with such an emphasis on not offending any sensibility, it likely won't appeal to many in reality. As was done with the Pink Panther films, director Donovan here tries to blend action with comedy with the emphasis being on the physical comedy itself. You would think given the involvement of Jackie Chan, it would be natural fit but this one only offers up disappointment. The fights are uninspired and forgettable with too much wire work. The attempts at humor either fall flat or are outright unfunny or they play things way too safe. Jennifer Love-Hewitt is terribly miscast as the heroine. Not only is she thoroughly unconvincing in her role but her character never comes across as anything but perpetually bitchy. This movie's best scenes actually involve Jackie Chan doing uncharacteristic stuff like dancing and performing on stage and his early cab and limousine driver scenes. The theme of self-confidence could have been used better but here is one of the film's better elements. Jason Issacs brief Bond-like Clark Devlin appearance also proves very entertaining and is much too short-lived. In the end, this just isn't the Jackie Chan or even Jennifer Love-Hewitt fans will want to see."

His action sequences are fun to watch as always, although definitely not his best (see Rush Hour and of course Rumble in the Bronx). The villain is 2 dimensional and doesn't receive much screen time. Love-Hewitt shines in a comedic role, but I found her constant insubordination unbelievable and annoying. That was no fault of hers, she did a great job with the lines she got.\n\nI really liked the tongue-in-cheek comment on bottled water in the title scene. Chan's send-up of James Brown was really well done, although the scene that followed where the pair tried to get information from the bad guys was pretty silly. Kinda ruined it.\n\nWorth a few laughs. If you like Chan or spy movie spoofs, see it in a cheap theatre or rent it."

Jackie's delivery of his own lines is what you'd expect in an English speaking film, but he was still funny. Of course, not as funny as his performance would have been had it been a cantonese speaking film in which his comedic style is, understandably, more natural.\n\nAction-wise, this film is pretty much a dud and leaves the Jackie Chan fan with an urge to rewatch Project A or Armor of God for a dose of the good old days to wash away the sour taste of disappointment. Still, its not as bad as The Medallion.\n\nAnd any film with Bob Balaban in it can't be entirely bad (I'm a big fan of his as well). To be honest though, its not a great film, but its not a terrible one either. It is saved somewhat just by Chan's presence and JLH's performance and some very nice dresses. Probably not worth paying money to see, but if its on tele and you've nothing better to do, its a decent time waster.\n\n6/10"

He's known for getting his clients to there destination with speed, so when a New York high flyer, Steena (Debi Mazar), jumps into his cab, she offers him double the fee if Jimmy can get her to her destination by the time she has finished putting on her make-up. After being thoroughly impressed with his driving, she offers him a job to be a chauffeur for millionaire, Clark Devin (Jason Isaacs), but he has to follow the many rules that Steena has given him. He soon builds a relationship with Clark but there car is targeted by henchmen, who want Clark dead. Jimmy tries his utmost to escape from a remote controlled car, which has a bomb attached to it but Clark gets severely injured in the explosion and ends up hospitalised. Clark gives Jimmy clues about who attempted to murder him but as he is unable to talk properly, Jimmy puts together the clues to try and find the murderer. When he gets back to his house, he goes through his possessions to try and piece the mystery together and he comes across a special Tuxedo, which is controlled by a wrist watch and can give the owner special powers. He then gets a call from a undercover, inexperienced field agent Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who wants to meet up with Clark to talk about a special mission. As she hasn't met Clark before, Jimmy poses as Clark in the special powered Tuxedo to try and take-down an international terrorist, Dietrich Banning (Ritchie Coaster), who plans to take over the world by putting chemicals in water. He then finds out that it was Dietrich who attempted to kill his boss so Jimmy has personal reasons to destroy Dietrich. After going undercover and worming there way into his operation, there cover is blown and they have to fight against Dietrich, who also gets his hands on a powerful Tuxedo. The action wasn't that great and the jokes aren't that funny. Chan makes a bit of a fool of himself by dancing, singing and making the Tuxedo take over his body and I wasn't that impressed with Jennifer Love Hewitt, who also wouldn't stop whining throughout the movie. On the plus side, you can tell that there was a big budget because it does look quite good and the concept was half decent but the comedy did get on my nerves after a while and it became more silly than funny. I did like Jason Isaacs, who would make a brilliant Bond and I found Ritchie Costner a convincing villain but the overall movie could do with a rewrite with some decent actors playing the leads. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: This movie was directed by Kevin Donovan, who has only directed 4 shorts behind the camera. He was lucky to get the chance to work with Jackie Chan, with such a big budget but he failed to make a unique film that will stand the test of time. This movie did make its money back at the box office so it wasn't a total failure but I personally think that people were starting to get a bit fed up with Chan's style of comedy and they just wanted to see the action scenes more than the jokes. His brief Western encounter did bring out some decent movies, like the Rush Hour franchise but I much prefer his earlier, authentic movies which had some unbelievable stunts and epic action scenes.\n\nBudget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $105million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/martial arts/comedies starring Jackie Chan, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jason Isaacs, Debi Mazar, Ritchie Coaster, Peter Stormare and Romany Malco. 3/10"

After the incredible setup that centers around an amazing tuxedo with essentially nanotechnological elements, a first for mainstream cinema, it completely fails to be the really cool science fiction film it could have been. Instead, they made a movie that is run of the mill spy spoof fodder, with dialogue dumbed down and some flashes of Jackie Chan's kung fu genius, but he isn't allowed to really show his chops, and the fight scenes are almost hilariously short. Jennifer Love Hewitt is tolerable if a bit weirdly cast as an agent of the CSA, a parallel intelligence organization that also fails to be all that it could be. She is awfully cute, though even this aspect of her talent is wasted here, reduced to juvenile humor about peeping toms and groping. When a film like this is relying on the hot actress to buddy up with the kung fu legend and the hotness and kung fu are crippled, you get this movie. Probably a great rental if a bunch of people are watching."

But this film has nothing to entertain.\n\nThe action is not well photographed and although the original fight scenes and action set pieces may have been well designed the photography and more importantly doesn't show them to the high standard we have come to expect from a Jackie Chan movie.\n\nThe only thing that I can see is the fact that Jackie must have been offered a fee that was impossible to say no to.\n\nI wouldn't have said that this is a sell out movie but the more Hollywood movies Chan does the more it seems to dilute what has been so far a reasonably good career and cross over from Hong Kong to western mainstream.\n\nLets hope Jackie likes the movie as much as I did and never lowers himself to star in anything this bad again."

My wait kindly rewarded with a spectacular action-comedy picture that as classy as the tuxedo itself. I liked that the actual plot served as an original creation of a cookie-cutter Hollywood. It was also nice that this movie retained a PG rating. Even though, some parents may want to be aware that there are about two scenes which may not be suitable for very young children. But for the most part, this movie is an excitement factory for all ages.\n\nThe lead actor, Jackie Chan, performs another timeless and ageless role handsomely. Along with the trademark martial arts, Jackie Chan's character, Jimmy Tong, was the funniest one I have ever seen him portray as his character offers plenty comedic moments. This role is different than the roles we have become accustomed to seeing Jackie Chan perform. Jimmy Tong was clumsy at times, brilliant at other times, as this reluctant hero becomes just so likable in a equally impressive tuxedo that turns him into a mix between Spiderman and James Bond. After watching this movie, it is no wonder why Jackie Chan is revered by many fans; only he could be suited for this tux.\n\nThe leading lady, the enchanting Jennifer Love Hewitt, takes on her complex character of Del Blaine with incredible talent and succeeded in delivering the array of the character's emotions and thoughts. Del Blaine would also be known to use her established beauty to manoeuvre through many tough times. This performance by this great actress proves how terrific an actress JLH is yet been seen for by many incomprehensive critics.\n\nIn the fight scenes, The traditional martial arts moves of Jackie Chan are present in every fight scene. But everyone else in the movie performed just as masterfully in these scene, especially JLH. As in all Jackie Chan movies, this motion picture provides a final action scene which will make you remember the Tuxedo. Some matrix-like wire acts are commissioned but overall, they end up enhancing the martial art skills.\n\nIn conclusion, great movie which I found far more entertaining than many movies this year.\n\nTo DreamWorks: Please make a sequel and remember that Toronto is open."

Which is a tragedy with all the skills they had on offer and the cast can't be blamed for that, apart from for signing up maybe. They should have just run instead of taking the money first.\n\nJackie Chan seems to get pushed into the second support role, presumably because Hollywood doesn't think he's leading man material.

        "review_detailed_main": "28 September 2002. Sadly, this isn't Jackie Chan's best nor even good movie. The pacing and plot seems to fall apart about a fourth of the way into the movie becoming dumb and dumber. What audiences expect from Jackie Chan doesn't get full play here and the best part of the movie is Chan's famous closing credits. Hewitt gets some great lines and acting parts and saves the movie from becoming a complete waste. The movie had potential, the number of funny lines are numerous, and the effort laudable, but unfortunately, neither Hewitt nor Chan can save this movie. More of Devlin's presence, the superspy, would have been helpful in a movie such as this but Chan had to suffer having to somehow carry the whole load of the irony in this movie, better shared with another actor."

A bombing puts Devlin in the hospital. Jimmy goes back to the mansion and puts on the tuxedo which turns out to be a high tech gear with extraordinary powers. Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is support at CSA headquarters who mistakenly assumes that Jimmy is Devlin as Jimmy goes on assignment against the villain Dietrich Banning (Ritchie Coaster) and his plan to take over the water supply.\n\nJackie Chan is not a good comedian in English. Some people make that mistake from his work in the Rush Hour movies. Essentially, he is the straight man in those movies. He still has difficulties doing non-physical comedic work in English. This just puts all that up front. The location work isn't the best trying to make the Toronto NYC transition. The story makes very limited logical sense. There was a chance that this movie could go full camp when Jackie Chan starts doing James Brown. However this is more sad than funny."

A movie headlined by Jackie Chan really needed something with chemistry and Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't it. This movie was definitly marketed for ten year olds rather than the usual Chan fan. I went to see it for Jackie Chan. Jennifer Love Hewitt looks great, but her acting career really took a back step. Maybe that new musical career should be permanent. Also, the main plot of the movie really isn't ever announced in the movie. You have to assume what the problem is. They never say what the problem is (I dont wanna give anything away). Some of the stunts with Chan are so fake, it doesn't seem like a Jackie Chan movie. Anyway, the movie needed more \"realistic\" fighting and original ideas, although the James Brown gig was quite funny. I also cant argue with the hilarious outtakes at the end of the movie, which is becoming standard with all Chan movies. In all, I wouldnt spend $10 bucks to watch this movie in theatres. If I were you, Id wait for it to come on DVD to rent."

Fun date film, and a great film for the teen set.\n\nIf you're looking for intrigue, thrills, whodunit or edge of your seat nailbiting - this ain't it. It's pure light fun that doesn't even bother with a plausible plot.\n\nIf you're looking for something like Rumble in the Bronx (Chan's best in my eyes - though I'm no expert) - this ain't it either.\n\nHowever - it is a fun way to spend a day - and it's worthy of a rainy afternoon, especially in the midst of the dry season we seem to be having at the movies lately.\n\nI give the flick a 6/10 for its sheer will to entertain us. It's not original, but it is fun. Besides - a shot of Hewitt's cleavage should thrill the teen set immensely."

If he can get her there before she finishes putting on her makeup, she'll double the fee. As he speeds, swerves, and takes dangerous short-cuts, she informs him on her progress. Since his performance is so satisfactory, she hires him to be a private chauffeur for her boss, Jason Isaacs.\n\nBesides being a good driver, Jackie has no special skills in this movie. What a surprise, right? And what a short movie, since nothing interesting can happen. Just kidding - Jason Isaacs is a secret agent. When Jason winds up in a coma, Jackie (through some twists and turns) finds himself taking his place. But how can a chauffeur pass for a secret agent? Through a magical tuxedo. . .\n\nJackie is just adorable in this movie, and there are tons of laughs and sweet moments sprinkled in among the impressive action sequences. Where else will you get to see him disco dance and perform James Brown songs? He's just adorable as he masters a new skill: fooling the audience into thinking his clothes are doing all the work. As his legs and arms have a mind of their own, he mugs his hilarious expressions and goes along for the ride. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Jackie's sidekick and pseudo-love interest. She's a scientist who's been looking forward to working with Jason Isaacs, so she's understandably confused when Jackie shows up in his place. She does get to wear some very pretty dresses, though. For one of Jackie's fluffiest roles, check him out wearing The Tuxedo."

Be prepared for a non-stop romp of laughs as well as Chan's signature arsenal of stunts in this one! Chan and Hewitt deliver the kind of chemistry that might very well land them two a sequel to this film! The special effects come off dazzling and flawless!

Maybe many of the other reviewers seem to have forgotten who the movie is ultimately aimed at?

The British C.S.A. agent was almost a fake, but he's still cool. I wonder if he always uses the tuxedo to fight crime. If so, that is really lame. There is a minor plot hole in this.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Tuxedo\" (2002), for those who may not know, I've recently reviewed my top two favorite Jackie Chan movies. Most of you know which one I think is his best film, that would be: \"Mr. Nice Guy\" (1997) and my second favorite of his movies is \"The Medallion\" (2003). I figured it was only fair to review my third favorite of his films, \"The Tuxedo\". I remember when I first saw this movie, I enjoyed it a lot. Then, the more I watched it, I found myself liking it even better! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, beautiful sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a hapless cab driver named Jimmy Tong gets hired to be a chauffeur for the wealthy secret agent named Clark Devlin, who owns a gadget-laden tuxedo. After Clark Devlin gets injured, Jimmy is forced to take his place. He dons his tuxedo, which gives him special powers and abilities. His mission is to stop Banning Corporation from poisoning the water supply. I won't go into any extra details about the story, but I promise that you'll be invested and laughing all the way from beginning to end. Probably the most unique aspect behind the plot of this film, is that Jackie Chan's character does not know any martial arts. His character only gains the ability when he puts on the tuxedo. At first, I thought that Jackie Chan not fighting as his normal self would ruin the whole idea of his skills in real-life. But, to tell you the truth, I thought it was an interesting change of pace! Watching someone like Jackie Chan on the screen not knowing martial arts is absolutely hilarious. Plus, when he puts on the tuxedo, the jokes and humor are raised up to 11! Just like in \"The Medallion\", I have the same nitpick here. That's right, I wish that this movie was longer! It may be 98 minutes in length, but it goes by in the blink of an eye. As for the acting, it's top-notch from the whole entire cast. Of course, Jackie Chan steals the show as usual. His acting never disappoints, and his performance here is no different! The rest of the cast does a phenomenal job as well. Jennifer Love Hewitt is funny as Jimmy's partner and eventual love interest, Delilah \"Del\" Blaine. Ritchie Costner as the villainous Dietrich Banning is fantastic. Every cast member nails their respectable character. Their chemistry on the screen is impeccable and they all help bring the film to life. All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up today. There are a few that are a bit cheesy. But, they get the job done and just give the movie that extra bit of charm. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Christophe Beck and John Debney is incredible. Their film score sets the perfect tone for the movie, and then some. Both of them are great film score composers on their own. But, when you have them both working and collaborating together, magic is created. \"The Tuxedo\" is a brilliant achievement in the world of action-comedy/martial arts movies. I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"The Tuxedo\" yet, go see it today. Especially if you're a huge fan of Jackie Chan! I promise that you'll love it. If you don't go see it, watch out for Dietrich Banning, he might poison your water!"

I love odd ideas.\n\nOk, get the plot out of the way, spying, hapless character, evil baddie, and some idea for world domination. Thats all there is to the story. Good, leaves more time for action.\n\nThis is one of Jackie`s better recent movies, pity about the wire fights. Jackie, you are better than that, leave phoney fighting to the likes of The Matrix, Crouching Director Hidden Plot, et al, and come back to the style that you`re best at stupid life threatening stunts and lightening fast fights.\n\nThis hour and a half (or so) of movie was more entertaining than most of last years efforts, i`m looking in your direction Minority Report!\n\nYou cant see this movie and lot enjoy it.... well you can, but you would have to have a swinging brick instead of a heart.\n\nRoll on Shanghai Nights."

I love Jackie Chan movies because Jackie Chan loves making movies, and his energy and vigor are clearly up on the screen. I think Jackie & Jennifer work better than Jackie & Chris (although I think Chris Tucker's one of the funniest actors ever) because Jackie and Jennifer have a similar energy and laidback style.\n\nI also love the wonderful dynamics of action that Jackie is the master of. Great human being as well.\n\nThe James Bond guy is a great actor (Patriot) and I hope he works in American movies more often. Very cute movie! Something you can take your 10-year-old kid brother to without worrying. 8 out of 10."
