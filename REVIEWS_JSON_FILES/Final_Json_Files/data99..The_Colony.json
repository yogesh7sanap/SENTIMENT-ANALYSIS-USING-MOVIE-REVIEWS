        "review_title": "Violent dystopian Scifi that takes place at a far future with lots of fights , chills , blood and gore",
        "review_detailed_main": "Nice Sci-fi with the usual concept : several people struggling for survival . Passable dystopian tale with loads of violence, action , fights , and turns . Groups of people - colonies - are forced underground due to another ice age . Colony 7 is formed by a group of survivors (Zegers , Fishburne, Bill Paxton , Atticus Mitchell , Lisa Berry , Lucius Hoyos, John Tench) . In order to survive they plan an expedition to find supplies and other survivors . A little team goes to check on Colony 5 , which they lost contact with . When the group (Kevin Zegers as Sam , Laurence Fishburne as Briggsget) arrives there , they will be forced to make difficult choices about sacrifice , courage, allegiance to get their final destination . As they find that the colony has fallen and there is a whole new enemy that they have to face on their way back and they have to make impossible decision about themselves and their companions at Colony 17 . As they face dangerous challenges after another as they unlock the truth about the past and ultimately the future of his world . When the world changes the rules of survival change with it .When the earth froze, the rules of survival changed forever.One day, it started to snow, and it never stopped.\n\nIt's a standard but also original Science Fiction movie with no much sense where there is suspense , thriller , getaways and pursuits , frenetic action , crossfire , struggles , explosions , violence , cannibalism , plot holes and characterization enough . Thrilling rendition that picks up every mote of bleak despair of a story by Patrick Tarr in which a group of unfortunate people are forced underground by the next ice age, as a struggling outpost of survivors battle to preserve humanity against a threat even more savage than nature . Highlights of the movie are the creepy encounter with the ominous creatures and the breathtaking battle on the iron bridge. This \u00a8The Colony\u00a8 movie is a sci-fi , action and drama that contains trills , chills , high body-count and overwhelming state-of-art FX . Set in an unknown future when the global warming has caused a new Ice age , as the entire world is frozen except for those are hidden underground .Stars Larry Fishburne and Kevin Zegers giving an acceptable acting as the brave fighters who take desperate , risked choices to protect the ones they love , as well as they must confront unexpected and brutal enemies . Support cast is decent such as : Bill Paxton , Charlotte Sullivan, Atticus ,Viergever, John Tench, among others.\n\nThe picture contains a colorful but dark cinematography by Pierre Gill , it was mostly filmed in North American Aerospace Defense Command , base in North Bay, Ontario, Canada . As well as sinister production design has been rendered with meticulous attention to a futurist detail . And a thrilling and adjusted to action musical score by Jeff Danna . The motion picture was professionally directed Jeff Renfroe . Jeff is a craftsman who has made a few films , such as : Civic Duty , One Point O , He loves me . And he has directed several episodes of notorious series as Houdini y Doyle , Remedy ,Dominion, Rogue , Killjoys , Haven , Reign , Cardinal , The Hardy Boys , Bad Blood , Beauty and the Beast, The art of more , Being human , and several others. Rating 6/10. Acceptable and passable .The flick will appeal to Science Fiction enthusiasts."

Not even recommended.\n\nIts like short B-movie based on a short survival comic book story. Like I said i don't see what they where thinking, or what went wrong and who is a guilty party.\n\nGraphics, actors, set, atmosphere, story, it all holds separately as parts of good movie but all together just fails terribly."

I love apocalyptic movies mixed with frozen world and eventually with monsters. Unfortunately, \"The collony\" turned to be another inconsistent and time- wasting entertainment movie. Yes, I'm talking about usual empty characters, boring plot and of course a good looking hero unable to express anything. A bit of action at the beginning but after knowing the villains you realize nothing good will come. Hollywood guys, please, you have huge resources, spend some more bucks on the script and on the casting and save on fx, anybody can create explosions on the computer but doing a good film is beyond that."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, since IMDb doesn't allow half-ratings and the current IMDb average is way below what the movie's truly worth, I decided to up my rating to an 8. I've been giving thought as to whether I should settle on a 7, but knowing that The Colony was a B-movie, I generously gave it an 8.\n\nThis movie is surprisingly done well. I have a personal liking for post-apocalyptic settings, and this one hits the nail on the spot, for what they chose. As the plot states, a small colony of survivors attempt to survive an ice age, and some unforeseen circumstances occur.\n\nThere isn't much I can say about the movie, apart from the fact that I felt that it was definitely worth the time to watch. It's a really solid movie, and you won't regret watching it. The acting was fine, there were no outrageous moments, and there were no issues with the other details in the movie, such as the CG (which was done pretty good).\n\nThe pacing of the movie is relatively nice, and the movie finishes just right. The movie wasn't stretched out, nor cut short. Any post-apocalyptic movie can easily be over- or underdone (trying to cram in too many subplots in a small timeframe, or not putting in enough to take full availability of the setting), but this one has just enough.\n\nThere's not much else I can say without spoiling the movie, so I'll just say that if you like post-apocalyptic movies, you're sure to have a kick out of watching this one."

It is showing very well how people turn into animals in self defense. We had a similar situation in Sarajevo in 1992-1995. When society fails, community is either doomed or it receives help from outside. Since in this film there was no help from outside even the remnants of the civilization left in the colony were attacked by a gang of cannibals.\n\nIf you like sci fi post apocalyptic films this one is for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what the makers were thinking, why will you cast Lawrence Fishburn if you're not going to use it in any meaningful way?.\n\nThe movie portraits humanity after the ice age has begun. The Colony only explains partially what happened to the planet and why we as humans destroyed it burning all the fossil fuel which contributed to a new ice age, all humanity is lost and the only remains are some \"colonies\" beneath the earth.\n\nThe starting point is quite good, the first minutes of the movie too. Although it is clich\u00e9d, it is standard sci-fi, it develop it's characters sufficiently enough but then.. it speeds up its downward spiral once the \"enemies\" appear on the scene.\n\nThe movie has an incredible change of pace once the enemies arrives with poorly execution on the director's side and just god awful fight scenes... Hardcore music and slaughter, i'm in the 80's again?, is this a joke?, I could accept that kind of embarrassment on a B low movie, I just can't accept it in a movie with Lawrence Fishburn that began as well as this one.\n\nIt's like the director throw away the script and said \"just put the rock music and kill everyone, because that's cool!\"... He appears to just shoot himself in the foot with the directing the movie takes.\n\nIt goes without saying that this was actually an incredible missed opportunity to tell a interesting story of the survivors of humanity... and a potential hope for the story.\n\nThe conclusion to this mess is, kill your opponents swiftly and survive.\n\nI wanna kill myself for wasting all this time. How can they ruin their own potentially good story is beyond me. It seems Hollywood is full of stupid people that takes stupid decisions in the making of movies these days.\n\nAvoid it, if you want to see killing, see it with some meaning added to it. If you want action and scares, go watch Dawn of the Dead, is 1000 times better than this horrendous mess."

        "review_title": "Slightly underrated (but not much!)",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is suffering from what I'd like to call the Game of Thrones effect; the way the ending defines a person's lasting opinion regardless of what came before. GOT was freakin' amazing, but to many people it is a festering pool of lameness, because the last series (or 2) was written by a spoon.\n\nThe Colony is kinda the same. I can honestly say, for the entire first half of the movie I was thinking: this movie doesn't deserve a 5/10. It has a solid post-apocalyptic atmosphere, an interesting somewhat-innovative premise, decent acting, and an intriguing story with good tension building. The CGI was a bit weak in places, but I didn't care because I was adequately immersed. Reading the other reviews, I think most people felt the same. So 50% of this movie is a solid 7/10 ... for real post-apocalyptic fans maybe even an 8/10.\n\nThe problem is, after the real enemy is revealed, the tension rapidly drops away and a simple bland survival story begins. There's nothing at all innovative from here on. The action is underwhelming and the enemy is also underwhelming (but they're clearly not zombies as one reviewer thought). Sure, there are multiple holes in terms of realism and believability, but they're the same flaws 100 other higher scoring action movies have made. Also the possibility of the interesting apocalypse-reversal was not explored. Basically, it was just generic not-too-terrible lameness. This part of the movie was a disappointing 5/10.\n\nSo yes, as a result of the ending the overall experience is disappointing ... but honestly I think the first half was special enough to justify watching the movie, especially if you're a post-apoc fan. Sit down, forget the IMDB score, pretend it's a hidden gem, and enjoy the first 45 minutes. When you sense it's starting to get lame, which it unfortunately will, crack on with your doom scrolling or whatever you personally do when TV loses your attention.\n\nThis might seem like odd advice but IMO, as a post-apoc fan, the beginning has stayed with me somewhat and I feel it'd be a shame to not give it a go."

It is indeed a shame that the last word of the movie almost subtracts everything added by my favorite scene and finishes by throwing this one back into the inescapable black-hole-bin of clich\u00e9s. As for those of you not attracted to over-analyzing golden nuggets - you will still find a very decent (6-ish) action movie as my fellow reviewers suggest."

You'll be surprised and impressed with how much the filmmakers accomplished with less than 20 million dollars. The authenticity of the underground colony is great (it doesn't feel like a film set) considering they filmed at the decommissioned NORAD facility in Northern Ontario."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie piqued my interest because it reminded of movies such as The Thing and Dawn of the Dead, and of games such as The Swarm. I found the setting of the movie, an underground base effectively surviving underneath a frozen world, a good basis for a story. However, the plot itself does not explore the world and the background story.\n\nWhen the movie started, I found myself thrown amid a bunch of clich\u00e9s. The narrative simplistically explains how the apocalypse, in this case a frozen world, came about. The premise of the plot is that a team of three people from one base, in response to a distress signal, journey to help another base. This is where the help squad encounters its initial enemy, and the squad inevitably ends up luring the enemy back to its own base. Other clich\u00e9s include a power struggle for leadership, and the movie trying to leave the backstory undeveloped to shroud the audience with a mysterious atmosphere. I found similarities between The Colony and Oblivion, including the narrative, the initial encounter with enemies, and the lack of answers. There are many other clich\u00e9s that are scattered about the movie, including scenes on a decaying bridge, and scenes involving escape.\n\nAs for the special effects and the cinematography, I did not find them particularly special or bad. The whole movie reminded me a bit of The Dawn of the Dead and The Thing, both of which are better than this movie. It did not make up for the lackluster plot with its visuals, and it did not make me feel anything.\n\nIf you have seen The Dawn of the Dead, The Thing, or anything similar, you have already pretty much seen this movie. The Colony is only worth watching on Netflix."

Well, while The Colony touches an interesting theme it never gets pretentious or wants to convince us of something. This can be seen as a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you are expecting. Some might want to be intellectually stimulated or forced to think about a subject they never have though of before. Those people will be disappointed because The Colony does not have an original concept at all. But for the ones who just want to be entertained will have a good time. The acting is more than decent thanks to Laurence Fishburne and Bill Paxton that bring a lot of weight into the movie. Although Kevin Zegers holds his own pretty well among the giants. Most of the focus is on the thrills and action. And in that aspect the director knows what he is doing. There will be moments where logic is thrown out of the door to keep the plot moving but one huge one will at least make you scratch your head and ask how did they manage to do that so quickly? Which could be distracting. Also a lot of questions will remain unanswered. Still the viewer will be rewarded more than enough with some solid thrills and action. So to answer the question. Yes,in my humble opinion The Colony is worth your time because this unpretentious B movie does what it is supposed to do. It will entertain you."

It was not bad as it was rated, it was quite an entertaining movie with fine performances. All the way Laurence Fishburne is the only familiar face you could find. His inclusion in the movie had the advantage. He delivered what his crew expected from him and the rest was recovered by the other cast members that I don't know anyone of them.\n\nBasically, this movie had a very simple concept, a story that was not expanded, but moves on a certain lane till the end. It was all about surviving which is set in the backdrop of next ice age where few people who survived live in colonies located underground. It follows the story of the colony 7, when they won't get respond from their's mutual understanding colony 5 the rescue team set to leave to know what's going on. They reach their destination and come to know everything, while escaping, the horror follows them. How it will be avoided from affecting the colony 7 and their strength of the defense system reveals in the rest.\n\nThis was not a movie made by some popular filmmaker with top actors. Like any other movie, it was also targeted commercial purpose. They want to make money and fame, but what we need is a good entertainment and so we get it. I am not saying or comparing to the masterpiece, though better than some A-list movies. I Gauratee it won't be your worst movie of the year. I was fulfilled with what I was anticipated, so no disappointment. If you are a luck it may work for you as well."

Both are solid dystopian sci-fi, with this having the far more solid science behind it, which helps with the believability and immersion. The only other qualities they share involves isolation and some annoying narration by the lead character.\n\nColony has a strong horror aspect to it, including an answer to the question of what might be the middle-ground between human and zombie. There's very little tech involved, contrary to what those seeing Lawrence Fishburne in it might expect. The action, however, is almost entirely fight related, with some connected to the extreme climate conditions and the decaying nature of the cities they're using for shelter.\n\nOutside of a forced end kill and gaps in how the enemy creatures manage to get to certain places, there are no horrible or weak scenes. Budget issues are more evident in undeveloped story elements than the FX."

        "review_detailed_main": "By the looks of the trailers, I actually had a slight hope for this flick. I'm a sucker for survival-movies and it starred Fishbourne and Paxton, cool right? No! This movie had everything going for it, but they managed to ruin it.\n\nFirst of all, how did Fishbourne and Paxton do? They did alright, it's just that their characters are horrible clich\u00e9s. Fishbourne is obviously the wise, great leader everybody loves and Paxton is his counter-part. A trigger-happy redneck who wants to have a tighter regime among the survivors, this character could be exciting, but with no development nor a lot of screen-time, he becomes too boring..\n\nSpeaking of survivors, I forgot to mention the 'Day after tomorrow'-plot here. We get to know that it just started snowing, that's why the entire globe has entered a new ice age, well okay, now I feel wiser. The plot is also told though the narration of the protagonist Sam, who looks a lot like Emile Hirsch, just more wooden. After receiving a distress call from another group of survivors, Fishbourne, Sam and some random dead- beat who brings pornography on expeditions (Fishbourne even asks if he wants to be alone when he pulls the magazine out, I'm not kidding)goes to investigate. After they find a skinnier version of Sharlto Copley, we meet the bad guys, who are basically a bunch of exaggerated orcs. The movie also tries to create some minor sub-plots, but fails. The tedious nightmare with flashbacks from Sam's childhood doesn't add anything to the story, and is explained by Fishbourne after 30 minutes, there goes the potential mystery.\n\nI must admit this film is on the verge of becoming a B-movie. The effects are horrendous, the camera gets a seizure during the fight- scenes and the ending was predicted during the first five minutes. It's sad to see such great actors get involved in garbage such as this now a days."

Although it does suffer from a lack of a budget there is very decent movie here that will keep you hooked. With the original setting and strong narrative perspective it is one of those movie that you will be glad you have seen.

The movie has some beautiful scenery, and the setting (frozen Earth) and the plot is solid enough. Sure, for science-fiction it has some flaws for example, footprints hold during the night on the snow despite the never-ending blizzard. Or the \"certain\" tribe is so big it shouldn't be able to survive (taking into account their ration). But... that's about it. I can't recall any other major problem and I saw this movie just yesterday. Besides, this is the fourth post-apocalyptic movie of 2013 that I have seen. \"The Oblivion\" was obviously the best, hands down. And this is also the simple fact that \"After Earth\" was obviously the worst. Taking into account their budgets, I would say \"The Colony\" is no worse than \"World War Z\". There is no unnecessary pathos and its characters definitely has more depth and creates more of viewers' willingness to empathize them."

By the end of the film I hoped we'd get some answers on that score but that was left hanging.\n\nAnd of course what led to the entire break down of civilization as a whole which is the underlying story of this movie beyond the clich\u00e9d explanation that people will do almost anything under great stress doesn't go far enough.\n\nI think in the end I was looking for a more intelligent film which is what actors like Laurence Fishburne and Bill Paxton have brought to projects in the past, I'm a little surprised they agreed to do this film on the script alone.\n\n4 Stars"

But that all changed to the worse and the movie fell into mediocrity once it was revealed what had happened to the inhabitants of the neighboring colony. I just didn't like that approach to the story one bit, it was just ludicrous.\n\nI liked the arctic setting of the movie, and the visual effects department did manage to make it look realistic and that did a lot for the movie. Because if a movie like this had poor effects and CGI it would just collapse like a poorly constructed card house.\n\nKevin Zegers didn't really have what it took to deliver in this movie, and as such then he wasn't a strong main actor for the movie, which did slow down the movie a bit. He is usually an adequate actor, but didn't really pull it off in \"The Colony\". It was without a doubt Bill Paxton who were the one carrying the movie, despite having only a secondary role in the movie. Laurence Fishburne was there simply because he is Laurence Fishburne.\n\nIt was a shame that director Jeff Renfroe opted for that approach to the incident of the neighboring colony, because it was a severe crippling blow to the movie. \"The Colony\" had potential, but it was abruptly cut down by the direction in which the story went."

So Unbelievable! The only 2 good things about the film is Laurence Fishbourne and Bill Paxton who are movie veterans. Apart from that, the film takes ages to get going and the script was a bit sketchy. As I hadn't heard anything about this film before watching it, I wasn't expecting that much so I wasn't overly let down, but I was expecting better. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: Whilst watching this film, I was hoping for something original once they got to the other Colony, but it just went downhill from there. The concept wasn't to bad before all the Zombie thing started to get out of hand, and it made me laugh how easy they got through so many of them. At Fishbourne's age, it was good to see him do his karate moves, which he must have learnt from the Matrix, but it doesn't last long. I know that there is a lot of people into these type of movies so it's not a total disaster, but for that budget, they should have come with something better.\n\nBudget: $16million Worldwide Gross: N/A\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Human vs. Zombies movies set in the snow. 3/10"

It does look good cinematography wise, but I would have thought they'd made it for far less money than that.\n\nYou have a couple of good actors on work here, the story is more than decent enough, the setting explaining it all.

It was slow and every move the actors made was predictable. Even the dialog was easy to predict. There were a few but far between, moments where the movie would start to pick up and give you false hope that it will get better. The movie does show how history will most likely repeat it's self and leaves you wondering WHY? They know what the result will be. The ending leaves you hanging with so many questions that will never be answered. It really wouldn't have hurt to add some time to the movie and finish the ending better. It was like they had to cram 2 hours worth of stuff into the last half hour and in order to do that- they cut 90% out all together."

I think the whole movie should have been pretty slow paced. And totally different from the middle to the end. Because as the movie really started to move, it went to the wrong direction.

        "review_detailed_main": "Looking at director Jeff Renfroe, he's a capable and talented director who I know from his intriguing feature film debut \"One Point O\" in 2004, which was followed by the more widely known \"Civic Duty\" about two years later, also well received. After a long period out of the spotlight, I was delighted to see his name attached to \"The Colony\", a film with a seemingly sufficient budget of $16 million and an experienced, capable cast. I love these type of genre blends, the elements of overcoming not just nature, but humanity in order to survive extinction. When you've seen as many of these films as I have you come to expect familiar elements and a plot that is far from original, we're in an area now where nothing is new, where everything is borrowing from one film or another. For me the success of this film will undoubtedly depend on it's script, acting and effects, when all are done brilliantly, the plot originality can be somewhat sacrificed, unfortunately this film was eons away from brilliant. As we have seen many times before it's all about us versus them, against the elements of nature.\n\nThe film takes place in a post-apocalyptic era, where the remainder of Earth's inhabitants have been driven underground due to sustained sub- zero temperatures. The surface has become a frozen wasteland void of life. Out of the few that did survive, many died due to overcrowding, starvation and sickness. The film revolves around an underground colony of survivors whose numbers are dwindling because of rampant flu, consisting of roughly forty people responsible for growing food and storing seeds in hopes that the surface will again someday be capable of growing crops. It's a last ditch effort to preserve humanity against all odds, some of which they are not prepared to face, a new evil, far more dangerous than the frozen surface or flu.\n\nThe leader of colony seven is Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) , after receiving a distress call from colony five, he picks one member out of the group Sam (Kevin Zegers) to accompany him and another member Graydon (Atticus Dean Mitchell) volunteers to accompany them. What they find there is not at all what they expected. It's inhabitants have been decimated by a rogue group and as the film swiftly shifts into higher gears, it's no longer clear who, if anyone, will be able to survive what is coming.\n\nThe first thing that many may be quick to criticize will be the script, the lack of detail & explanation. Worse yet after the extended period of time it takes to inject any real fear or excitement into the story it has completely failed to engage the viewer by an utter lack of character development even after forty long minutes in. When the pace quickens the viewer becomes easily detached by the chaos that ensues, leaving the question behind \"who should I be caring for & why\". Personally I didn't mind the slow crawl in the film's beginning, it successfully laid down a solid foundation for the second half to launch from and it did with sustained intensity. It was in that intensity where the film seemed to lose its identity to some degree within the onslaught of the attack. Another thing that may put off some viewer's was a major lack of explanation as to how exactly humanity ended up in the ridiculous spot they were holding up in. Again many weak points in the script to be found all throughout the film. Nonetheless, there were some solid performances given by the cast and the cinematography was superb, having an actual decommissioned NORAD base to use as a set made for an absolutely perfect backdrop. Despite the aforementioned problems, the film still holds decent entertaining value, enough to meet my initial expectations for a direct to disc sci-fi flick. The end wasn't very reassuring, I would have preferred something less in the grey area. Although, as a whole, it was light years ahead of other recent more expansive films like \"After Earth\". Again, it had it's problems but it's still worth a VOD or Redbox pick for fans of the genre ."

The Film Starts Out with some Obvious Observations about Alpha Males and Survival, Seed Storage and Weather Modification. There is some Relevance to the Times We live in, like the Climate Change Template.\n\nBut in the End it is much to do about Not Much as Things Devolve into expected Gory goings on and some Plot Holes Big Enough to Fill the one in the Ozone.\n\nBut here it is, another Typical Dystonia World that is another Warning to Recycle and develop Alternative Energy, and to keep Your Damn Hands Off the Weather Modification Machines.

The actors do pull of well made stereotypes that all have some sort of back-story to them, but you really don't need to know of. The atmosphere of the world is nice, even though the CGI is on par to video games. If you can look past all that, it's a nice film to kill the time."

Sam (Kevin Zegers) brings his concerns about Mason to Briggs. Kai (Charlotte Sullivan) maintains the seed collection. Suddenly, they receive an SOS from Colony 5. Briggs, Sam, and young Graydon go on a rescue mission. They find 5 deserted. A survivor shows them a transmission from a working recommissioned weather machine but soon they come under attack from cannibalistic survivors.\n\nThis works fine as a cable TV movie. As a theatrical release, it lacks anything original or outstanding to remove it from being derivative. The CGI is noticeably inferior. The actors are fine with some top talents. The setting is either industrial interiors or a snowy stage. While there is competent work, it never rises above its B-movie status."

I started to watch it as a lowgrade crappy movie and I always looked for the turning point where it goes bad. And I found none. In this movie there were no overdramatized scenes, no invincible superheroes, no eyecandy visuals, no big shootings with big guns, no super scientists, no over-explanation for the dumb viewer and no ordinary ppl acing like military personals or mentally rocksolid badasses. In short: Hollywood won't pour out from your screen while you watching it. A simple, decent directed post-apocalyptic story where the actors playing ordinary human beings living in an underground vault somewhere (I did not understand why were there Cyril letters in the walls while they speak English but whatever). Eg they are actually are panicking in some situations not like other humans sitting in their sofa telling how they would act in situations like this... The movie is not boring it keeps your attention all the time the acting is good the atmosphere is good the story is good. At least better than most of the blockbusters coming out nowadays claiming themselves sci-fi movies. It does not want to be more than it is, a lowbudget but good post-apocalyptic sci-fi which made me very satisfied after watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "**SPOILERS**\n\nThis movie is a mildly pleasant diversion for those who enjoy post apocalyptic stories.\n\nIt's set some time in the near future, where man's attempt to counter global warming through manipulation of climate caused severe global cooling instead, instantly bringing the earth into an ice age. This, by the way, is the exact same premise as the much better and more creative film \"Snowpiercer.\"\n\nHere, however, instead of a train as in Snowpiercer, the remaining humans live in \"colonies,\" dark, dingy underground industrial complexes, while the surface is covered with ice and ever-falling snow. The film's production design is top notch here. They recreate the intended atmosphere and mood beautifully.\n\nThe story is entertaining enough, if entirely conventional. In a sequence reminiscent of an early scene in John Carpenter's \"The Thing,\" the main characters here journey to another colony to find out why they have lost radio contact.\n\nThere, they encounter feral, cannibalistic humans who are like zombies but able to use weapons. Naturally, they attack the civilized humans, who must fend them off. Much more could have been done with this world. It's essentially a waste of a good setting.\n\nThe acting is fine, with Larry Fishburne turning in a reliably good performance as the group's leader, former army captain Briggs. Support from Bill Paxton and others is solid if unspectacular. Then again, there isn't much an actor can do with these parts as written. The characters are shallow and poorly developed.\n\nThere is more than the usual quotient of stupid behavior on the part of the characters, and more than the usual number of unnecessary implausibilities. For example, apparently a half dozen people with guns have trouble fighting off a dozen or so with axes and machetes. In one scene, one of the cannibals takes 17 hard blows to the head with a crowbar and not only remains alive, but conscious and able to continue fighting! Yet these crazies are not zombies killed only by destroying the brain. Others die from ordinary stab wounds.\n\nImplausibilities aside, this is a marginally entertaining sci-fi horror yarn. The pacing is relatively quick. In fact, the film's 86 minute run time seemed too short. With 10-15 more minutes they could have developed more interesting plot elements. If you enjoy this genre, it's worth a late night on Netflix, assuming you have nothing better to do. The bottom line is this movie isn't boring. It is, however, a bit irritating, and ultimately inconsequential."

It is okay for what it is (a mindless action flick) but there were just too many plotholes and highly unreasonable and \"unrealistic\" (aka not consistent with the world they set up in the beginning) scenes.\n\nIt is an interesting premise - post apocalyptic ice and snow covered earth after humans have meddled one too many times and the remnants are hiding in bunkers. However, the plot itselfs leave something to be desired. The characters make questionable desicions, for example jumping/walking over brittle concrete slabs while ignoring the completely intact steel beams next to them. The internal logic of the world changes repeatedly, especially regarding elements of survival - characters in the beginning are walking around covered head to toe with gear whereas later they wander into the snow with cargo pants and without head coverings which would kill them within the hour. They are well prepared and equipped for a 2-day trip to another bunker but don't bring safety gear for crossing an unstable bridge.\n\nThe characters motivations are often very cliche-y and pretty much everyone except the main characters are very 2-dimensional (and at times they are as well). And unless human physiology and physics work very differently in that world, the movie should have been over after the first discovery in the other bunker.\n\nNevertheless, the camera work was okay, the performances could have been worse and the dialog was fine(ish). It felt quite half hearted at times regarding the plot but some elements were done well. The landscape did look good for something so obviously low budget. If you don't think about any of it too much (especially the ending), it can be an enjoyable movie."

However, not long after arriving, they soon see that something has indeed gone very wrong and what they find there is something of unimaginable horror.\n\nThe Colony's another of these post-apocalyptic movies so you can imagine that there's nothing really original story-wise here. In saying that, however, it's still a pretty decent movie to watch with some of the most impressive parts of the film actually being the visual effects which are done pretty well.\n\nThe movie starts off well and it doesn't actually take long to get in to. It's not one of these 100 minute \"story-building\" movies with only 5 minutes of action. It keeps pace pretty well and while there are slower moments it never actually becomes boring.\n\nLike I said earlier, it's not an original story but it does keep your interest and the movie definitely picks up pace after the rescue party finds the source of the \"problems\". A downside of the movie for me was the lack of some of the realism with the cold environment. I mean in The Thing for example people were freezing cold with snow and ice sticking to their faces and seeing that YOU actually felt cold. Yet here we have the next ice age and people can go outside without their faces being covered and in some instances not wearing very much and there's not even as much as a shiver. I suppose I'm just being picky, but little things like that can add to the feeling of a movie when done properly.\n\nIn saying all of that, though, The Colony is not an Oscar-winning movie but it never sets out to be one, so as long as you're not expecting that then you'll be fine. Watch it for what it is - an entertaining popcorn horror/thriller."

Between the four of you, that's the best you can come up with? Re-stating what was apparent from the start of the movie.\n\nLastly, the tension is dragged down by a side-story involving Bill Paxton's character (played like he's going through the motions). It adds nothing and takes up precious screen time that ought to be devoted to creating suspense and heightening the action that evaporates in Act 3. Less is often more. This is why the only enjoyable part of the film was the one at Colony 5. You'll understand if you dare to watch this paint-by-the-numbers picture."

It's exciting and you wonder what's gonna happen next. I'm not a movie critic nor a film expert, but for me this was a pleasure to watch. The actors play their roles well, it's feels like this is how it would be if this disaster happened.

        "review_detailed_main": "NO SPOILERS HERE: A review without a plot summary.\n\nHow do movies like this get made? I mean, with all the money involved, doesn't someone stop and actually look at the product?\n\nFist off, the script. It must be said that if a plot has to rely on the main characters making a litany of stupid mistakes to move it forward, then its probably not a great, well thought out story to begin with...and that's exactly what we have here with The Colony. There are countless places in the film where the story would have ended abruptly, if only the characters made a good decision. Using character stupidity as a major plot device, in a movie of this genre, is just lazy writing/filmmaking, plain and simple.\n\nThe script is also ripe with over used horror troupes, which simply fall flat in the modern era of cinema. Audiences have just become to sophisticated for paint-by-numbers suspense for it to cause anxiety, fear, or thrills, simply because it's so predictable. Again, lazy writing/filmmaking.\n\nThe story also lacks a well defined main theme, whether it be life in an post-apocalyptic earth, a treat from an outside source, or finding salvation. Without direction, the movie as a whole feels empty and meaningless.\n\nThere is almost no character development. The story is imbalanced, in that, so much time is spent on the journey to and from a location in the film, there's no real time for the audience to get to know and care about the characters. Bill Paxton's character is way underdeveloped and underutilized. Laurence Fishburne's character was only fleshed out enough to be serviceable, but the audience feels not real connection to him, or any of the other characters for that matter. Therefore, it is difficult for the viewer to realty care about any of their fates. Hence, when one of the main characters dies, it carries no emotional impact.\n\nThe bad force in the film is given no explanation, no back story, and it is very hyperbolic, to the point its almost cartoonish, where it loses its intended impact...especially during the climax if the film.\n\nThe special effects in the film are only serviceable, as they're just a step above video game quality. This wouldn't have been so bad, if it weren't for the directors Peter Jacksonesque camera sweeps around and above some of the larger digital set pieces.\n\nThe none of the actors gave memorable performances. Many of the actors seemed to just, \"phone it in,\" as if this film was nothing more than a payday.\n\nThe cinematography does achieve the feeling of vast openness of the outdoor set pieces. However, the film fails to produce the feeling of true isolation or the claustrophobic effects of living underground.\n\nIf one could turn back the clock to 1987 and this were a made for TV movie, then it might have been something. But, this film was released in theaters 2013, so it fails to impress. Though, this isn't a film I'd place on the Worst Movies of All Time list, there's nothing worthy about it to make it worth recommending, even if its on Netflix and its a lazy Sunday. There are far better ways to waste your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked 'The Colony' the first time I saw it in 1995 and it was called 'Screamers.' Yeah yeah yeah. I know some nerds are raging right now that 'Screamers' didn't even take place on Earth, but face the facts. They both have pretty much the same plot.\n\n'The Colony' takes place in a frozen post apocalyptic future when the very few surviving humans must live underground in small colonies. They're all plagued with problems like, disease, pestilence, famine, and of course power junkies trying to be king of the hill.\n\nColony 7, the principle colony loses contact with colony 3 and sends out a search party.\n\nLawrence Fishburn (Cowboy Curtis) and two others travel to the far side of the blue screen to discover that colony 3 successfully made contact with a non frozen colony with healthy soil in need of seeds.\n\nUnfortunately colony 3 was wiped out by a gang of feral cannibals. Inevitably they will follow the search party back to colony 7.\n\nOver all the film is exciting and entertaining. The CGI FX are pretty decent, although they're about the same as 'Screamers' mat paintings, which once again begs the question, \"Why even use CGI if mat paintings have always worked well?\" The only logical flaw I notice was how the cannibal gang was able to track Fishburn's boot prints over night through a blizzard? Fishburn takes shelter before sundown citing how the storm is worsening. Yet the next morning, with it still snowing, Fishburn points to his boot prints from the day before. They're still fresh! This could have easily been explained away with a line, \"How could they have tracked us? The blizzard would have covered our prints in the snow?\" \"They've gone feral. They must have extraordinary tracking skills.\" See? Problem solved."

I was pleased to see I was right... up to the middle of the film. Then it became high-budget schlock.\n\nFirst: Good cinematography, good art direction, good effects, good audio, good acting, good directing. Sadly, none of this saved what could have been a really good film.\n\nThe first half established the characters and their conflicts, the engine that drives the story, as well as their living facility and the general world situation. So far, so good.\n\nThree of the main characters ended up at another colony, seemingly abandoned. Then they find out what happened to the inhabitants - a band of cannibals killed them off for food. Okay, well, this is where it gets stupid real fast.\n\nThese cannibals, think of them as nearly brainless, screaming, running zombies, except they're not zombies, just really hungry people. Their leader is the height of stupid stereotype - a tall brute of a man with a shaved head, a giant scar across his forehead, a long black overcoat, and... pointed teeth? Whatever.\n\nYada yada yada, big hand-to-hand combat, new hero exercises superhuman strength in a B movie way when vanquishing Mr. Chief Bad Guy, yada yada yada. This last half of the movie essentially abandoned the core concept of the film - a frozen world and how people deal with it. Instead, the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that, like they got tired of the cold and decided to shoot some fight scenes for fun.\n\nIf you decide to watch this film, do yourself a favor and go do something else during the last half of the film, something constructive like clipping your toenails.\n\nLastly, why does Lisa Berry's character only utter a few words? She's a good actress with a long, impressive list of credits and two BCA Best Actress nominations. I think I know why she was short-changed but I'll keep my suspicions about it to myself."

The first thing that makes this movie nice is the setting. Yes, snow is pretty bleak and uninspirational, but it works well here and adds to the feel. Plus you have Lawrence Fishburne and Bill Paxton, who both turn in fine performances.\n\nThe story is slower in the first half and then changes pace when the action kicks off, so be prepared for that. It's also a bit of a mish-mash of other movies (you can play 'spot the movie rip-off' a fair few times - I noticed bits borrowed from Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead 2004 and 28 Days Later), but you have to remember that it is just a B-movie.\n\nIt may be that 'The Colony' is one of those movies that has a concept which actually exceeds its capabilities. Normally, when I watch a movie, I tend to want to cut out about half an hour of pointless bits from the middle. However, here's a film that I thought should have been longer. There are quite a few plot threads which could have been expanded on. However, because of the short running time (probably due to budget constraints), the film does feel a little rushed.\n\nIf you accept it for what it is - a B-movie - then you should enjoy it. It wouldn't stand up against Hollywood's big budget action movies, but it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half of your time."

They assemble a team to investigate, but what they're about to find out will prove to be shocking, to say the least.\n\nIt's a movie which bases its story and action in a frozen world, where people lived in underground colonies and fight every day for survival. When a new threat is found, they must think and act fast as faced with extinction. Although not having plenty of characters, they are not very well designed, and furthermore, they follow the same over-used stereotypes you would normally find in this type of movies. Like the one obsessed with control and leadership despite of every logic, the so called hero on which the story focuses but his impact is little in the overall outcome, the fearless leader who leaves his people for a \"very important mission\" and so on.\n\nThe events presented can be suspenseful, but unfortunately fall deep into the predictable side. And, due to the above mentioned characters and their actions, the whole drama can be unleashed, in a quite uninteresting fashion. Still unfortunate, this movie bases its intrigue on some disturbing flaws, like tracks which are somehow not covered by the snow and a terrible blizzard, even after prolonged periods of time, character personalities and decisions which are simply mind-blowing, big inconsistencies like the fuse from two piles of TNT, one which burns in matter of seconds and another which simply is extinguished by the wind/snow, or just big intentional plot holes which somehow allow the antagonists to survive/teleport like otherworldly creatures.\n\nBeing as predictable and flawed as it is, you'll find it pretty hard to enjoy the scenery and the icy atmosphere which surrounds everything. Although it manages to build suspense through its cinematic direction, as you don't get to care about the characters even by a small bit, the most intense events tend to leave you as cold as the environment. And it really is a shame, as it makes the plot even more pointless and less interesting than it already is.\n\nOverall, I found a movie with a good location, with some unsympathetic characters which fight for survival, with some intense but unrealistic fighting scenes which ultimately lead to a favorable but predictable finale. It had potential but failed to deliver due to some bad decisions both regarding characters and action."

Now, I just want to kill the people who couldn't translate the awesomeness in the trailer to the movie.\n\nLet's start with the story. It starts out good. Post-apocalyptic world, good. Characters having tension, there. Love angle, present. See? Lots of potential. When they decide to go to the other colony, you get excited. They even learn something very important there, that you think is going to be the endgame of the movie. Instead, when it does end, you have a WTF moment. I usually don't use such things in my reviews, but seriously, that's the only way it could be described. Like halfway through the budget ended, and they decided to leave it at that. Or it was the first episode in a TV series. Yeah, I could actually see this continued in a TV series.\n\nThe acting couldn't have been much of a challenge. You have Laurence Fishburn playing his usual authority figure. As if he was still the same person he played in CSI, but after he left, the world ended and he got stuck in the colony. Don't be fooled by the picture though, he's not the main character. It's actually Kevin Zegers' character, Sam. He does a good job, but not a demanding role. Maybe just in the amount of running he had to do. Bill Paxton's role is such a clich\u00e9, it almost hurt. In every one of the stories you need the guy who just wants to be the king of the junk yard. However, I didn't expect too much depth in the story, just some entertainment, so I guess he could stay.\n\nI thought that this was one of the most disappointing movies that I've ever seen. They had a potential here, and ended up doing one of those mindless \"running from zombies / things that want to eat you\" movies. I get that they are hip now. However, it can be done without me wanting to slap someone, and scream at them: \"You had all this potential and you wasted it on THIS?\" Watch this movie, if you like to see people running from stuff. Also, watch it if you want to see good world-building wasted. Watch it if you are looking for a good base for a fanfiction. Otherwise, stay away!\n\nCross-posted at http://unapologetic-reviews.blogspot.com"

I've always been a fan of Bill Paxton (like so many, since 'Aliens') and I would have liked to see him in the film a bit more. Sadly, his role was quite small compared to how he's promoted on all marketing material surrounding this film.\n\nThe story is slower in the first half and then changes pace when the action kicks off, so be prepared for that. However, I thought that the film probably should have been called 'The OTHER Colony!' It begins with the colony where all our protagonists are, but it doesn't take long before a trio of cast-members decide to leave here to go and investigate another colony that they've lost contact with. Therefore, all the characters we've been introduced to are cast aside for what is basically the middle of the film when the action starts. It's also a bit of a mish-mash of other movies (you can play 'spot the movie rip-off' a fair few times - I noticed bits borrowed from 'Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead' (2004) and '28 Days Later'), but you have to remember that it is just a B-movie.\n\nOur heroes soon find themselves coming face to face with a load of expendable bad guys who like to eat people rather than save their own species. The 'lead' bad guy does tend to simply roar a lot rather than offer any real 'motivation' for his slide in humanity, hence why I saw this film as a weird 'zombie-like' story (just with cannibals instead of the undead).\n\nIt may be that 'The Colony' is one of those movies that has a concept which actually exceeds its capabilities. Normally, when I watch a movie, I tend to want to cut out about half an hour of pointless bits from the middle. However, here's a film that I thought should have been longer. There are quite a few plot threads which could have been expanded on. However, because of the short running time (probably due to budget constraints), the film does feel a little rushed.\n\nIf you accept it for what it is - a B-movie - then you should enjoy it. It wouldn't stand up against Hollywood's big budget action movies, but it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half of your time."

The sun has gone away, it's freezing and the survivors are understandably a bit grumpy about it.\n\nTensions are fraught in the colony and only made worse by clashing personalities and limited resources. To top it all off the main characters have to go on a dangerous expedition to save another colony.\n\nThe shots of the frozen cities are pretty good and the target of their venture is intriguing.\n\nActually it isn't. The second half of the film is shot in an underground car park and all the wonderful cgi of the wastes are quickly forgotten.\n\nOnce revealed, the plot is weak and uninteresting and the 'bad guys' are truly pathetic. It is like watching a version of the film Zulu where the Red Coats outnumber the Zulus 3:1.\n\nThe film descends into a half-hearted attempt at an action movie where the characters use up the last twenty minutes of film twatting each other over the head with frying pans."

        "review_detailed_main": "...having to watch the execution of terrible writing and utter stupidity unfold before my eyes was worse.\n\nI wanted to like this movie. The procession of Hollywood movies following remake after remake and clich\u00e9d movie knock offs is tiring. Post apocalyptic movies have always been of interest to me, however there are generally two categories that are filled when doing movies of this nature.\n\nThe first being intelligent movies. Where events and situations occur that make you think \"yeah I see this as a very high likelihood of happening\" or \"wow, that's totally believable!\". Then let smart intelligent writing with necessary arcs and twists fill the story. I will say this approach to movie writing is in the vast minority...I would say 1/50 movies maybe more.\n\nThen you have the other type. The stupid, the poorly written, clumsy execution and horrid plot development, I've seen 6 year olds tell more convincing stories. These seem to be the trending and vast majority off movies I see hitting the shelves.\n\nThe colony very nicely falls into the latter. Stupid, stupid and really stupid. Firstly, in a world of everlasting snow and ice...why would foot tracks last more than 10min before being covered by the consistent snow storms that are raging for the entirety of the movie? Which then kills the next part, the cannibal horde of crazies cannot follow you. But for stories sake, let say they got out of the blown up power station and started tracking you quickly and were hot on your heels. Running to the bridge and blowing it up. TNT fuses don't suddenly blow out when lit...they are built to burn in almost any situation. But hey lets suspend that as well, running across the bridge and into the city. By running into building after building and allowing the snow to cover your tracks, would successfully elude detection and capture.\n\nBut hell lets say the cannibal horde were magical/telepathic/psychic and found your colony against being frozen to death outside of shelter...and by the way anyone who's experienced living in temperatures that drop to the negative 20-40 will attest that to long in the weather without proper protection can send you delirious, you can slip into sleep/coma and die. The human body regardless of how tough you think you are will die in these conditions. Having a big steel door and steel grated vent systems would be difficult to open with a bunch of crowbars. The acting started OK, but got progressively bad and the characters intelligence progressively dumber.\n\nThis movie is utterly crap. Don't watch it. Don't download it. Don't rent it."

That put me off a bit and i almost started looking for something else to watch, but then I remembered that most of the blockbusters with major stars in them and no plot whatsoever had a 7-ish rating nowadays. So I decided to go for it. And man was I pleased.\n\nIt reminded me of a blend of Screamers (1995), The Thing (1982), Mad Max 2 (1981) and Alive (1993). The beginning was a bit slow, nothing new or surprising. But then I realized it was not a movie to expect something revolutionary out of - it was a homage to the simple, straight-to-the- point movies with a good atmosphere. Sure, there were a lot of plot holes , questionable moments and reactions and it did not introduce anything out of the ordinary. But you know what - I'm actually glad it didn't. It was a genuinely good watch, didn't take itself too seriously, it just came, did its job and went away even sooner than I expected.\n\nA recommended title for the ones who are into cinema not only for the summer blockbusters and cheap one-liners. I feel this one is meant for us lot who can appreciate a sincere old-school flick.\n\n4/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Colony could have flourished with good visual and cast, but it squanders the potential before it enters the second act. The main issue is how stagnant and predictable the plot progresses, screenplay it uses is the very generic template for sci-fi genre. It barely possesses any unique qualities, and by the time the movie is over, it will be either forgettable or interchangeable with any mediocre films.\n\nStory follows the survivors on Colony 7, led by Briggs (Laurence Fishburne). They have been plagued with the dangerous common cold, in which everyone who even shows symptoms are quarantined, possibly exiled or even killed. They also receive strange message from Colony 5, their neighbor colony and must go to examine whether it's real or not. The overall concept holds some promise, but there are far too many boring narratives and stupid behaviors from the characters to fully realize its prospect.\n\nScript is highly foreseeable, down to the sob stories of the survivors, which to the film's credit, would be salvageable if it actually portrays them instead of having guys talk about it. Characters also perform a few needless monologues that don't help setting the tension, they merely drag the movie by a few minutes. Furthermore, many of the characters' decision are moronic, the film tries to convince audience with stress or fear excuse, and even if that's true, it's still stupid by any stretch. This is the equivalent of seeing someone decide to split up in horror flick.\n\nVisual is pretty exceptional, it has good sharp contour and vibrant color. However, most of it are used in ordinary hallway full of pipes or barren wastelands, the most notably landmark is broken bridge which could very well be featured in half dozen other sci-fi films. The actors aren't that bad either, it's just the material is too thin and lacking any suspense for them to capitalize on.\n\nThe Colony might have bits that could've worked, but with too predictable execution and uninspiring plot, a visit isn't exactly recommended."

Not to mention that midway of the movie, seems people are hit by a retarded wave that freezes their brains and ability to think, which cant help but disappoint me.

The setting, set design, and atmospherics were excellent as depicted in Dark Water (2005), The Numbers Station(2013), and Silent Hill (2006). The plot outline basic, but decent. Yet unlike John Carpenter's remake of The Thing (1982), Colony has a great build up but seemingly loses its way and devolves into a stereotypical, violent chaos with not much in the way of intelligent script writing.\n\nThe premise of isolated pockets of humanity in a bleak ice-bound, frozen land, the mysterious SOS message, the lonely, dangerous search, the discovery and even further tidbit of hope all are fabulous in their presentation. Bill Pullman's role and how the script relates him to others is uneasily handled, sometimes distractedly. By the last third of the movie, the lazy hand of reverting to a quick ending is all that's left and even the final rule of \"survival\" becomes a seemingly flag for failure as if moral depravity really is the ultimate moral goodness."

The weapons used by the defenders is slap dash at best and considering they could scavenge a whole city you would think someone would at least forge swords or make bows and arrows for protection.\n\nThe end was left open for the sequel which I hope never gets made. I know everyone needs a pay check but this one seemed really bad for Fisbourne and Paxton."

The film does not have the tension it could have had, with another director and very good actors. Good things: The subject is generous and could have been an extraordinary film directed by, let's say, Stanley Kubrick or Franklin J. Schaffner, the director of \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968). Unfortunately, they both direct films in another dimension."

Throw in the timeless Lawrence Fishburne, the man would give credibility to a soiled diaper and the versatile veteran, Bill Paxton and the only thing missing is the popcorn! Fishburne and Paxton are flawless in portraying their characters in what can only be described as a launch pad for young and adequate, Kevin Zegers.\n\nDirector, Jeff Renfroe has been more involved with TV and although The Colony isn't a bad effort, it lacks that 'gripping' factor. Once the credits role you can't help but shrug and feel let down since the plot had so much potential. It's not a, bad film, it's more of a 'not bad' film.

        "review_title": "Beautiful arctic landscapes but not much more",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Colony\" had all the right ingredients for a great science fiction film, but the end result of this movie was disappointing. To jump to the story line briefly, \"The Colony\" is a movie about a group of humans living in an futuristic setting where Earth has literally froze into a second ice age. They reside in an arctic outpost trying to survive, preserving plants, animals, and other necessities to preserve life. Things turn weary where another outpost sends out a distress signal. Without spoiling the film, I will just say that \"The Colony\" is a lackluster, B grade science fiction film at best. And that makes me sad because I really wanted to like this movie. Bill Paxton, a fantastic veteran actor of epic films like, \"Aliens\" and \"Apollo 13\" played a completely hate-able character in this film that was just too out of character for him. Laurence Fishburne had some decent screen time but also came off a bit short compared to his previous performances like in \"The Matrix\" and \"Event Horizon\". I don't think it was either actors faults but more so these cookie-cutter type characters they had to play. As far as the main role goes, it was played by Canadian actor Kevin Zegers. He was decent in this film but not the best choice in my opinion for the lead role. He just doesn't have that on screen spark for me.\n\nBesides focusing on the two big names in this film, the rest of the film just fell short. The movie (unlike other films) seemed to end to short and quickly. I was expecting far more. The character development was very poor as well and the whole angle of this movie just a bit off. This movie ended up being some freakshow horror film in the end and I think it it was focused on being a survival/adventure film more with a less hate-able role from Paxton, I think this film would have been great. Lastly on the plus side, this film does got some good camera work and visuals. Very pretty arctic scenery and the underground colonies look nice. But other than the visuals, I can't say much about the rest of this film. It was pretty lackluster. Regardless, I do think it's worth a watch if you like sci fi fans and are a fan of Fishburne and Paxton (even though their roles weren't that great). But chalk this one up as a \"rental only\" because in the end, this movie is just pretty crappy."

So, we've seen this a hundred times before; people just trying to survive in an underground bunker in a post-apocalyptic world. The visuals are not the best and maybe not always believable, but at least there's a good story here and characters I care about. The film only really gains momentum around the halfway mark, once the rescue team reaches Colony 5.\n\nThe moment they reach Colony 5, the film accelerates to bring us an action-packed horror adventure in a frozen world. I loved it. It was creepy, suspenseful, thrilling, exciting. There were horror, explosions, fighting, shooting. And off course, all hell broke loose during the film's heart pounding final act. It does end very abruptly, though. I wanted it to run at least another twenty minutes or so. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this."

Not very believable and way to much suspense building up to what is already expected. Dramatic over used score that we have all heard a thousand times before in every other slasher/zombie movie.

Judging by the trailer I was looking forward to this one because I liked Day After Tomorrow and that's what the trailer reminded me of. While the idea was similar the movie wasn't. The first thing I have to say is that the trailer was exciting and tense, the movie wasn't. I found myself really struggling to stay interested in this and waiting for it to be over. The \"twist\" while not unexpected was a little bit of a surprise but not interesting enough to change the way I felt about the movie.

Laurence Fishburne is an excellent actor, but he looks like he's eaten one too many big mac's. Kevin Zegers is far more talented than the material he seems to get. Frozen & Transamerica have proved my point. I also didn't really warm up to any of the characters. I was just bored silly, and couldn't find anything worthwhile to finish the movie.

        "review_title": "After the Snowpocalypse, it's Winterworld",
        "review_detailed_main": "Released in 2013, \"The Colony\" is a post-apocalyptic movie about life in North America after the next ice age hits. Laurence Fishburne stars as the leader of an underground colony with Bill Paxton (R.I.P.) as his problematic assistant. Kevin Zegers plays a younger guy who rises to the challenge when contact with a neighboring colony is lost and a trio treks the winter wilderness to check on the status of its inhabitants.\n\nMy wife watched this movie on DVD before I did and, knowing it was some kind of wintery post-apocalyptic movie, I naturally asked her: \"Are there mutants in it?\" By \"mutants\" I meant, of course, any number of antagonists typical to the genre \u2013 zombies, cannibals, diseased tramps, monsters, etc. She didn't respond, but I knew the answer and was right. So this is a hackneyed post-apocalyptic movie; the question is: Does it rise to the challenge within that increasingly stale sci-fi/horror/action genre? Is there something about it that's fresh and invigorating?\n\nThe answer is \"no.\" There are obvious elements of numerous similar flicks, like \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (2004), \"Day of the Dead\" (1985), \"The Thing\" (1982), \"Aliens\" (1979), \"Aliens\" (1986) and the first two \"Planet of the Apes\" movies (1968, 1970). That said, \"The Colony\" is solid for what it is, which is helped by the fact that it doesn't overstay its welcome at 94 minutes. The CGI backdrops are convincing, albeit a little cartoonish, and I found myself drawn into the world of the characters. It's a good thing Charlotte Sullivan is on hand as the protagonist's babe, though.\n\nThe dramatic first half of the movie is a slow-build to the action-packed second half with its revelation of the main villain(s), which is underwhelming when revealed (I'm not going to give it away). I will say that there is a character played by Dru Viergever who's garbed like Pinhead's little brother or perhaps a rejected vampire from \"Underworld\" (2003). Whatever the case, I chuckled a few times upon eyeing his stereotypical menacing expressions/antics.\n\nThe movie's further brought down by the predictable political correctness wherein the sage leader is a seasoned black man and his unofficial second-in-command is a moral, intelligent & beautiful white woman. These two are naturally contrasted by the selfish and sociopathic \"aging white guy,\" a symbol of all that is wrong with the world (rolling my eyes).\n\nA Canadian production, the movie was shot at some defunct underground power plant in North Bay, Canada, with (I presume) establishing shots from Lapland, Finland, and studio work done in Toronto. DIRECTOR: Jeff Renfroe. WRITERS: Renfroe, Patrick Tarr, Pascal Trottier & Svet Rouskov. Atticus Mitchell has a small role.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read unless you've seen the movie):\n\nThe aforementioned \"mutants\" turn out to be merely \"humans gone feral,\" as Fishburne's character describes them. Cracked cannibals or not, wouldn't their priority be acquiring food supplies rather than senseless slaughter? Moreover, does it make sense to forgo a good take of fresh meat to wander the ruthless winter wilderness searching for even more food when it's not a for sure endeavor? Do farmers slaughter all their livestock at once? There are too many logical holes."

        "review_title": "Interesting concept",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Colony (2013) takes us to a post-apocalyptic, snow-covered Earth where survival is a constant struggle. Set in a world plagued by perpetual winter and disease, the film follows a small group of survivors in an underground bunker as they grapple with dwindling resources, food shortages, and the omnipresent threat of disease. When they lose contact with another colony, a small team sets out into the frozen wasteland to investigate, uncovering horrors they weren't prepared for.\n\nOn the plus side, The Colony has a solid premise, promising a mix of sci-fi and horror that could appeal to fans of dystopian survival narratives. Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Zegers bring a steady presence to their roles, doing their best to add depth to somewhat one-dimensional characters. The set design effectively conveys a cold, gritty atmosphere that matches the bleakness of the plot. The stark visuals and suspenseful moments give a strong impression of isolation, adding to the movie's dark tone.\n\nHowever, The Colony suffers from some drawbacks that hold it back. The script often feels underdeveloped, leaving intriguing themes like humanity's adaptability and the cost of survival barely explored. Additionally, the pacing can be sluggish, with a lack of substantial character development or emotional depth. The movie's horror element relies heavily on predictable jump scares rather than building genuine tension, which may disappoint genre enthusiasts looking for a more layered thrill. The plot also feels rushed towards the end, with an overly familiar climax that wraps up too conveniently.\n\nOverall, The Colony is a mixed bag. It delivers some engaging moments and visuals that hint at what could have been a more complex story. For casual fans of post-apocalyptic thrillers, it may provide a couple of hours of moderate entertainment. But for those seeking a film with richer themes or more inventive storytelling, The Colony falls a bit short."

He then requests two volunteers to go with him to investigate, with the main protagonist named, Sam (Kevin Zegers) being one the two to join him. What happens next would question the logic regarding the situation regarding cannibals or people who act like cannibals who can endure more cold weather than the humans themselves, and contain super human abilities which is not explained to viewers how they acquired it just by becoming one. Or was it a virus, that able them to be stronger than the average human being, for the movie never explains."

So infected people may leave the colony or be shot dead under colonial law. Such colonies are invaded by a group of human beings who have become cannibals without food.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Colony is directed by Jeff Renfroe (HAVEN, ALMOST HUMAN & BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) so he has a good eye for visuals, as you can see through his latest film. Originally this film was going to be a big budget ensemble cast piece, but thankfully they used big names & used the budget for the visuals. This amazing apocalyptic sci-fi horror has everything in it.\n\nIt stars Kevin Zegers (Adam Green's FROZEN), Laurence Fishburne, & Bill Paxton both of which have acted in their far share of the sci-fi, action & horror genre. Kevin Zegers plays SAM, a almost anti-hero character who doesn't find his place till later on in the film but through his eyes & perspective we see that world needs him in more ways than one. Laurence Fishburne & Bill Paxton play two ex-soldiers Briggs and Mason who team up early on to start a colony of survivors during this whiteout that covers the earth. Both are so different as one is a born leader, the other just wants to lead but both bring so much to their characters that they immerse you into the icy hell that it's hard to see who is right and who is wrong.\n\nIn the future, Earth is covered in an Ice Age. The survivors live in facilities underground named Colonies, ergo the name. When people from Colony 5 release a distress signal, the leader of Colony 7 Briggs (played by Fishburne) organizes an expedition with Sam (Zegers) and Graydon (played by Atticus Mitchell who brings a good level of faux bravery & fear to the role) to investigate what has happened to their neighboring colonists. Briggs leaves the scientist Kai (played by the beautiful Charlotte Sullivan) in charge of the group, disappointing his former friend Mason (Paxton).\n\nWalking for days, they finally reach the facility where the fifty said persons reside and they find only one survivor - Leland (played brilliantly by Julian Richings of CUBE & Wrong Turn) so scared to death that he's locked himself in a room deep in the facility. They soon come to realize that something far worse than the cold is hunting humans. The visuals and the cinematography are amazing especially considering that this is the first movie to be shot at the decommissioned NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) base in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe interior shots of the base gives the isolation and claustrophobic feel much like that of the original ALIEN film. The exterior shots which were mainly used with green screen but real snow to give the true effects of the cold hell they had to endure had beautiful destruction and chaos, quite a reminiscence of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW meets THE THING.\n\nThe tension builds amazingly well also, not just because of the trek and the weather conditions they have to endure but claustrophobia plays a huge part in this film. The tension also meets with a few good shocks of realism as well due to the human condition and what one does to survive in any condition of despair.\n\nThis film has a touch of several great nods to it especially considering the budget they had. It gives nods to (some I mentioned earlier) MAD MAX, THE THING, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, as well as THE HILLS HAVE EYES. The solid tension build up, the acting, the visuals all are top notch.\n\nI highly recommend this film."

With a very limited budget of 16 million, it manages to give us visuals and settings easily on par with Hollywood blockbusters. The apocalyptic tundra spreads out in front of you frozen to the bone and you can really feel the chill setting in.\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the film fails to impress. Laurence Fishburne is the only actor worth mentioning and even then the script doesn't give him much to work with. The rest are mainly painfully average and don't give us anything to remember them by.\n\nThen there's the script which offers us what we absolutely have to have for us to call this film a passable experience. When I tell you that it's an ice age apocalypse with two colonies struggling to survive together, you can pretty much guess what will happen. The story doesn't deviate away from the basic scripture at all and every single turn is easily predictable and something we have seen hundreds of times before.\n\nHonestly, I'm more disappointed than I'm angry. There is promise here. The visuals are impressive given the budget, and even some of the action is above average. If only it had had something to call its own, I would have been able to recommend this, but as it is, there are far better films out there."

A distress call from a nearby colony brings a whole new level of threat.\n\nI'll take into account the fact that this was a B movie when I do my review, clearly not a big budget blockbuster, more a c list sci fi clunker.\n\nIt's not bad film as such, but it's a close run thing. I liked the visuals, liked the acting and I felt it had a sense of atmosphere. The main problem, the story sucked, it just wasn't very interesting, it offered absolutely nothing new.\n\nA good start, average middle, and an ending that came so abruptly, it hardly felt like a conclusion, it honestly felt like they simply ran out of either time or budget.\n\nYou never feel that you're into it, there's a lot happening, but it all feels disjointed, it doesn't flow. There are some nice action scenes, and the alien beings look pretty good.\n\nI thought Dru Viergever was rather good as the leader of the alien marauders, he certainly looked the part, he had an imposing presence.\n\n5/10."

It was really enjoyable with a suspenseful atmosphere and it was actually quite scary at some points which I wasn't expecting! I'm a fan of this genre and the scary is not \"ghost\" scary but a real kind of terror you'd feel if you were in the situation.\n\nI was expecting it to be a typical B kind of movie but the general atmosphere was everything other than that.\n\nThe main character reminded me of Zac Efron all the time but I suppose that is highly irrelevant, just saying!"

I tried to get into it by mocking how bad it is, to enjoy it in the 'so bad it's good' sense, but it is so bad it's bad, not good. I still gave it two stars because, believe it or not, it is much better than some of the other (many) total pieces of crap that are included on Amazon Prime. The set design and wardrobe are probably the best aspects of it. The score blatantly rips off Maria and Autumn Leaves; the makeup department is desperately trying to justify its existence (and failing). Some of the scenes, in terms of the decisions the characters make, are so preposterous that I became angry while watching this film. It probably could've actually been good with a different writer and a different director. It's a shame that talented actors and production crews are having to settle for this kind of utter crap these days. Most of the movies included on Amazon Prime probably should never have been made."

And the main bad guy, with no name, no story, no background - just a pure evil makes a very good villain presence. Bill Paxton was, well lets just say not in his best form. The main hero was a compelling one.\n\nIf you like these Sci-Fi flicks, bloody, scary at the moments than \"The Colony\" is not to be missed one."

It did set up very simply for a sequel but I guess that never happened. Run time was a lull short, ie it could have gone deeper in places, but perhaps it benefits from not trying to outstay it's welcome.\n\n5.3 on IMDB gave me pause to whether I should watch it or not, but I'm pleased I did."

Overwhelming in its imagery and emotionally raw in its breathtaking prescience, this is a motion picture that should be shown in every young person's classroom. Laurence Fishburne gives a performance of a lifetime here and is supported by an outstanding cast. Pay attention to the message and you will understand why the issues depicted in this movie are the most significant of our time. That is the unrelenting impact which is indeed The Colony."
