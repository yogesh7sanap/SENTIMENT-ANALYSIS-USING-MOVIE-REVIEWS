Great cast, Nicole Kidman, Joey King, Zac Efron and the always amazing Kathy Bates.\n\nWhile on paper the casting is great, but when you watch this weak romcom it's easy to see that Efron and Kidman have been miscast. Either one would probably have worked very well with another actor but together Efron and Kidman are quite frankly, awful, in this. They have zero chemistry and to me looks like they couldn't even fake it. Their faces seem to lack the ability to portray any natural emotive expressions whatsoever. They are 100% not believable as lovers which makes it really impossible to root for their relationship.\n\nBates is her usual lovely self, and King is excellent, providing the only comic relief here. They completely carry this film.\n\nAvoid."

That only furthers the artificiality of it all.\n\nThe plot evolves in a predictable way, on the acting side there are no standouts and it's directed without much flair. It's astonishing that all the prominent names behind and before the camera agreed to make such a nothing of a movie."

I wasn't surprised by Nicole because it's typical for woman in Hollywood, but I was surprised by how Zac looked who is still in his 30s. As others have written, both of their faces are very distracting. I came to the reviews to see if anyone was feeling the same way. I also agree that there is zero chemistry and the acting is subpar. I agree Kathy Bates is good and the daughter really carries the movie. Kind of painful to watch and I am very, very easy to please with rom cons."

Add to that the very dated plot of younger successful self-obsessed man falls for older woman who just happens to be the mother of his young female assistant played with girlish zeal by Joey King.\n\nVeteran actor Kathy Bates as Brooke's mother in law does her best given the material she has to work with.\n\nThe love scenes between Brooke and Chris are cringe-worthy to watch as they both seem so awkward !"

While I'm glad I watched it, I would say it fell short of my expectations. The storyline is average and in parts a little messy. Some of the chemistry between characters feels a little too forced tho this could be down to how the script has been written rather than the actors capabilities. There was definitely atleast one scene I didn't feel worked at all and was a poor choice when written for the direction they wanted the storyline to go.\n\nI wouldn't say this movie was absolutely awful, the actors do a great job in their respective roles with Joey King probably giving the best performance of the main leads. The ending was a little predictable and I could see where it was going to end up ahead of time. Not the worst watch, an average rom com at best. For me it wasn't enjoyable or memorable enough to make me want to rewatch in future so this will likely be a one time viewing."

I don't mind a long intellectual movie once in a while but im the kinda guy who will have fun with a toilet humor Adam Sandler comedy.\n\nBut over my \"leniance\" toward movies, i don't get what the peoples complain here. I didn't notice such a \"lack of chemistry\" between Chris and Brooke. Maybe its because i watched in French but it was perfectly fine for me.\n\nAs for the plastic surgery that i read in so many other reviews... Well Nicole Kidman was doing movies i was a kid and i am almost 40. She is 57 ... For a woman her age, i think she looks great. I will admit Zac Efron does look a bit older than in my memories but then again the guy is 36 now, he ain't 20 something anymore. Sure i could pick up that he had some work done but it didn't distract me like some of these reviewers.\n\nOverall the star was Joey King as Zara. Its her movie. I think she was great. Charismatic, cute, and i enjoyed the interactions with Chris.\n\nAs for the rest yeah its a bit as your usual romcom exept the focus this time ain't on the main character love story but her mom, but again is that an issue? You either like these movies or you don't. Personally i did.\n\nI would give it a 7.5 out of 10 but due to the system i must settle on a 7 out of 10."

The chemistry between Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman was palpable, so I feel they did a good job. And, although they made Zac Efron's character out to be a womanizer, I didn't feel like it was that far off or unbelievable: Insert Leonardo DiCaprio. Further, I absolutely love Kathy Bates in pretty much anything she does, and although she was a peripheral and predictable character, she still managed to bring a lot of life to her role. Zoey King... this wasn't a heavy weight movie by any means, but I definitely see her talent here. Especially when she hit her head after she caught her boss and mom together! So funny!\n\nSo, overall, I would recommend it. I wouldn't put too much emphasis on how \"great\" it was, because I always end up hating highly praised movies; they just never live up to the hype, but there have been so many other movies far worse than this one, like Lindsay Lohan's Irish Wish for example, that this one was was actually cute and I would say good.\n\nDefinitely give it a try!"

The setup just didn't land. Everything seemed forced to go along with what the plot requires. I think a different script could have made a big difference.\n\nWhich is ironic, given a plot of the movie.\n\n\"A Family Affair\" is simply not funny nor romantic. Joey KIng's character just comes across as bitter and hateful, rather than being a humorous obstacle to Efron's and Kidman's characters that she really needed to be."

Outside of the three leads, the supporting characters could've used a little bit more development, but overall it was a fun light romance, and I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again. I know the older woman, younger man dynamic isn't anything new but it was still a fun watch. And Kathy Bates is always a delight, no matter what she does."

Main protagonist is Zara, not Chris and Brooke, they are just background players.\n\nBut even those they got somehow believable (one might argue) character arcs (depending on how you are feeling about Nicole and Zac. But I would say its more about \"how you are feeling how Nicole and Zac look like\", which seems to be much bigger issue for majority of people. I could understand that, but I find it funny for reviewers yelling \"you should be aging gracefully\", which feeling completely overwhelms their engagement with these characters. So they see them only how they look like, not how they behave, act. Which I find really meta.)\n\nI think people would find couple of additional stars in their reviews, if they will stop thinking about this as a rom com movie.\n\nIt is not a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but it still has some interesting under tones, which are completely flying over audience heads.

        "review_detailed_main": "Just like Amazon's 'The Idea of You', this film visits the age-gap romance of the older woman (who's 'normal') with the younger man (who's famous).\n\nHere, in this iteration, the plot is split between the character Zara Ford and her aspirations to produce films and using her celebrity boss, Chris Cole, to get there and her single mother, author/writer Brooke Harwood, who discovers an exciting connection with her daughter's boss.\n\nRomance movies are, at its core, simple tropes and relies on those standard cliches. That's what we love about romance movies. What elevates the basic romance is the chemistry and overall plot that at least tries to throw some 'thing' to make it less typical and a tad more elevated or has decent acting.\n\nSadly, A Family Affair fails on many fronts. My rating is purely for Kathy Bates as the MIL to Kidman's character, whose husband has been gone 10+ years before, and the daughter, Zara Ford, played by Joey King, who is the PA to an obnoxious, shallow and selfish self-proclaimed movie star.\n\nThe number one problem are our leads. The age-gap, a trope in and of itself, is no the problem. There is absolutely zero chemistry between Kidman (who plays Brook Harwood) and Efron (who plays Chris Cole). Not to mention that their very faces are terribly distracting--in that, they've both had so much work done, you can't help but notice it and not really get past it. If there had been decent chemistry between them, all that could be forgiven to a degree.\n\nThe second issue is the acting. It's...rather terrible. Especially by Kidman and Efron, the latter whose ability is more Hallmark B-level skills. The only saving grace was King and Bates, who made it even remotely watchable.\n\nI think the plot angle of King's character is actually a fun idea and King executes it brilliantly. She carries the movie. However, the rest of the plot is pretty miserable and nothing to really swoon at.\n\nAlso, because this movie came out so soon after Anne Hathaway's similar movie, which also lacked chemistry between its leads, it takes the general winds out of this movie. Ultimately, this did have potential as the plot isn't bad. Who knew that Efron and Kidman would suck and actually hurt the movie vs make it better?\n\nIf anything, watch it for Joey King and Kathy Bates."

And mostly Nicole Kidman is so fake! She doesn't even smile, and the filters they added to hide her wrinkles are just a joke. I would have loved this movie with another actress - there are so many beautiful natural actresses that also can act!\n\nThe daughter and grandma are saving the movie.

I also thought all of the performances were well done.\n\nAs far as the 'plastic' goes, I'm not a big fan of the type of plastic surgery a lot of celebrities have, and I have to wonder if it's all done by the same doctor, but in an industry where success is very largely dependent on looks, I can't blame the participants for trying to extend their careers by ridding themselves of the signs of aging. And for the most part, we can blame ourselves (the audience) for that, because we don't really want to see wrinkles and imperfections on the screen.\n\nI liked the film and would recommend it for a pleasant feel-good experience."

It's just a rom com and it lives up to being a rom com, you know, fairy tale romance that seems too unreal but so fun and dreamy. I'm sorry about her face.

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of what I saw in this movie has already, in just a few reviews, been said. For me? The script could have been reworked and maybe a decent movie could have come out of it. But the whole first 25 minutes of this movie concentrates on Chris Cole's mindless and terrible mental abuse of the character, Zara Ford. He is so absolutely horrible to her that I found myself thinking he is a woman hating man who never outgrew his teens.\n\nThen, she finally, to my relief, quits the job and decides to move on. So far, there was a lot of material to work with.\n\nSuddenly, Chris goes to Zara's house and meets her mother, Brooke Harwood. And here is where this movie fell off the rails in a way I have never seen in a Rom/Com. So, Chris, Played by Zac Efron, meets the Mom and within minutes they are kissing. I'm not sure I can do the mess of this script Justice here, but I'll try. When I found out Chris was supposed to be significantly younger than Brooke, I was stunned. NO WAY!! Suddenly, somehow, this child man grows up and falls in love with Brooke, the mother of Zara who spent 2 years being unspeakably abused by the man child. I'm sorry, what started out promising? Ended up unbelieavable.\n\nSo, Nicole Kidman played the mother who, for reasons I do not understand, falls in love in one scene with this man who has been verbally abusing her daughter for two years? Huh? She definitely should have passed on this movie! Two different actors and a massive rewrite might have changed the dynamic. Kathy Bates could not save this terrible movie. Miscast, badly written, poorly executed. The actress who played Zara was the only truly good actor in this film. Pass this one by. So sad to see so much talent wasted on a bad script, poor directing, and overall unbelievable story. I gave it a two, which it didn't deserve, because I just could not give so much wasted talent a one star. That makes as much sense as this movie!!! Just wish I could unsee this one!"

It's about the 24 year old daughter. This is her story. For me it's about self involvement and the realisation that others exist. The \"romance\" is the catalyst, not the focus.\n\nThere are some lovely set pieces. It's a gentle watch, the main drama is from Zara everyone else is reasuringly mature, well except for Chris. Maybe that's the reason that people and critics suggest there isn't romance. That the chemistry is lacking. Of course Chris is smitten by Brooke, she's gorgeous and real. She isn't interested in celebrity or should I say Chris's Movie star status. Brooke is cautious, love happens when you least expect it.\n\nThere's nothing new in the plot, we all know how it will end. We all know the trajectory but how we get there is worth the watch. I loved it, the last scene is pure brilliance."

Zack and Nicole did a pretty convincing job in their scenes. I'm a sucker for love stories and i personally love them if the woman is older(comparatively).

Both Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron look straight up scary, as if their Madame Tussauds wax figurines had come to life. Nicole is supposed to be very attractive in this, and why is her daughted so aggressively unattractive? Is that youth shaming? What justified casting Efron in the role? David duchovny, for eg, would have made the whole thing infinitely more interesting. Or, really, anyone without a wax figure.\n\nReminded me of bill burr's question: \"What would you rather be: 52 and look 52, or 52 and look like a 28 year-old lizard?\"\n\nAlso, let's point out the difference between talent and trash: Barbie is a movie about barbie dolls, with actors acting like plastic dolls, but at no point do actors look like they have plastic in their face. Great movie. This movie is about humans who look like barbie dolls that spent time next to an open fire.\n\nHorrid production, and genuinely unhealthy."

Predictable storyline of a mom who has done her duty, raised her child and now open to serendipitous romance. Joey King & Kathy Bates were good and natural in their roles. Great to see 3 generations of women bonding well with so much love. A nice change from the wierdo relationships we normally see glorified in movies. I wish there had been more character development to show Chris growing up from the prima donna to a real person to match the serene person he's falling in love with. I hate to comment on anyone's looks but Nicole Kidman looks unhealthy and unreal. Watch it when you have mindless time to kill."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't decide who in this movie is the most annoying, Nicole Kidman, the daughter, Zac Effron or Kathy Bates. Probably Nicole Kidman, Miss Perfect, with her stiff face, basically a statue with moving lips. But then again Zac is pretty annoying too, with his overly developed pecs and superficial personality even when trying to covey -- I am much deeper than you thought. Then again the daughter with her fake upper lip is also annoying in her own way and that lip is most distracting. It just doesn't make it as a love story because you just don't feel anything for these two, at least I don't. They are seem talking, laughing together, hugging smooching, so you are meant to think wow these two really love each other, but it just doesn't click. Kathy Bates as the ex-mother-in-law, gives a few homespun homilies and liberated advice that comes across as sappy, not meaningful. All in all bad."

It is by no means very original, and not very ambitious, and it does not pretend to be so, but I found it entertaining, with funny dialogue delivered in a n natural way, with Joey King being stellar, Zac Efron much better than expected, and Kathy Bates excellent as always. The weak point was Nicole Kidman, and yes, the amount of plastic surgery work is off-putting at best. Not a movie I would ever watch again, butI would recommend to watch as light entertainment on a rainy night."

The end scene of Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman trying to kiss each other with their plastic lips that no longer have normal functioning ability.....felt like a horror scene. Additionally, the sex scene looked like a alienistic-paranormal scare. It's going to take time to burn that out of my memory. Save yourself a therapy session. Skip this movie.

She has no comedic timing and was badly misdirected - one minute giving her familiar American voice then going full Aussie and in one scene not even acting her persona at all, just being regular Nicole. Aesthetically she looks perfect in that Hollywood way so I won't comment on her personal beauty choices.\n\nI made it through to the end and don't think the overall idea itself is bad but the ending was way too cheesy for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "8.1 stars.\n\nI've been reading several reviews to gauge general opinions because I genuinely love this film. However, unlike iconic romances with lines like \"You had me at hello,\" this one is effective in its own right, despite some actors appearing to have undergone unnecessary cosmetic procedures. Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman, for instance, didn't need alterations to their already great faces. It's baffling why they chose to undergo such procedures when so few achieve the desired results.\n\nSetting aside unrealistic expectations, this film offers a raw and emotionally satisfying romance. It centers on Zara (played by King) and a semi-narcissistic movie star who also happens to be her boss (played by Efron). She is his personal assistant aspiring to become a producer. Their dynamic shifts when Chris and Zara's mother, Brooke (played by Kidman), develop a romantic connection. Initially unsettling for Zara, this budding relationship evolves into something deeper, complicated by Chris's history of fleeting romances that Zara must manage on a regular basis.\n\nThe story ventures into the potential fallout of Brooke's heartbreak. Zara, who has always lived in Brooke's shadow as a famous writer, feels compelled to protect her mother despite their complex relationship. The situation intensifies with the involvement of Leila (played by Bates), Zara's grandmother, whose wisdom adds another layer of insight. Without realizing it, Zara has become the person she least admires, a self-centered woman who cares not about the feelings of anyone around her. Life has become all about her lately, and her mother and friends are suffering while she continues to focus on her own needs. Her best friend finally points out her selfishness and the drama intensifies.\n\nBeyond the complexities, this film is a wonderfully intricate romantic comedy. Look past the cosmetic enhancements and appreciate it for the engaging love story it portrays."

I lasted halfway through in the hope it'd somehow get better, but every minute of that was awful.\n\nI watched the movie because Nicole Kidman is in it. I enjoy her acting and she's been in some brilliant films.\n\nI hate to say, she was terrible in this. She didn't inhabit her character at all. What it looked like was just a series of her striking poses and reading from a script. And her voice was weirdly shy and \"little girlish\" for a woman of her age who was meant to be a distinguished writer. She wasn't believable as either the girl's mother or as a woman falling for a man.\n\nZac Efron was ok, not great. The role he was given was pretty flat to start with. His strange looks didn't help. I thought he was meant to be the same age as Nicole's character - like, a film star in his late 40s who'd gotten too much plastic surgery. Then Nicole says he's \"16 years younger\". At which point, I have to go google Zac's actual age. So, okay, from what I read, he had an accident to his chin that caused issues. The lips and entire face are huge, but maybe he had to do this to even things out. Sadly, the look is bizarre.\n\nThe young woman who played Nicole's daughter (Zoey) was a delight to watch. She inhabited the role and gave it her all. Same for Kathy Bates.\n\nWhich brings us to the script. Did a group of people check it or read it? Didn't anyone figure that it was flat and didn't make sense? How does something like this manage to get made and with a cast of big name actors?\n\nTrue, I'm not a rom-com viewer, but I've watched some in the past that were great. This was not, not for a minute of what I watched."

The doubt that she might be too old, how the fancy dresses in her closet now seem to make her look foolish.\n\nI agree with comments about the lack of chemistry and the plasticity. Nicole often seems awkward, as if she's acting.\n\nJoey King was the best thing, and it was always really about her. Also, there were a few good lines that made me laugh.\n\nI'd say it was superficial but not insubstantial."

These types of movies rely heavily on performances and execution. Here, the storytelling is monotone and it just doesn't go anywhere or have any high moment. The short runtime surely keeps you from getting bored, but you start to miss getting something more out of it.\n\nZac Efron in the lead is decent enough, and Nicole Kidman as the mother has an endearing presence.

The costume designer deserves a special shout-out as all the characters look ravishing in the well made costumes.\n\nA weak screenplay is surely a bummer for this film, taking it nowhere.

But now ever since I saw her play Jason Mamoas mother in Aquaman, that admiration has dwindled. Over the years she's altered her physical appearance so much (not for the better) that now all I see is a heavily noticed face, which make it hard for her to show much expressions and she can shake hands with Zac Eff on that one. Age is just a number, but there is no on screen chemistry between the two actors - quite putting off and revolting actually. Ridiculous script too and such a waste of talent- even Joey King could have done better."

If you're living in 12 inches of snow and have not left your home in over 4 years, the settings are a beautiful escape.\n\nI'm not familiar with Joey King, but she is adorable and enthusiastically entertaining.\n\nI only know Zac from \"Iron Claw\" so this performance is quite different. His Movie Star persona is a tour de force! \"A gift from a Tibetan monk I met in Santa Barbara!\" I laughed out loud.

Portraying the type of character where she excels in which is no surprise. Efron plays the fictional self absorbed movie star and he does it well.

Considering this, we would see where the conflict occurs.\n\nDespite the lower expected reviews, this is still a mindless and harmless all be it predictable but still enjoyable enough comedy.

Joey King is fun to watch but she alone can't undo the damage.\n\nThere is no chemistry between Zac and Nicole Kidman.

A Family Affair has much better acting, writing, directing, editing, costumes etc. - all the things that contribute to a movie's overall cheesiness or lack thereof. So while I didn't feel any heat between Nicole and Zach, this movie was considerably less cheesy than some other rom-com s and I therefore gave it a solid 7. It's not an Oscar contender but is enjoyable enough to pass 90 minutes with. And looking at Zach for 90 minutes wasn't too hard on the eyes. I really enjoyed the daughter's and grandma's acting. (The daughter's scene where she hit her head was hysterical). Thought Zach did well. Nicole was the weakest for me in this movie. And I just recently watched her in The Perfect Couple and thought she was great in that. To me she feels a bit cool; I don't see her as a passionate love interest. But as the matriarch in a family accused of murder she was great.\n\nA Family Affair is enjoyable but just don't expect it to be super memorable."

I think said celebrities call in favors to get a job for their inexperienced family members, hence these terrible, terrible movies. This movie was 100% predictable and 1000% overacted. Netflix must be paying the actors a shockingly large amount of money, because how else would they draw star power like Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron, Kathy Bates, and Joey King? And there must be a clause in the contract that allows them to phone in their performances and never have to change their facial expressions, which guarantees zero chemistry on screen. Normally, I love silly rom-coms; I have no problem suspending my disbelief for the sake of a plotline, but this was just so, so bad. The plot is embarrassingly predictable, the dialogue is nothing but exposition, and the acting is somehow both bland and exceedingly overacted at the same time. At this point I think I must be part of the problem, because why would I keep paying more money for a Netflix subscription and thereby enabling them to create this kind of garbage over and over again? Goodbye, Netflix. And please, Hollywood, please go back to quality over quantity."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I had to write a review to try and balance out all the surprisingly negative ones. It's a much better movie (in my opinion) than one would expect given all the hate it's getting over here! I wouldn't give it 8 stars in the realm of ALL movies of all time. But as a fun, light-hearted romcom with a bit of a deeper message, it's great!\n\nI've read some of the other reviews and am wondering whether I watched the same movie. Funnily enough, I also watched The Idea of You recently and had the exact OPPOSITE reaction that other reviewers seem to be having. I found that movie to be SUPER cringe and I wanted to fast-forward through the sex scenes. There was nothing believable or appealing to me about the idea of Anne Hathaway with an extremely young guy -- and I am a 50-something woman so I'm pretty sure I was \"supposed\" to think it was hot and liberating...but I did not.\n\nIn this movie, I though the chemistry was amazing between Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron. I'm kind of gobsmacked that others felt the opposite, but to each our own.\n\nI also thought, \"Well, at least Nicole Kidman's face is starting to settle in.\" For a lot of these people who get plastic surgery, it takes a few years for their face to take on a more normal appearance (Renee Zellweger comes to mind, who looked SO strange for awhile but then started to look super amazing more recently -- or Meg Ryan, who has finally started to look normal again!). As long as these people don't go full-on Michael Jackson (or more recently, Madonna) they seem to turn out okay in the end. I personally was encouraged to see Kidman looking good (although I wish they had either done her eyebrows thinner/lighter or given a bit more dimension to the extremely flat straw-blonde hair she had -- the contrast was too much... but that to me is hair & makeup, not plastic surgery).\n\nAs for Zac Efron, I guess since I didn't really follow him as a younger actor, I don't see the HUGE difference in his face that others see, and I personally find him very appealing. I thought he looked really good in this film and I thought he did a great job at looking at Kidman as if he was really smitten. So I don't know... I guess people's taste in actors is very subjective!\n\nI will also say, some of the writing and even physical humor in this movie is LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So if you think you can just watch it without scrutinizing the actors' faces, I recommend it for the humor alone. There are some truly hilarious scenes, and a couple of rather heartwarming ones, and the acting is really good and natural throughout (in my opinion). A recommended watch!"

It's more than content to coast on all of the most obvious tropes which makes it a perfect addition to the Netflix catalogue. Unlike so many of their biggest and worst offenders though, the reliance on formula here doesn't massively hinder the overall enjoyment and the motions it goes through still work well enough.\n\nZac Efron and Joey King walk the fine line of being unlikable without being completely off putting. Both of them have to be clearly self centred so they can become better people over the course of the film and neither of them push it too far. Their introductions are funny so it's a shame that the film tones it down after that, especially considering Efron's comedic talents that only briefly get to shine.\n\nRichard LaGravenese's direction gets the job done without any flourishes. There's a polish to the film which can make the film look too clean, like most streaming movies do. Everything is very flat and if it wasn't for all the big names populating this, you'd swear it was made for TV opposed to streaming. Plus all the little remarks about the fake films and the scenes that take place on a movie set are just used as a backdrop weirdly."

Stale and predictable script. The scene with her trying on the dresses was just to show us how stick thin she still is.\n\nHonestly how was film even made yet alone shown to the public?

Instead of seeing two characters with genuine chemistry, all I could focus on were the unnatural aesthetics and the lack of emotional connection between them.\n\nKidman and Efron seem to have mistaken chemistry for chemical fillers. There is absolutely no chemistry between them, which makes the love scenes not just awkward, but borderline sickening. It's clear that the reliance on cosmetic procedures has not only affected their appearances but also their ability to convey genuine emotions.\n\nZac Efron, in particular, looks disturbingly older due to the fillers, which is a tragic waste of his natural charm and youthful energy. It's perplexing why actors of such caliber feel the need to go down this route when their talent alone should be the focus.\n\n\"A Family Affair\" could have been a compelling story with its intriguing premise, but the lack of authentic connection between the leads and the distraction of their altered appearances make it a movie I'd rather forget.

        "review_title": "A Heartfelt Romantic Comedy with a Stellar Cast",
        "review_detailed_main": "A Family Affair is a delightful romantic comedy directed by Richard LaGravenese that explores the complexities of love, relationships, and family dynamics. Featuring a star-studded cast, the film offers a perfect blend of humor, romance, and heartfelt moments, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.\n\nPlot Summary 24-year-old Zara is tired of being underappreciated at her job as the personal assistant to self-absorbed Hollywood star Chris Cole.\n\nA short time after Zara quits, Chris arrives at her house to offer her an assistant producer position but only finds Brooke, her mother, as Zara is out running errands. As he decides to wait for her, he and Brooke hit it off. By the time Zara returns, she unknowingly walks in on them having sex.\n\nZara is promised that it won't happen again, but Chris invites Brooke to dinner. Before they realize it, Zara's boss is having a secret romantic relationship with her widowed mother\n\nWriting and Execution Richard LaGravenese, known for his knack for blending romance with genuine emotion, delivers a screenplay that is both witty and poignant. The dialogue is sharp and often humorous, capturing the awkwardness and charm of unexpected romantic situations. The story's pacing is well-balanced, allowing for both comedic moments and deeper emotional beats to resonate with the audience.\n\nThe film's plot, while rooted in familiar romantic comedy tropes, is elevated by its focus on family dynamics and the intergenerational impact of relationships. LaGravenese's direction ensures that the film remains engaging, with each scene contributing meaningfully to the development of the characters and the story.\n\nActing Nicole Kidman, as always, delivers a nuanced performance as Joey's mother. Her portrayal is both graceful and relatable, bringing depth to a character that could easily have been one-dimensional. Kidman's chemistry with Zac Efron is unexpectedly delightful, adding a layer of complexity to the romantic dynamics in the film.\n\nZac Efron shines as Joey's boss, balancing charm and vulnerability with ease. His comedic timing is impeccable, and he brings a sincerity to his role that makes his character's journey believable and endearing.\n\nJoey King, as the protagonist, is the heart of the film. Her performance is vibrant and earnest, capturing the confusion and excitement of navigating unexpected romantic territory. King's interactions with both Kidman and Efron are compelling, making the love triangle feel authentic and engaging.\n\nKathy Bates and Liza Koshy, in supporting roles, provide additional layers of humor and warmth. Bates' portrayal of a wise and witty family matriarch adds gravitas to the story, while Koshy's energetic presence brings a modern, relatable edge to the film.\n\nCinematography and Music The cinematography by Maryse Alberti complements the film's tone perfectly. The vibrant, picturesque settings enhance the romantic atmosphere, while the more intimate scenes are shot with a warmth that underscores the film's emotional core.\n\nThe musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, is both whimsical and touching, adding an extra layer of emotion to the film. The soundtrack features a mix of contemporary tracks and classic tunes, perfectly aligning with the film's themes of love and nostalgia.\n\nConclusion A Family Affair is a charming and heartfelt romantic comedy that stands out for its excellent performances, sharp writing, and thoughtful direction. Richard LaGravenese has crafted a film that, while rooted in traditional romantic comedy elements, explores deeper themes of family and the lasting impact of love.\n\nNicole Kidman, Zac Efron, and Joey King lead a stellar cast, each bringing their unique strengths to the film. The result is a delightful and emotionally resonant movie that will leave audiences laughing, crying, and reflecting on the importance of family and the complexities of love. A Family Affair is a refreshing addition to the romantic comedy genre and a testament to the enduring appeal of well-crafted, character-driven storytelling."

Not generally a romcom person-I just needed something mindless to just throw on and enjoy. . Efron was the main draw here and so I hit play. Days later it's still in my head as I'm left wondering how this movie can even exist. The notable cast absolutely tanks due to unrealistic plot and zero chemistry. There's not one ounce of me that rooted for, nor believed, that Kidman and Efron were anything but indifferent toward each other-and reading lines. Kidman's giving bodyodyody but her face is void of emotion and looks like it's wearing the skin of an 80 year old. I'm guessing due to the makeup to try to cover wrinkles and make this plot the slightest bit plausible. It FEELS like acting and not at all natural. Joey King was amazing and I found myself rooting for Efron and her to connect, as there was far more chemistry there than with Kidman. I really had to stop and wonder if I was being the slight bit ageist against the whole horrific plot but then felt comforted in knowing Lost City with Tatum and Bullock exists-which was ABSOLUTELY funny/enjoyable/believable and everything Family Affair is not. So very skipable..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought this was a fun, lighthearted movie. Not a brilliant plot nor acting, but enjoyable. Joey who plays the daughter was pretty fabulous. Zac Efron wasn't bad. Nicole Kidman was such a lightweight character and quite unbelievable. Nicole's presentation was very distracting. Her eyebrows were way too dark and overdone for her complexion and bleached hair colour, the top lip at the beginning was way too pumped up and false looking. The bleached hair colour I thought did not suit her at all - until one of the scenes with her hair out. Why is someone not telling her?? I didn't feel the two characters played by Zac and Nicole were terribly believable. I didn't notice anything negative about Zac's appearance - as others have mentioned but I don't know him very well as an actor He's starting to look a LOT like David Hasselhoff imo!."

The plot is horrible, acting is weird (problem with chemistry and the script). The daughter acts like a spoiled cnt most od the time and that makes her annoying and not someone you care about watching.\n\nWhy was this movie even made? Are we supposed to watch it as a romantic comedy or cringe fest. I rarely post reviews, but god was this movie hard to watch.\n\nHopefully I never have to watch another Nicole Kidman movie. Everything I saw from her in the last 10 years was beyond horrible."

From the hair, to the smarmy lines.\n\nIt was a fun watch because of the Hoff resemblance.\n\nI'm starting to think that American actors need to watch more K-drama romances so that they can bring back that wistful intimacy we all long to watch.\n\nWhoever wrote that Kidman and Effron were \"sexy\" together, I can't agree with."

Kathy Bates and the daughter were the only good things about this movie. Not a terrible story, but much better done with The Idea of You. There is no chemistry here at all.

Should have been great considering the boxes it checked, but something's just missing somehow to make it way better."

Please once you start you will know you gave into his looks and his charms only because no one can heal in days honey.

It felt forced, like stumbling upon something uncomfortably personal-almost like accidentally seeing a tape you shouldn't have. The whole vibe was off, making it hard to connect with the story.\n\nThe perspective through Joey King's character added to the awkwardness. It felt like I was intruding on private moments, watching interactions that weren't meant for me. This voyeuristic angle was supposed to add depth, but instead, it made the whole experience feel distant and uncomfortable.\n\nBut... Interestingly, there were moments between Zac Efron and Joey King's characters that showed potential. You could feel the tension and attraction building up, hinting at a more engaging storyline. It's just a shame these moments weren't explored more.\n\nOverall, \"The Family Affair\" falls short of delivering on its promise of romance and emotional depth. It tries to explore complex relationships but ends up feeling clumsy and unconvincing. If you're looking for a movie that captures something like Anyone But You but with a slight twist, this might not be it... 3 out of 10 stars \u2b50"

She showed great comedic chops, and was very good in the serious moments as well. I hope she goes on to become a big star. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next in her career. I certainly don't expect any Academy Award nominations to come out of this, but for a fun, light comedy to watch at home, you could do a lot worse. Give it a look."

Nicole Kidman's face was so frozen that in no way could she express any emotion, let alone sell the extremely quick romance that her and Effron's character develop. While watching their initial scene together, I seriously had to wonder if plastic surgery is what they both saw as having in common and lead to their attraction.\n\nI actually felt bad for Joey King. She's a decent actress, but being the only one of the three main cast members who could actually show emotions with her face, she more or less had to carry the movie on her own."

I felt like Zac did a good job of balancing an insufferable movie star character while still being likable. Kathy Bates was fantastic, as always.

I am so sick of Nicole Kidman's horribly awful, pathetic American accent. So at least they acknowledged finally yeah her American accent sucks.\n\nOther then that the plot is typical rom com but starts out stronger than it finishes. Joey King is good as the daughter.\n\nKidman is 20 years older than Efron. Why couldn't just go with that instead of manipulating the ages to make her seem younger? That and the the amount of plastic between the two of them is disturbing. Kidman is 57! At least she's the mother of a 24 year old here and not the mother of young kids like in Ex Pats."

I've much more enjoyed his part in The Greatest Showman. So much more convincing. Such a shame he played this part. I'm sorry but Cathy Bates' to good an actress for this movie. The only one who played a convincing part is this copycat was Joey King. I've enjoyed watching her play her part. A big applause for her. I finished watching the movie to eventually get a clear view. But it didn't change the opinion which I had already formed 15 minutes into the movie."

A movie about a movie star falling for his assistant's mother. Joey King is good in this movie, but her character overreacts way too much. I was not rooting for her at all. Zac Efron plays Chris Cole, but you should have him play Zac Efron. An extragged version of him would have still worked. He plays a very over-the-top actor who is very demanding, charming but demanding. I think somewhere along the way they really wanted to make this a holiday movie. Cause the second act takes place over the Christmas holiday. I will say the Christmas scenes were shot very beautifully and made me wish I was watching this movie snowed in with my girlfriend wrapped up in a blanket with hot chocolate. But alas I live in Florida with no snow and I don't have a girlfriend. All in all the movie was just fine. I wish they had touched more on the dynamic of Chris and Zara."

And Nicole Kidman looks her age, but is still gorgeous, not to mention that it was great to see her onscreen with her own accent!\n\nOverall, entertaining, funny, and moving in the right parts. Footnote: comparisons to The Idea of You, while inevitable, are not really apposite. Quite a different movie, quite a different message. Both movies enjoyable, but in different ways."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, who at Netflix is greenlighting these horrible films? It seems like all Netflix has to do is find some major actors willing to take on a terrible script, and then they make a bunch of money. And I'm part of the problem for watching and funding this crap.\n\nThis movie is truly just bad. Not like \"good bad,\" where it's dumb but still entertaining. It's just plain dull and boring. Here are the main problems:\n\n1) Bad romance: As others have mentioned, Efron and Kidman don't have any chemistry. The movie hinges on their \"love story,\" but it's just not interesting or believable.\n\n2) Bad dialogue: So much of the dialogue is pointless. I can't believe this movie is almost 2 hours; it easily could've been half of that. There are so many meaningless, boring conversations. They try to make it profound and touch on life lessons, but it's just a lot of word vomit and cliches.\n\n3) Bad characters: Literally no character here is likeable, including the main character. The side characters are tolerable, but that's because they're barely there.\n\n4) Bad plot: A major plot point is the main character's career arc. However, it doesn't make sense considering her age. She's freaking out about not being a production assistant yet & still living at home, but she's only 24. The average PA is 38 years old. Her frustrations would've made sense if she were older. If they wanted to keep this age, they should've made her more directionless. Or, they should've had other characters break down the realities of the working world to her. It was just unrealistic and eye roll inducing.\n\n5) Boring: Wow, this movie is boring. Save yourself the time and don't watch it. There's really nothing to be gained from this."

I don't believe either actor has had much done - certainly not to the point of looking hideous as some reviewers seem to think. People don't like change and find all sorts of ways to deny it including making mean comments they would never say to someone's face. Both stars are getting older - as we all are, Nicole being in her late fifties. They look how I would expect them to look.\n\nJoey King is a fine actor, was engaging and the core of the story. I 'believed' she and Nicole were mother and daughter. I enjoyed watching all the actors who seemed as natural as one would expect for a rom com and the writing was good. I was looking for a rom com and that's what I got. It was better than many and I was satisfied."

I'm all for a cheesy rom com, and I don't mind a predictable flick every now and again, but it felt so unrealistic I felt like I could imagine the writer coming up with this rather than actually enjoying any part it. Doubly disappointing knowing they're both good actors... was surprised that Joey was so much better (and believable) than both of them.\n\nThe story itself was incredibly shoddy, and too much felt either forced or just unoriginal...

        "review_detailed_main": "Netflix is known to put out a lot of terrible, cheesy movies out there so that people have something to have in the background while they do chores. The formula is that it cannot be interesting enough to prevent you from multitasking, yet the visuals/soundtrack/plot have to draw enough attention so that the half of your brain that is not folding laundry is not bored enough to look for something else.\n\nUsually this end up in some terribly uninspired movies that don't have a single scene without a clich\u00e9. But this time around, they came up with something that is actually enjoyable.\n\nOf course, this is not an A24 or Villeneuve movie that, while being accessible, still puts the cast in a position to actually act, and the cinematography and soundtrack are built with a concept in mind. The sets are the usual LA stereotype: Beaches, huge backyards with views, McMansions, fancy restaurants, etc. The soundtrack is a collage of small clips from whatever is on the Spotify top 100 playlist.\n\nBut, given its context, I found the movie very entertaining. The plot isn't anything new - just a remodeling of the classic love triangle replacing the romantic edges by other types of love. And since a good chunk of the movie is either slightly melancholic or teenage style love scenes, there isn't too much acting going on. But there is a layer to it that separates this movie from others. Efron's character is so much of a caricature that I refuse to believe it wasn't written sardonically, which leads to some actually funny scenes. In contrast, Kidman is playing someone that we all have met - of course, except for the money - someone who faces a series of challenges at a point in their lives that they can't afford to actually deal with them, so they postpone themselves for so long that they get so caught up with life that they forget to live it. The main character, player by Joey King, is not as remarkable, but is still a nice depiction of the problems a lot of young people face today: the road to your dreams feel too long and hard, staying where you are isn't special enough, and leaving it all behind is too scary and uncomfortable.\n\nOverall, not a movie I would invite friends over to rewatch. But I don't think that was the purpose of the movie in the first place. This is the cinema equivalent of that half-tray of lasagna that your mother left for you, and you keep it in the freezer for an evening you are too tired to cook, but still need something that makes you feel good."

The storyline seemed rushed and relied more on their name recognition rather than actual chemistry and believability. Also, as plenty have already noted - the cosmetic surgeries are extremely distracting. Their faces are completely emotionless, stiff, and overall unpleasant to watch. There are hundreds of talented actors and actresses out there with natural faces waiting for a big break so these two were an artistic miscast in my opinion. There are other rom coms with famous celebrities such as Your Place or Mine (Reese Witherspoon & Ashton Kutcher) and Ticket to Paradise (Julia Roberts and George Clooney) that were executed much better."

I also couldn't understand how they could prolong this torturous experience for nearly two hours!? I agree with other reviewers who commented on the strange plastic like appearance of Zac Effron's face. It was overall far too distracting. The only saving grace was Kathy Bates. I do question what attracted these actors to this film and storyline."

He just looks weird, fantastic abs though.\n\nI watched this for Joey King, a very talented young actor. This is a fun movie, unrealistic as all get out but it was entertaining. We seem to be getting ambushed by movies depicting older women with younger men these days, maybe payback for the misogyny of the last 2000 years. Some people are comparing this to \" The Idea Of You\" with Ann Hathaway. This movie is a more interesting take on this genre in my opinion."

If some of the richest people in the world still look bad from filler that speaks volumes. Honestly I suggest watching this movie. It's eye opening.

They seem to have tried to make a romcom tied to a hallmark movie with big actors. There are much better movies out there to satisfy the romcom itch.

He had more chemistry with Joey King and that I would have been more interested in. I kind of was hoping that was a twist in the end. It was not - boring to the end and nothing worth it. It had so many plot holes they didn't bother to fix, and there random ideas to try to get a laugh and they didn't. Just falls flat. I have seen every one of these actors in other movies make it work - be convincing - act in love - this was just not it. And not to be mean but whatever she is doing to her face she should stop it was hard to take her seriously when her face can't make the right expressions anymore due to all the work she has clearly had done.

The young woman playing the daughter was adorable while gagging and dry vomiting in certain scenes, briefly but still very amusing. She has a knack for slapstick as well.

Nicole could have had some slightly better/looser facial expressions but it was good enough for the film. The constant complaints about their chemistry are off base. This is not the first time Zac and Nicole played love interests. They did so the first time in The Paperboy in 2012. There was too much expectation for this to be exactly like The Idea of You and too much disappointment when of course it was proven NOT to be the exact same movie. It's a cute movie for what it is don't expect more or less."

Its just a romantic comedy on netflix where the spend all the money in the actors, the names, PS i love you by the same directors its a lot better than this tbh this is just bad, its not even funny and Kathy Bates its barely in here, false advertisement tbh."

I don't normally watch Nicole Kidman nor Joey King much but I've been a huge Zac Efron fan since I was a kid during the HSM craze but this movie was sooooooo boring. The only one that kept my attention was Joey King's character. The other two felt odd as a pretend relationship that I feel cause this movie to drag. Although I did finish it, I was hoping that it would get better but it never did. The chemistry just wasn't there which is weird to me because it was there during an earlier film from 2012 called The Paperboy featuring the two. Lol idk I just thought it was so boring and it kinda shocked me cause all the other efron movies I've liked."

Her mother Brooke Harwood (Nicole Kidman) is an award-winning writer and widower. Zara has had enough of Chris' diva behavior and quits.\n\nI really love these three actors and they almost sell this movie. Zac Efron is a little stuck between being a douche to Zara and not to Brooke. He doesn't have the balance right. The movie shouldn't start with Zara. It is more likely setting up an enemies-to-lovers romance with Chris than the eventual pairing. I do like this coupling and that almost saves this for me. In the end, I am too frustrated with Zara. I hate her sex-shaming her mother like a child. Kathy Bates finally says something. While I love the actors, the characters are not quite right."

        "review_detailed_main": "More than in plastic surgeries (debated later) the real issue here lies in the movie's childish script, which somehow managed to convince a mature lead like Nicole Kidman to act like a teenager in a role that could only be described as a midlife crisis captured on film.\n\nKidman's character is painfully out of touch, behaving more like an overgrown adolescent than the accomplished actress she is. Watching her navigate this cinematic disaster is akin to witnessing a distinguished professor trying to engage in playground antics. Her daughter Zara, played to ear-splitting perfection by Joey King, alternates between whining and shouting, bringing the concept of spoiled brat to new heights.\n\nThen there's Zac Efron, who seems completely out of his depth as the caricature of a Hollywood star. He tries to embody the role, but unfortunately, his efforts only highlight the film's many shortcomings. And let's not forget his latest look - Efron's transformation post-surgery leaves him resembling David Hasselhoff in his prime, which, while weirdly attractive, does nothing to bolster his performance.\n\nThe visual spectacle doesn't stop with Efron. Nicole Kidman's waxy visage and her peculiar, almost radioactive yellow hair color are a distraction. It's a pity that an artist of her caliber demeaned herself by taking on this role, especially when her appearance alone adds an unintended layer of absurdity to every scene she graces.\n\nPS as a side note to the review titled \"FYI\", and the reason why Efron had his surgery, were you there to witness his accident? I hear so many people \"justifying\" a nose job claiming they broke it... And Kidman looks great for her age, but she certainly doesn't shine for the wisdom she should have achieved - why should eternal adolescence be pursued at all costs? By all means, show a love story between a 60 yo woman and a guy 20 years younger, but let her shine with a real face and real wrinkles..."

I feel like his new face is incapable of expressing the emotions he wants to portray! It's as if it's the same face for both happiness and sadness.\n\nOverall, the movie is not the worst, but it lacks a lot. Even considering it as a romcom, it's still considered bad by many. The one positive thing that makes it watchable is that it's lighthearted, and its pleasant and comedic atmosphere makes it easier to watch."

I'm literally still in shock.\n\nI can handle many different movies and pull something to study, watch, or find entertaining. But not in this thing. That's why I'm sticking with my opening title.

Let's start, I guess, with the positives. First off, the film is well shot and well lit throughout. The cinematography, while not being particularly cinematic or artistic is probably the strongest point in the film. Secondly, as always Kathy Bates is a consistent delight every time she's in frame. As is Joey King, she is charming and endearing despite the script lacking any charm itself. She's doing her best to carry this giant production that is essentially about nothing. Now to our big movie stars, Nicole and Zach.. There's simply no chemistry between them and the writing/dialogue doesn't do much to convey it either. How they managed to be so incredibly unsexy throughout the film is truly astounding given who the actors are. And yes, frankly the amount of work done to both of their faces has rendered their greatest tools to convey emotion rather useless and it's truly a shame. But I want to be very clear, that while that adds to why the movie is not good, even if they both had their 100% natural, god given, untouched by a scalpel or syringe, born with, faces, this would still be a really, really bad (not to mention incredibly/unnecessarily long) movie."

In truth, the movie has some funny moments and keeps the story moving at a good pace, but overall, the movie is not that great. I really enjoyed Kidman's performance and Efron as a pre-Madonna movie star was very entertaining, but the writing in the movie was overall pretty bad. There were some scenes that did not really flow well with the film and the climax scene at the end was just stupid.\n\nI would consider this an enjoyably bad movie and if you are looking for a fun movie with some laughs but not a whole lot of anything else, I recommend checking this one out."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched A Family Affair a couple of days after The Idea of You. Both stories feature a romantic fling between an older female and a younger celebrity male, with the age difference being 16 years in both cases. Both mothers also have a daughter, who comes in between them and their new admirers. While The Idea of You is commendable in its attempt to convey the challenges that such a coupling brings, A Family Affair prefers to keep it light and vacuous.\n\nUnlike most rom-coms where the eventual couple act coy, misread each other's intentions, get involved with a third party, develop their bond over time, have a crisis near the final hurdle etc., A Family Affair does away with all of that by having Chris, Efron's movie star, jump Brooke's, Kidman's widow mom, bones on the very first time they meet. At this point, we know little about Chris and even less about Brooke. Without any suspense or believability about their pairing, I found it wholly impossible to be invested in their staying together.\n\nBesides their frozen faces, flat acting and abject absence of any sexual tension, Efron and Kidman portray one-dimensional characters that don't evoke sympathy. The daughter, Zara, is especially on-the-nose with her incessant whining and self-absorbed opposition to her mom dating her celebrity boss. Not even Kathy Bates as Grandma could save this dumpster fire. Why is she even in this? A good rom-com makes us root for the couple as corny as the ending may be; A Family Affair has zero stakes and utterly fails as a rom-com."

Hollywood celebrities are such egomaniacs and so afraid of aging, they've convinced themselves that they have to do this to stay employed, and sadly it's just become the norm. It is sad though that Zac Efron feels this way at only age 36.\n\nIt's not just the bad acting that does this movie in - it's plain bad writing as well. I don't think any actors could have saved this sad little script. It's not about lack of chemistry - it's that the script never gives us a reason for their attraction to each other except for their physical attributes.

I get that you can't explore each character's personality in depth, but some of the stuff that happened is kind of dumb even for a movie like this. It was a no thinking kind of movie, what do you expect with Zac Efron in it. With that said, I wish I could get the time spent watching this movie back."

It was cute, and fun and not boring...... everything a movie needs to be. I think it's sad that people are so busy dwelling on the stars' plastic surgery, good grief, just enjoy it for what it is....... a cute happy story with two very attractive stars."

They're made to relax, unwind and have a mind gap for 90 minutes. But they are definitely not doing the trick. Zac Efron looks like he is an experiment on Botched, for like an entire season. Joey King and Katie Bates try hard to fix this movie, but it was nearly impossible.\n\nI can't describe how many scenes were cringe, to say the least. But no scene, no character could top out Nicole.\n\nAnd that ending... Simply put, poor writing."

All the actors did well, especially Joey, and there was a great combination of witty banter and touching emotion. It did not follow the cookie-cutter formula of many of the romantic comedies of the last two decades. There was a lot of character development and many touching moments. It actually addressed a number of real, important emotional issues that people have around loss and relationships.\n\nI'd highly recommend this for a fun, light-hearted movie night!"

It felt forced, like stumbling upon something uncomfortably personal-almost like accidentally seeing a tape you shouldn't have. The whole vibe was off, making it hard to connect with the story.\n\nThe perspective through Joey King's character added to the awkwardness. It felt like I was intruding on private moments, watching interactions that weren't meant for me. This voyeuristic angle was supposed to add depth, but instead, it made the whole experience feel distant and uncomfortable.\n\nBut... Interestingly, there were moments between Zac Efron and Joey King's characters that showed potential. You could feel the tension and attraction building up, hinting at a more engaging storyline. It's just a shame these moments weren't explored more.\n\nOverall, \"The Family Affair\" falls short of delivering on its promise of romance and emotional depth. It tries to explore complex relationships but ends up feeling clumsy and unconvincing. If you're looking for a movie that captures something like Anyone But You but with a slight twist, this might not be it... 3 out of 10 stars \u2b50"

        "review_detailed_main": "Again people trying to make a Nancy Meyers film without Nancy Meyers. And they fail tremendously. You can have excellent actors but this film shows that if they fall into the wrong hands they appear to become mediocre actors. This film is not telling a coherent fun, uplifted story. It goes all places. Up and down from somewhere to nowhere and back again. At the start of the film there are some truly funny lines, which made me laugh out loud. I was ready for a fun romantic film. But quickly it all became so tedious, I could not be bothered to keep my focus. Boring, boring dialogues. No cohesive story arc. And the two protagonists stay so flat, so one dimensional. I don't understand why good actors can say yes to such an empty script. The emotions that are on display are also very childlike. We do not see fully developed adults with full personalities and emotions. Joey King is somehow the only one managing to make something out of her scenes and dialogues. But bad editing, bad direction, a script that haphazardly jumps up and down without real substance, is annihilating all her hard work. And then about Nicole Kidman. Yes, she is a recognised, good actress. But she looks frail, vulnerable. Not fit and virile. And yes even as such, a person is able to get into a passionate new love affair. But somehow I do not feel it. And to be honest this has mostly to do with the people behind the camera. An affair between Zac Efron's and Joey King's character would have made more sense. Let's be honest, Kidman was miscast in this film. I just saw the film 'May December', and I think that Julianne Moore, who by the way is older than Nicole Kidman, would have been a better fit for this film. Although I don't think it would have made the film much better. Because the script was lacking, the direction was lacking and the editing was lacking. I was mostly just bored. People need real adult characters with real adult emotions even when you try to create a romantic, at times a slapstick world. The world isn't a Children's Bible, so don't try to cater to those people who think it should be.\n\nN. B. This film is set during Christmas, with Christmas tree and all. My guess this film was meant to premiere during the holiday season in December. Why they decided to put it out there now, in summer?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Love movies don't make up even 5-10% of what I normally watch but I really enjoyed this film. I see many jokes about plastic surgery as if they're so rarely seen in society like CD players? They're also complaints about chemistry between Nicole Kidman & Zac Effron all solely focused on the age gaps majority wise. Lets be real here people, in society we have older men date younger women all the time so why is it so weird when its reversed? Seems like a very sexist opinion thats probably mostly from biased women? Weird right? Its always mostly women that attack women in this day age when it comes to age gap relationships or just on what they feel is a \"proper acceptable relationship partner\". Don't believe me? Just ask any female do they get more hate from women or men in life? They will all say women & going through the reviews its mostly women also rating it 1/10.\n\nWhy does Zac Effron need perfect chemistry with Nicole Kidman? Sounds like something only unhappy ppl, who needs their fairytale dreams to appear on screen to keep their hopes alive & believe that love exists only for perfect chemistry ppl of relatively the same age groups? They complain its not realistic of how they fall in love lol as if they themselves all know many rich famous actors n know 100% how their love lives play out? In the real world theirs a much higher percentage of couples in love who don't possess perfect chemistry than the ones who do. Many people judge the chemistry solely on the looks of Nicole Kidman with Zac Effron without understanding that quite often opposites attract. You don't need perfect chemistry to be the most in love, you don't need perfect chemistry to even be in love.\n\nThis film showcases a successful actor who behaves childish & selfish & yet at the same time shows how lonely & how pitiful he is that he's never been able to be himself for his acting in films also led to him acting in his daily life until he meets a much more older & mature & totally opposite in nature woman who is able to bring him out of his own self imposed walls of solitude. It shows him able to let his guard down to be himself & show that theirs more to him then his childish behaviours n selfish expectations. It shows a mother whois heartbroken & scarred from losing her husband & raising a daughter on her own & suddenly finding love. Theirs lots of single mothers out there who probs can relate as they find it hard to date again & think they will be lonely for the rest of their lives but meeting love one day again. Most older men like younger women while you get many younger men attracted to older women. Its no secret honestly & its something society likes to shun to make women feel bad for liking younger men but yet they accept older men going for much younger women.\n\nI found lots of funny moments in this film, I thought the acting was great by all main characters involved & for those that think Nicole Kidmans character doesn't meet their expectations of how she should act? Well not all women act the same way in the same given situation. Its ridiculous to say oh she doesnt seem to act like shes in love when many ppl in real life express themselves while in love in different ways."

I think a movie with each of these actors cast with a different story altogether and in more believable roles would have worked better.\n\nAlso, what is it with going overboard trying to throw out the scripted non stop cheap compliments to the older woman about her looks in this type of role to legitimize her going out with a supposed younger hottie superstar? It is as if it always needs to be justified. There was no organic real feel to this, just an overall unpleasant feeling."

I watched an entire hour of this movie in case I'd misjudged the story, but nothing of consequence happened at all, and, unless people acting slightly awkwardly around each other is comedy, there weren't any jokes. I know Nicole Kidman is a good actor, so I'm fairly confused as to how this happened. This movie wasn't my cup of tea (because it's vapid and boring), but it might be perfect for people who sleep with the TV on for background noise."

Sure, in order to fit the current vibe, Netflix added an African American and an Asian actress, but they're absolutely not important for the story (what story?) and are just there to cover legal requirements. Throughout all of the movie I couldn't help but feeling sad for Nicole Kidman, a great actress and one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood who now looks like Michael Jackson and had completely lost her ability to express emotions with her face. I really wished she'd age more naturally, though I understand the amount of pressure Hollywood puts on women to keep looking like they're 30 way into their 50s. Zac looks like a plastic Ken version oh himself, and while it may fit the character he plays, I found him having zero charisma on screen. Their love affair is unrelatable and so are their characters. The only entertaining part of the movie, for me, was looking at the beautiful houses."

It is sad, because she had real talent. The lack of expression bothered me greatly in Lioness and I kept telling myself that it was just the role, but nope. Sadly she has ruined her face and her acting along with it. Joey King was great. I look forward to seeing her work with some great script!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was like Anne Hathaway's movie, \"The Idea of You\" - except better! Because it has Kathy Bates being one of the best grandmas ever, and Nicole Kidman, as her usual stylish and charming self, as well as Zac Efron in his best John Stamos energy!\n\nWhen reviewing romcom from this era, I always hold them up against those from the 90s and , 2000s, to gauge quality- as I consider that the peak of the romcom. And this one meets that standard!\n\nIt's hard to tell if it's absolutely as good as a romcom from 20 or 30 years ago, but overtime, I do think this one has the potential to become a classic and its own right.\n\nThis movie is also special to me for a few other reasons: The marquee featuring a Jean Arthur movie in one scene,\n\nTwin polar bears featured in another scene, which are special omens to me, with a very personal meaning.\n\nWatching this just a day before Debbie Harry's birthday also feels like a good omen, since Blondie music is featured in this film, along with Nicole wearing a Blondie shirt! All was missing to make it even better was a Joan Jett reference somewhere, but that brings me to my next special point of this film\n\nJoan Didian mention! It may not be Joan Jett, but close enough, considering the other connections in this film. And considering the fact that Joan Didian wrote a book about the importance of \"magical\" thinking - I am going to continue seeing the magic in all of these signs. And then beginning to think there's something to this even deeper than that, because Joan Didian keeps being mentioned in so many of the movies I watch! She was even mentioned in \"Miller's girl\" - which featured Jenna Ortega talking about a character named Alice, which is my name. And on another occasion, Joan Didion was mentioned in \"Ingrid goes West\" - featuring Aubrey Plaza, who people often say should play Joan Jett in a biopic. It was the Aubrey Plaza character that was reading Joan Didion!\n\nAll those points and more, made me love the movie. It just got off to a great start, from the first second it came on the screen!\n\nMy complaints with the film are very minor, and they just have to do with the hairdo of Nicole Kidman, which I thought could've been so much better. That's where the 1990s and 2000s really shined, compared to now, as well as how quickly the characters engage in sexual activity. I prefer my romcom a little bit more PG. As well as the language. But, other than that, this is basically one big, beautiful bouquet of flowers!"

Now they come back through my cell phone carrier, or my Walmart subscription. Once in a while,being a curious and optimistic person, I decide to take a look at their production.\n\nThis here shines as a promising title. Nicole Kidman, right! So I tell myself 'you were too harsh on them' and I occupy the couch. 15 minutes later, the revelation hits me: They believe they can sell anything. In their eyes, we're like cattle. Whatever they serve, we'll eat, just to not die of starvation.\n\nHollywood doesn't look for talent. They just split the money with the nearest mediocrity they find. What kind of a story writer is behind this exercise? What director would look in the camera and accept what they see?\n\nStop paying them!"

Come on producers - stop putting her in movies if she looks like that. No one wants to see that. Naomi Watts, so many others would have been able to emote and bring characterization to the role that Nicole Kidman just cannot when her face looks like that now.\n\nThen you also have to get past Zac Efron's face, where there is the jaw reconstruction and he has clearly had fillers in his upper lip because it doesn't really move and is unnaturally large. But he does a nice job with the other parts of his face LOL. He's funny even if it's practically the same character he always plays...sweetish, dumb, shallow.\n\nWatch and speed through some parts and you won't regret it. Good luck!"

Their plasticine, non mobile faces were horribly distracting and completely ruined this film for me as I could not follow the plot. The cast in this film is more than impressive and I was super excited for the little escape that romantic comedies provide, but this was disgusting and lends more to showing off the unrealistic Hollywood beauty standards of our time and how they make you look like a walking monster with a cemented face that's only good for still photos."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I don't understand the negative reviews (particularly the ones bagging on the physical features of the cast... Why do these reviewers feel it essential to translate their own insecurities onto others-especially for a movie review? Side note: if their own features were put on blast in response to their ridiculous criticism, I'm sure they'd actually correspond a review worth actual content). Now, onto the meat and potatoes of this review...\n\nThe trio had incredible chemistry and Zac Efron's comedic timing in his line deliver was incredible! Kathy Bates also shined in her role and her relationship with Nicole Kidman was beautiful. As I am someone who just completed being in their 20's, I felt that Joey King's portrayal and how her character was written, perfectly displayed the reality of an up-and-coming adult struggling to not only find her place in the work world, but also the sometimes rough reality of the new relationship we transition to with our parents as adult children.\n\nAs for the film's faults, there isn't many. Liza Koshy's character was a bit rough during her first introduction but did become a likable character towards the end of the film. I felt that her character was more Liza playing herself rather than the actual character. I do wish there was a scene between the characters of Joey King, Liza Koshy, and Sherry Cola to make them a friendship trio. It felt like a smooth way to make condense amount of character groups and become a bit more cohesive to watch and follow their connections to Zara.\n\nThe other fault was the in-your-face product placement. I get it-movies need funding to start with and product placement is a great way to do it! But holy smokes did it feel like one long commercial full of products! I will say, a lot of the highlighted items are actually good, but that is besides the point. The placement of the labels was very unnatural and became distracting in the scenes (one of the strongest was Chris Cole using Kodiak and King Arthur flour together while cooking-which doesn't make any sense because you do not need flour to make Kodiak anything since it's already in the mix... but I will say both of these products are great and I have both in my kitchen right now).\n\nIn all truth, I was not expecting to love this movie and be as entrained as I was to the point of eye-watering laughter. I've noticed a lot Netflix Rom-Coms recently have often miss their mark with lazy writing, subpar acting, and lack of chemistry between characters. 'A Family Affair' is a movie that doesn't have a backlash of second-hand embarrassment for the viewer. I will say that what sold me on even watching this movie was Zac Efron. I've never seen a movie I didn't enjoy of his and I believe it is not only because of his incredible acting, but his choice to be in such greatly written movies and not to be in the ones that might miss the mark.\n\nOverall, this is a movie I would gladly watch again and recommend to anyone looking for a feel good Rom-Com that doesn't make you regret watching it.\n\nThank you for the lovely watch!"

He should have left his body smaller and more natural to suit his height. Hopefully he can go back to how he looked before. Nicole's plastic surgery has long been obvious bit here it didn't matter because Zac's face was the scene stealer. He even explained it in the movie referring to his accident. But the jaw is not the only thing what made him look so strange.\n\nIt is a bit icky for the boss to date the mother.

It's refreshing to find a movie that makes us feel good and reminds us that dreams can be realized at any age. Some people may find this unrealistic and post negative reviews, but remember, life reflects what you think about. If you still have dreams and believe they can happen, you'll feel more human. Suppressing dreams and dismissing this movie as unrealistic places you in a negative mindset. Ultimately, this film is excellent because the lead actors are truly outstanding."

        "review_detailed_main": "I laughed a lot in the first 20 minutes of this movie. Frankly, Zoe King is the standout of this otherwise meh rom-com, though I think Zac Efron's parody of his own life was often quite funny in his approach to playing a movie star. It takes a lot of confidence to make fun of the very person you are IRL, which he does in an engagingly dry and deadpan way. The best chemistry *by far* in the movie is between his character and Joey's.\n\nHowever, once the \"rom com\" story arc starts, the fun stops. It's frankly hurt by the star quality of the main characters, mostly because there's an almost superhero-meets-superhero dynamic between Nic and Zac. You have to suspend reality to commit to the premise of the film, and while that's fine for Deadpool & Wolverine, it just distracts in this type of movie.\n\nI was most disappointed in Nichole Kidman's wooden, uninspired performance. Maybe it was due to an underlying resenment for now being cast as the mother of a (young) adult, or maybe she took this role too soon after her latest facial \"touch up.\" (I'm sorry, it's just too hard to overlook.) Regardless, she was the biggest letdown in this movie, which I think in no way deserves its (current) #2 ranking on Netflix."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one movie where the trailer gives everything away. RomComs from the early 2000s are so fun, and this attempt to revive RomComs fell flat. Zara (King) was probably the worst part of this whole movie. Whoever wrote her character, needs to hang out with real women in their 20s; all this character did was complain and Zara seemed to lack any work ethic. This could be a series, and this was just the first episode to get people to come back for more. Additionally, Kidman's hair needs to be a more natural color, she is beautiful, but the hair color in the movie washed her out completely. Again, this movie was incredibly boring and disappointing."

It's like what were you thinking, man?\n\nHolywood, please, this have to stop.\n\nThe movie itself is a generic Netflix rom com that tries to be funny about actors, their crazy life, and their problems. It fails to be anything but forced and unnatural. Maybe it's because looking at these two actors makes it impossible not to feel like it's just a big ironic self portrait that writer didn't intend it to be. It ends up being just weird and sad."

Think of all the characters she has played and she has to act along these two stiff people. Zac Efron looks like a cartoon character. That poor guy.

Hopefully nobody actually acts like that in real life but in a movie I didn't mind him. The plot is woefully thin as it usually is with this type of movie. To fill in the gaps we had several extended montages that were meant to convey the main characters falling in love. The absent dialogue felt like what you do when you don't have a writer/s capable of creating interesting dialogue and certainly didn't have me going awww aren't they cute together.\n\nThe completely shallow Efron character couldn't possibly suddenly develop some depth and the supposedly high class writer wouldn't have been able to spend five minutes with him without getting bored. The age difference would also have become a problem but for a short term fling - sure, why not.\n\nIn the end it was just . . . Not worth the time I invested watching it."

Zac Efron, a conceited actor with limited abilities both in films and apparently in real life, has a \"relationship\" with Nicole Kidman, a successful writer who is trying to find success again and is the mother of Joey King who is employed by Zac Efron as his assistant (his \"go for\"). The movie starts out in a high point as Joey King is in a traffic jam and Zac Efron is waiting from her to make a delivery to him in a restaurant. From that point the film began degrading into nonsense. In recent movies and serials Kidman had been excellent but this one went totally the wrong way. When I see Efron I cannot get those ridiculous high school movies he had been in out of my mind. Joey King was the best in the movie, especially with her out bursts, and Kathy Bates was, as always, superb but neither could save this movie. I have seen Hallmark movies that showed a far better chemistry between the principles. A recent movie with Anne Hathaway had a similar story line of an older woman involved with a much younger man was far better (but not as a rom-com) but was not any more enjoyable to watch."

It was maybe supposed to be funny, but given the terrible script and acting, the humour didn't come across. Joey King's character was entitled and completely un-likeable, even at the end when she gets a supposed epiphany. I don't think she's a good actress overall, I've seen her in a few things and never rated her.\n\nI completely agree that there is no chemistry between the two main characters.

Without really realizing it, i tried to view the reaction to the creative approach unbiasedly by checkin on my friends here and there while we watched it together. Ive concluded that Zac must have me under some kind of spell cuz they were definitely getting the ick from him way more than i was. I also laughed alone multiple times during the movie so idk if that says more about what i find funny or what the film assumes people find funny.\n\nI really enjoyed this for what it was, a silly little romcom that narrowed in on the older peeps for once. We often get the widowed mom trope but a disconnected loner eventually finding something special was a cute first for me.\n\nJoey king played her role well despite looking like a preteen, and nicole kidman did just fine despite looking like an evil step-mother. And the relatively new Liza Koshy and seasoned veteran Kathy Bates were easily my two favorite characters despite being so wildly different.\n\nOverall it was cute, not great, but not a bad way to spend an afternoon."

It's a standard Rom-Com with no overly eye-popping or gut busting, intricate material to be had except for a few scenes. The chemistry is lacking, the story is played out: I saw another commenter mention The Idea of You which was another similar movie that has just came out that I think is better as well; better chemistry between the leads and a better movie all around. The girl who plays Zara was good in Bullet Train but here she has no material to work with.. the whole project has this aura lingering over it like they are all making a much better movie than it turned out to be... Kathy Bates is also here in a throwaway role. At least she looks completely natural... but even she has no content of any substance. Some better Rom-Coms that have came out in recent years I can interest you in besides this: Shotgun Wedding with Jennifer Lopez, the aforementioned The Idea of You with Anne Hathaway, the also aforementioned Red, White & Royal Blue... all have acceptable chemistry between the lead roles, funny scenes and touching moments. This Netflix original is another clunker..,"

Given the premise and trailer, I knew this wasn't going to be an intellectual treasure, but I thought it was just what I was looking for - a fun, predictable distraction. I was indeed distracted, but by all the wrong things. So many talented people who I've watched do so many great things... and then you can't get a superficial romcom right? I mean, even Zac Efron can do much more authentic-feeling acting. Of course we all know we shouldn't be judging on looks, but I will admit that I found many things distracting. The daughter looks not old enough to have a job as a pa, let alone producer, the AI version of David Hasselhoff is a lot to get used to, Nicole's hair is yellow and her mouth does odd things.\n\nBut the worst is the actual content, of course. Zac's character's behaviour is appalling but of course, all women fall for it and nobody really calls him out for it until the film's almost over. I know it's a film, so technically I can't say \"If a guy said those arrogant things he'd get a slap in the face\", but in real life, he would. Nicole's character says no to meeting him but he refuses to accept a no and of course is proven right by her showing up anyway. A 24-year-old daughter behaving like a spoiled 14-year-old and then threatening to move out... yes, you're 24, please do! All the women the same, stressing about their looks, fretting over every dress in the wardrobe, tiny women saying they're too boxy and big, Zara having her hair straight in the last few scenes because apparently that makes you look more grown-up... oh dear. Is that really how we want women portrayed? Or worse... is this really how many women are? Speaking of which: all the women laying against each other, stroking each other's hair... all the people who do that with their mothers, daughters and friends are not my people.\n\nA story about the daughter being 7 and making her mother carry her \"all the way up the Eiffel Tower\", implying an average person can actually carry a heavy child up 1665 steps... when the Eiffel Tower has lifts. Really? A good-looking, sexual woman her age did not have anyone else in 11 years? Really? Her new book is called Second Time Around - have we not evolved since the Sex and the City scene about the clich\u00e9 self help books? Why are we pretending she's much younger, for example with exclamations/jokes about her being in kindergarten when she had her daughter? Nicole is 57, Joey is 24, making it a relatively late but still normal 33 when she had her. Are they doing this because they deem it impossible for people with a 20-year age gap to fall in love?\n\nAnd why was a film with Christmas and winter playing a big part, with at least one Christmas song in it, released in summer? Christmas is the only time we make allowances for films of this caliber."

The movie is just about okay and provides fairly passable entertainment with a few good situations. The daughter Zara is a sprightly young woman who is at her wit's end in her job because she has an extremely fussy and eccentric boss who drives her up the wall with his unreasonable demands. So it is doomsday for her when she finds her mom and her boss in a compromising position in her home. That too when she is on the verge of resigning from her job or getting fired depending on which way you look at it. Zara who is protective of her mother furiously tries to break up this relationship but without success. It is then upto grandma Leila ( Kathy Bates) to persuade Zara to soften her stand and allow her single mom to continue her affair and live her life.\n\nThe movie never really rises above the ordinary and those who go with great expectations because of Nicole will be disappointed. Not many laughs or one liners worth talking about. However some good acting from Kathy Bates makes the scenes watchable while Nicole is just adequate. Joey King has acted well."

What's with Nicole's face, hair and eyebrow. Daughter is so botoxed and such a ham. The overacting is unbelievable. I have NEVER considered Kidman a comedienne. She was miscast in Moulin Rouge, too. If my daughter did to me what Zara did to her mother, there would be heck to pay. I did not like this film at all."

Maybe it's because their faces can't move anymore from the intense plastic surgery or maybe they just don't work well together. This movie was extremely predictable and left a lot to be desired. I also noticed the main cast was sparce with really only 4 or 5 characters with any major lines. I'm also pretty sure that Nicole Kidman could be Zacks mother which makes this even more unsettling for me. Maybe they wanted to break traditional norms with an older woman and a younger man but it honestly was kind creepy."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched the Netflix movie A Family Affair\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Zara (Joey King) an assistant to a self absorbed, egotistical movie star (Zac Efron) is alarmed when her boss starts a relationship with her widowed mother (Nicole Kidman).\n\nThis started off promising with the Wham! Song I'm Your Man playing over the opening credits. I enjoy silly rom/com's and movies that poke fun at an actor's ego (Like Michael J Fox in The Hard Way or Burt Reynolds in A Bunch Of Amateurs), so I thought it could be a fun movie. And then it got down to it. I predicted every second of this movie (They get together, overcome some obstacles, things go well, there is a misunderstanding and fall out, then cue the happy ending) not that it's hard with a rom/com lol\n\nJoey King was a pleasant surprise and Kathy Bates is always a joy, but Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman really lacked any sort of sexual chemistry. The love scenes are uncomfortable to watch as they both look so awkward.\n\nLike most Netflix movies, the movie does not make much sense, the characters are not believeable, the dialogue is awful, the direction is uninspired but Die Hard meets Miracle on 34th Street meets Speed sounds like something Netflix would make and I would watch, the day it dropped.\n\nEfron, Kidman, King and Bates's talent is wasted here.\n\nI watched it, so you don't have to."

It's so nice to have a worry-free movie experience without all the loud bells & whistles. Just a good romance with sex appeal, laughs & more. Kathy Bates is always a joy.

The movie could not be more Incredibly formulaic, predictable, and derivative. There is nothing wrong with an older woman having a relationship with a younger man, but the whole premise of this movie is awful. A successful writer living on the beach in Malibu is cleaning her own home, invites a handsome, famous movie star into her house and immediately starts doing shots with him, and they end up in bed. Of course the woman is a widow, and hasn't had sex in a decade, has a grown daughter who is the movie star's employee. Of course the daughter walks in on them in bed. Did I mention it's also Christmas? The emotionally stunted movie star has no friends or family so he's invited to spend the holiday with the gorgeous mum, daughter, and grandmother. The daughter, of course, calls out her mum and the movie star, and then gets berated by everyone in her life. Much more blah, blah, blah. Everyone has to break up.

        "review_detailed_main": "A Family Affair, masquerading as a lighthearted romantic comedy, offers a surprisingly potent exploration of Lacanian psychoanalysis. The film delves into the complexities of desire, the construction of the self, and the ever-present dance of power within the family unit.\n\nCentral to this exploration is the concept of \"lack.\" One character grapples with loss, creating a void in their established sense of self. Enter another character, brimming with youthful energy and a captivating presence. This character disrupts the existing dynamic, forcing everyone to confront their own desires and their place within the family structure.\n\nLacanian theory posits three realms: the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic. A Family Affair masterfully utilizes humor to explore these concepts in a relatable way. The laughter serves as a gateway, allowing audiences to engage with complex psychoanalytic ideas without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe film cleverly subverts traditional narratives around family roles. The characters grapple with societal expectations and the internal yearning for something more. This creates a fascinating tension, forcing us to question the very nature of desire and its role within family relationships.\n\nA Family Affair is more than just a movie; it's a cinematic Rorschach test. It compels us to confront the complexities of the unconscious mind, the fluidity of family dynamics, and the ever-present dance of desire that shapes our lives. Prepare to be surprised, to laugh, and to have your understanding of family relationships playfully challenged."

Zara's grandmother is rather supportive of Brooke and bow does Zara's disapproval start impacting the relationship and will they be able to get over it, forms rest of the story.\n\nThis one is no The Idea of You and much of the emotions are strictly on the surface level. There is barely any chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron, to make matters worse, the humor is largely hit and miss. It sticks to the template of rom-com with Christmas thrown in the middle too yet the narrative simply remains dull throughout. The conflict is Zara's disapproval over what she perceives Cole to be and that's about it. There is one scene where Liza's Eugenie mentions how everything isn't about Zara but that comes in way too late. The conflict gets resolved in a cheesy way as well. All it required was more sparks, more drama and balanced humor, to be a better film."

It was fun and let my brain settle.\n\nAside from the ease of watching it, it was nice to see the character chemistry. I thought everyone connected well. I'm also glad they mentioned Zac having a surgery on his chin because that's what happened in real life. It makes me sad what happened to his jaw but I'm glad he's still performing in films.

I think the biggest problem was that there was no chemistry. It also wasn't funny. There were moments that I had fun with, but nothing's worse than when something is trying to be funny and it's just not. I always say that a comedy is the hardest type of movie to make. The not so funny moments made things a bit awkward. So, awkward, but sometimes entertaining."

There is some quality and interesting scenes around Christmas time where the romance seemed to land well. But good writing and direction was needed to remove the ick of this awkward relationship. The humour is very poorly executed. The jokes land flat to the point of just being sad and depressing. There is no driver at the helm of this runaway disaster and I wonder why it got permission to get made in the first place. Come on Netflix, please do better next time."

I stuck with it through four different viewings just because that's the type of idiot I am. (Well one of many types...)\n\nWhat I liked Kathy Bates - although there is one pivotal scene with her and Nicole that even Bates could not rescue. She does deliver a simple carpe diem crossed with live your own life message that is the simple, but always worthy, message.\n\nJoey King - in general the more the film focused on her, granted riding comedy cliches on big lot Hollywood (does it even still exist, this was filmed in Atlanta). As a parent, I am learning to accept my cameo role more in my kids' lives - however I do not command the paycheck Nicole Kidman does. And kudos to her for her hard work ethic, so many things out these year.\n\nBack to King, her character (especially scenes with Liza Koshy) brought a little snap to the film, which goes mushy when the role reversal of mother-daughter happens.\n\nAnyways, while not a film for me and perhaps not for you as well, for me there was a peculiar joy imagining the DVD for this with a special extra including Tom Cruise auditioning for the role as Chris Cole. And then of course the commentary track with Kidman discussing the dismissal.\n\nHah, even now looking at the poster for this film, since I watched it on NetFlix, there's Zac Efron with the \"Risky Business\" sunglasses tilt. Comedy gold? Honestly I have no idea about their relationship other than it happened, I've tried to keep my Mind Wide Shut."

It can't decide if it wants to be a comedy (not a single laugh to be found throughout), or a romance, (ewww), or a drama (puhleazeee), there is no redeeming qualities to this movie. It's full of characters that behave in a way that makes you say, \"wait, what??\" There is not a single point in this film where you say, \"that makes sense.\" 0/10 would never watch again. It made me scream at the tv, \"What the F are they thinking?\" So so so many times. The writers need to be excommunicated from show business circa the Red Scare of Hollywood. I actually wish we could go back in time and snitch on these writers to McCarthy and get them blacklisted from moviemaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "A Family Affair, starring Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron, Joey King, and Kathy Bates, had the potential to deliver a compelling story with its star-studded cast, but unfortunately, it fell flat.\n\nHow I Found It: The movie didn't hold my attention and felt like it was plodding along without much direction. I kept waiting for it to pick up or offer some emotional depth, but it never did. It lacked the spark and warmth that make rom-coms enjoyable, leaving me disappointed.\n\nNicole Kidman: I usually find Nicole Kidman captivating on screen, but her performance here was underwhelming. Her character annoyed me, particularly because of the questionable choices she made-never put a man before your child! It felt like a waste of her talent, and I couldn't connect with her role.\n\nZac Efron: While I've enjoyed Zac Efron in films like New Year's Eve and Baywatch, this role just didn't work for me. It's not entirely his fault, but he essentially played a version of himself, which came across as dull. His character lacked the charm or complexity needed to stand out.\n\nJoey King: The saving grace of the movie. Joey King delivered a captivating performance, and I found myself enjoying every scene she was in. She brought energy and authenticity that the rest of the film lacked.\n\nKathy Bates: Kathy Bates is always a joy to watch, and her scenes were no exception. She brought a touch of magic and gravitas to the movie, even if the script didn't give her much to work with.\n\nBest scene for me: the Christmas scene when they're all at the cabin. This scene delivers the growth that was sorely lacking until this point.\n\nOverall: The film is primarily a series of glimpses of Kidman and Efron as a happy, affectionate couple, but it doesn't go beyond surface-level storytelling. It's essentially a rom-com without the sizzle or the warm glow that makes the genre so comforting. Instead, it felt a little sad and lacking in heart.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Despite the strong cast, A Family Affair fails to deliver. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's far from memorable. If you're looking for a light-hearted rom-com, this one may leave you wanting more."

        "review_detailed_main": "...but I actually think this is a good movie. The script is strong. All the women characters are complicated and intelligent. And they are good at what they do (ie, careers) in the story of the film. So you have three generations played by Kathy Bates, Nicole Kidman and Joey King -- all amazing actresses who really work this well-written script. Zac Ephron plays the self-absorbed but not quite dumb celebrity who is the daughter's boss. I don't think I've ever seen him in a movie before. I do think it would be hard for him to fail in this role of annoying guy who becomes a better guy.\n\nOkay, the elephant in the room is the faces. Nicole looks like she is out of an early-Hollywood film where the camera lens is covered with gauze or gel or whatever they did to soften women's faces in films in the past. She is just blurry. Her face doesn't look as rigid as it's been (I actually stopped watching her movies because her immobile face really upset me). I don't know if it's the soft-focus lens or whatever the newest round of work is, but she is easier to look at.\n\nZac, on the other hand, has a face that is frozen. I don't know what choices he has made in terms of plastic surgery, but his head is now a block -- he looks like a Lego head. He was pretty before, wasn't he?\n\nAnyway, it's a bit odd at first but you get used to it. And ultimately the movie isn't really about him, so it doesn't matter. I recommend this because I appreciated the story told about aspiration, creativity, success, and returning to one's creative work after a significant pause. The exploration of the dynamics of a relationship (in all the different iterations in the story) is honest and rang true for me.\n\nThe only part that was a little jarring -- and maybe it's because I watch so many Korean dramas these days -- but the speed with which people start kissing took me by surprise."

Bates and Kidman are fantastic. Definitely worth a watch. It's a feel good story with solid writing and few scenes that should make any normal person genuinely happy.

A nice mix,maybe more of a girly film.\n\nZacs super hero film bits are very funny,and typical of how daft all super hero films can seem,when being filmed.\n\nI thought the chemistry between a movie star and an older widow would be ,its not a normal situation, they woukd have awkward silences and cringey moments,that's what real life is full of."

        "review_detailed_main": "Joey King plays Zara, daughter to Nicole Kidman as Brooke, and employee of Zac Efron who plays conceited actor Chris Cole. Zara is unhappy that Cole is not making good his early promises about her employment with him, and when Cole and her Mum meet everything breaks down.\n\nIt's a typical family type film where the daughter is unhappy about the parent, and when a man becomes involved, especially one renowned as a love rat, she is understandably upset and falls out with her Mum. Mother and daughter both turn to grandma Ford played by Kathy Bates.\n\nHowever there are twists and turns along the way, the usual misunderstandings and hurt feelings, and the inevitable mish mash of boiled emotions coming to a fitting crescendo.\n\nBut, while this is not a new story it's a new presentation. Joey King is amazing, she goes from better to brilliant. Nicole Kidman is her normal excellent self. Kathy Bates...almost a legend in her own right. And Zac Efron, I never would have believed that I could say he played a great part.\n\nTogether the cast, the writer and the director delivered a brilliantly told story with such amazing connections between all actors, that it was a joy to watch such a simple story.\n\nI loved this film and if you like romantic comedies do not miss it. A solid 8 from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed this! There was good chemistry and affinity among all the actors. The scenery and locations were beautiful, especially Brooke's home. Nicole Kidman brings the loveliness as an author and single mom, and Zac Efron's boyish charm pairs well with her feminine grace.\n\nThe film centers on their attraction, which evolves into more than just a sexual fling. Her daughter, though, is Efron's personal assistant and he's a celebrity mega-hunk. We learn at the beginning that he doesn't have a great track record with commitment.\n\nWhat made this film unique is that Kidman's character is 16 years older than him. So, this film is part of a recent spate of releases with other over-40 actresses, including Brooke Shields and Anne Hathaway, demonstrating that older women can still be vibrant, beautiful and sexually appealing.\n\nThat's a dramatic sea change for Hollywood because the entertainment industry has been notorious for sending older actresses out to pasture, or relegating them to unattractive supporting roles. In this film and the others, they play moms who are not supporting actors. They are the leads, alongside, not behind, younger actresses playing their daughters.\n\nOlder moms are depicted as having exciting second acts. No longer relegated to brandishing knitting needles and making lemonade at family BBQs, these women have great careers and vibrant sex lives.\n\nAnd I gotta thank Nicole Kidman for helping get that message out there and you gotta see this film because it's sweet and uplifting and it'll make you feel all warm and cozy inside."
