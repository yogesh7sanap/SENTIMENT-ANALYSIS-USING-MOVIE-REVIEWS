        "review_detailed_main": "A sequel to the 2008 box-office hit '1920', '1920: Evil Returns' is Spooky! Its got the thrills!\n\n'1920: Evil Returns' Synopsis: A famous poet meets a woman who is in trouble. In order to treat her, he takes her to Shimla in a big hospital, but soon that woman gets possessed by devil and goes out of control.\n\n'1920: Evil Returns' is as scary as '1920' was. Vikram Bhatt & Amin Hajee's Screenplay isn't foolproof, but it offers some great thrills & engaging moments, especially in the second-hour. Cinematographer-Turned-Director Bhushan Patel knows his job. Cinematography & Editing are crisp. Music by the under-rated Chirantan Bhatt is melodious.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Aftab returns on the screen after a hiatus. He's good, but looks well-fed throughout. Tia is haunting. Vidya Malvade is average. Sharad Kelkar is fair.\n\nOn the whole, '1920: Evil Returns' is a spooky watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "1920 Evil return is a descent watch. With Good picturesque locations , good background score that keeps you glued on the screen. The movie starts on a promising note and leaves the viewers thinking.\n\nWatching this movie is exploring \"The Exorcist\" of 70's in various scenes when the lead actress gets possessed. Tia Bajpai manages to give a good performance, Aftab looks confused in the entire movie rest of the Actors are ordinary.\n\nOK! we come to the spook part, barring 1 or 2 scenes there is nothing that will give you a chill. If we compare 1920 with the sequel,1920 returns is a huge let down during the climax which is the integral part of the movie.\n\nAll said and done still 1920 returns is good watch around Halloween and much better than bhatt's previous venture Raaz 3. Though Vikram Bhatt is not the director of this movie still it has all the characteristics of the bhatt camp\n\nPlease try new things in horror rather just serving old wine (The Exorcist ) in a new bottle ( 1920 , 1920 returns ) each time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Seeing 1920 brings back memories of B.R chopra's Mahabharat,mainly the portion between Dronacharya and eklavya.With this film Vikram Bhatt again proves that he is a modern day eklavya to the Ramsay brothers who act as his multiple dronacharyas.From the screech in the opening scene (which takes place in a jungle set where the fog machine naturally went on an overdrive) to the hero(a beefy Aftab with an even beefier stubble) strapping a Om printed cloth onto his hand and grabbing the the collar of the evil spirit,Bhatt gives a proper shraddhanjali to the fathers of the Indian horror genre.The film is replete with innumerable clich\u00e9s from horrific close ups,a homeless villager who can see spirits,secondary characters who get murdered one by one to some forgettable love scenes,but just when it seems that the film is going to sink like the titanic halfway through the runtime,it picks up steam,some interesting back stories are shown and ultimately it hurtles towards a memorable climax.The climax is full of spine chilling moments,the actress Tia bajpai makes up for her careless acting in the 1st half by delivering some gruesome moments with great panache.Ultimately on seeing 1920,you are left with the feeling of savoring a biriyani from a roadside stall,your stomach churns a few time,you have to gulp a few extra glasses of water but ultimately you would be left craving for more."

        "review_detailed_main": "An almost full theater for 1920 EVIL RETURNS in a multiplex on the first day itself (also a holiday) clearly proved that there are still enough fans of horror genre, desperately waiting for a good Hindi horror film from long. But unfortunately once again they all are served the same mediocre stuff from the house of Vikram Bhatt, which has got nothing exceptional as associated with the brand of 1920. May be the result is such since this time the unrelated sequel is not directed by Vikram but by the debutant Bhushan Patel, who mainly falters in the opportunity given due to a poor and unconvincing writing.\n\nSo even when the film gives you some well executed scenes depicting the possessing spirit, it overall fails to impress because of an all predictable, soul-less storyline penned by Vikram Bhatt himself along with Amin Hajee. As a result, 1920 Evil Returns just remains a quick sequel, purely made to en-cash the brand value of both Vikram Bhatt's Horror Cinema and 1920 in this festive season and nothing else. It begins on a confusing note and then continues its uninteresting run till the interval without moving any further as far as the plot is concerned. And then in the second half too it rarely manages to scare you off in its prolonged climax shot well. At times, the scary sequences even turn out to be funny instead of frightening when the ghost starts singing songs and keeps laughing weirdly.\n\nWith the actual twist in the script unfolding only in its last 40 minutes, the film relies mostly on repetition and unwanted songs which ideally should be strictly avoided in this particular genre. But as per the routine, the director keeps throwing one love song after another at regular intervals into the film and ruins an otherwise decent soundtrack by Chirantan Bhatt including few fine tracks such as \"Uska Hi Banana\", \"Apna Mujhe Tu Laga\" & more. Apart from the soundtrack the film also has a fine Cinematography which again gets overshadowed by a loud and annoying background score which sounds the same as Vikram's earlier movies.\n\nMoreover 1920 EVIL RETURNS remains a hushed-up project in its performance department too as no particular actor is able to contribute in the film through his acting skill other than Tia playing the lead role of a possessed girl. Both Aftab and Sharad Kelkar fail to impress mainly due to the lackluster roles given to them and Vidya Malvade simply stands wasted. Further the viewer is not able to find any emotional connect with the sufferers on the screen because of a feeble screenplay which neither establishes Love or Fear in its 2 hours of duration.\n\nTo put it together, after watching 1920 EVIL RETURNS you can easily add the name of Vikram Bhatt in the list of those famous film-makers who have now found a new style of making films on a fixed Template or Pattern. In clear words, after Madhur Bhandarkarand Parkash Jha, here is Vikram Bhatt with his new horror film made on a preset template to win over the audience. Now whether you want to be fooled again or not, the choice is all yours."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Tum achha sangeet gaa leti ho. Tumhara naam Sangita rakhenge.\" is one of the few gems that is delivered with a serious face by Jaidev Verma played by none other then Aftab the great, in a movie that is so genuinely entertaining(unintentionally).\n\nTalking bad about a movie that made me laugh so hard through out non-stop would not do justice because I got more than my money's worth. So here's what I thought about this movie.\n\nThis movie is one of the best unintentionally enjoyable films that you would ever find.\n\nTalking about all the different factors in this film like direction, acting and all is hilariously futile. Except for one actor named Sharad Kelkar who does something that resembles the word \"acting\".\n\nBut I'm sorry I never went into watch anyone act! In fact this isn't a movie that you sit and seriously watch.\n\nIt's a movie to make fun at and in the process get all your money's worth.\n\nSo go buy a cheap ticket and be the dialog writer of this movie along with your friends. Bring out the creativity in you man!\n\nConclusion:\n\nGo strictly with a group of friends, keep an open mind and have a blast.\n\nYou will enjoy like you have never enjoyed before.\n\nThank you Vikram Bhatt."

Then I decided to watch the movie...I said OK Bollywood but it seems really good.\n\nThe movie has a bad thing! MUSIC and HORROR don't go together!The songs in a thriller I think that is the worst thing.\n\nThe script is very strong with a very nice background but I thing this movie is TWO movies! A nice romance musical and a very well played thriller but this two things can't go together!\n\nThe main actress don't have a very good performance is a little fake but at the scenes of exorcism she is very good!\n\nThe effect is a little too much and I think they can do it better! So much money Bollywood spend for the movies, they can't do a good effect production?\n\nI think the movie is good only for the script and please Bollywood the next time don't do that!!It isn't necessary songs and music like this in a horror movie! The songs every twenty minutes make the movie funny!\n\nI will rate this with a 6 (six) for their try and the well built script!!"

The acting, horror and direction are not as par with 1920 but the 'story' and 'music' is something that is better than previous 1920. The story is fantastic, even acting by the girl (Tia) is very good and comparable to 1920 girl (Adaah). Music is definitely better with quite a few hummable songs. I think the direction is a bit loose and there are not much scary moments. Aftab is good. I think his role was of a silent and introvert person and he performed it well. Overall a great movie. Do not go by negative reviews and low ratings. The movie is definitely worth a watch. 8/10 from me."

Thus '1920 - Evil Returns' should be spookier, horrifying and attention-grabbing, along with an excellent storyline, more than '1920'.
