The green screen when the actors who would play with the national team was super cheesy.\n\nThis movie doesn't even follow the first two except a few characters. The first two I would give a seven they were more center on the characters and soccer scenes were more entertaining. The movie should have been center on finishing up the loose ends of Santiago, but it wasn't. There is nothing much to say. If your an England football fan I would still stay clear of this movie. This movie actually made me mad when watching it that it didn't follow the previous Goal! films. The first movie was called Goal! The Dream begins, but the dream hasn't even concluded yet."

As an ending to a GREAT storyline, this one is truly disappointing, borderline RAGE at the producer and director.\n\nWow, that is all i can say. With in the first 5 minutes i was totally lost. My first thought was, who the hell are these two blokes (charlie and Liam character)? Since then, i sat angrily watching a story about two characters that did not belong in the story line. I mean why, why, why end the trilogy killing of the storyline and character that many fans fell in love with and related to? Seriously, where was the original story line? Where was Roz and the baby, Glen Foy and Gavin Harris? I can understand that they might not have the budget to star the likes of Anna Friel or Stephen Dillane again, but they could have just gotten new actor/actresses. NOT a totally new story.\n\nBottom Line, this movie will not only disappoint you, but if you watched the first two, will anger and leave you dissatisfied by the ending of what i thought to be a great trilogy."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is not a doubt in my mind why this came straight to DVD. It was an absolute awful film. With the central character from the first two movies Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) being given a guest entry. The story line was laughable. I am almost sure that there was no script, they just went along as they shot it. The two main characters were just plain unlikable. The CGI, or the blue screen to fit the actors in the matches was extremely bad and low budget.\n\nThere was hardly any football in the movie. It was more like the story about the love life of two footballers. There was no build up or character development. The lines and the acting was awful. Santiago Munez, the wonder kid, suddenly becomes an average mid-table club player.\n\nFinally, the ending, oh the ending, it was disgusting and worse. If any of you value your time and most importantly money then please do not watch this movie. And this is not a \"Goal\" movie. They just used the franchise name to sell some DVD's."

        "review_title": "What happened to the munez story ?",
        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this film thinking that it would carry on from the first 2 goal films and be about the story of the brilliant mexian footballer santiago munez reaching the ultimate dream of playing in the world cup. Unfortunately he played very little part in this film. Not even kicking a ball in the world cup. This is hard to understand considering the first two movies were about him. Overall I thought the script for this movie was terrible compared to the first two which I enjoyed. There were so many times in which the story here just did not relate to what was seen in the first two movies and you ended up asking yourself \" hold on what about munez wife or , who is he I have never seen him before etc etc\" and you never really get a full explanation to these questions. There are some parts which are completely absurd, for instance, adams gets a taxi to see an ex girlfriend, he goes to pay the taxi driver and the taxi drivers says no it alright mate its for free. Adams says great I'll sort you out for tickets to see england in the world cup after the knockout stage. This sounds a reasonable thing to do. However you see the taxi driver and his friends 1) get into the VIP areas of the world cup games, 2)invited to Braithwaite funeral, 3) invited to adams wedding. I mean come it was a free taxi ride for god sake and suddenly your best man at the wedding. All in all I found the story boring and had no relation to the first two movies. The writers for this movie should be ashamed that they strayed so far away from the munez story of the first two movies. So my advice is if you think goal 3 will be anything like the first two movies then you will be bitterly disappointed as I was. With a script this bad It is no wonder some of the actors who played big parts in Goal 1 and 2 did not sign up for Goal 3. Verdit ----> miss at all costs"

Don't watch this crap, it has nothing to do with a \"Goal\" franchise except for Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) who appears to have something more like a guest-star role. I reckon he had to be in there due to some legal stuff. Anyone who enjoyed this movie is either related to someone who's in it or is still a teenager. Probably both.\n\nTotal waste of time.

I'M not a fan of soccer and I have to say that the first two movies were great, maybe in the top 5 sport movies ever made. This one, major flop! It doesn't even tie in with the other ones. For a trilogy to end like this with characters we don't care about, with Mun\u00eaz not even a major character here is just bad. I mean where's Harris? Where's Fry?, the two new characters here Adams and Braithwaite just pop out of nowhere. And the action is bad.. very bad... Not one scene where you could believe they where really out there playing for real. The first two movies, you actually wondered if they filmed the scenes during the freaking games since they seemed so real! I loved it! I was hoping for the same quality here, didn't get it at all. I'm guessing the money ran out or just a very bad Director in Morahan. Also I guess that Butchart was the real writer here because the story in Goal 3 is lame.. very lame. Jefferies either got rid of this one in a few hours or he's just that bad. There's no soccer issue other than the drinking oh wow.. If you loved the first two, then don't watch this one, you'll be greatly disappointed. They took the soul of the 1 and 2 out. Gave Mun\u00eaz a backseat and got rid of the rest of the cast. Even his line that lets us know about his relationship was what can be called some of the worst writing ever! Bad choice. We wanted an end to the story arc. They gave us a shitty conclusion to what seemed like a great continuity. Too bad. 1 star.."

I've seen many wonderful films during this time but not one has meant as much as this one to me. This is an atrocious film. Full of stereotypical characters, boring plot, little integration between the actors and real football footage, which was a strength in earlier versions. Furthermore, it doesn't appear to fit in at all with the two earlier parts of this trilogy, as the main character, Santiago is relegated to a supporting role and none of the people around him from the earlier parts have survived. You have a completely pointless set of Geordie fans which I guess were introduced to try and inject some humour to the tired plot. The acting is pitiful, the script is criminal and it was almost so bad, I could have watched it all over again, just to laugh at the total ineptitude. I awarded this film 1 - a first for me and I consider I was being far too generous."

        "review_detailed_main": "I managed to watch Goal 3 yesterday. As a die-hard football fan, and the fact that I loved the first Goal, I felt I had to. However, in the end it was a disappointment.\n\nThis is not to say that the movie was too bad. It was just that, as a fan of the Goal franchise, the movie was a terrible let down. The star of the first two movies, Santiago (Kuno Becker) was reduced to just an extended cameo, and it looked like he has even put on a bit of weight. They very conveniently manage to get him injured in the first half of the film, so that he wouldn't be able to play the world cup. Big mistake. Santiago's is the journey the viewers rooted for. He played in the premiership and then went to Real Madrid. Everyone wanted to watch him play the world cu. But probably the film makers decided that following Mexico at the world cup wont be too exciting. Which is why they got two Englishmen to play the lead this time. They are Charlie Braithwaite and Adams, both who play for Real Madrid, and who are supposedly Santiago's best friends. Which is where the problems start with Goal 3. There is absolutely no continuity from the first two goal movies. These guys are supposed to be Santi's best friends, but where were they till now? What happened to Santi's personal life, with the wife and kid? Only a passing reference is made to this. While focus is spent on the personal lives of the two Englishmen. Another problem with the movie. While I did not like the second Goal too much, as I felt they forsaked a good football plot and tried to hide the flaws by bombarding the watchers with glitzy images of Real Madrid players and stadium, this one seemed to almost relegate the world cup to the background. The biggest problem with the film was probably this. The film crew seems to have just added the existing footage from the last world cup, and with the use of some not so good CGI, merge the actors on the foreground of matches.And Santi seemed to be only intent o supporting England, rather than beat any of Mexico's matches.\n\nAs I said earlier, not a very bad movie (even the relatively unknown actors do a decent job), but unfortunately, it virtually disowns the Goal franchise and Santiago."

I was expecting this to be the HAT-TRICK; but a pile of NON-SENSE came out of the HAT.\n\nThis was supposed to be the ROCKY of soccer movies. Even low budget isn't an excuse for what I had watched.\n\nThe story is already there... Why try to invent something which has nothing to do with what GOAL is/was about? The movie started with 7-8 user rating on IMDb, which I believe were production people votes, family etc...\n\nOne of the comments which really struck me was \"If you thought the movie sucked that bad...why don't you shell out the cash and make one better...if you can't afford it then keep your mouth shut...\"\n\nWe do it by buying the DVD and paying for theater tickets, but please understand that we feel sad and extremely disappointed when film makers sorta pocket our money with jokes like this movie.\n\nA similar experience I had was Rocky 5, but Sylvester Stallone was man enough to say sorry to the fans and actually accepted that the movie was bad; but than he made Rocky 6 (Rocky Balboa) which was an epic ending in my opinion.\n\nSo just like The Rocky Story was saved, Goal can be saved with a real 3rd installation. However it will require producers who love the movie as much as the fans love it. Not people trying to make a quick buck!\n\nPS: Before submitting, I had a long coffee break and re-read my comments just in case I may have been unfair because of my fresh disappointment.

I flinched every time Kuno Becker kicked a ball (sincerely, he could have trained more) but I liked his character enough to ignore that little thing and enjoy his epic rise to stardom. I really liked characters like Roz, Glen and Gavin Harris because they added depth to the life of the main character. Hell, even Ra\u00fal, Beckham, and co. did a good job.\n\nThe third film simply doesn't have any connections with its \"distant and far superior cousins\" besides one of the characters. That character was supposed to be the heart of the trilogy but in this last movie he's simply a sidekick to a myriad of new characters of whom I found myself not giving a flying f*ck (pardon me...). Football in this movie gets 15 minutes of screen time and the special effects made me think \"Wow, they really wanted this film to suck!\". Roz, Gavin, Glen, where were they? The life of Santiago Mu\u00f1ez, how many questions left unanswered?? Even real life footballers had no part in this, it was just footage from the matches of the world cup!\n\nOK, it has drama (more \u00fcber-drama), that made me, to say the least, watch the film until the end, a few nice goals from WC2006 and Swedish girls partying. And... that's it...\n\nThis film was able to make death-murder-kill to the end of the series, destroying what was good and completely creating awful things.

There was some good and funny parts of the film it was well acted and a good story line but some parts for me were a bit far-fetched and some things happened a bit suddenly with out warning but it had a good ending although quite predictable. But its definitely worth a watch even if football isn't something your particularly into. I watch a lot of films and did enjoy it although i didn't think i would."

Awkward way how Santos is out of book (in a car accident in which he breaks his hand, not being able to participate in World Cup)!Embarrassing to have destroyed all the expectations of fans of a beautiful series.The film must be named, in my humble opinion, \"I love England\", that is dedicated entirely to this nation.This movie that left me empty inside!It's not about football! It's just an ordinary drama that has as background a World Championship! And clearly, does not deserve to wear the name \"Goal III\" . Shame, shame on you! And another thing ... learn to write correctly in Romanian language!! Shame on you!! very bad movie ... not recommend!"

Santiago came out in this movie for what 10 minutes? i am so disappointed. i hope they remake this 3rd one because this one was a piece of well you know what. i am so glad no money was spent on this movie because i would not buy it in a million years. if it was given to me, i would throw it in the trash."

Whereas the first two had parts filmed at football grounds with real fans and real footballers providing the atmosphere this one has gone to a cheaper \"green screen\" option which just looks tacky.\n\nA massive let down from a pretty good trilogy.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is almost unwatchable. When my son and I watched GOAL! , a couple of years ago, we both enjoyed it immensely, especially on the big cinema screen. When GOAL!2 was released straight to DVD I thought, what a shame. Still, it was a nice continuation of a wonderful story. We waited patiently for the much anticipated release of GOAL3. The title suggests it is the conclusion of a Trilogy. Logically it should follow on from the previous 2 films, using the same characters, themes and storyline. GOAL!3 is not a sequel and has almost nothing in common with GOAL!1 and GOAL!2. Perhaps the studio was legally bound to release GOAL!3, but I wish they hadn't. It is clear that it was poorly conceived, badly scripted, and the acting is unconvincing. The trilogy has a basic flaw right from the beginning. If Munez was Portuguese instead of Mexican the writers might have been able to create a plausible story for GOAL!3. Instead they had to fashion a pathetic story line using totally new characters, relegating Santiago Munez to a cameo role, all because England did not play Mexico in the 2006 World Cup. England did however play Portugal in a match that ended England's chances at the title. Was Gavin Harris supposed to somehow play against Santiago at the World Cup? Given that Santiago had the starring role in 1 and 2, should this not continue in GOAL!3? This movie was marketed as Santiago's World Cup debut, playing for Mexico. In fact, Santiago doesn't play ANY football in this movie. Rather conveniently he had a broken arm! Three pivotal characters are nowhere to be seen in GOAL3; Gavin Harris, Santiago's girl friend and his manager, Glen Foy. So it is up to two previously unseen characters, to carry this boring movie to a slow death. In fact one of the two new characters doesn't even make it that far. In the movie he dies, probably because the money ran out. This is a low budget movie with a weak script, aimless story, poor acting and the green screen (crowd background) effect is laughable. On close examination there are many mistakes in this film, however substituting the lead actor (Kuno Becker) with 2 unknowns and then not following any themes from the first 2 films is the biggest one. The script included a totally out of place speech which he (Kuno Becker) delivered at a wedding in the last scene. It's embarrassing to watch a good actor being destroyed by such a bad movie. If anyone should be angry with the result it is Kuno Becker. Don't waste your time or money on this film! I give it no stars at all."

Although number 2 clearly emphasized a bit too much personal drama that detracted from the overall sporting aspect of the film, the football still seemed real. This film spent too much time on drama and the football was, well, great if you wanted to watch World Cup highlights. The Braithwaite and Adams goal looked like something a five year old drew up on an etch-a-sketch. My only hope is that someone at Milkshake reads this and makes a true and fitting conclusion to this franchise. Bring Santi back to UK to play some real football, close the loop with Roz, Let us know what happen to Gavin Harris even if he is \"shite\". Don't ruin a great run with a a flop like a England loss to Liechtenstein. Avoid this film if you want to preserve your love of this story. Goal -3 cancels out Goal 1+2 equaling 0. Try again and finish in the positives."

What happened to Santiago's fianc\u00e9? I do believe that she was pregnant at the end of Goal 2 and what? the writers just decided to drop that idea and go with the plot of the dramatic lives of two other footballers that had absolutely nothing to do with the first two movies Talk about a complete twist of events you can tell that there was not enough funding for this movie as there was for the first two Becker- if I were you I would be completely P-O'd not only for yourself but for the fans that loved Parts I and II and were seriously ripped off with III. Hopefully there will be a fourth part that can finally carry out the the first two and tell us all what actually happens with Munez's life and his ex fianc\u00e9/child."

When you watch Goal 3 you're like \"WTF?!?\". It totally breaks away from Santiago and focuses on 2 other guys (who cares?). You're almost thinking that this Director did not even see the first 2 films.\n\nAnd they went really cheap on the special effects. You could easily tell that the soccer scenes with the 2 main characters for England were not authentic, and did not blend in well. They showed shots from England games w/ Beckham and you could easily tell there was differentiation. I figured they could probably salvage Goal 2 but this one really hit the crapper. It was so bad and offbeat from the 1st two that I had to constantly fast forward through scenes - too cheesy or didn't make sense, or horrible acting, or bad script.\n\nSo disappointing! Munoz breaks his arm and that's IT! Nothing for him but watching games with a cast?!? WTF? This movie should get a Razzberry for sure!"

It also missed key characters such as Roz, Glenn Foy & Gavin Harris, and when Santi was asked about Roz he seemed to simply dismiss her with no mention of what happened between them.\n\nThis trilogy started being about Santi, and his love of football, and the twists along the way, in Goal III they have lost all sense of this and instead showed us things that fans of Goal, did not start watching this trilogy for.\n\nThe writer's especially should take most of the blame; but also the casting was shocking, as none of the new actors could ever pass for footballers!\n\nIn conclusion, a really poor way to end what was a fantastic beginning, I would have preferred this film was never made in truth."

However, after reading the plot for the third movie, it looks really bad. The film producers have completely changed everything and instead of taking part in football's biggest ever competition, Santiago sits out through injury. There's also no Gavin (who retired even though it was revealed in Goal 2 he became 29, which is too young to retire in my opinion), Roz (Goal 2 revealed she became pregnant) or Glen (who got sacked by Santi in Goal 2). The two main characters in the film are two English footballers (one of them sadly dies during the film) who no'one had ever heard of, also a bald man is used for Sven-Goran Eriksson (who appeared at a party in Goal). If I was to make it, I'd have group draws that would mean the possibility of Mexico playing Brazil in the final (but try to make it as similar as possible so they can continue to use real matches) as well as England beating Germany in the third place play- off after losing to Brazil in the semi-finals. In the final, I'd have Santi scoring a hat-trick to help Mexico come from 2-0 down to beat Brazil 3-2 and him becoming player of the tournament with Gavin doing similar to what Paolo Rossi did in the 1982 World Cup (apart from the fact he helped Italy win it) and struggle in the group games before scoring tons of goals in the knock-out stages to become joint top scorer with Santi (who'd win the golden boot with more assists). Before the tournament after the squads are picked, I'd have Santi visiting Roz in Newcastle for a few days before meeting up with the Mexican squad whilst Santi says \"RIP Dad\" after his winner in the final."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I started watching the film I was expecting to see the same sort of action as from the previous two films. Unfortunately right from the start I noticed that the use of very cheap 'Weather forecast' green screen instantly put me off and I was starting to worry that the film would be like that all the way through. The narrative of the film was very shallow and there was barely any character development. The main hero of the previous two films, Santi was just a second plan role and was overtaken by the characters of JJ Feil and Leo Gregory, two English players playing alongside our prime hero at Real Madrid (because that's realistic).Anyways they were the main focus of the narrative in this film but to be honest it was a very poorly thought of screenplay. First of all why would a football player or shall I say star as he was viewed, be asked to play any kind of role in a film especially one filmed somewhere in Romania by a low time director who clearly has no clue of what his doing. Well thats basically the input of Charlie (Leo Gregory) into the narrative other than him falling in love with on of the actresses in the film and proposing her after just two weeks. The second, more controversial character Liam (JJ Feilds) is an alcohol and sex addict, who finds out that one of his previous girlfriends has had his baby, which makes him reconsider his future. And finally the character of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker). He was the main character in the previous two films, and for some ridiculous reason the best actor in the cast, the trademark of Goal films get a second plan role, Why I ask ?! It seems as though he is completely discarded from the film, as if he is needed no more. But as we have seen from so many great sequels, the main hero always stays the main hero (Indian Jones, Transformers, Rambo etc) and it is that character who brings the audience to the cinema. Maybe this is what the director thought 'Lets include Kuno's character in the film, people will come to see it because he was in the previous two'. And yeah, possibly but the inclusion of the two 'clowns' made the film boring and senseless, without any kind of resolution.\n\nIt is good that we see the lives of the football players outside the football pitch, but come on this is a film about football, so where is all the on field action, which was present in the films two predecessors. In my opinion Andrew Morahan (the director) concentrated too much on creating a more family friendly movie, and distanced its 'dreaming young boy' audience from it by creating this kind of narrative. But the Director was thinking well again. He used the trademark title and made sure he included some football scenes in it, or on the case of the DVD and in the trailer shall I say. Anyways this would be acceptable and appealing to the TA, possibly making the film a success.\n\nBut overall the film was an utter disappointment and I felt sorry for myself after watching it and wasting the 1.30h of my free time"

Any sense of passion and feeling that the first two films evoked have been washed away for a quick turn around and profit by using the name of the franchise. The title character Santiago Muniz can barely even be considered to appear as a cameo. 96 horrendous minutes of stock footage from various football matches, mashed together with green screen actors trying their hardest to fake any form of talent and emotion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, the movie was pretty disappointing after seeing the first two, but I almost have to wonder if they had a new director for the third movie. If you watch the end of Goal 2, you can see that Rose is pregnant, and when I saw that June had a kid (and looked relatively similar), I feel as though they changed some things up. This is how I viewed the movie:\n\n1. Liam Adams is supposed to be Gavin Harris -The reason I say this is because at the end of Goal 2, Santiago asked for Gavin to get the start over himself, to give himself a shot at getting onto the world cup team. As you may recall, Gavin performed poorly at the start, but turned it on near the end, making his spot on the team \"questionable\". Liam is portrayed as an \"older\" footballer with a questionable future ahead of him. In Goal 2, there was a scene where Gavin is in the bathtub and Santiago walks in on him. He has cream on his face, because he was trying to get rid of his wrinkles (getting older). He mentioned that his contract was up at the end of the season, which Liam's was as well. When Liam found out that he (and Charlie) made the England squad, they were ecstatic, as would Gavin have been. Another clue to this is that they said that Liam was heading back to Newcastle where he (and Santiago) had been teammates before (sound familiar). The last connection is the drinking and partying personality. Both Liam and Gavin loved to drink and get the ladies. They mentioned at one point in Goal 3 that the reason Liam was so iffy was because of his lifestyle, similar to what he was told at Real Madrid in Goal 2.\n\n2. Liam's love story is actually supposed to be Santiago's -As stated before, if you look closely enough at Rose at the end of Goal 2 (when Santiago calls her), you can tell that she is pregnant. I think that is part of the reason why she is so hesitant to get back together with Santiago. Also, I remember Rose telling Santiago that she had \"daddy\" issues in the past with her father being in a band that had their fifteen minutes of fame. In Goal 3, June says that the reason she was so protective of her child was because either (1) she wanted her daughter's father to be present all the time, or (2) for him to never be there. This to me sounds very familiar to the Rose we all loved in the first two Goal movies.)--The only thing going against this theory is that when Santiago is talking to Charlie's fianc\u00e9 in the press box, he mentions that loved once but messed it up.\n\nOverall, the movie was pretty poor, and it seemed as though there was in fact budget cuts or something that caused this movie to be sub par to the first two Goal movies. I personally think that there was a director or writer change that didn't do his homework (study the first two movies) before filming this, and just took it in an awkwardly different direction. The movie seemed to go in every direction, but as mentioned in some previous posts, at least there was the Charlie/Sophia love story that made some sense (the fact that no earlier plot made it confusing to understand).\n\nHopefully this clears some questions up about the movie, and feel free to reply and add other similarities that I forgot to mention."

It was the same writer who had written the previous films, wrote this unnecessary garbage of a film. After all that wait to see the storyline set at the world cup, the wait was not worth it. We will never find out if Santiago plays for England or Mexico or USA. We will never know if Santiago will get back to this love interest and their yet to be born child. We will never know if he will make his manager and well wisher proud (from the first two films played by Stephen Dillane as Glen Foy, an important character in the GOAL movie universe.) All Goal fans ARE disappointed ! We demand a proper ending for the series. Those of you planning to watch this movie, please don't. GOAL 1 and 2 are the only movies that follow a proper narrative. This one does not follow the storyline and doesn't even explain why ? (except for some cheap bits like Kuno just saying how he knows to be loved and didn't bother to care for his lover) DANG!

Where's Roz? And Gavin Harris? And one of the main things that peeves me the *beep* off was the atrocious match footage featuring the worst digital effects since Ray Harryhausen's monster flicks of the 1950s. Couldn't they even find a proper soccer pitch and try using some actual extras for crowd scenes? Instead they have to uses real games and digitally insert the \"alleged\" actors into the footage.

I loved the first two movies I'm a huge football fan but Kuno Becker (Santiago) plays so little of role (never see him touch a football) that its discussing to even call this the last movie of the trilogy. You expect at the least the star of the first two to have some kind of an impact on this movie but if you count up the speaking parts he has in this movie it comes out to be maybe around 10 minutes maybe less. From the first two movies this is 99% different.

So, the story then focuses on the other two jerks...and you most likely will find you just don't care.\n\nThe film is incredibly cynical. After all, it expects the viewer to stay engaged with a story where you don't like anyone and the sports action seems detached and uninteresting.\n\nBy the way, although this clearly is a terrible film (due almost exclusively to the writing), I cannot believe the reviews I saw giving it 10s and singing its praises. Unfortunately, I think many films have fake positive reviews...and perhaps they were paid for or made by members of the cast.
