        "review_detailed_main": "Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.\n\nBut no wait there is more, this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.\n\nIt currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Foulest Family Film, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least \"Special\" Special Effects.\n\nStarring Jamie Kennedy, Traylor Howard, Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.\n\nFull of dire cgi, painfully unfunny \"comedy\", purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.\n\nIt's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.\n\nSeriously, everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its \"Trendy\" to, nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!\n\nThe Good:\n\nTraylor Howard\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPoor cgi\n\nBeyond dumb\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nIn movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic, I do it and I get arrested!?\n\nHow could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny? Shocking!\n\nChildren being stolen by norse gods isn't even remotely shocking to some parents\n\nOdin is a WWE champion"

        "review_title": "p-a-r-t-y. Why? no seriously....why was this movie made?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie \"Son of the Mask.\" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds \"Cuz I gotta!\" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, \"Good Lord, Why?\" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.\n\nThe Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.\n\nFirst off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.\n\nThe premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.\n\nThe son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question \"WHY?\" The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask."

Back when Son of the Mask first came out, Jim had only done one sequel (Ace Ventura) that soured his entire outlook on sequels. Not that he was asked to take part in this in the first place, anyway. What's really interesting about this movie is the fact that The Mask is a totally different character depending on who wears it... and yet everyone who wears the mask in this movie (including the dog) are just absolutely wrong in their portrayals. The comedy is flat, the acting is laughable, the attempt to redo a Cuban Pete-style musical number was cringe-inducing at the absolute best, and the movie drones on and on and on. In terms of sequels, this is among the worst."

Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!\n\n\"Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!\"\n\n\"Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!\"\n\nAnd really, that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.\n\nNevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it's massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out \"like me!\" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.\n\nJamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.\n\nThe plot is so much by the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.\n\nSave your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. Didn't dumb and dumberer teach them anything?"

He becomes the life of the party, When he gets home, he then makes love to his wife, while still wearing the mask. The couple soon realize there gonna have a baby.

I give it 7 out of 10 because it is actually an enjoyable and fun movie and it has a message that is very overlooked...FATHERHOOD! Maybe that's another reason why the movie is criticized???"

After all, to anyone hearing the plot, they'd know that the film was destined to bomb--yet some lunkheads approved the picture. And, while they saved a huge amount of money by not getting Jim Carey for this sequel, it's obvious that the budget was NOT small when you look at the amazing sets and see the excellent special effects. Yet, oddly, despite all this money being spent, the fundamental story idea was so stupid and the writing so amateurish that it couldn't help but bomb...and thankfully it did...otherwise they might have made more sequels!!! This is a bad film--there is no doubt about this. However, I object to it being on the IMDb Bottom 100 list as it's not THAT bad. Only the very worst of the worst deserve to be on the list--yet I notice such horrendous films as those of Ed Wood, Arch Hall, Al Adamson or William Grefe are not on the list! I guess it's because not as many people have seen these films and many DID see \"Son of the Mask\" due to its huge publicity campaign and massive DVD saturation.\n\nIn addition, you can't help but admire the special effects as well as the sets. In particular, I loved the sets--which were very surreal and cartoon-like. I can't see giving such a beautiful looking film a 1---it deserves at least another point or two for effects and sets.\n\nAs for the story, it's just plain stupid and wastes the talents of Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Plus, odd for a comedy, the film hasn't got a single laugh--not even one. In fact, some of the 'jokes' are downright repellent--such as the baby peeing copiously on the father as well as the snot joke--which both managed to be unfunny AND gross.\n\nWhile I could go on to discuss the plot, I won't...as simply put, no one could possibly care. It's dumb and not worth your trouble. An incredibly limp, unfunny and stupid film...with nice sets. Even smaller children will find all this very tedious and boring. Only for bad movie fans who want to marvel at the film's awfulness."

What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.\n\nLet me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clich\u00e9d and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.\n\nThe special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.\n\nAll in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox"

They absolutely loved it and told me to rate this movie a 9 out of 10. I admit the acting was poor but the animation was outstanding and extremely funny. My expectations going in to the movie was to laugh a lot. This was achieved even though the movie itself was a bit strange and nothing like I expected. So if you want to see your kids laugh go to see this one. If your a big Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz fan this is not for you (Note - They are not in it).

Jamie Kennedy has got what it takes for natural, charming, comedic acting. Natalie Traylor was more vivacious and cute in this movie than she has been since she took over the sidekick role in the \"Monk\" TV series. The dialogue has some pretty zippy stuff in it, and the plotting is competent and a good springboard for the hot visual effects.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the production itself was that the voice of the masked Tim was surprisingly subdued. It needed to be much more out there, distinctive and penetrating, even annoying, but definitely more audible and spooky that what we got.\n\nStill, this is a great movie for kids from 5 to 15. Surprisingly, it totally tanked at the box office (in Hollywood terms -- it lost big money, though it grossed $17 million). This must have been because it was not marketed for kids. In fact, I don't remember much marketing at all on this movie, which is strange for a flick that cost almost a hundred million dollars to make.\n\nBut it's too good a movie not to have legs with the nippers in the years to come, if someone will just tell them about it. As we move steadily into the era of DVD importance in viewing habits, greater revenues for initially neglected movies like this one will start to materialize. Sort of like the mask in this movie, they will hang there for a while and then, when the right person touches them, will come to life."

But if you really liked the first one and you just want a nice relaxing fun film to watch with your kids son of the mask is great :D"

        "review_detailed_main": "The story in a nutshell: Dog finds enchanted mask. Pre-Dad puts on mask one night for Halloween party. Turns out the mask gave him superpowers capable of doing anything he wants. Has a baby WHILE he has the mask on, thus giving baby superpowers when he is born. Dog gets jealous, decides to put on mask itself, and becomes super-insane dog. Mom goes away for a week, dad's about to face a big battle between his baby, the dog, and a really crazy god called Loki who wants his mask back.\n\nSon of the Mask ends up being a generic, CGI filled, and otherwise throw-away movie, and normally, that would be the end of that. It no longer has Jim Carrey, and has toned down sexual innuendos to cater to kids. Being a parent, I know that young kids will love it, but will you? Here's a little questionnaire to find out:\n\n1: Do you like old Bugs Bunny,Roadrunner,Woody Wood Pecker cartoons?\n\n2:If you watched these mayhem-filled cartoons, would you still laugh?\n\n3:Do you have kids, or a brother/sister under 12?\n\n4: Do you like watching movies that are carried primarily by CGI effects?\n\nIf you answered 'no' to any of the above, you might not like the movie. You may even hate it. It is, after all, a real life cartoon. Things don't make complete sense. It's a very poor sequel in comparison. Jaime Kennedy is no Carrey, amid the fact that the Jamie Kennedy Experiment is a funny show. Alan Cumming as the god Loki? I liked him a lot better painted in dark blue as Nightcrawler in X-2. New Line Cinema paid way too much money to get this one made. I don't think they will get the money back.\n\nBut it's a family friendly film, no naughty words, no nudity. And, hey, when you're at a kids movie, you can't always expect Oscar winning performances. I was laughing my head off at some scenes, including one where the dog draws up a booby-trap plan to get back at the baby, and instead ends up getting caught in the trap itself. Instantly reminded me of Wild E. Coyote, getting his ACME trap to get the Roadrunner, and instead gets caught in it himself. That's the beauty of cartoons, you really don't have to think much, you don't have to ponder, just watch!\n\nWhile I know that this movie will never get a good rating, it doesn't deserve the '1' that everyone is giving it. It's short, at least as good as a hectic cartoon, and every bit as cheesy. I just wish New Line would have spent their money more on the plot or just done another better movie.\n\nIf your kids really bug you to watch this one, do it on the cheap.\n\n5 out of 10. To me, a 5 represents a movie that fails to meet all expectations, may be poorly produced, acted and directed, but may find interest in those that know what to do before watching this movie: films that you remove your brain for."

        "review_detailed_main": "For the record this is the story of the mask which was created by Loki, who after many centuries tries to find it again, only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son.\n\nThis film raises several interesting questions, first and foremost is why is Jaime Kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? Based on this film he is talentless \"actor\" with no charisma. It maybe the film, but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...\n\nThen again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.\n\nThe special effects aren't special. For a \"big budget\" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real, even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.\n\nThe direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.\n\nWhat annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good, its just bad.\n\nWhile this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. For the promise of what might have been I give this a two, however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid, this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity."

But appear in his life a newborn baby with Mask's sensational powers. Meanwhile in Valhalla, the mythological Odin(Bob Hoskins) is infuriate at his son Loki(Alan Cumming) for losing the magical mask and orders look it for and he's willing to get whatever cost. Then, the powerful baby with godlike faculties confronting Loki in an extraordinary taking on.\n\nThis is a rip-roaring sequel from Jim Carrey's successful film. It packs exaggerated humor, frenetic action, excessive jokes, noisy comedy with some nice moments here and there. Pitched at hectic pace, lots of cartoonist special effects,Tex Avery-alike, and with ominous angle camera to create genuine area of apprehension. The film is studded with funny scenes but also some embarrassing. The movie is a vehicle for Jamie Kennedy,the baby and the dog , their rubber faces are an incredible asset magnified by the breathtaking FX, courtesy of Industrial light Magic. Colorful cinematography by Gardiner and lively musical score by Randy Edelman(Last of Mohican,Gettysburg). The film is regularly directed by Laurence Guterman(Cat and dogs), providing a megablast of mayhem with the occasional original touch, even if its whole central set-up fails to convince. Rating : Average though with some entertaining moment."

It's the majority of the film and it's painful to watch. Dancing CGI babies are simply horrible, and this film is filled with them.

The script was original, could be polished a lot, the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL, it apparently beat Star Wars I, or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well, one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy. Loki have good costumes, good makeup, good actor, perfect in appearance and look, but the rest of the story is a mess. The role of Odin rests with a veteran, who shows only pure rage and no expression. The baby and the dog play a supposed humor role:\n\n1. The dog's jealousy towards the baby; Is so original that it is a shame that it was ruined by the type of movie that turned out to be.\n\n2. The baby is the product of an error, and his computer image is as false as the charisma of the film.\n\nBut some scenes of these two entities are memorable, it's a shame that they have been utterly overshadowed by this failed commercial sequel attempt. One of the worst movies of 2005.\n\nP.D. For all the reviewers that said that this movie is good because is targeted to kids, or praise Mr. Guterman because he directed a comedy with cats; go watch the animated TV series \"Kid vs. Kat\" (no pun intended) instead. This cartoon show is more funny than SotM, and also beats this monstrosity."

While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless, the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as, say, Schindler's List (1993) or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Two factors mitigate that lack. One, Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two, Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.\n\nOf course, related to point one above, it's not that every film needs to have a paradigm-shattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me, and debatably they have no plots, even if they make many cogent, often philosophical, \"arguments\" about culture.\n\nBut it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same location--the fictional Edge City--as the first Mask (as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books, upon which both films are based). The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City (it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey, Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke). The mask of Loki, the \"God of mischief\" in Norse mythology, comes floating down a stream, to be found by Tim's dog, Otis (in an alliterative reference to Odin, Loki's father, and a pun on Milo and Otis). Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party, which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss, played by comedian Steven Wright, and his wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard). Prior to this, Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise, and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.\n\nMeanwhile, we get to meet Loki himself (played by Alan Cumming) in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask (of course) and Odin (an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins) is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate, but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki, and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.\n\nAlthough it sounds complex, perhaps, that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal, and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent, Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fathers-to-be experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmas--and director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughout--hinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts, including the importance of personal assertiveness (carried over from the themes of the first film), the quandaries of dual career families, \"sibling\" rivalry, child development issues, and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.\n\nNot that this is primarily a serious film, but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laugh-out-loud comedy, either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism, so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact, I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film, at least to an extent.\n\nThe production design--including things like the sets, matte paintings, costumes, and the ubiquitous cgi--is simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film, Son of the Mask realizes a \"live action\" cartoon.\n\nTex Avery is again a strong reference (made obvious by Kennedy's character being named \"Tim Avery\" and working as an animator), as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening (1955), and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons (involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate, almost Rube Goldbergian \"elimination contraption\").\n\nThe funniest aspect of the movie for me, perhaps, was a kind of \"suspended absurdity\", made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home (which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s) still in shambles from the cartoonish events that preceded--the piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs, the giant boxing glove is still engaged, and so on.\n\nBut the performers have many funny moments, too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carrey-like mannerisms when Tim is The Mask, and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can (of course), these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film, and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask, and entertaining otherwise--he's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny, especially when more surreal.\n\nGiving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me, even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically, at least, this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered."

And after hearing about a vomiting scene I knew that I should stay away from this. From what I have seen this movie is very creepy and ugly. The baby is disturbing to watch. The dog has creepy imagery written all over him. And I wonder why they chose Jamie Kennedy to play the lead role. Seriously, I would approach Robin Williams, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and Dave Coulier before approaching him. I have a hard time eating when I think about this movie. It gives me a bad taste in the mouth. You know you made a bad movie when the poster leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Why is Bob Hoskins in this? Was he missing the days of Roger Rabbit or something? If I was in something like this I would be ashamed to show my family. I hope a true sequel to The Mask (a great movie) happens someday and if it does it should totally make of this movie similar to how Deadpool made fun of Green Lantern I will never sit and watch this movie as long as I live. Are there any movies that are worse than this piece of crap?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Always had been a great fan of THE MASK with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz, it was funny, great and enjoyable for both kids and adults. Why they had to make such a terrible sequel out of it? It makes me cringe. And it's at number 9 on IMDB's Bottom 100 (a well deserved position).\n\nLet me say that the script was mind-numbingly dumb and filled with clich\u00e8s to say the least, with nothing in common with its excellent predecessor. And the direction by Lawrence Guterman, who also directed NUTTY PROFESSOR 2: THE KLUMPS and CATS & DOGS, which were much better, was close to incompetent. The movie's plot is supposed to be about a cartoonist that becomes a dad and tries to raise a child, but the movie rarely follows it, and it's more concentrated on gross and unfunny humour (including the baby making his dad insane, the dog that wants to kill the baby but is the baby that turns all this around and many other moments I won't mention)\n\nThe sets remind a lot of the old Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons, but these and the CGI effects don't have the charm the first movie had. The casting is among the worst you can find in a sequel: Jamie Kennedy was the worst choice for the lead, as he lacks charisma, and the dog and the baby are incredibly frightening. Alan Cumming is a fine actor, and I liked him in various of his movies, but here he is completely wasted as Loki, and he looks disengaged here. And why Bob Hoskins signed for this movie I'll never know.\n\nOne of the worst movies ever made for children, one of the worst sequels ever made (and it should have never been made in the first place), dull, pointless, stupid and even incredibly frightening in some points! Avoid this movie at all costs, your brain will thank you for this!"

And if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece.\n\n\"The Mask\" was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling Jim Carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea, plus you'd have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.\" But no... though to be fair, having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, however, there's nothing there in return, except a steady stream of admittedly decent FX by the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improving on the \"Ally McBeal\" dancing baby and their own \"Baby's Day Out,\" with the Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as \"Siamese Popes\"), naming his character after Tex Avery, and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.\n\nThe trouble is that last approach doesn't really work, partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, \"Duck Amuck\" and especially \"One Froggy Evening\" show up how weak this movie is in comparison. Plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norse god Loki - is far from the apple of Odin's eye... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin, even after \"Super Mario Bros.,\" is beyond me), and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of the son of the Mask) doesn't get much to do; giving HER the Mask might have helped the movie.\n\nFurther points are lost for throwing away Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the \"green guy\" as an animated TV series - \"The Mask\" did become an animated TV series in real life, and was a far better follow up than this sequel. The fact that this actually opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything... what with this and \"Blade: Trinity,\" New Line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from \"Two Guys And A Girl.\" What next, \"The Butterfly Effect 2\" with Nathan Fillion?\n\nSomebody stop this."

They could care less if it had too many cgi effects or if some of the jokes were juvenile in nature. This movie gave them exactly what they look for in a comedy. It is a fun film with loads of slapstick comedy, crazy antics, and lots of physical humor. Jamie Kennedy did a great job appealing to what the younger viewers want to see such as, over the top acting, exaggerated facial expressions, and an overall zany performance. If you take the movie for what it is, which is a silly comedy that provides cheap laughs and a fun atmosphere, than it is a total success.

It is filled with poor CGI, terrible writing, awful acting, and just joke after joke AFTER JOKE of nonstop boredom.\n\nThe Mask itself is totally different. In the first film, it was an obnoxious sex machine, knowing perfectly how to push the buttons of certain people and evade situations in the most cartoonish and childish ways possible. Now, its just a cartoony man that spews fart jokes and other jokes than even Pauly Shore would be embarrassed to mutter.\n\nThe make-up on The Mask is just bad. It literally looks like a mask! The mouth only moves like a centimeter and the overall effect just looks like garbage.\n\nThe attempt at humor is just pitiful. Some scenes in this film are actually quite disturbing in my opinion! Such as the scene where Loki transforms an old lady's face into a giant nose, rendering her to be blind, deaf, and the inability to talk. I would be fine if at the end, they turned her back to normal. But no! We never see her again! Are we just to assume she spent the rest of her life as a giant nose? I don't know, I just kinda find it disturbing. Just the way she is seen lumbering around, pleading for help because she cant see or hear. They play it as a big joke, but it just is downright disturbing to me.\n\nOverall, 84 Million Dollars for this? Wow."

I think the reason most people are complaining about this movie is because it didn't continue the story from the original. Well has anyone ever heard of a SPIN OFF? A NEW CHAPTER? Do we bag Frasier because the cast from cheers aren't back? Do we hate Joey because the cast of Friends isn't back. Back on topic...Son of the Mask is a Live action cartoon.

Even a fake identity would be embarrassed to be associated with this sub-par, incredibly mediocre, poorly executed film. I hope this won't be considered Jamie Kennedy's breakout film. It's more of a breakdown type of thing. Therefore, this move by any other name would still be a turd in a handbag. Good luck to the movie going public. To my good friend, the next film I get to pick."

The original, although hated by some, was something I found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, \"Smoooooookin!\" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? The writing and story: terrible. Why would I ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? Moreover why would I want to see it fly? Ever? HOW DID SOMEONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! The acting is despicable, in fact nearly everything about this movie is. I'm trying to keep calm, or IMDb probably won't let me post this. Bottom line: don't watch this piece of trash. Pick up the original, see how good Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey used to have a career, and laugh. Don't waste even a second of your time on this."

I am sure they could have cut him out, and it wouldn't affect the movie at all.\n\nOverall, you can live without seeing this. It is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though.

If there were never a first Mask movie, critics could have reviewed the movie from a different viewpoint making way for reviews about the actual movie, not the fact that Jim Carrey isn't in it. Not to mention all the reviews are comparing it to the Jim Carrey movie, which it isn't anything like or really trying to be. Despite what \"everybody\" says, I don't think it would have worked plot-wise if Jim Carrey was in a sequel. He didn't want the mask in the end of the first film. It got him into a lot of bad situations, why would he wouldn't want to wear it again? There was no more story to tell from that perspective. They needed to start out with a fresh story, and that's what they did, and the concept really wasn't that bad.\n\nAlthough it was an interesting effort, I don't think Alan Cumming's role really wasn't necessary, considering it's a mythical god playing a villain. I also would have liked to see Tim's character wear the mask more, there was a dry spell in the middle of the movie when it got too drawn out following the baby when it wasn't doing anything except being cute.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the first Mask movie, as well as the original Mask comics and I see the object of just the Mask itself for what it is and what it does for its wearer. The Loki Mask itself bringing out the characters inner-most self and is the whole object of the Mask movies. If you don't like or understand that concept, you probably won't like this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "A baby literally bouncing off the walls, a game of \"Super Twister,\" and watching Ben Stein's face separate from his head all mixed into one movie will only bring one thing... the Son of the Mask.\n\nAvid cartoonist Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy, Malibu's Most Wanted, Scream Trilogy) suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son Alvey (Ryan and Liam Falconer) as his wife goes to New York for a week on business. It soon becomes known that Alvey has \"powers\" of the mask of Loki (Alan Cumming, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, X2). Now, Loki wants his powers and mask back...\n\nBased on the fact that little-known director Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs, Headless!) had directed this film, I definitely did not expect such work. This film was well put together and could attract many audiences.\n\nThe acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. Kennedy and Cumming portrayed their characters well, which was highly expected from the experience they have. Appearances from Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle) and Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) really accentuated the film. Transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. Noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely, considering the director's lack of high profile experience, but it did astonish me.\n\nAs always, with the good comes the bad. The film contained minor \"hokey\" elements that I wasn't lured toward. Although I felt this way, the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. I'll denounce this upon age difference.\n\nSon of the Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language. I must admit it was a little harshly rated. This PG kisses the borderline of PG-13 at times. The raw and risqu\u00e9 humor and language was periodically unnecessary.\n\nA nice additive of the movie was the special effects, which were essential. Kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. At times, he had to breathe only through a straw. The effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers.\n\nIf you are searching for a collective laugh, Son of the Mask may be a film to invest in seeing. Watching the original Mask (Jim Carrey) would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. However, this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences, so mind that. Otherwise, for some good, clean fun, Son of the Mask may be right up your alley."

After using the mask for a Halloween party, he keeps it on as he makes love to his wife. As a result, she gives birth to a son who carries the powers of the Mask. So on top of the crummy writing, terrible acting, weird production design, and unflattering cinematography, it also contains the most horrific and rotten CGI effects ever put to film. Son of the Mask is the sorriest excuse for a Jim Carrey-less sequel. At least Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd was a prequel set in their high school years, and at least it had a redeemable factor in the form of an explicit Bob Saget rant.

Very difficult for me to choose.\n\nThis film isn't perfect, but it doesn't deserve such a low rating. I've seen films worse than these! This movie was made for enjoyment purposes and it seems that some people have overlooked that fact."

IT IS EVIL!!!!\n\nUpside: Nothing worth mentioning.\n\nDownsides: Where do I start? Besides from the awkward acting, uninteresting characters, poor story, lame comedy, and horrible effects, it is scary. The visuals are so disturbing and so terrifying, you'd swear this was meant to be a horror film. It's like the movie is possessed and wants to jump out of the screen and eat you!\n\nVerdict: If a sequel to a Jim Carrey movie doesn't have Jim Carrey in it, you know it's going to suck. For me, SKIP THIS MOVIE."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Mask\", starring Jim Carrey, was an absolute success when it was released in 1994, and I would say well deservingly. Not exactly a classic in my book, but a good movie nonetheless. \"Son of the Mask\", a sequel to the 1994 blockbuster, came nearly eleven years later, featuring a different set of characters and a different cast, but still the same mask. Unfortunately, this didn't work out so well. Unlike the 1994 original, this one flopped, even won a Razzie Award, and was nominated for a bunch of others! Since this sequel is in the bottom 100, it's generally considered atrocious, and I can't exactly say I'm with the majority on this one, but can still describe the film as pretty much worthless.\n\nLoki, the Norse night god of mischief, has been sent by his father, Odin, to find Loki's mask, which will not be easy, as he will find more than one replica of this mask. During his search, his real mask is found by a dog named Otis, owned by an aspiring cartoonist named Tim Avery. Otis brings the mask to his owner, so it is now in the hands of this aspiring cartoonist, though he is obviously unaware of its powers at first! After this, Tim soon becomes a father, with a newborn son named Alvey, who is born with the powers of Loki! While Tim's wife, Tonya, is out on a business trip, he finds that looking after Alvey on his own as he tries to fulfill his ambition is very difficult as he gradually learns the extent of his son's powers! Meanwhile, Loki has been informed by Odin that a baby has been born with his powers, and he will find the mask if he finds this baby. Since the Norse night god of mischief is so determined to get it, Tim could be headed for even more trouble!\n\nWhy can't I vote 1/10 for this movie like the majority of others? Well, I just wasn't absolutely revolted by it. My biggest problem with the movie is that it simply isn't funny. I'll admit, I did smile a couple times (I think that includes the part where Alvey has just been influenced by TV and starts singing \"Ragtime Gal\", but the gags involving the baby and his TV imitations wear thin VERY fast, and I definitely smiled at the part where Loki slaps Odin) and came close to it at other times, but for the most part, I didn't even find it remotely amusing. We have some lame fart and bowel movement jokes, but an upside is that they tend to keep the gross-out gags brief. Another one of these gags is one where Loki turns a woman's head into a giant nose, and she sneezes, blowing out a ton of snot on the ground. Once again, lame, but once again, they kept it brief. So, while these gags do make the film worse, they would have sunk it even more if they put more of them in and/or made them longer and more graphic. Now, don't get me wrong, I am NOT defending \"Son of the Mask\", I'm just saying why I don't think it's as bad as apparently most people who have seen it do. Overall, I found the movie boring, and some of the gags put a confused look on my face, which may include some of the ones I've mentioned, as well as Otis hopelessly trying to get rid of Alvey while wearing the mask, which involves a lot of slapstick, but they didn't pull it off.\n\nFor a long time, I have been aware of the fact that Jim Carrey played the starring role of Stanley Ipkiss in the 1994 blockbuster, but in this sequel, I didn't recognize anybody, other than Kal Penn (I had only seen him in the dreadful \"Epic Movie\", which I see has a slightly higher rating here, though I think it's significantly worse), and Ben Stein (he was in the \"The Mask\", and I also saw him in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", another funny movie). After watching this \"Mask\" sequel, I have learned that Loki was played by Alan Cumming (hadn't memorized his name yet), who I had seen in the short \"Blind Date\" episode of \"Mr. Bean\" and in \"X2\", both good roles, though I didn't know it was the same actor in both of them. However, regardless of how familiar I am with the cast members, none of them are any match for Jim Carrey and the comic talent he showed in \"The Mask\". When Tim Avery (played by Jamie Kennedy) has the Mask on, he is definitely similar to Stanley Ipkiss with it on, but one difference is that he is not funny. The cast as a whole is certainly nothing to rave about, and that's not the only problem with the movie, due to other things I've pointed out. So, while I don't hate this film with a passion, I do not recommend it, and won't say it didn't deserve its Razzie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "How does this happen? The original Jim Carrey classic \"The Mask\"- one of the films that launched his career in the 90's, was a silly, well-made and highly stylized comedic film. It was great fun and still holds up fairly well nearly 20 years after its release.\n\n11 years after the first film's release, New Line unleashed this stand- alone sequel, \"Son of the Mask.\" I knew I was in for a bad film from the previews, but I had no idea it would be this dreadful.\n\nEverything about this film is pretty much sup-par. From uneven direction (some scenes in the beginning are beautifully shot, but it quickly degenerates into uneven-at-best), to an awful script, to effects that are just eerie to look at (particularly the CGI baby effects which fall into the dreaded \"Uncanny Valley\"), to mixed performances and bad makeup effects. This film has a lot at its disposal, and it does everything wrong with its abundant resources.\n\nJamie Kennedy (who I actually don't hate at all, he's funny in moderation) plays Tim Avery, a struggling cartoonist working a dead-end job as a suited mascot tour-guide at the animation studio where he works. He is married to the lovely Tonya (Traylor Howard), who wants a baby. (Although Tonya is little more in this film than a caricature of the concept of a woman's Biological Clock) One day, his dog Otis finds the ancient mask of Loki from the first film and brings it home. In a bind for his work's Halloween party, Tim puts the mask on, turning into a dumbed-down version of the Mask character from the first film. (Which consists of a creepy-looking prosthetic green mask and plastic-looking hairpiece, and Kennedy trying his hardest to do a Jim Carrey impression)\n\nHe is the hit of the party (although I have no clue why, he's just creepy and weird) and inspires the head of the company (Steven Wright) to create a cartoon based on the character with Tim. On that night, Tonya also got pregnant while Tim was wearing the mask, and after a dreadfully unfunny montage where Tonya goes through exaggerated signs of pregnancy, a baby named Alvey is born, who has all of the powers of the mask, causing various mayhem. Otis the dog also gets the mask on several times, to cash in on the goofy sequence from the first film where Milo wears it for about 30 seconds. While this nonsense is going on, Loki (the dreadfully under-utilized and talented Alan Cumming), god of Mischief and creator of the mask, is sent to recover it by his father Thor. (Bob Hoskins wasted in a glorified cameo)\n\nI guess I should explain what about this film does work, and there area a few bits and pieces I liked, hence I gave this a 2 out of 10, and not a 1 out of 10. For starters, the first few minutes are fairly well done and have a slight taste of the creativity of the original. Also, there are a few moments, here and there, that are pretty funny in a way that calls back to classic Warner Bros. cartoons. And some of the effects not concerning the baby are nice.\n\nBut asides from that, this really is a trainwreck of the highest magnitude. Everything about the production feels like a let-down, and its clear no thought went into this and it was a mere cash-in on the original.\n\nI give \"Son of the Mask\" an extremely poor 2 out of 10. Avoid it."

(The singing frog for example). Loki was hilarious and the baby effects well done, and Otis the Dog a stand-out (the shot where he gives up what he's doing to get the bone is a gem) Overall, some of the effects were overly-laboured, such as the urinating and exorcism vomit scenes.

Quite good as ODIN, father of the gods.\n\nSurprisingly, from my point of view, what could be the highlight of the show, the FX/digitally animated scenes/action between the dog and the baby that gives the name to the movie - the son of the mask - and all the other digital animations in the movie, are what actually spoils it. Some parts are all too excessive and boring , showing some abuse in the use of CGI effects. Or the lack of imagination and plagiarism ( as when the dog, that looks rather like ipkiss's dog, puts on and changes into the mask, like in the previous movie).\n\nAlan Cumming is pleasant , sometimes a bit annoying in his matrix stile wearing.\n\nAll in all, if i were to choose, i would go for a whole digitally animated movie like the breakthrough one's these days, and far better. That would certainly be a better choice, probably a winning one. This is not the case though, a mild movie dangerously in the border of average and bad, but still, manages not to fall down completely. 5 out 10"

I mean, c'mon Hollywood, why do you gotta make a remake or sequel of every damn movie? You are just wasting money and ruining classics (because The Mask is a classic comedy of the 90s and one of Jim Carrey's finest works). Such a shame that Alan Cumming, late Bob Hoskins and any actor of this ensemble decided to sign for this. Anyway, this is a forgettable movie and the world stills going it's way even though this disaster was made."

The Mask with that orange hair and no expressions? And a baby with superpowers? C'mon...\n\nThe movie is so bad that can't even be cult, because who made this really thought it would be awesome.\n\nLook, I already knew it would be bad.

After conceiving an infant son by the magical powers of the mask, he understands just how difficult child raising can be.\n\nThere are certain films which leaves so great impression on the viewers that remaking the film or making the sequel of the film is always a tedious task and one needs some great story or some great creativity to either recreate or make sequel but alas in the case of this film we neither has any great story or great creativity and has some terrible plot and messy execution.\n\nThe plot of the film is stale and cliched and the execution is terrible, the film should've never been made in the first place. The film lacks almost everything. The film has some bad VFX, pathetic acting, humorless jokes and pale climax.\n\nI didn't found any reason to advise you to watch this film for me it was a complete waste of time."

The good thing is that it has got some catchy actups that can attract the children and especially babies as you well know they love colours and gestures which they take as actions.\n\nThe movie has the relations of a newly made father and son compared to another father-son pair that's messed up and the Family of the Mask, the Dog, Loki, ( and Thor) and the Gods are creamed up in between.\n\nBetter make sure that one has the movie's playing time as completely useless to invest the time to watch this.

Now unless \"Son of the Mask\" was TRYING to be a saccharine CG-fetishizing suck fest, it probably missed its mark.\n\nJamie Kennedy is truly an underrated creative talent whom I hoped would carry the movie. Add in Ben Stein, Bob Hoskins, Kal Penn, and a refreshing supporting role by Steven Wright and you can see how much screen time was wasted on drawn-out cartoonish action sequences and digital manipulations of the baby's three expressions.\n\nTaking into account the director's previous work on \"Cats and Dogs\" and \"Antz,\" it is easy to see the source of the neglect: human characters (and actors) seem to take a back seat to novelty leads under Guterman's direction.\n\nSeveral segments were entirely over-descriptive of the plot/upcoming action to even be considered subtle foreshadowing, including a gratuitous 2-minute synopsis of a classic cartoon. Rather than innovative media sampling and dynamic background asides, certain parts just come off as cinematic laziness.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with a little toilet humor, especially in a kid's movie; however some of the bodily fluid scenes would probably be considered profane by the FCC.\n\nThe special effects were pretty seamless and elaborated on the conventions established by the first film, but for the most part served as lengthy breaks from plot advancement and character development. They certainly got the right FX house, because ILM has plenty of experience in this field! Alan Cummings played a dynamic and likable villain, and Traylor Howard a generic, but hot, Gen-Xer mom.\n\nOverall, the movie had its moments, but missed the boat by ignoring a talented and capable cast and dumbing down the humor to the point of being patronizing even to children. The best kids movies work on several levels.\n\nI'd recommend sitting this one out and giving the rug rats something to do for 86 minutes."

The movie in a matter of 3 short weeks has totally fallen out of the top 20 and is down to one showing in the basement room of most theaters.

With the budget for this movie close to 90 million and another 20 million promotion, it is this years Gigli. a failure on all levels. All I have to say is good thing New Line made tons of money off the LOtR movies.

The star of the show should have been the Mask effects here, since this time you don't have an actor half as skilled as Jim Carrey at making you invest your emotions in the main character. You can tell the producers are itching to get 'wacky' and put their money up on screen too, but before they can do that they disappointingly decided that what was necessary first was to write lame domesticated scenes in an attempt to bullishly hammer home a sickly sappy wholesome moral. I didn't care about Kennedy or Howard; nor did I want to watch their dog monopolise the Mask for what felt like an eternity, turning a mildly amusing 'bit' from the first film into an entire and crushingly leaden subplot for the second...\n\nOnce Loki got on the trail of the baby, it improved just enough for me to think it bearable. I liked the idea of a folklore-d foot-soldier taking charge of an innocent baby (it put me in mind of the immeasurably superior \"Labyrinth\", whether intentionally or not) and the movie references were fun at first, I guess (\"Ransom\", for example). Overall, though, it's difficult to deny that this is a poorly-conceived sequel that wastes its opportunities by stalling for far too long and never knowing what best to do with the powers of the Mask when the time is felt ultimately right."

I went back a couple of days later to see it again because I enjoyed it so much.\n\nA classic is best left alone without a sequel. For me it was not even worthy of calling a sequel. The screenplay was crap, the acting was crap, the so-called special effects were a ridiculous attempt to recreate some of the funnier scenes of the original but completely failed on all levels.\n\nEd Wood was probably the worst director of all time, and his film \" Plan 9 from Outer Space \" is reputed to be the worst film of all time. I love it!! It really IS so crap that it is funny because of that fact. Son of the Mask on the other hand is like taking a classic such as The Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption and making a 3rd rate cartoon out of them voiced by actors with completely no substance.\n\nA franchise CAN consist of only one film and this is a perfect example.\n\nHow Bob Hoskins and one of my favourite comedians Steven Wright got mixed up in this pile of trash is one of the great mysteries of the universe.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!"

The CGI baby effects are not great, but I imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks, they could have been better!\n\nMoose, the dog from \"Frasier,\" phoned in his usual exemplary performance.

Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, which we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable.\n\nThe actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute-as-a-button, as you'd expect, and Jamie Kennedy stunk, as you'd expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy.

I had seen the Critic's review so many times (if only because it was the first one that referenced \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\") that I was familiar with most of the material. There's still stupid scenes he didn't really talk about. Loki tries to search for his mask through various disguises including a plumber with his butt crack. Why exactly wasn't Loki searching for the mask in the first movie? If Odin knew there was a baby born from the mask, how did he not know where he was?\n\nThe only actor or character from the first movie to appear is Ben Stein. I would honestly watch his stupid anti-evolution documentary over this. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen with the baby looking hideous in most shots. Loki only appeared briefly in \"Avengers: Infinity War\", but that was still a much better representation of him. As we end Channel Awesome Month, we start next with Sequel Month! If Doug and Rob Walker refuse to address the controversy surrounding their website, than that's their problem. 1/2*"

Obviously its not amazing to go into the top 250 but it still had a plot to it.\n\nEveryone knows that the first one was much better mainly because of more experienced actors. In this on Jamie Kennedy did a great job at pulling off a hard working father. Alan Cumming has worked in children's movies before such as Spy Kids but he was too very good.This movie may be a little silly with all the curses and stuff but this movie is a comedy it has to not make sense its just a bit of fun! I know loads of people hate this movie but to be honest there are much worse movies than this. In my opinion this was a fun movie and I would advice to watch it you are feeling like watching a fun film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sequel to \"The Mask\" is out! But this one doesn't have Jim Carrey. What a pity! I think this sequel should be a story of its own. Jamie Kennedy best known for his own show, and the comedy \"Malibu's Most Wanted\" tries his luck as the green masked buffoon that made Carrey famous. The real deal was the dog who wears the mask more than Tim Avery(Kennedy). And this dog is more mischievous than Milo. He'll do anything for attention. As for Tim, he is so preoccupied, he lets everything whizzes by him. Including that Norse god Loki(Alan Cumming). One question comes to mind, \"Where is Thor?\" That would be another show.\n\nThis movie is good, but it lacks the hit making chemistry that \"The Mask\" has. Though it has Ben Stein from the first one, It was funny from the robbery scene where Loki dealt with the security guards when he said \"Thanks for dropping by\". A real knee slapper there! Some parts really funny, some way too off the wall for me. This sequel was a few years too late. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "I usually try to review movies on their own merit but with this one, I have to go into some back story. The first Mask movie was not really a good movie, but it was watchable, mind you, I never really liked the Mask cartoon so my view might be a bit skewed. See, the first film had two things that this one did not. First, it had Jim Carrey in the lead role, who is able to act out in a way similar to the mask character, which gives the character a certain amount of verisimilitude. Secondly, it has a plot, there is a clear progression forwards where there are actual stakes for the characters. Also, the setting is a lot darker than in Son of the Mask which makes the character stand out more against the background.\n\nSon of the Mask however, has no plot, there is stuff going on but the story doesn't move forward. The setting is this garish, cartoonish world where none of the masks shenanigans has any consequence. It really is just a cartoon with one over the top gag after another. The original had very little potential for a sequel, and yet they still tried to make a follow up by pouring a bucket load of animated effects on a weak script. It didn't work, the only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because it didn't make me all that angry."

I remember loving the first one but that was so long ago I couldn't really remember the actual storyline when I was watching this so I wasn't comparing it to the original, just enjoying it as one of those fun, slightly mental movies that is just a laugh. I used to watch Jamie Kennedy's show JKX (an earlier version of \"punk'd\" but without the celebrities and much madder set-ups!) and I was a big fan. He's absolutely hilarious! Although...he does end up being out-shined by the insane special effects and the even more special baby. Just watch this movie with a big bunch of friends and enjoy it for what it is: a mad-cap adventure with a weak storyline that somehow has a sweet ending, that really will have you in stitches. Oh, and if you just happen to enjoy it, check out Malibu's Most Wanted, another Jamie Kennedy great, based on one of the most popular skits from JKX. Jamie Kennedy ROCKS!!"

Tonya would love to start a family but Tim wants to first make it big, as a cartoonist, for the animation company he works for. Get ready for a turn of events. The couple's darling dog brings home THE mask, the one Jim Carrey wore in the first film and Tim falls under its spell for an evening. Not only does he score big points at a company party for his cartoon ideas, he also scores when he gets home. Tonya is delighted when she becomes pregnant. However, when their son Alvey is born, he has mask-like powers from time to time. This is known only to Tim and the Norse God Thor and his son, Loki. Seems Thor wants the mask out of human hands and orders Loki to find it and the magical child. Let the games begin. This is not really horrible entertainment, as one may have heard or expect. The plot zips along nicely and the performers do their jobs well, especially Alan Cumming as Loki. The art direction and special effects are the true highlights, however. The film sports vibrant colors everywhere and the effects are truly amazing. Watch Loki change identities, each one adorable, or watch the baby swing his father, Tim, around when he feels like it. And much more, including a big ending at the car garage. If you liked the first film, you will miss Carrey, no doubt about it. But, give this one a chance. It qualifies definitely as entertainment rather than art, which is not always an unwelcome thing. Smiles will abound at any showing."

They should make it a law to stop movie-makers from taking hit Jim Carrey movies and making sequels without Jim that suck.\n\nAfter doing so many good movies in the 1980s, Bob Hoskins seems to have hit rock-bottom. His performance as Odin can't save this turkey. Ditto Jamie Kennedy (who seems to be doing a poor Jim Carrey imitation) and Alan Cumming (who isn't much of an actor in my opinion). The dog-wearing-the-mask bit was already done in the first film, and the dancing baby singing 1940s swing tunes is an idea that would have been laughed off by the makers of \"Ally McBeal\".\n\nDid the makers of this movie actually think that a scene where a baby attacks his father with squirting urine would make people laugh? It didn't for me. It made me cringe. Oh, the horror!!! Please just rent the original and avoid this dreck."

I must say that it is partially my fault, as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first \"Mask\" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.\n\nTen minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster. Disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter, but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.\n\nFinding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as I did is surprising to even me, as I loved \"Scary Movie\" and \"Anchorman\", two films which many people I know found crude and offensive. But the thing is, \"Son of the Mask\" is not funny unless you're under the age of ten.\n\nThe film features lots of CGI in it, but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. Whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential, considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it has none of the laughs, fun, or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original \"Mask\" to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "Want it or not, The Mask, starring Jim Carrey was an amazing success. The story was not perfect, but we can't forget it was a comedy and the kind of film din't require anything extremely good. But it was a success. Jim Carrey, an excellent comedian, and revealed to be a great dancer too. The effects, the characters, the environment, everything was pretty good and made it a very good movie. Almost everybody associates Jim Carrey to the Mask ans vise-versa.\n\nSon of the mask is a disaster... and awful disaster. Everybody knows that making a second movie after a great success is risky and almost every time, is not so good as the first one. In this case the \"not so good\" could be a compliment, as Son Of The Mask revealed to be the worst movie i ever seen. But why? So here it goes: 1\u00ba - The characters are bad. they're personality is horrible, complete loosers (not like Stanley Hipkiss, not even close.). 2\u00ba - The actors are the worst i have ever seen. Come on people... making a second mask movie without Jim Carrey ??? or without any actor with the same status as Jim?? I mean, professionals! These guys can'0t even act as ordinary people in they's day-to-day lives... When I saw this Jamie Kennedy as the mask.... Jesus.... i couldn't believe... it was SO INCREDIBLY BAD!!! The make up, the posture, the face, everything.... the guy doesn't even move any muscle in his face... I can't believe they destroyed The Mask this way... people, put this in your mind: there will never be any Mask like Jim Carrey. Or even close! 3\u00ba The story is incredibly bad... when people watch a movie, there is supposed to be a connection between the watcher and the movie. there has got to be something interesting, something funny, something that makes you see the movie until the end. And actually like the movie. You don't have any connection to this movie. You star to watch and you wonder when it is over, 'cause it's so bad, you want to stop watching it! 4\u00ba Don't have the skill, don't mess. This title completely destroyed the mask, the funny the mask was. After a decade, people still watch the original The Mask starring Jim Carrey, and they still laugh an enjoy the movie as if it was the first time it was seen. With this disgusting sequel i'm afraid The Mask looses it's beauty in comedy and it's magic.\n\nSo, my advice is: if you liked very much The Mask, don't you dare to watch this Son Of The Mask thing, 'cause you're gonna get disappointed and very sad about what they've done with the original title. If you loved The Mask, forget that Son Of The Mask has ever been made. But actually, my advice is: EVERYONE -> DON'T WATCH THIS, DON'T RENT IT, DON'T BUY IT. IT'S SSSSSOOOOOOOOOO BBBBAAAAAADDDDDD!!!!!\n\nI even saw someone's review saying that this Son Of The Mask is a great movie for kids... please... children are not \"stupid beings\". Can't they have good content, on what they see, anymore ? But that also has another point... The Mask was not supposed to be ONLY for kids... The original Mask was a movie for everyone!! AND IT WAS GOOD. I'm not just complaining, i mean, Son Of The Mask is an interesting title, i actually lead me to watch it. but please.... why use these title in such an awful movie?? why not a GOOD sequel???\n\nI'm sorry Lawrence Guterman, but you could have done MUCH better. I know it's a cheap movie to direct... but the result is the worst thing i've ever seen, and i'm not the only one.\n\nAnd by the way, to all actors of this movie, specially to Jamie Kennedy: go to acting school, or go there again. learn something there and come back to the movie business. And learn, as well, what is true comedy. Learn with Jim.\n\nAnd if any director is thinking about making another movie about The Mask... please.... choose experts, choose great actors, great comedians, great effects, great music, and great story. otherwise... don't mess anymore, don't destroy The Mask anymore."

Acting is not bad, and Jamie Kennedy is trying his best. I think he tries to follow Jim, and sometimes he succeeds. The final conclusion: this movie is NOT as bad as it could have been."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by stating that I am a big fan of the original Mask with Jim Carrey. I watched this movie because I purchased it as part of a double feature DVD for $5. And I must say with all seriousness, that I was absolutely dumbfounded by what I saw. It was, unquestionably, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life! I literally watched the whole movie, because I refused to believe that I had completely wasted my time spent watching it. I was absolutely convinced that there had to be at least one somewhat funny part in the movie. However, I was dead wrong. Jamie Kennedy's attempts at comedy in that movie were so awkward and uncomforting that I literally cringed throughout the whole thing. I probably felt similar to how a child feels when they are about to be molested by a pedophile. Unfortunately for me (the viewer), however, I did not have free candy or a nice ride in a white van to brag about. My innocence was stolen that day.\n\nAfter watching the movie, two thoughts have stuck in my head regarding the film.\n\nFirst off, I did not know that Hollywood actually made movies this bad. It seems that there should be some standard that all movies are required to meet. This was so bad, it didn't even seem real.\n\nSecondly, as the movie went on, I found myself developing a profound hatred for Jamie Kennedy. It's been about two years since I viewed it, and I still feel that he needs to have his ass kicked for the part he played in it. What he has done to the world of Arts of Humanities is comparable to 1st-Degree Manslaughter.\n\nI urge you to not watch this movie unless you are dedicated to being a part of history--as you can then say that you have watched the worst movie of all time. However, if you do decide to watch it for the hell of it, you run the risk of becoming less of a person."

Jim Carrey wasn't in the film. Instead, Jamie Kennedy. Serously? Jamie Kennedy does a horrible job as his character. Along with the rest of the cast.

Loki's infuriated father, Odin, orders Loki to take back what's his, one way or another. The film stars Jamie Kennedy. He did a very poor job playing the role of Tim Avery. In the first film, The Mask, the protagonist was Stanley Ipkiss, played by the hilarious Jim Carrey and with this one, Tim Avery was the protagonist. I don't get that. Why not use Jim Carrey again? He's far better than Jamie. The director, Lawrence Guterman ruined a great movie with this crap follow up! Then there's Tim's wife Tonya, who also did a bad job acting, but hey, she did a better job than Jamie.\n\nThis movie is terrible, and no one should have to see it. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as King's Ransom. I watched this movie once or twice, and I will not be watching it again! The best way to enjoy this movie is not to see it in the first place."

        "review_title": "A Disturbing display of unfunny jokes, hideous aesthetic quality and shocking overall delivery.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I know a lot of people don't like sequels. Some say they endanger the first film by maybe disgracing it, others say they're just a cash in. Sometimes filmmakers get it right (Terminator 2: Judgement Day) but other times, they get it wrong. Son of the Mask is a great example of an instance when they do just that. Son of the Mask has to be one of the worst sequels of all time and even though the first Mask film was no classic, it had its moments and I truly mean that. What Son of the Mask is, is nothing more than a nasty to look at, nasty to watch, mess of bad and unfunny jokes mixed in with horrible music and nasty to look at visuals.\n\nFrom the off, Son of the Mask begins its terrible decent into celluloid waste. It messes around, very dangerously, with the original Mask film's premise. We are told that Loki: the Nordic God of mischief, created the mask in question and banished it himself to Earth for people to find, fool around with and create mischief of their own. It's Loki's job in this film to find it, by rule of Odin, so that he can get back into Valhalla or wherever. This immediately goes against the first film as we were told Loki was, in fact, BANISHED from his heaven and imprisoned inside this mask that was then placed on the earth; hopefully for no one to ever find. Thus, destroying the equilibrium. This is the first mistake the film makes of many and if you can't even get your equilibriums right, you're in big trouble.\n\nFirst of all; the characters. Loki in this film is evil. He is genuinely evil and it spoils the image that was created in the first film when he was a mischievous, funny, maybe misunderstood God. In Son of the Mask, he acts as the villain of the piece and that is very disorientating, especially if you've seen the first film and I had a big problem with this. Then we move onto the supposed hero. The hero is Tim Avery (Kennedy) a comic book artist who lacks big inspiration. The fact he has one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard in a film and acts like a twelve year old throughout is enough to utterly repel you from any sort of feeling or relation towards him. These are bad principals for a hero to have. Thirdly, when we actually see our hero wear the mask; its not only a let down as so much as a shockingly unfunny and downright embarrassing series of events that I've ever witnessed in a film.\n\nThe scene in question is the company he works for and their large function they're having. There's no build up like their was in the first film, there's no motivation to even wear the mask and our hero's position in Son of the Mask isn't as desperate as Ipkiss' was in the first film. Anyway, once the mask goes on; we're treated to an absolutely hideous display of camera work including close ups of the ugly Mask character's face, fast editing as we struggle to grasp what it is we're seeing, music so bad you have to cover your ears and dance numbers so cringe-worthingly bad that it hurts to watch.\n\nThen comes the plot. The plot is straight forward enough as I've explained. Loki's trying to find his mask that he supposedly created. What happens is Loki spends so much time going from house to house trying to find his Mask that I, personally, began to stop caring. Each visit was just an excuse to 'do something funny' and with jokes so blatantly aimed at children; it was difficult to watch. Another thing is the pointless, 'in there for laughs' subplot that opens up. This involves the baby that's born that is given the powers of the mask. Halfway through the child seems it fit to copy various cartoons on the TV to try and get their father (who's the hero) condemned to a mental institute. This is bad enough as the writers aren't even using their own initiative to create material. To counteract this, the family's dog attempts to defy the baby. Although maybe funny the first time this quickly plays out into utter farce and serves no bearing on the rest of the film; it's just a pointless mess of jokes and gags that makes you feel like you're watching an episode of Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote. During this, for some reason the father doesn't actually think of perhaps filming the baby or something like that rather than pick him up and run to the neighbour's house; thus trying to convince them the baby can sing and dance. Oh look, it's stopped: what a surprise.\n\nPlot holes? You bet. Loki has his powers taken away from him and is made mortal during a scrap in an alley way; yet survives the baby's counterattack of having two rubbish skips crush him. He's, literally, just been made mortal yet survives being crushed. Another instance is nearer the end when Avery's Mask character does battle with Loki over the child. Loki states 'Stop! We are evenly matched!' Well, of course you are! The guy's wearing your mask; he has your powers. It took them about ten minutes to figure that out(!) I also really feel that although the acting talent it has on display, if they'd have known it was going to be anything like how it was, they would've kept well away. With these things and a few hundred plot holes heaped on top, Son of the Mask can easily be labelled as one of the worst films ever made; in fact it makes 'The Mask' look like a masterpiece."

Although to give them a break most of the actors do try but the editing and direction just doesn't do anything to assist them.

Now he has to find a baby and take it too.\n\nThe movie isn't very funny, and the special effects are awful, the first movies special effects are 10 years more advanced, pretty bad for a movie made 10 years after.

Avid cartoonist Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy, Malibu's Most Wanted, Scream Trilogy) suddenly is burdened to act as a single parent to his newborn son Alvey (Ryan and Liam Falconer) as his wife goes to New York for a week on business. It soon becomes known that Alvey has \"powers\" of the mask of Loki (Alan Cumming, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, X2). Now, Loki wants his powers and mask back... Based on the fact that little-known director Lawrence Guterman (Cats & Dogs, Headless!) had directed this film, I definitely did not expect such work. This film was well put together and could attract many audiences. The acting of this motion picture was fulfilling. Kennedy and Cumming portrayed their characters well, which was highly expected from the experience they have. Appearances from Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle) and Ben Stein (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) really accentuated the film. Transitions throughout the entire hour and 45 minutes were par excellence. Noticing this from a genre of the sort is highly unlikely, considering the director's lack of high profile experience, but it did astonish me. As always, with the good comes the bad. The film contained minor \"hokey\" elements that I wasn't lured toward. Although I felt this way, the preteens of the theatre obtained kicks and giggles from it. I'll denounce this upon age difference. Son of the Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language. I must admit it was a little harshly rated. This PG kisses the borderline of PG-13 at times. The raw and risqu\u00e9 humor and language was periodically unnecessary. A nice additive of the movie was the special effects, which were essential. Kennedy spent three and a half hours a day in makeup consisting of foam rubber for the mask. At times, he had to breathe only through a straw. The effects were paid off well as the intrigue struck many viewers. If you are searching for a collective laugh, Son of the Mask may be a film to invest in seeing. Watching the original Mask (Jim Carrey) would not be a prerequisite to see this movie. However, this movie is aimed towards the younger audiences, so mind that. Otherwise, for some good, clean fun, Son of the Mask may be right up your alley."

When i saw son of the mask it was like he was using that same stupid character from Malibu's only i think this is how Jamie Kennedy act for real in any case its pathetic, there were no funny points to the movie at all and i couldn't believe they spent 100 million dollars on this film, they obviously couldn't dub over his voice to make this movie good or decent with that 100 million dollars, the movie looked like it was thrown together by a bunch of amateur high school student just learning how to make movies and produce CGI. my recommendations are to stay away from this movie and its not even worth watching on free T.V. 1 out 10 i'd give a lower mark but 1's all i can give it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Son of the Mask is the sequel to a film that had amazing effects, great \"on his own rubbery\" actor, Jim Carrey and was dark comedy that made fans look forward to Son of the Mask. Son of the Mask would have been a good movie if it wasn't a sequel, its a Kids Movie, the first was an adults.\n\nThe movie went over board with effects that was the trade mark of the first. The main problem about this one is that not only did the effects look unreal at points, usually when the mask is put on and off, but they were almost unneeded, in the first the effects are more used for the point of making the actor quick and usually dresses him into weird clothing later to be introduced as a new character \"the cowboy\", in the Son of the Mash the effects where used as the jokes. The movie made a lot of mistakes including the mask working during the day and tried to re-capture the magic of the first one by including music and exact scenes from the mask.\n\nFinally comments: The film wasn't appealing to many as it was a kid film, nothing made it eye catching like the first, personally I would have liked to have scene a spin off starring Milo as the mask instead of making a sequel. The only good thing about the film was that it made me love the original even more which is why I give it a five."

Secondly, the son of the mask is apparently a mixture of human and mask, which makes no sense. That's why it was a mask... you put it on your face. The kid doesn't even wear a mask. The whole movie was a pathetic attempt at making a funny sequel. Which if you think about it, the movie makes absolutely no sense. The more I think about it, I wonder why it was even made. I used to imagine there being a sequel to the Mask, and that if so, it would have some sort of appeasing story and cast. I disliked the movie extremely. I even stopped watching it after the first hour. I didn't care to see the ending, so don't tell me \"Well no wonder you didn't like it, you didn't see the ending.\" It was making me vomit."

        "review_title": "Funny Stuff",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Story: Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedey) is a struggling cartoonist who has a run-in with the infamous Mask which leads to him and his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard) having a bouncing baby boy (Ryan and Liam Falconer) who can, in fact, bounce via his inheritance of the Mask's amazing powers. Meanwhile, Loki (Alan Cumming), Norse god of mischief, has been charged by papa Odin (Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask before it can cause any more trouble on Earth.\n\nWacky hijinks ensue.\n\nThe Good: HILARIOUS! There were several several laugh out loud points in this movie. There was the great possibility that this would be one of those movies where the only funny parts were shown in the previews (baby Alvey Avery saying \"Mother\" in a deep voice still makes me crack up just thinking about it), but such was fortunately not the case here. This movie took the flavor of all the old cartoons I and a few generations before me watched growing up - like the Flintstones and Looney Tunes, both of which are cameoed in the film - and ran headlong with it. Virtually every joke was pulled straight from the cartoon old school, which was just as it should be.\n\nThe acting is, for the most part, superb. Cumming does a great job playing the crazified Loki, and Hoskins is a convincing grumpy old man-god (go figure, ha ha). The gem of the film, however, is the main man himself, Jamie Kennedey. His tour as the frizzed out, completely at the end of his rope father is played to the hilt, and it's great fun to watch him gradually go crazy as his son happily drives him there.\n\nWith one exception (which I'll elaborate on in a moment), the special effects are also spectacular. The Cats & Dogs crew may not be on the top of the visual effects heap in Hollywood, but for this movie, they don't really have to be. It actually helps that you can tell that the characters are animated when they're doing crazy things, because they're supposed to be doing things that only animated characters can do. If some super-snazzy ILM-like group had come in and made everything up super-realistic, THAT I would have complained about.\n\nThe Bad: Now, Mr. Kennedey was great and awesome and wonderful as Tim Avery, but . . . well, as soon as the Mask was slapped onto him, something bad went wrong. It's almost as if the people applying the latex to his face did it incorrectly, and it kept him with almost the exact same facial expression the whole time. It's a big detraction when his face bends and contorts better when he's supposed to be a regular guy than it does when he's supposed to be a cartoon character.\n\nWhile this is a good movie, I think it's sadly before its time. Son of the Mask really feels less like a direct sequel and more like the end of a trilogy. I believe New Line would have done a good deal better if they'd made a different Mask movie in between this one and the first one.\n\nFinally, there's a short period where Loki loses his powers. I won't go into the details, since I don't wanna be a spoiler, but the duration of this powerlessness is disappointingly short, and not much was really done with it. Which is a shame, since there were several different things that they COULD have done with it . . . ah, well.\n\nThe Deal: Overall, I thought this was a very satisfying movie. Sure, it isn't complete brilliance or movie genius or whatever. It isn't going to win any awards or change anyone's life. It's just a series of quick, side-splitting laughs strung together with funny animations. But that's all it really NEEDS to be!\n\nSo just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride, neh?"

The mask has now fallen into a new owner Tim Avery, which give him new fond powers like in the original Mask, and his son has special powers too while pregenting his wife under the spell of the mask. Here I thought Dumb & Dumberer was the worst Jim Carrey sequel, but sorry to say Son of the Mask is much, much, much worse. I can see Jim Carrey vomiting, say how can they make a movie like this? The first mask had some comic elements and some potential to the character as the mask, and had it's ways being a cartoon character, resulting, half human, and half cartoon, and never before, a human actually performed as a cartoon character. Here, Son of the Mask is just, nothing actually, there was nothing to it, I did not laugh once throughout the entire film, there was no story to it at all. What a disappointment to the original mask film. Basically there's just a lot of running around, and a lot of noises, the film tries to copy some famous cartoons, used in the original film. Haven't any of the producers, learned from Dumb & Dumberer? Come on!"

I do believe the character of Oden is downplayed I absolutely love Traylor Howard her on screen presence is amazing I have seen the movie a few times and do believe that with different casting for Tim Avery and a better director would have made the script work I think Chuck Russell could have saved this movie all and all if you have kids this could be a movie to watch with them A family movie that if you don't watch many movies you might enjoy but if you pick apart movies the way I do then this flick is not for you."

It lasts about 98 minutes, and its pace is frenetic and boring at the same time. Way too much juvenile humor. Since there's so little dialogue, the actors are left floundering. The original was no masterpiece, but it had some endearing moments; specially towards the beginning.

Jamie Kennedy boast his \"funny\" persona, but he really doesn't make a person burst out laughing or at least show a grin.

In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you'll have to actively search for them.\n\nFor the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler, but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father, this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he responded \"Convicted felons,\" apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nBut just making a bad movie is not a sin, or Hell would be overflowing. What makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. To put things in perspective, the day after we watched Son of the Mask, my son and I watched \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture), and was brought in for $7 million.

I think my daughters would have gotten a kick out of this movie when they were little. \"Son of the Mask\" is a pretty good movie that deserves a revisit every once in a while."

OK, it's not as bad as low budget, we-want-to-make-a-really-crappy-movie, movies out there, but considering they had the money to do some special effects they should have used more time on the corny script. The acting is poor and the story starts off confusing, spirals into stupidity and ends up in a bad clich\u00e9 of a \"the most important thing is family\" speech. If this is supposed to be a sequel to the original Mask it fails so horribly the it's almost sarcastic. I've just got one option for you: Don't waste your time!!! Watching grass grow is more fun..."

        "review_detailed_main": "...then this is it. This is forced comedy at it's worst, as for 90 minutes, many things that are not funny happen. There is absolutely no sign of the gag-fest of the original Mask, which rightly put Carrey into mainstream cinema. Jamie Kennedy as main character has no charisma whatsoever and simply looks depressed when he becomes the Mask. Cumming (Loki) just looks a poof throughout.\n\nThe ending is nothing that anyone with the IQ of the average 3 year old can figure out. Instead, the real story is the battle between Cumming and Kennedy to bore as many people as possible, both on and off the screen. Carrey grinned like a maniac as the Mask; Kennedy just gimmaces. Just look at the expression on everybody's faces in his vicinity both as Avery and as the Mask. Utter boredom. Cumming has the best part (not that there's much competition - he should have played Avery) but in his opening scene he simply uses his mighty powers of boredom to outwit his foe. His magnum opus for boredom takes place in a busy street in broad daylight where he's flexing his mighty computer-generated powers and is ignored by everyone.\n\nGood bits? Well, I gave this two stars as I think this movie is unique in that most of the budget went on the splendid spangily cheery props and scenery than on the cheap, bland and wooden actors. But despite all the flashy effects, I imagine that anybody watching this dull-fest masquerading as entertainment to the end will be left feeling depressed, thoroughly miserable, heartless, soul-less and sickly-green with nausea. Give them an orange plastic wig to wear and it will be Son of the Mask all over again. Avoid."

By the time I was 20 minutes into it, I was bored out of my mind. When Tim Avery put on the mask, I thought, hmmm... I wonder what this is gonna be like. It was not in the least bit funny, the humor was terribly dry. Then the animated baby and the dog. Didn't even get a chuckle out of me. I love cartoons, but movies that try to be cartoons better do it amazingly well, which this movie fails to do. The toilet humor was not at all funny either, and I'm a big fan of Terrance and Phillip. The only performance that was acceptable was by Alan Cumming playing Loki. Bob Hoskins as Odin was just laughable. For some reason he feels the need to yell every line, and he does not come across as Godlike. Consider yourself warned, don't watch this!"

The underlying theme of the importance of the bond between fathers and sons was well done without ever getting slushy. The 'gloopy' bits quite honestly compared with some of the gross-out material presented these days on children's cartoon channels was extremely mild and never revolting.\n\nThe sets were beautiful, and the CGI was absolutely fine. This film had a good pacey storyline, amusing sympathetic characters and plenty of laugh out loud moments.\n\nI can see why Carrey fans wouldn't like it, but as I am not a Carrey fan and prefer a balanced film with an ensemble of good acting and a share out of amusing lines, rather than a one man ego trip with a back up of lacklustre characters none of whom can steal the star's thunder - I enjoyed this film.\n\nAlan Cummings was a joy and it is nice to watch an actor of his calibre doing what he does best, entertaining and interacting with the other cast members to produce a great film.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes to have a fun time when watching a film and who enjoys surreal wacky stuff.\n\nIf you like 'Fairly Odd Parents' 'My Parents are Aliens' 'Tom and Jerry' and 'Coneheads' you will probably enjoy this."

It had a wild, anarchic, almost over the top style that meant it left an impact- and Carrey was perfect for the film.\n\nNow along comes this stinker.\n\nLet me start by saying this- if you value your life, keep the hell away from this movie. I only just survived, and even then I had to saw off one of my arms. Want more proof as to how stupefyingly horrible this dreck is? It's on the IMDb Bottom 100, and quite honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.\n\nPlan 9 From Outer Space is widely regarded to be the worst film of all time- and one of the funniest. Why? Because that's how bad it it. The aliens are guys in gorilla suits with fish bowls one their heads. The graves used in the graveyard seen are cardboard, and wobble whenever the wind blows. The aliens use human desks and pens. And the U.F.O.s are hubcaps being dangled around on visible strings. Why do I mention this? It's very simple: in ten years time, Son of the Mask will be considered the Plan 9 of our generation. The already bad effects will look terrible.\n\nThe only likable character is, surprisingly, Loki. I didn't mind the actor playing him, but the rest got on my nerves. Who the heck is Jamie Kennedy, anyway/\n\nAnd who wrote this film? A five year old?\n\nI still have nightmares from this form of child abuse projected onto the big screen. Someone forced me to watch it. I later shot them.\n\nThe scariest thing is, there were tons of people involved in making this ****fest.\n\nAvoid."

Kids aged more than 6 might find hard time watching this movie.\n\nTim Arvey did his job very decently... He doesn't look comic. He tries to be one but fails utterly.\n\nThe story line is vague sometimes... The director seems to have lots of different conflicting ideas in taking the movie.\n\nThe movie ends with the Loki and his father going back to their kingdom... That very scene is awful with the so-called GODs getting upset upon their mistake.\n\nThe worst part is... to scare hell out of you, Loki's dad comes out of nowhere; shouts at Loki goes back just to remind the viewer that the movie is still intact and running around the story.\n\nI rate 3!"

And if you think Jamie Kennedy doing the Mask was bad, look no further than Bob Hoskins character, Odin. Every time he enters he is yelling...what is up with that? The whole Odin/Loki gods stuff is such a stupid angle.\n\nJamie Kennedy and the mask: What made the original Mask movie great was Jim Carrey. Not only did Carrey act the Mask better, his \"Mask\" was dressed much more appropriate. The Mask character was modeled after the Wolf character in Tex Avery's cartoons. Jim Carrey portrayed that character almost perfect, with the clothing, the voice, the actions...everything. Mind I note Jim Carrey's face is much thinner and therefore works better in mimicking the wolf character. Jamie Kennedy has a fat face, is dressed in horrible clothing, wears this UGLY red wig, and worst of all, his voice over on the mask is horrible...not to mention his acting as \"Tim Avery\". The Mask here is more like...a cartoon version of Mo Collins (from MadTV) doing that character who never finishes her sentences and continues to go higher and higher with her voice. It is horrible. There is little, if any, evidence of the Son of the Mask resembling Tex Avery's creations. Jamie Kennedy's performance, alone, makes this movie very hard to watch."

I felt like Alex de Large watching Hitler movies with Beethoven music in A Clockwork Orange. I was conditioned by this movie. At that time I really hoped the airplane had to make an emergency landing or what so ever. But here I am. Still alive, and I feel guilty for myself that I have seen this , I will take these bad memories into my grave. Thanks to China Airlines. Well, after this, should I say something about the plot, the acting, the camera-work? The director, Lance Guterman should be banned for life, this movie must be destroyed immediately. And that's why I give it a 10. Because it must not get the cult status. It should be banned out of the \"worst 100 IMDb list\". If you read this, please help, give it a 10!"

Son of the Mask is the lamest excuse for a sequel, even more than Staying Alive for Saturday Night Fever.\n\nIn Son of the Mask Jamie Kennedy plays a man who draws comics for a living, which is odd, because he is not very animated in this movie. Unlike movies like The Cat in the Hat which was ruined by Mike Myer's portrayal of the Cat, Jamie Kennedy's lackluster comedic performance had nothing to do with horridness of this movie! The only think saving Son of the Mask in my mind, is the kid inside of me...just kidding. Son of the mask would be not so unfortunate if it was a half an hour cartoon for children, but it's not. This was a large budget feature film for \"families.\" I cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would make this a movie, or even star in it! I do understand Traylor Howard that you have done many projects since Two Guys and a Girl, but if your thought process of Son of the Mask or nothing, you should have choose nothing.\n\nDON'T TRY IT! IT WILL LEAVE A SOUR TASTE!!"

        "review_title": "Not a Jim Carrey classic, but hilarious nonetheless",
        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished this movie and my cheeks hurt from the grinning. Son of the Mask expands on the story of Jim Carrey classic The Mask in a whole different way. A baby is conceived while the father is wearing the titular mask and 9 months later unto the world is born a nightmare child with cartoon god-like powers. On top of this, the pet dog, now jealous of the baby getting all the attention, has gotten its paws on the mask and become a green-faced, revenge-seeking cartoon mutt.\n\nMeanwhile, Loki, the fabled God of mischief (mentioned in the original movie, not featured), has been instructed by his father Odin to retrieve his mask due to the havoc it caused in the first film. Loki is the essence of the Mask and thus can also turn green and do the Jim Carrey routine, coming to a total of four equally bizarre Mask-like characters, though obviously none living up to Jim Carrey.\n\nThe father, and hero of the movie is played by Jamie Kennedy, the funny chap who was the film buff in the Scream movies (\"Did you put her liver in the mailbox? Because I read that the killer put her liver in the mailbox...\"), and he does a good job. Upon donning the mask he becomes the plastic-haired, catsuit-clad, cheesy game show host type (nice to see more different takes on what the mask does to different people) who is amusing though feels a little unnatural compared to the his acting in \"Dad form\".\n\nPlenty of great CG just like the original, some spectacular visuals and designs, and for a movie so different to it's predecessor and so much more family friendly, it certainly does a good job of recreating the original atmosphere with nice lighting and settings.\n\nSo, would I recommend it? If you're a hardcore fan of The Mask in the form of comic book, movie or even cartoon, probably not, because it's not what you will want from a sequel. For slightly more open-minded people looking for some fun and a few smiles of nostalgia from nods to the original, totally. It's a side-splitter, particularly for kids.\n\nThere's no obligation to have seen the original; it works as a film on it's own as well as a sequel, so don't worry if you want to entertain your very young kids but don't want to expose them to some of the more \"PG\" humour of the original. Then perhaps they can check the original out when they're a few years older.\n\nUnderrated and great fun. It may not be the \"Revenge of the Mask\" movie we were promised all those years ago and it's not a masterpiece by any means (what sequel is?) but it's really nice to see a clever and creative sequel/followup to a film whose chances as a franchise we all thought were dead."

The screenplay was rubbish, it was acted dreadfully, their was no feeling after it. The film didn't catch me in anyway. It left me puzzled. It had no feeling, no happiness, no sadness, no nothing.

        "review_detailed_main": "It is common, especially for Hollywood, to churn out a sequel that is not as good as its original blockbuster. Watch the very weak Men in Black 2 to understand this completely in contrast to its witty sci-fi comedy of an original. However, after viewing such a flawed fantasy, I recommend this is how low you can go to make a horrible sequel! Choppy editing. The camera work was poor! You name a flaw in film-making and realise how many you can find in this doomed project. This is a visual guide how not to make film, unless of course you are a studio executive, who couldn't care less that such a film is bad, but a money-making venture for its franchise. As you cannot tell, I think this is how such a poor sequel was introduced.\n\nSo, what did I hate about this film? Was it the fact that they tried to be more creative than its predecessor? Yes, by the bowl full! In the original they at least had someone who gave an \"animated performance\" to the main character, who pulls all sorts of codes and convention from the world of Hollywood animation. I am talking of no one but some Canadian comedian known as Jim Carrey, in a role I thought was suitable for his brand of goofy talents. However, viewing the Son of the Mask, they fail to impress me with such antics that I could not stand any more, and cringed for every time such an antic was performed.\n\nWas another reason the fact got anything to do with the plot of a struggling animator wanting his idea to become a show? Through that perspective, I guess not. But this sub-plot failed to make such a focus on the narrative of this film, instead they went to re-invent the antics that made The Mask entertaining, that I couldn't even care less about this animation-orientated sub-plot. Also, the fact is the film focuses on Poki trying to get that Mask back to his father was the main narrative. In fact, because of that narrative, the filmmakers, who I do not want to hear about unless they make something really worth watching, the excuse to proceed such badly-timed antics.\n\nWhile on the subject of the main narrative, I will have a moan about costumes; that god's outfit looked so cheap and nasty that I think an amateur drama society could make a better job than that piece of ghastly clothing.\n\nAlso, while we are on the subject of the god, I found some dialogue either poorly written or badly acted. It was hard to tell. So I will blame both such a script that relied on the clich\u00e9s of a family film to make the film have some continuity. Although from viewing this, I wished the writers had writer's block and go on to write something else. I will also put blame on some of the actors and actresses. Actually, I won't blame them; performing such rubbish deserves recognition, which will unfortunately be a Razzie Award. Well, the actor that played the god was terrible and so unknowingly, that I wish someone with much better acting training had the role. But I hope Brian Blessed will have turned down that role at such a sight of a poor project.\n\nThere you go. I have survived watching such rubbish, and hopefully go on and have a better life, and hopefully forgetting that such a flawed film even existed. But they do say, with bad films, that it is so bad it's good. That will never apply to this pointless sequel to The Mask."

Ever since showing the trailer and eagerly putting the original through the projector, I knew that there had to be a follow-up. OK, so it wasn't Jim Carey, but I thought it might be watchable. What follows is visual gag on top of visual gag and to be honest, they just aren't funny. Why? Quite simply, there is no timing. Imagine a stand up comedian reeling off jokes without taking a breath and you will soon find it boring. It would help if there was a plot or a little tension thrown in but I think more emphasis was given to set design. And to think of all the hours spent on the visuals. It really is a crying shame but I am being convinced more everyday that the art of film-making is being replaced by bright colours that bounce around the screen. My sympathies go out to highly talented Alan Cumming for being coerced into this. No doubt he was promised that it was going to be big big big. Take my advice and watch the original again (that goes to the production team too)."

In almost every scene they insult the intelligence of even the most brain-dead of masses desiring 'fluff' entertainment, and that is a challenge for any filmmaker to do.\n\nThis is a sickly mixture of Warner Bros. style plots using Garfield (the movie) style computer graphics which are horribly integrated with live actors -- and I use the word \"actors\" very loosely, as I think that \"clowns\" might be the more appropriate word in this case.\n\nIn case you missed it, this really sorry excuse for a movie has absolutely no relation whatsoever to the decent comedy \"The Mask\" starring Jim Carrey.\n\nI recommend avoiding this movie unless you have had a full frontal lobotomy, or are interested in experimenting in a couple hours of sadomasochism.\n\nThis movie is near the top of the bottom 100 movies on IMDb, and with good reason !"

No.\n\nBut the reviewers, I think, down-rated it for all the wrong reasons."

So when an unexpected bundle of joy comes along, he gets more than he bargained for... oh god. Cheesy premise, yes, but is it watchable? There are only two reasons this movie was made. One: Money. (duh.) Two: an exercise in animation techniques and physical effects. Like those straight-to-tape Disney sequels, this movie strikes me as \"practise\" for animators and animation techniques. That said, the different animations and computer graphics throughout the movie are very good and are amalgamated with the live action fairly well. However, besides that and the surprising heartfelt 'message' near the end of the movie, the good stuff pretty much ends there.\n\nJim Carrey MADE the original movie. Now Jamie Kennedy has shown his versatility behind a disguise on 'The Jamie Kennedy Experiment', yet he seemed really restricted and NON-wild in his subpar prosthetics. Sadly, even a decent performance from super talented Alan Cumming couldn't really help a script that really seems to go all over the place. Add to all this a CG animated baby that \"doesn't quite look right\" and you have yet another shallow attempt to cash in on a surprisingly profitable original.\n\nIs \"Son Of The Mask\" worth watching for the average viewer? I don't think so. Is this harmless family viewing? Mostly. But if you're an animation buff like I am and grew up on those Tex Avery-type cartoons, you MIGHT be able to appreciate this movie for that aspect. 2 out of 10."

Set in a town called Fringe City, we follow wannabe animator Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) who comes into contact with the mask that was discarded at the end of the first film when his dog fishes it out of the water. Despite initially being reluctant to start a family with his wife Tonya (Traylor Howard), he conceives a child while wearing the mask and soon discovers that his baby may have inherited its powers.\n\nMeanwhile, god of Mischief Loki himself (Alan Cumming) is forced by his father Odin (Bob Hoskins) to recover the mask and an unlikely Tom & Jerry-style battle breaks out between Tim's baby and his dog in the house. Not quite what you'd expect from a sequel to the 1994 film, then, but not without potential when you consider the cast and the budget involved.\n\nThere's certainly no shortage of things going on in this movie and yet Son Of The Mask still manages to feel completely bare and full of filler. This is due to a severe lack of character development, consistency or coherent storytelling throughout. Individually, the plot and its subplots sound like fun but together, they are smashed one against the other without any idea of how they might gel or work together to tell a proper story.\n\nThe film aims to be a Tex Avery cartoon but, where The Mask would only go all out whenever Stanley Ipkiss would wear the mask, Son Of The Mask is entirely shot through an obnoxious wide-angle lens. Everything is always over-the-top, loud and silly so Tim Avery never feels like a real person, his story never feels like one we should care about and the cartoonish stuff is about as cartoonish as the real life stuff so it irritates about as much as it falls completely flat. I should point out that the CGI, while ambitious, is a complete catastrophe and makes the film look very ugly, plus the surprisingly dark and unpleasant imagery peppered all over the movie does not help improve things.\n\nA sequel to The Mask, perhaps one closer to the Dark Horse comics, could have been worthwhile and yet, without the charm of the 1994 cast and the overall competence of the original filmmakers, we are left with a thoroughly unappealing mess that's far too annoying to please anyone.\n\nSssssmokin'...\n\n...is probably healthier for you than this movie."

Most definitely worked as he was out like a light within 15 ish minutes.\n\nBesides the failed attempt on the makers/actors and actresses they shouldn't do a sequel to an already good movie.\n\nKudos to Alan Cumming however and also to the late great Bob Hoskins as they were the main reasons I gave in and watched what I could of it."

It's uncomfortably up close to the character's faces and it looks like a ring doorbell camera, it's very overwhelming.\n\nIt's not a terribly long movie, it's a little more than an hour and a half long, however the movie has awful, just AWFUL pacing. It throws a lot at you at once and still drags, again it's not a long movie, but it feels like an eternity. It's kinda impressive because of that.\n\n100% DO NOT recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone who saw the movie \"The Mask\" with Jim Carey, from 1994, cannot remain indifferent. It's one of those family comedies that marked the 90's and that strongly contributed to the meteoric rise of the comic actor's career. It was a film that, in my opinion, did not need a sequel, but that, if it came to exist, would have to have the same crew and a similar cast (that is, keeping, at least, Carey and some other actors). Unfortunately, this movie does everything it shouldn't have done.\n\nIn fact, any comparison between the first movie and this crap is pointless. It is not the first time that I see that there are sequels made to profit from great successes and that have virtually no connection with the preceding films. This is just one more example. Jim Carey was right not to want to associate himself with a project that failed at the outset, not least because most of the cast that associated with the film did not manage to take advantage of it beyond the financial inflow.\n\nThe film is clearly expensive and stupid. It had a high budget, which was invested in a range of CGI assets and massive and sometimes impressive visual effects, but everything else is lacking. And the film's biggest flaw couldn't be any other: the script is so amateurish and idiotic that it seems to have been written by ten-year-old children. Ideas are bad, there are a number of situations in which we feel that the public is being mocked, and our intelligence is being mocked too.\n\nAnother problem with this film is the total lack of humor. The movie was supposed to be funny and make us laugh, but we couldn't find anything funny. Much of what is shown was already done - and better - in the first film, and what has been introduced as new is a series of scatological or gross jokes that, I think, could have been cut. Even children's audiences might not be very interested in seeing this, if you think about it.\n\nThe cast does what they can, but they can't do much. Deep down, the actors end up being the least to blame for the fact that the film is rubbish. Alan Cumming turns out to be the best actor present and is the only one worth seeing work. He's an effective villain and his comedic streak is interesting, but totally wasted here. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance, but it is innocuous and adds nothing to the film. Jamie Kennedy is bad, he does a bad job, and surely he must be sorry he got into this movie. The rest is basically a bunch of extras, even when they have to talk."

I saw this in whole when I was around 10, and I even tried watching it before then. It says something when I tell you that even as a child, I knew that this movie was garbage. I saw the whole thing once, and any other try was insufferable.\n\nThe movie follows a new father, who's dog and baby have gotten hold of The Mask from the Jim Carrey movie. After this, chaos ensues.\n\nLike I said, I haven't seen this in 13 years, but I still remember how much I hated it.\n\nThe movie is for kids, but it's boring. It was not entertaining in any way, I was constantly waiting for something interesting to happen.\n\nMost of the jokes don't land either. In one scene, The Mask makes the infant pee in 3 different directions. Isn't that funny- a pee joke?\n\nActually, ONE funny joke happens later due to it. When the villain, played by Alan Cumming, tells the father to give him The Mask, the genuinely confused Dad asks: \"What mask?... Oh! That's why he can pee like that!\" The villian is revolted by that comment.\n\nThat's the only worthwhile part of the movie, so there you go. 140 other people have given this a 1/10, and they are not wrong. Please watch anything else other than this. I have nothing else to say, except to say this is one of the worst movies ever made, and even as a child I knew that.\n\nReverse Recommendation: To see a better movie with Alan Cumming, see Spy Kids 1 and 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a bit outrageous, seeing this film in the bottom 100. I can think of heaps of other films that are worse than this. Sure, this film is in bad taste, and it doesn't have Jim Carrey, but it really wasn't that bad. It was bad, sure, and I think a couple of the jokes were a bit too crude for my taste, but people are really overreacting. The movie is just meant to be a silly, crude comedy to watch when your bored. It's definitely not deserving of a 2.2/10.\n\nLet me get this clear: Jim Carrey was my favourite thing in the original The Mask. He was very funny, and I loved the movie because of his comedic skills. This film, of course, isn't as great because Jim Carrey is in it, and because the jokes are a bit too crude for people's taste, so I can semi-understand if this got mixed reviews, but the reviews are horrendous...Christ.\n\nWe'll start off with the pros first.\n\nSome of the humour in this was quite good. I liked the fast-motion jokes they used in this, which they used in the original. You know, when he puts on the mask, and he goes fast? Yeah, the filmmakers of this understood the humour of this joke, and they used it in their original, unique way. I enjoyed the slapstick humour in this, which I won't give away, and I especially enjoyed Otis, who was a constant gag throughout the film that was very funny. The pacing in this is way too fast, unfortunately, but I suppose it just matches with the humour in this film.\n\nIt knows it's audience, and it knows what it's doing. The film knows that it's a crude, tasteless comedy, which is why I think this film's underrated. It knows how to pull off a gag at the right time, and none of the jokes ever seem to be forced when you watch this. So, there's another pro.\n\nNow for the cons.\n\nI absolutely hated the CGI in this. It was horrendous, cringe worthy, and annoying. I can see where the hate for the CGI comes from, it was horrible, I felt repulsed watching the CGI.\n\nThe gags involving potty humour weren't funny. I know how I said that it was just meant to be a crude, tasteless comedy, but I think this went a bit too far with the potty humour. It was way too crude for my taste, and I can clearly agree that the potty humour was too much, and it made me lose my appetite a bit. I had to pause the film for a few minutes so I could vomit.\n\nThe original The Mask felt to be the better experience. When I watched this, I enjoyed some moments, and laughed, but in The Mask, I think it felt more coherent and normal, rather than jumpy and energetic like this one. The original The Mask also had Jim Carrey, which I think really boosted the original from this one. If your going to watch this, expecting it to be as good as the original, don't watch it.\n\nOverall, I think it was a bad film, but it was nowhere as bad as critics are saying. You may like it if you can stomach crude humour, but if you can't, I don't think you will. 4.8/10."

I saw it at the Grove in Los Angeles and I was invited to the Premier and the after party, which was 100% kid land! From the bumping music to the wonderful food it was for kids. What else for a kid type movie? Jamie Kennedy give the most cute and comical expressions. There is a part in the movie where you can tell Jamie Kennedy does his own thing, its the fish mouth. Go see it, its a feel good movie hugs."

Not only because Jim Carrey gave a magical and hilarious performance, but the script was great, and the gags were not only visual, but subtle and funny.\n\nThen, I saw \"Son of the Mask\" was coming out. I was overjoyed at the thought of a sequel to the first movie. I also thought (at first), that Jim Carrey was in the sequel too. But after half an hour or so in front of the huge cinema screen, I realized that \"The Son of the Mask\" would never live up to it's predecessor's brilliance.\n\nYou cannot really blame the cast for this huge disaster. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard weren't actually too bad. But it's the fact that the film doesn't really make a departure from it's predecessor. The plot does not vary etc..., but it is mainly because Jim Carrey was missing. JIM CARREY, WHERE ARE YOU?\n\n2/10"

But the actual film Son of the Mask delivers that feeling just for the fact that it was made. The beginning masked character pales horridly to the already tragically instructed performance by Jim Carrey (they basically hired an astronaut to to drive a taxi). With the sequel, however, they hired a grouchy obnoxious taxi driver to chauffeur foreign dignitaries. From there it just gets worse"

More less to say that Chris and Claire's son was a total brat that kept passing gas, causing trouble for Chris and his dog, and most of all being a balloon freak. I hated that baby so much that when he stuck his thumb in his mouth and blew his head up like a balloon, I would take a toothpick and pop him. Jim Carey did really horrible in this movie and the actress that did Claire in the movie was a extreme waste of time.

I suppose new line cinema were just hoping to make a few bucks rapid time.\n\nJamie Kennedy is okay in this movie playing the workaholic husband who dreams of creating his own comic books and drawing his own cartoons. That is, until he puts the mask on and try's his best impression of Carreys version of the mask, but he is horrible. i mean really, really awful as the mask. he is so wooden and unfunny and what the hell is the stupid voice about? 2 words explain Kennedy's performance as the mask = CRINGE WORTHY! Alan Cumming portrays the movies villain Loki who wants the mask for its power. I swear that the character he plays in this could be the same character he plays in spy kids. its like he doesn't even try! I'd like to say the best actor in this film is the dog, but that would be a little harsh on the rest of the cast. The only upside to this film is that it has the gorgeous Traylor Howard( no i haven't spelt it wrong it's Traylor not Taylor!) but even she cant save this sh*t stain of a film.

It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way, or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past. Oh, wait!\n\n4/10 is probably generous on my part, though there are far worse films out there that actually annoy me - 'Son of the Mask' honestly doesn't.

Not only must he deal with their antics and try to keep his job at the same time, but he also has to contend with Alan Cumming, the son of a god who's doing his best to get the titular mask back. All of the effort went into the well-done visuals and about four cents went into the script and dumbed-down situations. So, the lame story drags poor Kennedy and Cumming down with it, too.
