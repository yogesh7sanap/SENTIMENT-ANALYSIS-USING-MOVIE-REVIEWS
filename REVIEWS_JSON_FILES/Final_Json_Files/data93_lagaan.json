        "review_detailed_main": "LAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one!"

A must see for Indian cricket fans!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I am not from India, not even close. I am from Scandinavia. Before Lagaan I had never watched any Hindi movies of any kind. I know about 3 words from the hindi language. And I don't like musicals much. I viewed the movie on a DVD of rather poor quality compared to the state of the art DVDs I am used to. And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!) hours... I figured this would be a complete waste of time... BOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite! It is just amazing! Mr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead. He makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan. He tries to unite the village in a struggle for life against the greedy Britons. The Britons exploit the villages by collecting lagaan (tax). This means that most of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food for the farmers themselves. It's a classic war between \"David\", the native villagers of India, and \"Goliath\", the powerful and greedy Britons. But what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket arena. This is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket, against the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket bat. If the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three years! And if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean the end of the village. The stakes could not be higher!!\n\nI can't remember a movie being this thrilling and having so much life in it. And the music has a huge impact thanks to the great voices of Udit Narayan, Lata Mangeshkar etc. And the dancing is a chapter in itself! Few or none will leave this movie not remembering the song \"Mitwa, sun Mitwa\". It is a must see for everyone, inside and outside of India. And this movies has been totally righteously nominated for an Oscar too, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes all the way to the top. It has my vote! It gets 10 out of 10 from me. Excellent!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket.\n\nThis movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really deserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has wonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama, beautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film indicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a shame, showing a total lack of respect of the 'Columbia Tristar Home Video' with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have subtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the 'Menu' to 'English', and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion of the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn English first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel really sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will miss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): 'Lagaan \u2013 A Coragem de Um Povo' ('Lagaan \u2013 The Courage of a People')"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience clapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the actual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that they were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though admittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket at all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also found I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea cricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave interest.\n\nAbout the fikm, the acting was good. Rachel Shelly and Paul Blackthorne were impressive and unlike in other Hindi films where they are usually clich\u00e9d versions of foreign characters, they were very drawn out believable characters. Aamir Khan was definitely the star attraction (obviously) as in any case it was 'his movie' but honestly he was very good, one of hsi best performances i'd personally say. Gauri was given very little to do in the movie but she did stand out in her own way. The supporting cast were all excellent in each of their roles, although some characters were a bit too starkly depicted. The British cast on the other hand had precious little to do except look foreboding.\n\nThe setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The sets were historically accurate I've been told and the backdrop just right for the match and one would it imagine it fit into the time frame suggested. The costumes were also appropriate. I especially liked that scene where Elisabeth imagines Aamir in a suit, it worked because being who she is of course shed see him like that.)Some historians might nitpick on small points, but they were so minor that the rest of the story overshadowed these errors.\n\nAt first I wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what the unusual concept of musical numbers, but most seem to have understood the game of cricket (non cricket playing countries I mean) and the historical context as well and seem to have also taken the musical numbers in their stride.\n\nThe only thing that got to me was the length of the movie. I really wish that they had done some serious editing, it just ran too long and the cricket match was too dragged out. It should have either focused more on the cricket match for the majority of the film, or reduced the footage of the rest of the film to balance it out. I saw many scenes that could have been edited out and were totally unnecessary.\n\nThe songs were enjoyable and only one or two were unnecessary and could have been cut down or deleted entirely, like the 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' and the song where both girls sing. Honestly this movie was one Hindi movie that did not require many songs at all if at all. A background score maybe but not 6 songs. It got tedious and it gets on the nerves especially when you've been sitting in the theatre for 2 hours and you know that there is 1 more hour to go. Luckily people with DVDs will be able to fast forward!\n\nAlthough Predictable in places with characters being over-drawn or under-drawn and everyone knew the ending that was inevitable, ending, (it isn't much of a long shot at all) but we watched it for the thrill of it anyway.\n\nThe overall effect the movie was so good that I fully believe that it deserved a nomination and I never say that about most Hindi movies. Even though it did not win I'm very proud of this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this in a Paris cinema on a Sunday afternoon. The French audience loved it, as did I. They clapped at the intermission and they clapped to the music while the credits were running. I thought the song and dance routines were great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised narrative. The audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of the plot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never married. Astonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the future of this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles with words like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course the pillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked the representation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as straight agrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants' mouths.\n\nI was on the edge of tears throughout. Why? Because this was the first Indian production that to my knowledge has won a world audience. And it provided a new sentimental bridge to the world for my own trajectory. I could see how Bollywood is the only film-making centre that actually could do what Hollywood does, but in its own distinctive way, with a much more universal human interest. And the music of course. The plot and characters were caricatured, but that made it all that more accessible and touching, like a medieval passion play. I loved the symbolic roles contrived for the Muslim, the Untouchable, the Sikh, the collaborator, the headman, the intellectual etc.\n\nAbove all, the plot of learning the game and beating the masters was perfect. It was CLR James to the tee. Beyond a Boundary indeed , with society in the shape of the crowd as much of the action as the players. And the idea of the bet! Play comes from an Old English word whose first meaning is to wager. The idea of life as a game of negotiated risks is very widespread among hunter-gatherers, where people have to be trained to respond instantly to the flash of white tail in the bush. Obviously it sometimes pays for peasants (and citydwellers) to pick up these skills. The play goes on."

WELL DONE Gowarikar ...... WELL DONE Amir Khan .......\n\nMr. Gowarikar, please note that if this sublime film had been directed by a British or American director like Danny Boyle or Richard Attenborough .... the Oscars would have definitely flown into the laps of the director and the protagonist actor. This is not to say that your directorial skills lack the excellence to win the coveted Academy Awards, but it is to mention the inherent bias and prejudice which prevails among the jury of the Oscar Award Committee towards directors, producers and actors of the Sub-Continent namely India. Mother India (1957) met the same fate from the then jury of Academy Awards committee who simply rejected its nomination for the Oscars on the grounds that it is laden with too much songs, formulaic in nature.\n\nBesides, the excellent performance of Amir Khan as an aggressive and challenging native youth 'Bhavan'; Rachael Shelley has put up a remarkable and evocatively strong performance as the suave young British lady Elizabeth Russell, who aspires to help out the hapless villagers from the cunning guile of his brother, Captain Russel.\n\nNow what can one say if the members of the Oscar awarding committee do not understand the meanings of wordings of the emotionally focused songs (due to language and culture difference). It is a handicap with them and not with the local Indian movie making team.\n\nKeeping aside this injustice, the movie characterizes pure and pristine feelings, emotions, struggle and fighting spirit of a raw and unskilled cricket team of illiterate Indian villagers who capitalized the opportunity to get waived the odious land revenue tax, with exacting standards of will power and perseverance.\n\nAfter a long time, there is an Indian movie bred with the contents found in the Indian films of yester years."

The story idea is nice, to play a sport game Indians never played against long time British players. This makes it funny also to see those unconventional players.\n\nWhat I don't like: However, the action is slow and not much happens. The storyline is very much predictable, no surprises. If you don't know Cricket rules, you will still be confused how to play this game.\n\nOverall conclusion: It's a nice movie to look at, and you may have some pleasant moments, but it's not the kind of movie you can be much excited about and tell your friends to watch."

Im sure ratings and accolades accounts for something, but in some cases, it is hard to understand how a movie has grown to be generally accepted as a masterpiece.\n\nFor me, Lagaan is such a film. The title (Once upon a time in India) and the length (244 min!) implies an epic. At the same time, the length is a double-edged sword. If musicals with an underdog sport story is not your thing ca 4h may prove to be quite a feat. I sat through this but did not like it much. I found it cheesy, sentimental and thought most characters where irritating. I guess the idea is you should sheer for the team of mistreated locals. One of the problems is that you never really feel that their situation is severe, since the film is so family oriented and polished...I'm sure a lot of people like Lagaan, there is a lot of proof for it. For me, it stands as one of many examples of mysteriously high-rated mediocrity."

Luckily, I got one 2weeks ago and I became so fascinated that I download pictures & wallpapers already\u0085all about Lagaan!!! I wouldn't be posting a comment here if I didn't have the Lagaan fever!!! =p The story started in a small village of Champaner , where Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) and Gauri (Gracie Singh) are in a community of poor and innocent farmers who are happily plowing, sowing, praying for the rains and reaping their harvest. Inspite of such unwanted circumstances, they are still full of hope.\n\nBut then, a British captain, Captain Andrew (Paul Blackthorne), challenges the farmers to a cricket match. He is a capricious character that wants to burden the villagers with a land tax (Lagaan). He waived that there'll be no Lagaan for the next three years and that he'll be the one to pay it from his own pocket. Worst, if they lose, they will pay triple Lagaan for that year. He knows that the villagers are ignorant of the game and its rules. So he's pretty confident that he'll win the game\u0085 What he didn't know was that his younger sister, Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) is completely against his outrageous ideas\u0085 Elizabeth's first meeting with Bhuvan already got her attracted to him\u0085 Unsuspectingly, all of the villagers knows that she helps them purely out of sympathy\u0085well, I guess it was that way but she fells in love with Bhuvan later on\u0085it just pains me to see that Elizabeth's love for Bhuvan is an unrequited one\u0085she remained Bhuvan's Radha\u0085 The cricket match between Indians and British was really superb and very uplifting. Nevertheless, their wit and determination never let go unnoticed. Even the British officers cheered for their victory! It's really a heartwarming story\u0085of Purity in Spirit, Sacrificial Love and that good still prevails..\n\nAamir Khan has absolutely a god-given talent\u0085simply amazing\u0085he dances like any other talented men I know who perform. He was very good in the role\u0085he looks very appealing especially when Elizabeth imagined him in a princely suit! Gracie Singh looks convincing as Gauri who loves Bhuvan with all her heart. She looks bubbly and cute to me! She displays an excellent facial expression that she can shift from one emotion to another without any difficulty, I guess\u0085 They are really perfect for each other\u0085 On the other hand, Elizabeth may have love Bhuvan with the same intensity as with Gauri's but I guess, they weren't really meant to be with each other\u0085the rest of the men in Bhuvan's team were also fit for their roles\u0085they never failed to uplift, share their sentiments and inspire me\u0085the British officials showcased a role of fairness\u0085they sympathized and cheered with the villager's victory.\n\nFor an overall view, the movie was really amazing and I never will get tired watching it all over again. The songs were enjoyable. I can even depict it in my mind\u0085sometimes I would hum it 'coz I cannot recite the proper lyrics\u0085moreover, even if this film didn't win in the Oscars\u0085it's all worth it"

And Now Ashutosh Gowatrikar (Lagaan).\n\nWhen I went to see Lagaan in the theater, I had certain expectations of what the story was going to be like. But as I watched the film I realized that it was nothing like what I thought. The story was totally unexpected. It was quite a surprise. Never before has a film done that, usually the trailers, promos or songs of an Indian film give the story away and you get an idea of what the film is going to be like, but Lagaan was a total surprise.\n\nThe story is very well told and each character is well etched. Aamir Khan gives one of his best performances in the film. New find Gracy Singh gives an excellent performance. The Direction and Story of Ashutosh Gowatrikar are beyond words. After watching the film, it is very easy to see why this film was sent to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Film category.\n\nA great movie, definitely worth watching at least 10 or 12 times."

I figured I would watch a few minutes and then lay down for my well needed rest. Well, almost 4 hours later, I'm looking up the movie on IMDb.\n\nI don't understand the game of cricket at all and, honestly, could care less. I was captivated by the characters and their plight. I was rooting for the underdog The songs were so touching and spiritual. The dance scenes, especially the love dance one, were beautiful.\n\nI have read many comments on here that the movie was badly lip sang. I disagree. Until I read it here I hadn't noticed it at all.\n\nOverall, I cheered, I laughed at a few of the zanier characters, and I also found myself streaming tears for the young boy. I found myself experiencing the same emotions the English woman was showing during the game.\n\nI think they tied everything together well in the end. I ended the movie feeling like I wanted to recommend it to others.\n\nSo see the movie!! OK. I am finally off to bed."

When I was young I was forced to watch both - I never understood either and got bored pretty quickly. I think that Cricket is a game best broadcast on radio, and Footy on TV. Most times, they both bore me.\n\nNot so in this case. The match only takes up the last 45 minutes of this 210+ minute film, but the build up to it is quite good filled with intrigue, a love story, and a number of song and dance routines. By the time you get to the match you are totally aware of its importance, and how the Villagers are the underdogs. I won't give away the ending, but it really is suspenseful to the very end.\n\nIf you only see one \"Bollywood\" film, make it this one!"

Here, as told in the excellent movie Brother, we left this propaganda and are closer to the truth : West is an arrogant invader that spoils and squeezes resources from the natives ! This is maybe the first time i hear this argument in a movie and it's good !\n\n3) In our materialistic, consumerist and loose-valued society, we take anyone different from us as retarded, dumb and degenerate. Here, i see women veiled and working for the household and i can't say they are exploited as told by today propaganda. Those people wear traditional clothes but they can express their feelings and they have more interesting things to say that i'm a beauty, see my perfect body, etc\u0085\n\n4) For sure, we are frightened by the fact that we know nobody's name on the cover, as much we are instructed to except big names for a big movie ! However, all those fresh faces are cool, talented and crush the Hollywood and french myth ! Newcomers can do as good and even better than films legends !\n\n5) The movie has a clear story, with well done cliffhangers involving well-defined and balanced characters and the production knows how to tell it : so it's not about like video music and cutting frame each seconds, grading colors to a what-if world and confusing special effects with a story ! At last, as it's a sport movie, we find as in Rocky all the values that sports can teach (solidarity, efforts) and i must praise all the production because the 3 days match was not all repetitive or unintelligible but this final showdown was a test in human nature !\n\nSo if you are tired of seeing the same faces, desperate of propaganda and endless violence, try this movie and you will discover that yes, there's a different way to do movies \u0085 and different cultures in the world !"

This was a very slow predictable movie, and was throughout the 3 \u00bd, and more, hours. The storyline seems very similar to kid's movies from Disney relating to little children playing sports and some really corny soap opera. The whole time I was expecting some in depth, mysterious, beautifully woven scenes to come in, because it was actually nominated for an Oscar and was pretty popular ,but, they never came. It didn't do anything for me personally, but, I see some people enjoy the experience of the diversity in movie making and Bollywood movies, I would recommend it those people only."

I heartily recommend it to anyone curious about Hindi films.\n\nAamir Khan's attention to detail is fantastic, as is his energetic portrayal of a young man fed up with the status quo and willing to risk all for a chance to cast the burdensome yoke of British taxation off his village. Revolution without significant bloodshed, beautiful cinematography and choreography, excellent costuming, an intriguing love triangle, and a captivating story line ... all this and an edge-of-your-seat cricket match!

Excellent pacing, appealing acting, good music and about perfect movie entertainment. I've seen quite a number of Bollywood musical productions as the local Indian fast food restaurants tend to play non-stop DVDs that splice only the music and dance numbers together. It's been very hard to get a good recommendation of an entire film to see. The few that I've been able to watch were tough going, mainly due to the length and corny plot lines. The musical numbers were usually entertaining.\n\nI had to stop this film (on DVD) and resume watching it at a later time. I found myself watching from the beginning again and not getting bored! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has developed an excellent technique that I think the subtitle of the film gives a clue where his inspiration comes from. There are many scenes that remained me of the way Sergio Leone built scenes, introduced new characters and involved the viewer in the story. Really impressive.\n\nThere is one problem, if this is your first Indian musical/drama, there's not much in league with this film. To extend the Leone connection, it's like watching \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" and then trying to find another Spaghetti western that comes even close.\n\nExcellent."

The film's Oscar nomination for best foreign language film in 2002.\n\nWell, the fact is that Aamir Khan truly does light up the screen in this outing as he did in the aforementioned. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that every moment he is on screen is a delight. Goodness only knows why the Western film industry have failed to recruit this considerable talent. He is a gifted actor, is profoundly charismatic - and a great dancer to boot! Unfortunately, he isn't on screen for the whole 215 minutes. Moreover, his co-stars pale by comparison. (No pun intended.) Be they the simpering girlfriend, the English Rose or the pantomime British villain, they are all lacking somehow.\n\nThematically, the film is in the time-honored (fairytale) tradition of the \"Rocky\" movies but on long-play. It drags to an overly long conclusion. And I hardly think four song and dance routines qualify this movie as a musical - especially as none of them are particularly memorable.\n\nI've no idea why the film was nominated for an Oscar. Either it was a bad year for foreign films or the Academy must have felt obliged to include an Indian film for once. It's clear why it didn't win. It's not bad but it isn't Oscar material by a long way."

I loved it even though they had cut some bits out. I later got it on DVD and I must say the quality is much better. I kept watching this movie over and over again and have studied it also, I love the making of a movie its so intriguing.\n\nEveryone puts on great a performance; Aamir khan is the Protagonist, he so realistic and versatile. He has been my fav actor since 1990 in Dil, he was great, he's one of the finest actors Bollywood has (Also you have got watch Dil Chahta Hai he puts on a great performance). Gracy is new and unique she will do fine, no one would have suited as lead actress except her, a great job. All the eleven members of the team also deserved to be applauded it was cause of them that lagaan worked, same goes for the other opposite team. Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne have done great acting; since they can't speak Hindi it would have been very difficult. They bring a certain amount of realism to the story and how British people use to be like back in the late 1800's.\n\nBut most importantly, the man behind the scene deserves the most credit Ashutosh Gowariker the writer and director. This would not have been an easy movie to make and bringing it to silver screen is something amazing.\n\nI have been reading other peoples comments on lagaan as well, and many people have a problem that the length of the movie is to long, (hey look at the bright side at least you get your moneys worth) I can understand, in the beginning I found the movie a tad slow but it needed to introduce u to the village, characters, and most importantly the time frame. But once that goes ur glued to the movie till the end.\n\nIndian movies are very different to western movies, and what makes it unique are the song and dance routines, I thought the music and lyrics were so beautiful. The background music was superb. People also complained that song and dance routines are waste of time I don't think so, I think it's a way celebrating life and people like that.\n\nI really wished that lagaan would have got the Oscars, it would have been the first one for India, and all their hard work would have payed off. I haven't seen No mans Land but from the sound of it, it looks good. India just had some tough competitors.\n\nNow that lagaan has opened doors internationally India will very soon get an Oscar and I think it will be an Aamir Khan movie, which will get it.\n\nLagaan will always remain a story untouched; Wonderfully made and showcased, I would give it ten out of ten, one of the greatest movies of all time."

The plot is about some village people trying to beat an English team(englishmen who are the all-in-all for smooth running of the British empire) in a game of cricket so that they do not have to pay any taxes(lagaan) for the next three years. The movie is excellent technically--well choreographed songs, beautiful cinematography etc but that is all the movie has to it. The actors too play their part, which is not substantial, fairly well. The movie has been stretched to almost 4 hours but the plot deserves no more time than a routine movie..(In fact, there is not much plot at all.) There is not even a single actor other than Bhuvan(played by Aamir) which is developed. The movie focusses solely on Aamir and does not allow any other strong character to emerge. The stress on good cinematography (read good looking scenes ) is so large that peasants(poor, starving and all) living in pre-independence India wear freshly laundered (as good as new) clothes most of the time. It just does not look like that these are the poor peasants struggling to save their land but just a cricket team which is desperate to score a win over a fancied team. The love triangle is not even a triangle but a fleeting line....\n\nAll in all, a movie which looooks good but just that... Its soul is missing...\n\nAnd as for the length of the movie , for people who can watch test matches from start to end may find it to their liking."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Lagaan",
        "review_detailed_main": "Having won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002 Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, my interest in Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker's works, having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar, and having bought Swades: We, the People starring Shah Rukh Khan, still unwatched.\n\nI've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules, but I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan, you'll learn at least the basics enough to enjoy the game. No doubt my interest in this sport has been piqued, and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the movie, because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to enjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping 3.5 hours (and I heard in the collector's edition, it runs to 4?)\n\nSet in British India, we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that the villagers have to pay to their Rajas, who in turn pay the British for protection against, erm, invading forces and rivals from other Rajas. In fact, the British were double crossing everyone during their occupation of the country, and bad weather makes the lives of the villagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell. Every village needs a folk hero, and herein lies Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) who decides to step into the shoes of one, not because of bravado, but because of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow countrymen, especially when taxes for the year have been doubled.\n\nSo the stakes are raised in a game of cricket. Defeat the British, led by Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) and have a tax waver of 3 years for the entire province, or if they lose, then their Lagaan will be tripled. And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when the impoverished have their backs against the corner, they have little choice but to fight back. However, after years of being oppressed and cowering in the face of hardship, you'll need that bright spark or two to shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is something they have which they can turn into reality if they work at it.\n\nThe storyline might seem clich\u00e9 as per the usual sports movies, where our hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own special farming background which can be incorporated into the game, and recruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you, and thinks you're the troublemaker who started it all. There are leaders, and there are followers, and some good time is invested to develop this challenge, as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more detail. The villains of the movie, those pompous Brits personified by Captain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time, are put in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves.\n\nBut even amongst themselves, the Indians too have their infamous caste system, and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more meritocratic route in player selection, and this message undoubtedly stands out. I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch upon in his films, such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar, but it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his films do appeal to the masses, and therefore serve as a reminder to everyone.\n\nWhile the last 1.5 hours get devoted to the game, where two proud man go head to head against each other with their team, and team members having their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches, it never for a minute played out in a boring manner. In fact, it was entertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101 terms, and from there, those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be able to pick up the basics. Even if the sport is not your cup of tea, its delivery will still appeal to you, as do the usual Bollywood staple of dance and song, as composed by renowned A.R. Rahman - I particularly liked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have - the training montage, and with a love triangle of sorts fused between Bhuvan, his childhood sweetheart Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Englishwoman Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), sister of the villagers' enemy but one who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal terms with her countrymen.\n\nDespite its clich\u00e9s, Lagaan is wonderful entertainment, and you will not realize the movie's running length, as you'll be engrossed in what transpires, and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as they go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms. Colourful songs and charismatic folk characters, Lagaan unquestionably reinforces my love for Bollywood!"

It is one of the best films i have seen in my lifetime if not the best. Thoroughly entertaining and without meaningless subplots. The screenplay is as good as it gets and the 3 hour+ film just flies by. The cricket match in the climax is an absolute highlight of the film and is as nail biting as a real sports match. The game is explained so wonderfully during the film that people with very little or no knowledge of cricket will understand what cricket is all about. Aamir Khan is delightful as the enthusiastic Bhuvan. He takes to the role as a fish takes to water. He is one of the best actors of India and people who see the film will see why he is reckoned a perfectionist in India. In short, he does magnificently well doubling as the producer and the protagonist. Newcomer Gracy Singh (Gauri) is a revelation. She is simply adorable as the jealous village belle. She dances her way into viewers' heart esp in the \"Radha kaise na jale\" number. Rest of the cast is on target as well. The music by A.R.Rehman is another positive aspect of the film. The songs heighten the impact of the film unlike many other Indian films where songs act as deterrents in the ongoings. Cinematography has to be seen to be believed. All in all a brilliant effort. That too without leaving the commercial parameters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must preface this review with several caveats. First, \"Lagaan\" is Indian cinema, and anyone unwise enough to compare it to Hollywood cinema should really think twice before writing a review. Indian cinema can and does have inexplicable musical numbers, acting standards that are sometimes at the level of a TV movie of the week, and they are LONG. If you know that before you sit down with \"Lagaan\", you are in for a treat.\n\n\"Lagaan\" is a well told tale of the sufferings of a poor Indian village in 1893 under tyrannical British rule. The ultimate showdown between oppressor and oppressed is set up early on in the form of a cricket match between the British officers who rule the region and the inexperienced, spirit-shaken villagers, led by Bhuvan. If you haven't seen \"The Longest Yard\", \"Victory\", or even the game in \"The Road to El Dorado\", you are still probably familiar with the storytelling device of using a sporting contest in allegory.\n\nAnd let me tell you, \"Lagaan\" is shamelessly heavy-handed in its sweeping use of allegory. Nearly all of the characters might strike you as stereotypical if you fail to realize that they are deliberately allegorical. The director is not even trying to hide how each person represents an aspect of the overall situation of British Imperial rule, and how each person is also singularly responsible for representing a significant strength or weakness of the people they portray, whether Indian or English.\n\nSo if you are looking for Scorcese or Spielberg (or even George Lucas! ha!), forget it. The musical numbers are sometimes jarring and might even appear silly to Western audiences, but they have strength and fit into the entire allegorical pattern consistently. I admit that had those songs been omitted, I might have liked the film more.\n\nBut that cricket game is remarkable. I have seen the same kind of showdown game any number of times in any number of films. I knew what the outcome was going to be. But that game was astonishing and gives the film a strength that nicely balances out the weakness created by the songs and the ridiculous love story. I genuinely suspended my disbelief long enough to believe that the outcome of the film might not be quite so happy. When the director can do that to a veteran movie buff (and occasional cynic), he has demonstrated some kind of mastery in his craft.\n\nBefore I saw this movie, I knew little about cricket. Afterwards, I knew slightly more, but I did understand one thing that really surprised me. Without making the British unnecessarily sinister or unscrupulous, cricket still came across as disturbingly unforgiving and even brutal. I understood why it is a game many consider to be synonymous with fairness and skill and knowing the rules. And I truly felt the director and the performers did me a service for my $4 rental fee.\n\nGive \"Lagaan\" a chance, and tell me if Aamir Khan doesn't look like a buffed out Indian version of American Tobey Maguire!!"

Lagaan is filled with numerous filler scenes, including 1 or 2 absolutely random musical choreographs, that only serve to distract from the plot, negatively impact the plot, or beat certain plot points to death with repetition."

        "review_detailed_main": "The best cricket movie ever made.\n\nSet in India in the late-1800s, the local British rulers are imposing excessively high taxes on the local population. One of the local villagers has a run-in with the senior British officer, resulting in a cricket match between the British and the villagers. If the villagers win, they don't have to pay taxes for three years. If they lose, they have to pay three times their usual taxes.\n\nInteresting, engaging movie with some of the most realistic cricket scenes you'll see in a movie.\n\nThe April 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer, probably the foremost cricket magazine in the world, had their list of the top 10 cricket moments in movies, and Lagaan come in at number 1. I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment.\n\nCricket in movies is normally very badly done, looking as if the director had no clue about the sport. Even Bodyline, the movie about the infamous 1932 Bodyline series, had some laughable moments (eg the England wicket-keeper, Les Ames, standing up to the wicket for the express pace of Harold Larwood!). Considering that it was a movie exclusively about an historic cricket series, thus is even more cricket-centric than Lagaan, which is as much a human drama as a cricket movie, Bodyline's cricket scenes were very badly done. (Bodyline's script was just as bad, very biased and propaganda-like: going out of it's way to be anti-English).\n\nI expected similar inaccuracies in Lagaan and was pleasantly surprised. While there are some minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this is truly the most accurate and best cricket movie ever made. It is also good as a drama, not just a cricket movie, so recommended for those less-into-cricket too.\n\n(Aside: Bodyline came in at Number 3 on Wisden's list)."

I liked especially that they used subtitles instead of dubbing. It was an interesting look at the time and culture of Victorian India from the Indian as opposed to Euro-centric viewpoint. The musical numbers bring to mind Hollywood of the forties and Broadway.\n\nI was interested too to see the costumes and props of the period, again from the Indian point of view. It is not something kids growing up in white-bread suburbia get exposed to as a rule, at least not in the 60's and 70's when I was in school. So I found it educational as well as entertaining.\n\nThere was certainly more of the older style Hollywood in the acting than the more \"method\" approach of modern actors. Characters were archetypal rather than deep or subtle."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie for the first time in a small alternative cinema in Freiburg, Germany, where it was part of a Bollywood program. If I am reconstructing this correctly from press reports (the movie's local success made it into the local newspaper!), it must have been in December 2002.\n\nThis was just before the appreciation for Bollywood in the west really started, and a few years before YouTube. I did not know what to expect. My then girlfriend and I had selected the film from the program more or less randomly, despite some warning signs that it could be boring: It wasn't a comedy but a serious political drama about the struggle of an Indian village against British oppression. And it was about cricket, that boring and totally incomprehensible game. But somehow the program gave the impression it might be worth watching anyway.\n\nIt was the middle of the week, so people had to go to work on the next day, and the film started around 9 p.m. With no prior Bollywood experience, we expected it to last about 2 hours tops. First there was a minor complication: not enough seats! The cinema staff had to bring a lot of extra chairs in, which was very unusual (and probably illegal), so I assume the film already had a reputation that we only didn't know about.\n\nIt started nice enough. The beginning of the plot is gripping though a bit unsubtle (as is typical for Bollywood). Around 24 minutes in, after several promising sub-plots had been started, I realized that we were experiencing something I had never expected might exist: The first song, Ghanan Ghanan (the famous Monsoon song), started. Totally different form everything I had heard before, and (for my western ears) the perfect mix of classical and pop music, of western and exotic music. And the accompanying imagery! A sophisticated crowd pleaser with depth, at the same time humorous and tragic. This wasn't the kind of film we expected, it was a musical. Or perhaps more to the point, the modern equivalent of a classical opera. Only... better in every way? How could that be?\n\nIt must have been around 10:30 p.m. Or so (90 minutes in) that we realized that something else was unexpected. Shouldn't they have started wrapping up this film? At this point it seemed unlikely that it would end much before midnight.\n\nThen around 11 p.m. A shock: A break! A break? After 2 hours? At this time? This should have been bad news, but we were glad because this was a promise that this experience would last another 2 hours. And our reaction was typical. Around us only happy faces -- and happy chatter from those who had already regained their speech. After the break, I expected severely reduced spectator numbers, but it appears only a few people had miscalculated and had to return home to relieve the babysitter or something. The cinema was still crowded.\n\nAt 1 a.m. The film was over, but about half the people didn't feel like going home right away. We were standing in front of the cinema, talking about the film, sorry it was over. And still stunned that we had just enjoyed watching something as absurd as a cricket match drawing on for much of the second half of the film.\n\nAs I hinted in the beginning, this is not the typical reaction of a German cinema audience. Granted, it wasn't a typical German cinema, either, and not a typical German audience. But the entire experience was so unusual that the local newspaper referred to it in an article half a year later.\n\nThis film first put Bollywood on the map for me, but I think it's not a typical Bollywood movie. It is part of the Bollywood tradition, but it made it into the small Pantheon of all-time classics. I have no doubt that this film plays in the same league as Citizen Kane or Casablanca."

This is certainly not Hollywood, but 100% Bollywood - at its best! Although I live in a country with cricket only second to rugby, I do not like cricket and never watch it - but I did in fact enjoy the cricket in this film - my wife included. Towards the end, there is a spiritual aspect of this film that brought tears to my eyes and radiance to my heart. Marvelous! There is not much more that I can add here (considering the many wonderful comments below) except to say that the romance and symbolism is a joy to see. Yes, there are some simplistic soap opera segments, but this is in fact a Bollywood film, so I embrace this difference and see it as wholesome and refreshingly moralistic.\n\nYou will feel energised and elevated by this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "That's funny. I always thought the reason of \"Lagaan\" continuous presence on IMDb Top 250 was due to its being \"a little more than\" your typical Bollywood movie, as if the opposite was a disqualifying parameter. I confess, from my slightly prejudiced perspective, I thought \"Lagaan\" was an empowering sports movie about the triumph of human spirit etc. but again, not the \"typical\" Hindi movie. But that would have been overlooking the subtitle: which goes straight to the point: Once Upon a Time in India. I guess if you set a story in India, you better tell it the \"Indian way\".\n\nSo, the fact is: \"Lagaan\" IS your \"typical\" Bollywood movie, but that's not saying much as the director Ashutosh Gowariker finds that little extra push to elevate the film above the expectations of a national audience, thus delivering a story of universal appeal: something about the fight for dignity and justice, an underdog story with the same resonance as \"Rocky\", and told in an old-fashioned way with a despicable villain and a colorful gallery of challengers that goes from a handsome hero, a brute with a golden heart, a sneaky traitor, a comic relief etc. The film use many familiar elements from both Bolly and Hollywood's canon but the result is so enthralling, so exhilarating that it gets away with it.\n\nAnd take it from someone who's never been a fan of that Bollywood trope requiring that characters can break into singing and dancing in such a so well-choreographed act you wouldn't believe it's one of these spur-of-the-moment things. But the power of \"Lagaan\" is to know exactly what the audience longs, an emotional roller-coaster that includes singing and all dancing. There's such boldness in making a movie almost four hour longs by adding nothing that clearly advances the plot that even someone who's not familiar with Bollywood will understand that music isn't just an ornament, but as vital to the enjoyment as the rest. The film was long and riveting enough, but \"Lagaan\" primarily addresses its own audience and with such gusto that it widened its appeal to foreign audiences.\n\nBut the story had a part to play in that success. Its premise alone is captivating: at the peak of the British Empire in India, an arrogant and racist Captain named Andrew Russel, commanding the province of Champenar, doubled the Lagaan tax to the villagers, who are already taxed to the bone. But with this new measure, they risk starvation and misery. Phillips (well-played by Paul Blackthorne) is no man to care for such considerations. And when the young and rebel villager named Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) goes with a few villagers to ask the local Rajah to intercede, the man with one foot in each world admits he's powerless. Russell spices up the situation, he challenges the villagers to beat them in cricket, a game Bhuvan called stupid, if they win, they won't pay Lagaan for three years, if they lose, they'll have to play triple Lagaan.\n\nWhen Bhuvan accepts, he faces a major uproar from the other villages of the provinces and before winning the game, there's a long process of winning the villagers' spirit and the process is crucial to reveal more about the characters and the setting. Meanwhile, Philips confronts his superiors and understands he'd rather win the game or he might pay the Lagaan from his own pocket. The dice are cast and we follow the training of villagers who never understood cricket, let alone played it. But it's not much in the game than the anticipation, to see these peasant trying to defy the British establishment, it's both funny like \"The Full Monty\" but many highly dramatic moments remind us that lives are at stakes and it's not just a game. The odds are worse but they've got to beat them.\n\nThey are trying to win with what they have at hands and turning their flaws into tricks is the kind of inspirational material you expect from sport movie. One of the villagers is swift with slingshots, which earned him an ability to launch a ball so fast you literally don't see it coming, another one with a defect in his hand is able to make the ball spin, his status as a pariah allows a film to make a few comments about the caste system, to make sure there is an equivalent to British' ruthlessness. And to make up for the vileness of Captain his sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), finding her brother's method cruel and unfair help the villagers, much to the displeasure of Gaury (Gracy Singh) in love with Aamir. There are many subplots in the movie and they swiftly overlap just like the many rules of that cricket game that you don't need to understand in order to enjoy the film.\n\nEach sub-story is bound to a specific emotion, there's romance, there's drama, comedy and tragedy, and at the climactic game, all these element come full circle together. And no matter how hard you expect the game to be, how many sports movie you've seen, no matter how firmly you anticipate that it will all comes down to one final blow, the film will still manage to surprise you. And that's the power of Lagaan that Ebert summed up very well, you enjoy it, you realize it's new and fresh although it's a very familiar material. You really enjoyed it. It is Bollywood but its appeals transcend the story.\n\nIt has escapism, fun, colors, it's the kind of film, you can't say they don't make them anymore\u0085 well except maybe in Bollywood, the quintessential place for popular cinema. And it is an empowering sports drama about the triumph of human spirit."

        "review_detailed_main": "The answer: kind of. Occasionally. But Lagaan is a very flawed film. I think the Sports Movie is probably the worst cinematic genre, in that there are really only two possible outcomes in the end. The underdogs either win or they lose. Both options have been so utterly overdone that a sports movie just can't really be very interesting. Add to that the fact that I know so little of cricket \u0096 if you don't, you probably should read up on the rules before you see Lagaan (like the fact that you can bean a batter without any penalty whatsoever) \u0096 and that promises a very dull movie. Fortunately, the film manages to be pretty entertaining all the way through. And since I personally broke it up into three different sittings, the length wasn't a big deal (if I had seen this in the theater, I very well might have despised it). It helps that the film is partly a musical. There are, I think, only six musical numbers, all of them good, a couple just fantastic (they get less impressive as the film goes on). The musical score of the film is also very good. And the (Indian) actors are all pretty good, with Gracy Singh (as Gauri) being an absolutely stunning beauty. I hated the way that the British were portrayed, though. Yeah, I know, they were pretty awful to their subjects at this point of history. But they're so evil, they might as well be twirling their ever-present mustaches. And the more flamboyant the facial hair, the meaner they are. There is a lot of semi-frightening `I hope our gods break the backs of the Whiteys!' sentiment flying around the film, and Lagaan sometimes seems like a very hateful movie. It does very little to actually separate the past with the present, it seems to me. And then there's the white woman. She seems like she might have been added to apologize for the rest of the British characters (she has no facial hair), but she's so poorly written that all of her actions and appearances are laughable. And the semi-romantic relationship between herself and Bhuvan, the main Indian character, is an incredibly anachronistic and unbelievable conceit. Not much is even made of it, really, except for a particularly hilarious scene where she joins in during one of the better musical numbers. I don't particularly recommend Lagaan (you might want to buy the soundtrack, though, or download a couple of the songs), but many may like it much more than I did. 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Lagaan\" was a darling of the press; too bad; it's overrated.\n\nIf you want to see art films from India, ripe with the magic that this film utterly lacks, view films by the master, Satyajit Ray.\n\nIf you want to see a fun, expansive Bollywood flick, pick one with Amitabh Bachchan, \"Coolie,\" for example.\n\nIf you want to see a movie with a powerful social conscience and incredible amounts of courage, check out \"Bandit Queen.\" \"Lagaan\" is cartoonish and strictly for the middle brow.\n\nThere are extensive singing and dancing numbers, performed by people who can't sing or dance, directed by a director without an eye for the body and its movements.\n\nWhen the film's star, Aamir Khan, moves his shoulders in a typical Indian dance move, he looks so uncomfortable you wonder if he's got a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.\n\nHe looks like he's never made that prototypically Indian dance move before; given the theme of the movie, his apparent inauthenticity is inadvertently comical. Maybe the stiff British officer would perform the move with more grace and ease.\n\nThis is such a shame. There is great dancing in India, with a centuries-long pedigree. If a movie is going to be seen before international audiences, and represent Indian dance, it should not be this.\n\nOther Bollywood movies wear their buffoonery lightly. \"Lagaan\" takes itself oh-so seriously.\n\nIt wants to be an expose of the suffering of helpless peasants and the cruelty of the British Raj.\n\nThing is, you can see real suffering, helpless peasants in India today. They are not suffering under the heel of the British Raj, they are suffering under the heel of Indian policies and cultural norms, like, oh, say, the caste system and misogyny. VS Naipaul had a lot to say about that ...\n\nBut, anyway. Real life Indian peasants look nothing like the plump, immaculate, perfectly coiffed, sparkly-toothed stars of this movie.\n\nAnd that's a problem. You can't really make a gritty expose while banishing from your set the very visible throngs -- visible even to the most casual of tourists -- in any Indian street -- who looks even vaguely like the people whose plight you are dramatizing and wringing your hands over.\n\nWell, musicals aren't realistic, you might be saying.\n\nWell, I'd reply, musicals do feature the truth of great singing and great dance. When a performer with the talent of Paul Robeson belts out a song as great as \"Old Man River,\" you get the point being made about the plight of African Americans in the South, even if Robeson is on a soundstage, not on the banks of the Mississippi.\n\nNo one in \"Lagaan\" can sing or dance, and there are no great songs in the movie. And Hollywood bothered to costume Paul Robeson in simple, torn clothing.\n\nThe excruciatingly bogus peasants of \"Lagaan\" look like some very rich and privileged person's fantasy of what peasants ought to look like. They look like collectible international dolls, like something you'd purchase in an airport before departure. It's all very Potemkin-village-esquire.\n\nThe Sadistic British Officer is utterly unbelievable. The audience looks at him and sees nothing but the filmmakers' pathetic political agenda. A more realistic character, once less flamboyant, painted and dyed, but more believable, could have been much more horrible.\n\nThe movie wants to be Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" and ends up being a Warner Brothers' Road Runner v. Wile E. Coyote cartoon.\n\nBecause it is so bogus, it is lifeless. \"Lagaan\" doesn't have the exuberant goofiness of less ambitious Bollywood movies. Those movies have their truth; their truth is the most extravagant dreams of their poorest viewers.\n\n\"Lagaan\" is a politically correct dream, and, as such, it becomes an artistic nightmare.\n\nSome will like \"Lagaan,\" though. As mentioned, there are costumes galore, with nary a tear from long use or spot from buffalo dung. There are vapid musical numbers, unencumbered by any connection to organic life.\n\nAamir Khan, the lead, is gorgeous, and he wears very little clothing, so you get to enjoy his gorgeousness in all its gorgeousness.\n\nKhan greatly resembles Tyrone Power. Khan looks like Power, he is as beautiful as Power was, and he has Power's absence of any apparent quality -- intelligence, physicality, depth -- other than great beauty.\n\nGracy Singh is beautiful *and* a good actress. Let's hope she goes far. Far away from \"Lagaan.\" There's a lot up on the screen. A Big Plot Device, scenery, and, oh, did I mention the costumes? Ultimately, though, given its complete divorce from either artistic excellence or the courses of real life, it's all pretty boring."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lagaan is one of the best-made large-scale films (by which I mean I am not comparing it with the films of masters like Ray, Ghatak, Bergman or Kieslowski, whose films to my mind are made on a more intimate scale than films like Lagaan, which means that the parameters of evaluation are different) I have seen, and is certainly among the best five films ever to have come out of India's commercial film industry. It combines some of the best song-and-dance sequences in Hindi cinema's history with an interesting premise for a plot, excellent, restrained yet powerful performances all round, beautiful cinematography/camerawork, and manages to elicit from the audience a level of emotional involvement that most films can only dream of. It looks consistently beautiful, without ever being untrue to its setting: this is not the beauty of bright primary colours so favoured by the average Hindi film director these days, but rather the more muted earth tones, combined with the earthy reds and oranges of the women's clothes, of its village setting. It really does mark a return to the sort of honest, heartfelt, genuine films that the Bombay was known for in the 1950s and 1960s, though technically this is an infinitely more assured piece of work than those films. For once, the dialogue never hits a false note \u0096 admittedly, the use of Avadhi is a bit erratic, but my guess is that was a compromise between comprehensibility and authenticity, and it certainly does not jar. The integration of the British actors and the bits that are in English is seamless; the film is often funny without ever descending into farce of slapstick; even Rachel Shelley's typically \u0091Bollywood' declaration of love, complete with pillared room and flying tresses/dresses, works! Speaking of Shelley, her role is perhaps my one quibble \u0096 it would have been nice to see her romantic involvement with Aamir's character be allowed to develop a bit more. Perhaps the only other critical comment I'm willing to make is that the plot sort of ran out of steam for the last bit \u0096 the cricket match was very entertaining, but given that there was no way the outcome was going to be any different from what it was (this does purport to be a feel-good film, after all!), I think it went on for a tad too long. But these are minor points; nothing's ever perfect, and neither is Lagaan \u0096 but it comes pretty damn close to being a perfect realisation of what it set out to be. Well worth a (couple of?) watch(es), and I've no doubt this will come to be regarded as a classic. Beautifully made, stunningly shot, perfectly acted, exhilarating, strong, earthy cinema that made me feel good for a while after I saw it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was amused at the hype the film created amongst well-meaning Indians when it got nominated for the best foreign film Oscar and found entry into the Competition Section of Cannes in 2002. It was no mean achievement for an Indian film, in the perspective of the political and other forces that come into play in the long selection process. Yet, the film was inherently too weak to represent the best in Indian cinema.\n\nThe strengths of \"Lagaan\" were: 1. Great sound (I do not imply music) recording and the split of the sound into six channels--one of the best in Indian cinema since \"Sholay\"; 2. Commendable casting of Indian actors who are alumni of the National School of Drama, Delhi and the Film Institute, Pune--and not because they are sons and daughters of famous Indian actors or they won international beauty contests; 3. Good costumes; 4. Some good lilting songs with music of A R Rahman; and 5. authentic pronunciation.\n\nThe weaknesses were: 1. Unrealistic photography--passing dark clouds that have sharp boundaries i.e., with an umbra and no penumbra, resembling shadows of sci-fi films like \"Independence day\"; 2. A screenplay that ignores the development of secondary characters like Gauri, the British characters, and Indians who work for the British while these characters are utilized unabashedly and lackadaisically to burnish the main plot -- a look at the character development of tertiary characters of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns or Japanese cinema will show the lack of depth of Lagaan's screenplay; 4. Lack of detailed research on cricket rules of that era which any serious director would have done; 5. Inadequate and poor subtitling, with key lines left out and additional lines that appear that were never spoken; 6. A director who fumbles with editing and camera perspectives on the deer and rabbit sequences and forgets to capture the \"no-balls\" of bowlers on camera, 7 Uninspired editing ... the list is endless.\n\nA modest production like Shyam Benegal's \"Ankur\" or any Adoor Gopalakrishnan's later films would have won an Oscar because these films take direction, screenplay, photography, editing and sound seriously to a level beyond the obvious importance the producers of \"Lagaan\" gave to the story and acting. Unfortunately, the films of Benegal and Gopalakrishnan were never sent to the Oscars by the Indian organizations that choose the representative Indian film to vie for an Oscar..\n\nYet \"Lagaan\" is a good Indian film excelling in certain departments but is definitely not a patch on the best Indian cinema today. A film of Mrinal Sen (later period), Gopalakrishnan, Benegal, or Karnad offer better cinema than \"Lagaan\"--though none of these filmmakers could afford the monetary and technological advantage in the hands of the producers of \"Lagaan.\"\n\nI commend the performances of some players such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajesh Vivek and Sri Vallabh Vyas in their poorly developed roles. These are great actors on stage but cinema unfortunately has resorted to casting them as stereotypes. I wish these three are picked up by accomplished directors and given an opportunity to express their talent in complex roles. Then they would give the Amir Khans a run for their money and prove acting skills of trained Indian actors further. British actress Rachel Shelley was refreshing to watch and may develop into an accomplished actress."

        "review_title": "I was suitably entertained",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film happens to the very first Bollywood film that I have watched in its entirety. Not being a fan of musicals, I braced myself as I popped in the DVD. Well, 225 minutes past by rather quickly and although there were moments where I was wondering exactly why I was watching a musical, but most of the time I was fairly well entertained. I mean, granted, my critical side could pick at this film for a while, but that didn't lessen my entertainment.\n\nThe story is a pretty simple one and rolls forward predictably. The setup is this: poor Indian farmers get taxed by local British cantonments through their raj. One day the British capriciously demand double tax (lagaan = tax) and the villagers, suffering from an extended drought ask for it to be lifted. The big bad Brit offers them a challenge: win a cricket game against the Brits and no taxes for three years. Lose and pay thrice over. I like the word thrice.\n\nComplications arise as you have a British woman who goes against her tyrannical brother and secretly aids the Indian team. Of course, since it's a classically styled musical, there's a romance, complicated by a triangle (or perhaps a quadrilateral). And since it's a sports film (a cricket film), you have your requisite training montages. Since it's a musical, you have plenty of musical/dance numbers. And it's a recruiting film, so you could call it Bhuvan's Eleven.\n\nAll right, the good stuff first. The production values are high, the photography is gorgeous at times, the acting is simple but effective, the story is unapologetically escapist, the song and dance numbers aren't so silly that I wanted to skip them and at least one of them actually moved forward the underlying drama, rather than being just a number. And then there's the tension. The stakes are high from the beginning and the cricket game itself is presented in just a way that the tension never really lets up until all almost four hours is said and done.\n\nOne of the problems is that the characters are all very simplistic. The villain character is played over the top, which makes sense in the simple world of simple characters that's described here. Perhaps if you let yourself get caught up in the simple world presented and can hit the switch in your brain that cares about what's real, this isn't a problem. But I think the character is so entirely bad (and the hero so entirely good) that it's hard to believe characters in this movie to be real, for the most part.\n\nAnother problem I have with this film is a problem I have with most musicals: many of the song and dance numbers are long and some of them are unnecessary for the purposes of storytelling. I understand that it's all part of a show, but sometimes I feel like all these things are either just tacked on, or a story is tacked onto a series of somewhat related songs. Which was why I was relieved that not every number was pointless. The movie is also really long and some trimming could help it be a little easier to find time to watch.\n\nI'd say that its escapism is a negative trait, but I can't help but wonder if the primary audience is one that faces the harsh realities of the world every day and needs a little hope in their lives. All the same, I can't help but wonder if some of the little things the film does to \"say something\" about the problems of the caste system, etc., are done with little meaning, but to just appease the hopes of those watching. There is something to say about the critics of escapist films in that it helps keep the disenfranchised appeased in their situation and holding out hope rather than doing something themselves to change the situation.\n\nAnd when it comes to believability, the initial love triangle is fairly believable, but the second complication makes me uncomfortable, since it appears to be over-idealized and part of me thinks that it's also, in part, an unbelievable male fantasy, even if not acted on.\n\nStill, for as long a watch as it was, I was suitably entertained. The only real barrier to me watching more Bollywood films in the future is carving out the heroic amount of time necessary to take one in. I suspect that this film will be a joy to musical lovers. 7/10."

How could they stretch this to four hours!?!?!?!? Incredible! It should have been two hours at the most.\n\nThe Indian actors were good, especially the woman playing Gauri, but the British ones were terrible! The main bad guy and his sister were awfully bad. The sister would not have been tolerated helping the Indians like that. She would have been sent away, not allowed to watch the final match."

It is a triumph for Garwariker, the actors, the composer, the technicians on every level. There is immaculate attention paid to the framing of all shots. A breathtaking tour de force in Cinematography and fine acting.\n\nLagaan is a colorful melange of music, romance, drama and sports that is completely engrossing despite being nearly 4 hours long. This masterpiece reveals just how far Bollywood has come and, in many ways, surpassed Hollywood in inspired film making.\n\nA must-see for the entire family!!"

The songs are fun too!\n\nThe cricket scenes are well staged & filmed quite well.\n\nI was impressed overall with the English cast, especially the fact that it appears many of the cast appeared to have learnt to speak fluent Hindi, minor touches such as these can make a huge difference to a film like this.\n\nA great film for cricket fans & non cricket fans alike, even if the end is a tad predictable & not unexpected. 8/10"

The trailer I saw was so vibrant, but there was no way to know that it would be written and shot so well. (Not to mention that the cast was beautiful and brilliant.) It took about 15-20 min to acclimate myself to the film, BUT, I was entering a foreign country and exposing myself to a completely unknown culture.\n\nLAGAAN was a touching, well-written musical film that , I think, should be for the Hindu community what THE SOUND OF MUSIC is to Americans. Though it was lengthy, the script surprised me at several pivital turns. The stakes were raised for our heroic villagers more times than I expected. The music was new for me and I became mesmerized by it. The English translations of the songs were nothing short of heart-wrenching poetry. The diversity of the characters added conflict and comedy. Many of them had to overcome personal downfalls to lift their community out of bondage. I cared not only for the hero and heroine, but about 7 or 8 minor supporting characters. THAT is not only good writing, but F***ing brilliant acting!!!! This movie was colorful, beautiful, spiritually uplifting, and entertaining, while still being educational on facets of the Hindu culture/spirituality, the caste system (the most moving character for me was 'the Untouchable') and a period of their history. I screamed and cheered. I got misty and cried. It was a long film, but well worth the wait."

Virtually everything in it is recycled from something else \u0096 it's Rocky, Gandhi and MTV all rolled into one, with a heavy overlay of American-style political correctness. But it's all done with pizzazz. I loved the photography, the music (by the amazing A.R. Rahman) and the cast. I especially liked the performances of Aamir Khan as the hero and Gracy Singh as the spunky girl who loves him. They are both gorgeous (once you get past the nose ring on her) and have charm galore. The choreography is a hoot. Some of the dialogue is a scream. My favorite line: `You can't fool me. I know which way the Ganges flows.' The film is a campy, over-the-top melodrama, but its heartfelt earnestness makes it surprisingly affective. The movie has moments of sheer exhilaration. On the whole it's very sweet and uplifting. It's long, but always interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I predict that this movie will gain a huge cult following in America and spawn many English-language films with a similar style."

As far as can be expected. It's handsomely made, has some good (if standard) storytelling turns, and oh, the dance sequences are lovely and a lot fun to watch, especially scored to Rahman.\n\nA particularly not very strong point: the love \"triangle\" which doesn't make much sense when one of them, the white lady Elizabeth, can't speak the other's language, and so can't Bhuvan. But, that's what is simply done in these movies do you roll with it, or try to. Luckily, this gets pretty much jettisoned once the cricket matches come up, and it's then all about the sports movie hystrionics - which I also enjoyed (often against my better judgment), in large part because, well, it looks like they'll lose the game (BUT WILL THEY!??!)\n\nAnd damn does Aamir Khan (the, uh. Jack Nicholson of India? By that I mean great at comedy, drama, charming, fine at singing, and uh, ok not sure how Jack dances and all) have to act his ass off to make this work as our hero - certainly when our antagonist, played by Paul Blackthorne, seems to be cast because the producers said, \"we want Billy Zane...

It distills into film the more exciting moments from a cricket game; batters getting pummeled, wickets getting knocked over, home runs, centuries, and tide-turning errors. The film also has droughts, evil British oppressors, and a pitiful Untouchable kid.\n\nUnfortunately these symbols don't resonate with my ABCD brain. Removing them, Lagaan is left me with flat characters, a simple plot, an undeveloped lovestory, and an awfully long running time.\n\nPurely as a sports movie I think Lagaan falls short. Compare it to Karate Kids and Rockys. There, the competition is not so focused on the win/lose/tie outcome, but on the heroes gaining self-respect. Instead, Lagaan's Indian team lacked a coach-figure inspiring them to \"do your best; don't lose to fear.\" Instead, they had Aamir Khan telling them \"try to let me handle it\"\n\nThe game-ending scene in Lagaan is about as fulfulling as G.W. winning the Florida election or Brazil winning the 1994 World Cup. The outcome hinges on chance, not effort.\n\nSongs and lyrics are fun but have a major problem: most of the the lip-syncing is not convincing. You see the mouths chatting in a desert while you hear the singers screaming in a closet. They don't blend well. Save the echo and reverb for the soundtrack CD."

So one revolutionist farmer Aamir Khan (the main lead of the film) takes up the challenge thinking that its almost impossible for them to pay them even single tax, double tax wouldn't make anything worse then it already is... so the film describes the sheer power and will of these Indian farmers which makes them Succeed!!

I was not prepared for a film that had so many levels.\n\nI think it is plain that the villagers' struggle to \"beat the British at their own game\" is a metaphor for the \"power of the human spirit\" (regardless of culture), as well as the nascent potential of India, and other \"non-western\" countries, to learn from and compete with the west in spheres of art, science, culture, industry, and sports. The film tries to be \"balanced\" in showing that not ALL westerners are \"bad guys\", nor are all Indians \"good guys\", however, there is a clear villain and a likable hero.\n\nThe film weaves a romantic subplot, historical elements, the main conflict (multi-caste/ethnic Indian villagers vs. the haughty British occupiers), the details of the sport (cricket), comic and dramatic elements, even song & dance numbers in such a way that the film does not seem overlong. The film is plotted and paced beautifully. Some might find it too \"saccharine\", but I think that, like the sports classic \"Rocky\", \"Lagaan\" believes in the qualities of compassion, patience, endurance, ingenuity, teamwork, sportsmanship and love that it espouses - and as a result, the film works!\n\nIf you have NOT seen many Indian films other than \"Monsoon Wedding\", but you are open-minded and like sports, culture and history, be prepared to step back in time to the days of the British Raj as seen from an Indian point of view. I think you will enjoy \"Lagaan\"."

Although it contains a somewhat overwhelming hyperbolic, It should actually expected beforehand, due to hyperbolas in the dramatization, even to some extremes, is to some extent a distinctive signature of any Indian movie, beside the all known singing and dancing every thirty minutes or so. I personally don't think that the hyperbolic are really needed in this story because it already is a great story to tell. Fortunately Aamir Khan realizes this and uses drastically reduced hyperbolas in the next works as 3 Idiots (2009). This movie is also able to teach at least the very basic rules of cricket, a game which is not very common in countries outside the British Commonwealth. The acting is just what is expected from any Indian movie. Not to say that it's bad, but I sure will not also say that it's Oscar quality. But then again I'm sure that, like most of Aamir Khan production, this movie's strong point is the great story based on a rare premise to be used as a movie screenplay. The set selection unfortunately is very confined and limited for a movie with almost a three hour duration."

Also, the characters are rather one-dimensional, particularly the bad white folks. Perhaps I would not have been so irked if not for the nearly four-hour run time. I have not seen much Bollywood, and I did find the cut-to-music-video scenes, coupled with fact that the actors are not singing their own songs (i.e., there is just one singer for all the women characters and one for the men) distracting, but I do not think that was the source of my discontent. I recently saw A Peck On the Cheek, which is also Bollywood, and I thought that movie was far superior to this one."

A.R.Rahman had to follow and use almost every single film scoring rule and technique for writing the background score of Lagaan. Every principal character gets a musical theme. Every dramatic moment gets an uplifting music score. Every song's melody is used appropriately in the background score throughout the film. Every musical theme that is not based on any of the song's melody is deliberately tuned catchy, so that it could get a life even out of the film. There are big bangs and grand orchestral outbursts. There are moments with measured silence amidst ample music. Every tear-jerking moment is filled with an instrumental soliloquy. Every instrument in the score is carefully chosen, and every piece is carefully orchestrated to convincingly transport us, a century back in time. The beauty of Lagaan's background score lies in the way all of these techniques come up in the right proportion, in the right context, in the right moments of the film....... to read more go to the link given below www.backgroundscore.com/2011/06/10th-anniversary-of-lagaan.html"

It was a good, fresh and very much welcome change for Bollywood.\n\nHaving taken a major risk here, Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker tried the stunt of a historically placed Hindi Film. Yet they did it so cleverly and without much fuss that it was compatible with the Indian Mainstream, as well as contain so much depth to story and characters that it impressed higher categories of film-viewers too and thus reached the Oscars.\n\nThe genially balanced blend of Myth-Legend and Bollywood-Spice Film had everything I desire from a good film: Fresh and interesting visuals, rich and diverse characters to relate to, stunning music and a riveting storyline. A game of cricket to decide a dispute, not more. It wasn't necessary.\n\nNormally such a film would not have had much success in India, for complicated themes requiring some general knowledge (in this case historical) just does not click. Indians want real-life soaps 3 hours long.\n\nBut this worked, because it took to the most primitive forms of entertainment and didn't get to involved in historical matters.\n\nI loved it. And I loved the way it was made."

He impulsively challenges a ruling officer, a really nasty type reminiscent of previous villainous prototypes...and then he must meet his challenge.\n\nViewers not accustomed to the Bollywood product should be able to believe that hundreds of drought-stricken villagers could break out in unified and very colorful song when they see black clouds on the way--if so, and you like romance and being on the winning them, this film is great fun indeed!"

In fact, this movie's a four-hour long demonization of the Raj (British rule) that's sure to disappoint any with an authentic interest in colonial times. The story centers around a cricket match wager between villagers hoping to escape taxes and a local colonial British administrator eager to out-do himself in providing a hateful stereotype for the Indian resistance (and their cinematic inheritors). One must wonder at the insecurity of any producer of so jaundiced and anti-British a screenplay. Not to mention India's movie goers. Far too much singing and dancing accompany it all, of course, but between musical numbers the viewer will find enough quality script, acting and scenery to carry it off."

But the highlight of the film is, without doubt, the cricket match, which dominates the second half completely.\n\nThe filming of the cricket match is the most exhilarating part of the film, which keeps the viewer on tenterhooks right till the end. The highs and lows of the villagers and the emotions attached to the game are so true to life, which is why the cinegoer becomes a part of the crowd watching the game on screen."

For a cricket crazy nation, it has a 1:30 hours long match with all the possible things included that can happen in cricket. At the time of it's release everything related to the film was an event. Right from the music release and discussion about the songs to theatres charging extra in view of the decreased number of shows per day.\n\nAlmost 20 years down the line, I'm sad to sat that this film does not stand the test of time.

They had done great efforts in making the film and also they had put every effort they could to make it successful. Aamir always had high hopes for his films and he works hard for his films. This film was released along with Gadar and though Gadar became a bigger hit, Lagaan gathered more acclaims. Gadar was a massy entertainer with patriotic feel while Lagaan had a class and was well written to cater every audience. It has a David Vs. Goliath story where poor farmers fight against mighty British Empire and what happens next forms the story. There is curiosity which is maintained till the end of the film about who will win what and I think one should watch this film to see how brilliantly Gowarikar, the director captures everything in it.

They protect the local Raja from neighboring Rajas as well as the other Rajas. So they are able to demand Lagaan (tax) from the hard-upon local villagers. There is a drought but the cruel arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) doesn't care and doubles the Lagaan. Local villager Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) rallies the villagers to appeal to the Raja. There they witness their first game of cricket played by the British. Russell offers to forgive the Lagaan for the entire province for the next three years if Bhuvan can lead a team to beat the British. If the villagers lose, he will triple the Lagaan. Few villagers believe in the gamble except for Gauri (Gracy Singh) who loves Bhuvan. The captain's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) comes to teach the hopeless villagers how to play the foreigner's game.\n\nIndian movies are not usually my thing but this one works very well. I'm still not a big fan of the Bollywood song and dance. However the story works here. The Captain is a bit of a cartoon who needs to be a better villain. The love story is good but the love triangle needs to hold off its resolution. The game is pretty much a Bad News Bear situation where all the disparate players join together. The game is interesting. They made it compelling and almost understandable."

Unlike posing as a non-Indian and flooding all oscar/film related forum with shameless posts on lagaan. Dont try to make a web coup just like, it was done to make Amitabh the actor of the millenium by BBC!.\n\nOne new thing as a Indian film is that for first time its a sports film. You have all the usual features, villain's sister falling for the hero, a unwanted love triangle, a black sheep, over melodrama and what not?!.\n\nAny sensible cricket fan will know, when limited overs cricket was introduced (by 1971). There we have it about 100 years ago!. So much for details!. There is a limit for cinematic liberties. Detail flaws can pile up like Sachins tons here.\n\nI think we have seen may better underdog movies in hollywood, I dont know whats so new about this?!. Tell me about, self-determination and human spirit, I have seen it enough right from seven samurai. I dont need a crowd pleasing, over simplified film for this. Why not call Ajay Devgan kicking bad-guys can also called human spirit.\n\nIts a shame calling this the india's best. Agreed its a good film with good songs and some decent production qualities, but please keep your cool guys. First please, go and see some European and Hollywood movies to see what world movie standards are like. I am first a movie fan, then i am a indian movie fan. I dont accept this film as any better bollywood fare.\n\n6/10."

        "review_title": "True anti-colonial escapism",
        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike, say, Once Upon a Time in China, with which this film shares at least its English (sub)title, this is populist anti-Western colonialism done right! For one thing, having the villains actually be white goes a long way; Paul Blackthrone is an extremely effective \"evil Englishman,\" and he actually speaks Hindi for a good chunk of his role! As a result, we get a real struggle, rather than an ultimately-meaningless proxy battle as we usually do in Tsui Hark's film. This is, however, no Gibsonesque exercise in Anglo-bashing, and everything comes out extremely balanced, perhaps too obviously so. He does, after all, have a sister that helps out the village people as they try to learn cricket and beat his wager. More importantly, untouchables and Muslims, despite earlier misgivings, are welcomed into the team, providing a heartening, inclusive vision of Indian resistance against the occupier.\n\nWhat's nice about this film is that it is clearly a high-profile Bollywood picture with an eye towards crossover, but it is not so compromised that it becomes unrecognizable to anyone who is already somewhat familiar with Bollywood. I imagine this is one of the better \"gateway drugs\" for the genre, as the music is good and fits with the plot, and one rarely feels that the more-than-three-hour running time is needlessly padded. Sure, they could have made it shorter, but this is actually epic enough to deserve it."

        "review_title": "A Movie that will change how movies are made in India!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "When you think of how many movies keep you engrossed for three running hours, the brilliance of Lagaan is evident from keeping your interest for all of its four hours (with an interval and some boring ads and trailors thrown in). It could have been a few minutes shorter - but that would be at the cost of detail, drama, humor, or perhaps a silent cinematographic transition. Different sections of the audience appreciate different aspects of a film - and a film that can please as many sections without getting on the nerves of another must be appreciated as a truly complete film. And in that respect, Lagaan is a perfect example of complete film, a classy entertainer, with superior technical execution - like Sholay (the only other comparable movie).\n\nThe strength of \"Lagaan\" is in the people behind its making. Ashutosh Gowariker leads the way as a director first, and as much as the man behind the story and screenplay. Anil Mehta uses color and camera to bring out the mood in each scene. A period movie set in 1893 would rely on sets and costumes - but limiting the movie to one village called Champaner and nearby British Cantonment makes it easier on Nitin Desai and Bhanu Athaiya to successfully take you back by a century with none of the usual faux pas.\n\nA R Rahman\u00b4s background score combines with Anil Mehta\u00b4s visual brilliance for a strong audio-visual impact. The songs impress by themselves, and instrumental notes from the songs work brilliantly in the background track - that keeps you listening and appreciating it from the titles to the credits at the end. The songs blend into the movie with Javed Akhtar\u00b4s strong lyrics and are innovative choreography. There may be some whispers about the songs affecting the narrative but there is an audience that wants to see movies for the songs and choreography - and Lagaan manages the balance between narrative and song-and-dance well. About the cast, everyone brings life into their roles. Aamir Khan stands out - with his screen time to movie time ratio most likely to beat some of Kamal Haasan\u00b4s movies.\n\nNow, about the movie itself - it is a modernized presentation of four-decade old \"Naya Daur\". It is a movie about common men, led by a strong-minded individual to overcome resistance and differences in opinion - and standing their ground for a cause against a powerful opposition. There is a cause for a fight, there is a fight, and there is a moral victory in the end. This is the stuff that most good-over-bad and other moral stories are made of, but the details in the script of Lagaan make it work.\n\nThe humor built into individual characters as Aamir Khan assembles a cricket team and respond to the challenge of the British General is most entertaining. At the cost of sounding sexist, some of the ignorant humorous descriptions of cricket amused me by how close it was to what some women in the house would say when all men are glued to the TV and households come to a standstill (often depriving the women of some boring TV serial). This humor is certainly a strength of the movie, blended most brilliantly into a serious and inspirational narrative. Full credit to the director, screenplay, dialogues, and the performers.\n\nAbout the story itself - it is incidental to the movie. Lagaan is more about spirit, inspiration, and cinematic brilliance rather than a story that will move you. And should I say, thankfully there is no marriage, no rituals and functions, and the stuff that most of 90\u00b4s were made off. The movie works at the level of spirit and inspiration, and not at some perceived lost cultural value in society - and most thankfully so.\n\nAnd to conclude this review - I must say Lagaan and Sholay, being two very different movies share a lot in common - in how complete they are. Think about this - what\u00b4s so common to these movies.\n\nExtra long movies, suppressed societies, domination through power, the spirit to fight, inspiring and building a team, humor and entertainment in a serious script, brown barren landscapes, strong people and characters, story of a single village, and we can keep counting ...\n\nSo, here I am shooting off a feature by feature comparison of the two movies.\n\nLength and directions - Two \"too\" long movies - where the length didn\u00b4t bore you. Two directors, who got their formula right.\n\nPerformances and characters - Sholay was easily better with a different genre of performers and more complete characters. Lagaan suffers from the typical \"Kamal Haasan\" syndrome - of centering around one character.\n\nThe love story - If it were not for the Amitabh-Jaya love story of Sholay, Lagaan would be far superior with how the romantic angle never interferes or disturbs on the narrative.\n\nCreating a whole village - Two movies that successfully take you to a different society with pains, pleasures, and feelings that are not so common with what we associate with.\n\nTerror - Gabbar Singh scores and its an unfair comparison here. The British general is more about misplaced pride than terror.\n\nHumor - Lagaan wins, with humor being a part of its people - unlike Sholay which had parallel tracks and comic characters like \"Soorma Bhopali\" and the \"Jailor\".\n\nVisual effects - Technologies have evolved in 25 years, but the brilliance of Anil Mehta in Lagaan is still only comparable to what we saw in Sholay. Songs and dances - Lagaan scores with its songs, though R D Burman could undo all the brilliance of A R Rahman with one Mehbooba.\n\nBackground music - It would be hard to tell the two apart in how well they served the movie.\n\nClimax - Sholay wins, for the stark and different end - and this is one weakness for Lagaan to be a little more cliched, heroic, and melodramatic. Yet, the climax of Lagaan has its moments and tries to be different in its own way. How often has a cricket match formed a climax (without getting so farcical as Chamatkar, Maalamaal, and the Dev Anand fiasco which incidentally again had Aamir Khan at the crease)?\n\nSo - for those who still believe that Sholay is the best entertainer Hindi cinema has seen till date, here is reason to rejoice that Lagaan is comparable if not better."

        "review_detailed_main": "it could have been shorter. It didn't seem like 4 hours but the film did drag in places.\n\nI haven't seen many Indian films in my life and know nothing about cricket so the film was hard to follow at times. (I think a short run down on how cricket is played would have helped) Still, I figured it out.\n\nThe movie itself is very interesting--name all the Indian films that takes place in 1893, is about a cricket match between Indians and the British AND is a musical AND is 4 hours long! Purportedly this type of film is not unusual in India but here in America. Still I did like it.\n\nThe dialogue (actually subtitles) read very well, the setting is (in a way) quite beautiful and the film is very colorful.\n\nOn the down side: The acting is (with two exceptions) pretty poor--people either overact (the Indians) or underact (the British). Only Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley give out good performances. He's great as the lead--handsome, hunky and full of charisma. Good singer and dancer too. Shelley has a role that could have been a disaster--she's a kind British woman who teaches the Indians to play cricket and (understandably) falls in love with Khan. It's an old stereotype, but she manages to rise above it. The songs are not that good--there are only 6 and only the first one and an unintentionally hysterical love song in the middle are fun. The others bring the film to a screeching halt and go on forever. The 4 bad songs annoyed me and the climatic cricket match goes on forever.\n\nStill, I recommend this highly. I saw it in a theatre but on video or DVD you can just fast forward through the bad songs and slow spots. When this film is doing well, it's just great. Worth seeing--perfect family viewing (if you have a kid who will sit through a 4 hour subtitled film)."

I started watching when Bhuvan and Tipu are trying to hit the ball in the middle of the village, it seemed interesting to me since I believed the guy playing Bhuvan seemed familiar, I obviously realize now that I hadn't seen him before in my life since this is the first Indian movie I watch.\n\nBut still, there was something in the atmosphere of the movie that caught me, it seemed different to anything I've seen, perhaps it was the way they kept both languages and intersected them in various ways. The story is outstanding, and even though the dialogues seemed strange for me at times I think it might of been the way it was translated, the musical moments take a while to get used to but after you get past the new sound and get familiar with it you'll find it has great rhythm, I think anyone would get provoked to either sing or dance. There isn't a boring moment in this movie, it keeps you focused on the screen since you don't want to miss what they say!, the language is beautiful as well. Perhaps the songs get a bit long but those are the only times you're allowed to look away.\n\nOverall it's a good movie to watch if you want to learn about the culture, and even if you want to kill some time, it's definitely not a waste. And I promise you wont notice how long it is!"

And often for no reason. This is another one of those.\n\nI appreciate the idea of having a film made by Indians about the Indian resistance to British rule. There is certainly more to that story than simply \"Gandhi\". But the Bollywood way of telling these stories just ruins them. Would people fighting against their oppression really burst into song at random times? No."

Good acting from Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh and all the rest of the cast. Good storyline - not the usual emotional rambling of star-crossed lovers or try too hard to be like Hollywood like many Indian films. Though the love story is still there, it does not interfere with the narrative. Good song and dance sequence, they kept it real - there was only one very short piece where a lover was imagining. It makes stiff and formal English culture look very drab in contrast to the flamboyant song and dance sequences, no offense to any English who happen to be reading this. Not one minute of the almost 4 hours was wasted, I have to hand it to Aamir and also Ashutush Gowarikar, good work guys."

And oh, the ending is so predictable, the movie, however is partly saved by the various unknown actors' and actresses' decent performance.\n\nTo top it all, this movie has innumerable songs which just test the viewer's patience. The makers should know that the international commercial audience shall NEVER accept the mindless song and dance routine that the Indian Cinema is infamous for. The direction, though a notch up from the usual Indian stuff is nevertheless bland and uninspiring.\n\nBasically, a wannabe hollywood type sport movie set in the colonial era.

(Watching DEVDAS a few weeks earlier helped too !!!) Bollywood produces wonderful films, and LAGAAN is a true ambassador.\n\nAll right, it's long, but who cares, it's pure entertainment every minute every second ! Yes, they sing (occasionally), but if you like WEST SIDE STORY, HAIR, THE KING AND I, GREASE, Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR, etcetera-etcetera this film will appeal to you. If you don't, but like to undergo different cultures, well, there isn't too much singing here, the panoramas are breathtaking, India, certainly in 1877, is thrilling...\n\nBollywood got his clich\u00e9s, its typical framework, but with all due respect, doesn't the western film do also ? I mean, every thriller, whodunit, western, Hollywood comedy follows strict rules... And so does every SPORTS-thriller. Costner, Snipes, Redford... Eat your heart out ! Here we have a story that can challenge the wonderful 'Bang The Drum Slowly'. Honest ! Well acted, strong historic references, thrilling sets and costumes...\n\nThis film is a joy to watch, full off exciting backdrops, some very thrilling acting-performances (watch Miss Rachel Shelley !!!), a story that goes straight to the heart... Honestly, LAGAAAN is a marvel.\n\nGive Bollywood a chance. Right now ! So you can say you knew it right before it starts grossing in international trophies.\n\nBecause it will... Honest...\n\nPS: How to find your way through all these 1000's of Bollywood titles ? The usual sellers have discovered Bollywood and charge you outrages prices for the DVD's, without giving any info or guidance. Go to eBay, there are sellers with the same titles from the same manufacturers, but with normal prices AND a lot of know-how on the subject ! My advice to all of you, go the the store H2Bcom on eBay. You will feel like Dante guided by Virgil...\n\nEnjoy Bollywood !!!!"

It just isn't realistic and believable enough despite the great production values. It seems that none of the characters had a shred of self respect, the way they portrayed themselves. However, there are plenty of other plus points to make this movie highly watchable for a non Indian.

Well thanks for the concerns, but it is unfortunate to see how strong stereotypes can be an influence on someone's opinions- the typical Indian picture filled with untouchables, beggars and so on... BTW, what u expect from a country of billion people which was under foreign rule for centuries and getting a chance to stand on its feet only now? if i saw it right, your point is that unless India eradicate every single social issue, we are not allowed to have any entertainment. well, in that case, which country has the right to entertain themselves? yours? really?\n\nAs for lagaan, boo all you want, its still fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would rate this movie 5.5/10. Well to start with, I should be impartial if I want to give marks. In some aspects the movie was good (photography, camera work, actors roles etc.) but in others this was a disappointing movie. Same old Bollywood style with length that bored me a lot (3.5 hrs!!) and scores of songs. Traditionally, these songs never come out from the actors or actresses voices, all dubbed!! The movie that won an Oscar that year (No Man's Land) was really a must-watch, even Amelie (the contender for that year's Oscar) was brilliant in terms of conception and ingenuinity. One does not have to spend a million bucks to carry a movie to human hearts and the sole example was No Man's Land. Lagaan, truly speaking, doesn't even etch by the Oscar winner or even Amelie, I feel it was lucky to be drawn in the final six as a nominee. And speaking about the Indian Oscar nominations; I was pretty surprised that instead of choosing Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, the Indian government chose another scrap a year later, the result: Indian movie never got past. Even they could have selected Mira Nair's \"Monsoon Wedding\", a wonderful movie, much better than Lagaan.\n\nThere should not be any false sentimental feelings that Lagaan missed the Oscar by whisker, in fact in terms of cinematic standards, it stands no where near the past winners, e.g. Cinema Paradiso, Il Postino, Life is Beautiful, The Seven Samurai etc etc. Am I true? You may differ, you have every right to, but the fact is Bollywood has three versions of movies, the most boring and dilapidated love and romantic movies, or the gangster movies or the age old police-thief-politician story. One wonders when the time will come for the age old Bollywood directors to present the truth and the real. And I am pretty sure they will never send Bavhum for Oscar, instead send movies like Jeans or Devdas...much of the similie of Indian politics here too!! My real query is if India really boasts of being a secular, democratic and multi-lingual country (this is the only country which boasts of having more than 33 different languages, besides the Hindi), then why not send the regional movies which are miles ahead in terms of direction, art, cinematography and story? If there is a rule of sending only the Hindi movies for Oscar, then why falsify and overstate the word, \"multilingual country\"??? India would have won a film Oscar years ago if they had chosen to send movies of the regional languages (especially from Bengal, Tamilnadu and Kerala)."

        "review_detailed_main": "With no doubt, Lagaan is an excellent film. High on entertainment, morals, production values, and emotions.\n\nFor most part, those that criticize Lagaan are either those that try to put themselves forward as being more intelligent than the masses, or those that didn't get the true message of the film.\n\nLagaan is a movie about many things; not just about Cricket. Lagaan is a movie about a war without bloodshed. Lagaan is a movie about the triumph of human spirit. Lagaan is a movie about unity in gender, religion, race, and class.\n\nThe movie is not just about a cricket match. India won its independence through non-violence, and that concept is mirrored here in the way that Champaner liberates itself from the British occupation. War doesn't have to be fought with guns; here it is fought with bats and balls.\n\nHuman spirit is what triumphs against all odds in Lagaan and it is shown in a realistic manner. The British were overconfident about their victory and only lightly practiced; that too half-heartedly. Meanwhile, the villagers spent three months of intensive training, day by day. For those three months, cricket was their life; it is what would determine their future. And the moment the final shot of this war is delivered, the triumph overcomes the viewer, and the viewer is filled with absolute joy. Why? Because they too see how human spirit has triumphed against all odds.\n\nSome may complain that Lagaan shows the British in absolute negative light. This, however, is most definitely not true. As previously stated, Lagaan is a film about unity. First and foremost, the British in this film are British Imperialists. Saying that Lagaan is anti-British is like saying that \"Schindler's List\" is anti-German. Additionally, we see how not all the British go along with this plan. Captain Russel's sister feels that this is unfair, as do many of Russel's senior officers. And, it very well is true that many of the British Imperialists at the time were that antagonizing. Additionally, the theme of unity is brought forward throughout the film, mainly during the building of the team. We see women, such as Gauri and Elizabeth, play an important role in the team's victory. We see men of all religions (Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) working together towards victory. When Kachra, the untouchable, is brought forward into the team, what we see is not an unrealistic speech; we see a social message.\n\nMost throughout the world view India as a land of absolute destitution, without learning about its rich heritage or culture, or what India is capable of. Even when India proves its worth, criticism is brought about (such as the case with nuclear testing). Lagaan proves to the world that India is not as they think it really is. While films like \"Salaam Bombay!\" are truly excellent, they only feed this general and negative perception of India.\n\nVery well, Lagaan is worth a chance by anyone, no matter where they're from. Lagaan has been appreciated by foreigners throughout the world, and nothing can move it away from that. -Rishi J"

The British villain is the one cardboard character in the movie, but it's clear from the start that he's only meant to be a foil for the hero and his friends.

The suspense of that final hour is wonderfully, almost intolerably suspenseful.\n\nBeautifully crafted, this is Bollywood at its best."

        "review_detailed_main": "LAGAAN- the last word for determination and passion. Like me those who have watched this movie know that it's not exaggerating to say so. To describe the movie in one line it's simply a fight of poor villagers of champaran against the freakish nature of the British officials.\n\nThe movie starts with detailing of each and every thing i.e. the actors, the situation, makeup etc. all the characters are so real that many of us can identify someone or the other with the characters. The story tells us about a poor village Champaren, where there is no rain since last few years. The villagers are unable to pay tax but the Britisher imposes double 'lagaan' on them. In the meantime, a piece of cloud is seen and the villagers rejoices with \"Ghanan Ghanan ghana ghir aye badra......\". But unlucky villagers the cloud flies away and then came the news of \"diguna lagaan\". They decided to go and pray to their king to look into the matter and first time sees the British \"gillidanda\", which was in real means nothing but the game of Cricket. Captain Russell challenge them and puts a condition that if they beat them in the game of cricket then they won't have to pay tax for three years otherwise the burden of triple tax would be forcefully imposed on them. Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) accepts the challenge but initially his friends did not support him. Gauri (Gracy Singh) supports Bhuvan and gradually support came from the other villagers. Elizabeth, sister of Captain Russell doesn't support her brother as she feels that its injustice to the poor villagers. She helps the villager to learn cricket.\n\nThe D-day comes and the play starts. During the play, the cinema hall turns out to be Eden Gardens. With each and every ball it seems that its the Indian eleven playing and every moment you find yourself praying to God to help them. I would not mention the result, as the film really deserves the visit of each and every movie lover. All the actors were very good. The British actors especially Russell and Elizabeth were too good and the way they spoke in Hindi was also very charming, and very close to reality.\n\nI don't know much about the technical aspect of films but had heard about sink sound and really don't find any problem in hearing any dialogue. The songs by A.R.Rahman were really majestic.' O re chori...' seems to be great specially the mixing of Hindi with English. Other songs are also too good. Nowadays Indian viewers are very much habituated with the locations of European countries. In this film we find that the shots are taken in the particular village only. One has to admit that the picturisations were really good. Lastly to end this writing I must say that watching such movies are must because if you don't watch it you are really missing something."

This story of the Indian people's resistance to colonialism (in the form of a cricket game) goes over the top in just about every way. As is often the case in Hindi films, the characters break out into song at one point. I also noticed that the Indians call the English \"ferengi\" (like on \"Star Trek\"); I think that the word might mean \"foreigner\" in Hindi.\n\nOverall, this is a fine piece of work from the subcontinent, and I certainly recommend it. I haven't seen enough Indian movies to determine if this is among the greatest, but it definitely makes one appreciate the work coming from Bollywood. Starring Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne."

And musical numbers every now and then. But it works, it works, it works. Sometimes you can smile at the naive approach or rough editing, but I bet you won't be bored by sitting for 4 hours thru' this story. It has the same appeal films used to have on us when we were kids. And if it is Disney, is first class Disney."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has its flaws, but any movie that can make a three-day cricket match suspenseful and riveting deserves a standing ovation in my book.\n\nLagaan is lots of fun for those used to Hollywood movies. The variations from Hollywood norms range from small (but amusing) to major (but refreshing). No Hollywood movie would feature an adult male romantic lead whose primary criterion for a wife is that she be liked by his mother. And no modern Hollywood movie would take four hours to tell this story - four hours that are fun and entertaining, and that pass surprisingly quickly.\n\nYes, this movie has flaws. Many of the characters are stereotypes or caricatures rather than people; this is particularly true of the British officers and the supporting villagers. The subtitling, so crucial in a film that uses two languages, isn't always perfect on the DVD. The rules of cricket aren't made particularly clear, so non-cricketers have to make some intelligent guesses to understand early dramatic sequences. And some of the romantic sequences (mercifully brief) made me cringe.\n\nHowever, the novelty of the movie makes it well worth watching. The songs and dance routines are particularly appealing; they retain Indian character, but are accessible and enjoyable to Western ears. And the composition, pacing, and cinematography are unusual, hence refreshing to people who are used to standard Hollywood fare.\n\nAll in all, this movie is ideal for anyone who likes musicals, modern fables, sporting films, or just light-hearted, excellent cinematic entertainment."

It was late and I needed my sleep, but my daughter and I decided to at least start the film. What a delight it turned out to be!!! In fact, even though it was long past bedtime, we watched the whole thing.\n\nLagaan deals with a late 19th century Indian village under the dominance of British rule, more specifically under the thumb of a sadistic British officer. In the second year of a drought, the farmers are faced not only with not having enough food for themselves, but having to suffer through double taxes (lagaan) owed to the British. Their only hope for relief comes in the way of a bet based on a cricket match, a game in which they are fundamentally ignorant.\n\nDespite the film's length, it never drags. Instead, it beautifully examines the will, character, and courage of the villagers in the face of hardship. Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie that is at all a downer. It is highly entertaining and fills the screen with wonderful colors and sound. It is also a film that seems highly predictable, one that you feel you know the eventual outcome of after the first ten minutes, or do you??? I will say that my daughter and I were startled several times during the course of the film.\n\nMy recommendation: See this film and allow yourself to be swept up in its wonder."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lagaan. It's not everyday affair when something like Lagaan happens. When Bollywood entered the new millennium, it was still craving for a turning point which takes Bollywood to international stage. Ashutosh Gowariker came with an idea which defies Bollywood norms by leaps and bounds, Aamir Khan is hooked by the idea as an actor and takes the risky decision of producing the movie on its own so that idea gets the much deserved heart felt treatment and what happened later is a history now. Lagaan year after year is considered the Bollywood's bravest effort of the new millennium.\n\nIn its unbelievable plot where our hero a villager played by Mr. perfectionist Aamir Khan accepts the challenge of egoist British Commander Officer to play a cricket match in which if village wins, they need not to pay taxes for next three years. Even with a run time of 3 hours and 40 minutes, movie never gets out of steam, in fact gets better with every passing moment. An array of colorful characters played by credible actors, the mesmerizing music and back ground score of maestro A.R.Rahman, soulful lyrics of Javed Akhtar, a water tight screenplay with not a single out of the place scene and the genuine feeling of honesty and simplicity, all these factors make Lagaan an outstanding movie of modern times. First half is a smooth journey of introducing characters, the challenge, the team making and the match preparation. Second half is a like watching a nail biting cricket match. The movie is a perfect example that with full commitment and hard work, Bollywood can create the international level cinema with ease.\n\nLagaan turned out to be an inspiration for audience and its makes alike. After Lagaan, Aamir Khan appeared into Taare Zameen Par, Rang De Basanti and 3 Idiots. Ashutosh made Swades and Jodhaa Akbar. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Lagaan. It's a sin for any movies fan to miss Lagaan."

I also liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline. The direction which made by Ashutosh Gowariker was magnificent and equally good was the music and dancing. About the interpretations I have to mention the interpretation of Aamir Khan who played as Bhuvan and he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Paul Blackthorne's who played as Captain Andrew Russell and of course the beautiful's Rachel Shelley's who played as Elizabeth Russell.\n\nFinally I have to say that \"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India\" is a very interesting movie to watch because it shows what happened to India in the Victorian times. What difficulties Indian people got through and how were their lives back then. Musical movies are different than the classic movies but I believe that this movie is not just a musical movie because it teaches us many things about India and its culture."

        "review_detailed_main": "My whole family loved this movie--11 and 17 year old sons, myself and my husband. It's a 19th century fable, the story of how a scraggly bunch of peasants--including a cripple, a mute, a chicken farmer, and a crazy holy man--unite to defend their village against the British. It also gives a glimpse of how all Indians--from rajas to Muslims to untouchables--even English women--lived under the boot of Anglo power. But the movie doesn't preach; it entertains and moves the viewer. It is visually varied and colorful, with glimpses of scenic countryside, village huts, and palaces. And the musical part of the movie is well- balanced with the drama, full of lively rhythms, singing, and great dancing. Our real reason, however, for loving this movie is that it is truly a quintessential underdogs-unite and-fight-back kind of story which anyone with a heart will love."

Every character out of the over twenty main characters from both the local and 'visitors' team is wonderfully developed and seamless integrated in this simple yet eternal tale on bravery and honor, in which thrill builds up as the match goes ahead.\n\nThe simple embedded love story works as a join between two worlds, two cultures, which actually never meet in a direct clash. A beautifully crafted movie to enjoy for both western and eastern audiences, where cricket is just a wonderful alibi."

LAGAAN is made with such bravura, energy, dedication, artistry and professionalism that one can only but become enthralled by its energy, humor, lightness, and beauty.\n\nSee it at the theatre.

This film SHOULD've shown India the way to good cinema, yet they still go with the scantily clad westernized Indian girls, who are not westernized enough in my opinion. Lagaan should've won the Oscar for best Foreign film or whatever it was. I'm also not a fan of Indian Music, but this isn't your typical Indian Soundtrack. India could also learn from this. Aamir Khan takes the cake, as always. Simply a great, great performance. This move is what led to all the hype with 1847: The Rising. Which I also cannot wait for. Now back to the Cricket. I honestly think Cricket is the worst sport ever, besides Baseball. (Just My Opinion, sorry to everyone.) But this film makes me want to see more of the Cricket match. After the movie is only when I realized I'd just watched a cricket match. And it wasn't a full cricket match. To everyone who hasn't seen this... Please watch it."

Of course , to make things realistic , they DID get trained in the finer skills of the game by an English woman !\n\nThe story starts off with the English guys being cruel enough to levy some unbelievable taxes on the poor villagers. The they turn sadistic enough to challenge the poor villagers to a game of cricket , and if the villagers win , they get to TRIPLE the taxes. This is the start of absurdities ...leading to more than an hour of badly photographed cricket , and Englishwoman falling in love with one of the villagers who happens to look like a Bollywood star ( Aamir Khan ). Of course , the chocolate-faced Bollywood boy shuns her for the local village girl . This village girl , played by Gracy Singh , is the only breath of fresh air in this gigantic mess of a movie , replete with over-acting , misfit music and a totally predictable cricket match."

The storyline is paper thin with a predictable climax but its treatment is really marvellous. To sum it up its an age old saga of \"weak\" vs. \"strong\" and the weak winning in the end and so on.... Some very great direction and some very good acting make this film worth watching. The only drawback is its length are a whopping 3 hours and 40 minutes.

It's a brilliant effort to bring Cricket to the big screen in a way the world has not seen.

The other condition was in case of loss the Bhuvan's team wud required to pay dugna lagaan (twice). The movie takes us on further journey which include love, faith, deception, drama, team game, help and so on..\n\nThe essence of India and its villages is captured really well. Every character acting has been carved well. It would have been an even more delicious treat, if I would have found out if the story was real, sadly it was not.\n\nWhat is common between the movies Dangal and Lagaan? Without taking time one would answer, they both contain Aamir. I would like to put, there's one more thing. It is the knowledge of game. They are wrestling and cricket. It's a treat when knowledge is imparted, along with entertainment.\n\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: As discussed earlier, the mentioned factors capture well the essence of India. Music: Music is very good. Acting: Acting captures what is required by script from all leads.\n\nFinal Verdict: It gives you a glimpse and essence of ancient India.

Its a very bad American movie that happens to be in Hindi with some badly dubbed songs. It needs a severe case of editing, and a much better sense of pace.\n\nOnly two groups of people seem to like this movie a lot. The first group is Non-Indians who have never seen an Indian movie before and think of themselves as chic and cultured for liking this one.\n\nThe other group that loves this movie is the 'Jai Hind' crowd, who are amazed that an Indian movie was actually made with technical competence (Note comments like 'amazing production values' or 'high quality prints') AND seen by non-Indians. They are the same Indians that think that the Sixth Sense is the greatest movie ever made; not because its actually a pretty cool movie (which it definitely is) but because it was directed by an Indian and appreciated by non-Indians.\n\nIf you want to watch a trully great indian movie watch Pakeezah. You won't find it at Blockbuster, and you might need to dig a little, but it'll be worth it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Lagaan\" takes place in India, in a small village, ruled by the British, which is facing a drought due to the lack of rain because there hasn't been any monsoons. The lack of rain led to the loss of many crops. Even worse Captain Russell, a British captain, decides to raise the land tax also known as the Lagaan. This becomes even more impossible for the villagers to pay so they try to talk things out with Captain Russell. Captain Russell, knowing that the villagers have no clue about the game or Cricket, he challenges them to a game and gives them a few months to practice. If they win, they don't have to pay the Lagaan, but if they lose, they have to pay even more. Bhuvan takes up the challenge and gathers up a team. Bhuvan and his team is then aided by Elizabeth Russell, Captain Russell's sister. While all of this is going on, the movie is also a love story. Bhuvan is in love with one of the villagers named Gauri. Gauri then gets a bit jealous of the relationship between Bhuvan and Elizabeth.\n\nThe acting in \"Lagaan\" was very good. At sometimes a little over dramatic but I think that added some comedy to the film. The set design was also very good. It portrayed the drought that the villagers had to live through. Their clothing showed their religion and social class on the Caste system. I think one of the strengths of the movie was definitely the directing. Ashutosh Gowariker did a very good job in getting my attention during dramatic scenes my zooming in on the actors' and actress' faces and actions. This was great especially during the Cricket game. The addition of background music made the movie even better, adding excitement and a little suspense to the movie.\n\nI give \"Lagaan\" eight out of ten stars. I think the movie was great but just too long for me, even though I expected it to be that long because that is the average length of a Bollywood movie. Another characteristic of Bollywood movies I'm not really a big fan of was the musical numbers. Even though it went along with the movie, it still felt a little random for me because people don't usually sing and dance randomly in real life. I'm sure if you're a fan of Bollywood movies, you would like the movie more than I did and most likely gave it ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lagaan, a tale of survival, struggle, love and courage and for those of you who have heard this too often it adds a twist \u0096 a cricket match between two particularly different cultures in mind, traditions and techniques.\n\nLagaan: Once Upon a Time in India, directed by Ashutosh Gowariker and starring Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne is a movie that not only invites viewers of different cultures, as can be seen by the variety of both Indian and British actors, but also viewers of different ages. Rated PG for the lack of any sexual content and only minor violence, not only can adults and teenagers appreciate the lessons and stories of love and life, but children can enjoy the preparations to and final game of cricket. A runtime of 224 minutes encompass a wide array of genres including drama and romance, musical and sport.\n\nThis story begins and ends in the village of Champaneer, with the fate of the villagers' lives resting on a game of cricket. British occupation of India during this time brings forth the conflict the villagers face: the Lagaan, a tax the Raja must pay for British services. The villagers, who provide the Raja with crops for the tax, pray for rain but their prayers go unanswered as the Lagaan threatens hunger and despair upon the entire village. Only Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) has the courage to stand up to British official Capt. Russell (Paul Blackthorne) who offers a game of cricket in return for the repeal of the Lagaan for three years, but if the British win the Lagaan will be tripled. With tension already inflamed between the Indians and British, Bhuvan and the villagers form a family, using each individual's talents to learn a game they've never played so that they could win life. Even Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), the British sister of Capt. Russell, joins this family in hopes of helping them and finds herself in a love triangle between herself, Bhuvan and Gauri (Gracy Singh), a young Indian girl. When the day of the game comes you're left wondering whether spirits will be revived or broken for the Indian village.\n\nEven though at first I was frightened to learn the movie was about three and a half hours long, I have to say as a viewer I did not feel them. Not only is the script historically accurate and both humorous and dramatic at the right moments, the plot keeps you guessing, waiting the entire movie. An easy story to follow, the director provides just the right amount of suspense and relief to keep you going. The director I believe is a master of the camera as he uses various camera angles to get the viewers to feel what he intends, using both \"bird's-eye\" views as well as views from the ground and many more. Visually stunning, the settings and costumes were amazing from a gorgeous sunset emphasized by Gauri's sari to a dance number in the pitch black, gorgeous all the more due to the bright costumes of the women. The musicals were my favorite: stunning performances and beautiful voices but for those of you not interested in dance, the cricket game is just as intense and do not worry if you're foreign to the game: so are they. Lastly, I applaud the acting simply because they were able to get across the true elements of life: love, despair, happiness and hope."

The Movie is underrated because of its limitation to receive global Viewership. It deserved to nominate for Oscar more than most of the movies that have been nominated.\n\nThe plot is epic and the actors have played there part very well. The music by A.R Rahman and the Lyrics by Javed Akhtar is extra Ordinary. The kind of sentiments we have for cricket, Social discrimination, Love Triangle have been depicted in an fabulous way. The movie captures the heart of India and for me is the best Indian movie ever been made."

The ending is obvious from the very beginning and hence there isn't any suspense. There is some petty infighting amongst the peasants along with some modern day political correctness thrown in about the caste system but in the end everyone in the village lives happily ever after. I much prefer \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"American Desi.\""

This might be a true story as the tag line is \"Once Upon a Time in India\" I recommend that If you like cricket and understand Hindi then go and see it. A new face made her Bollwood debut in this movie\"Gracy Singh\" who was doing Indian soaps was called up to co-star with Aamir and acted excellently. Cricket is a big thing in the movie as the future of the province that they live in is decided by a cricket match between the Indian villagers with very little experience and an English team with plenty of match practise and experience."

These scenes are memorable forever for the ones who went through these harsh times in India. This film's cast from the baby face of the protagonist and the fierce look in the eyes of Paul Blackthorne. Great movie! Must see film if you're an Indian.

        "review_detailed_main": "Lagaan is film that I watched without any expectation and it absolutely blew my mind.The film revolves around three characters Bhuvan played by Aamir Khan,Gauri played by Gracy Singh and Elizabeth played by Rachel Shelley.The film's central character is Bhuvan,who is a spirited and outstanding young man who firmly stands for the rights of the villagers who are oppressed by their British dictators.Lagaan was a tax that was a compulsory payment at the time of British rule.The price of tax increased at the will of the British and people couldn't afford to pay their taxes.Village people had to starve to pay their taxes.Therefore,the young and brave Bhuvan made a deal that the British would waive the tax of villagers on the fate of cricket match.This is the main plot of the story and the rest of the parts make up the movie. The first frame of the movie explains the meaning of Lagaan and setting the tone of the 19th century in India.The first few frames of the film showed the beautiful Indian villages in the late 19th century and immediately setting the tone for the audience to pull them into the ancient Indian world.The film took its time to introduce its characters to the audience to firmly understand the sentiments of the Indians during that time.The important characters who were Bhuvan and Gauri were introduced first in the opening scenes while the character of Elizabeth was introduced later on.Along with these three main characters,there were more than ten characters which had important dialogues throughout the film. The first positive that I noticed from the beginning is the lush cinematography of the film.The man behind the camera deserves all my salutes for really raising the bars in the level of making films.The camera angles in the day time and the aerial shots of the village were excellent.The use of color and the tone of cinematography really brought me back to that time zone.The second positive was the art design the of the film.The art director deserves all credits for creating sets that looked and felt real.The sets of the villages and the palaces were really beautiful and made me feel that I was in that period.Coming the curtain raiser,the performances of the cast.The life of the this film,actor and producer Aamir Khan.Aamir Khan absolutely lived his character as Bhuvan throughout this film.He has outclassed himself in this film.The film showcased his full acting potential and great credit has to go to the director for pulling this off.His eyes in this film were razor sharp absolutely piercing through the lenses directly into the hearts of the audience.The dialogue delivery by him was simply hard hitting an sitting in the hearts of those watching.Hats off.The other actors Gracy and Rachel did an outstanding job in portraying the characters.Other smaller characters really made a standout performance throughout the film as well.The people in the village and the British actors completely gave life to and done justice to the roles given by the director.They acted their hearts out. A.R Rahman the two time Academy award winner in 2008,yet again proved why the Oscar's needed him in 2002 itself.The background score of this film was absolutely a bliss to hear and in a class on its own.This was one of the very few Indian films where I enjoyed every single song because of its inspiring and spirit lifting lyrics,my personal favorite in \"Mitwa\".Some songs made me laugh and some made me cry.The only reason has to be the hearty composition of a man who had his full dedication,hats off for this gem. Finally,a man who I really needed to salute,director Ashutosh Gowariker.He has revolutionized Indian cinema with his creation.It was no surprise that this is the only Indian movie till date that has been nominated in an Academy award and a deserving special mention in that award.It might not have won the award,but it certainly won everybody's hearts and the person to stand behind is Ashutosh Gowariker.Hats off to you. Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians.This is one the very few movies that I can call a masterpiece just because of its magnanimous spirit lifting story line.Lagaan is a film that teaches Indian films where I enjoyed every single song because of its inspiring and spirit lifting lyrics,my personal favorite is \"Mitwa\".Some songs made me laugh and some made me cry.The only reason has to be the hearty composition of a man who had his full dedication,hats off for this gem.

He didnt tried to be a hero at any point and thats the reason by the end of the movie you will have the impressions of more than five characters in the film. Considering him being a star hero by then itself, letting the story and other characters of the film breath is awesome. The english girl was awesome, gracie acter pretty well. Ar rahman as usually lived upto his standards. No wonder that this got selected for academy awards. This will stay in top 10 in the list of top 100 indian movies list.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the best from Ashutosh Gowariker. It is though 3 and 1/2 hours long. But is strong in showing three aspects. Indian rural life, the cricket sport and a historical love story in between them. The characters are gripping and true to both british and rural indian. These three subplots are well maintained in the movie, gradually and serially opening each chapters to progress. It may seem a Fantasy, ie a cricket game being a reedeming point from the brutal British but is still logically covered in the climax where it is said 'Lost in time'. The songs are soulful, beautifully fused Indian and western scores. 'O re chori' is my personal favorite. The story is unique and praiseworthy, how a group of Indian farmers taught British a good lesson, through the game of cricket. Really oscar deserving for it's technicals, well narratives with slow pace. It is agreeable that it is one of IMDb top 250s, a justified rating too of 8+\n\nThe movie shows the story in the historical background of 1893. India in 1893 is shown as real as it could get and the performers also resonated well with the scenario. This includes the set designs of both Indians and British, the costumes, the character traits etc. The cricket match avoids unnecessary scenes of just bating- bowling, each scenes has possible connection with the progress. The film depicts the spirit of teamwork, struggle, betrayal, success, self belief, relationship all mixed into an interesting game of cricket. These things has the potential to hold you throughout the film, well resonates with the real life experience. In depth sense, it's not about Indians vs British, its just a cover story to hide the reality. The real issue is between unity vs ego, represented respetively by Bhuban vs Capt. Russell. It is a recommended film for entertainment and equally for some real life character study also for some message learning themes. All 3 in one. A true masterpiece from Ashutosh Sir.\n\nAamir convincingly did his part as a protagony. All casts are solidly chosen , those of western siblings too inluding Big B Voice, which convinces with husky narrations, a may-be fiction event as believable event in history. Ashutosh Gowariker thought uniquely, worked hard to bring out life of 1893s India, perfected his directoial debut through this masterpiece. The length seem a little long but is utilized well in portraying as many things to go in details of the plot.\n\nSumming up it will never bore you in it's long length of experience, through its long list of subplots all connected logically with one another. Truly oscar worthy and it is definitely one of the best movies Bollywood ever made. A 99/100."

The nearly four-hour running time hardly ever lags -- whenever a scene begins to get slow, a huge song-and-dance number is just around the corner. The musical numbers are all incredibly complex, with stunning choreography and vibrant, dramatic vocals. You don't have to speak Hindi or even read the subtitles to want to laugh, dance or cry. There are many Bollywood movies that make it hard to sit through the first hour due to poor acting and sappy content. Lagaan, from the opening voice-over to the final moment of the big cricket match, simply makes you very, very happy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The idea of sitting through a 3 3/4-hour film about a cricket match didn't appeal to me until I read the reviews for this 2001 Indian extravaganza set in rural 1893 British colonial-ruled India. It's really the only home-grown Bollywood film I've ever seen if you don't count Gurinder Chadha's disappointing multi-cultural Jane Austen adaptation, 2004's \"Bride and Prejudice\". The film's title, \"Lagaan\", refers to the annual crop tax charged by the British army to the provincial Rajah, who in turn, must collect the lagaan from the local villagers.\n\nThe plot begins with a drought which has hit the village making it near-impossible for them to pay the lagaan. The cruel, capricious Captain Russell is indifferent to the fate of the villagers and decides to charge double-lagaan. The villagers plead with the Rajah to cancel this year's lagaan in deference to the drought, so the captain proposes a challenge that will either wipe out the lagaan for the next three years or force the villagers to pay triple-lagaan at once. The challenge takes the form of a cricket match between the local British command and a ragtag team of villagers organized and led by a renegade villager, the hot-tempered Bhuvan.\n\nThe middle of the film focuses on two plot strands - the local team's haphazard preparation for the match aided by Russell's sympathetic sister Elizabeth, and the romantic triangle that develops between Bhuvan, Elizabeth and Gauri, the local girl smitten since childhood with Bhuvan. Amazingly, about eighty minutes of the final portion are taken up by the cricket match itself in painstaking detail. Even if you know nothing about the rules of the game (as I don't), it is inarguably the best part of the movie. Granted there is little suspense in the outcome and cricket is not the most visual of sports, director Ashutosh Gowariker makes the extended sequence exciting in spite of itself thanks to the creative ways he develops the drama of the match.\n\nThe rest of the film is a bit more variable, especially the rather slow set-up of the story, but as a whole, the movie is enlivened by the inevitable Bollywood production numbers. Unlike \"Bride\", the numbers are not interjected as pure kitsch but feed more organically into the plot. What also helps is A.R. Rahman's atmospheric music. One should understand from the outset that this is not a movie of great emotional complexity or dramatic subtlety. Almost every aspect of the film is very in-your-face, and for the most part, the acting reflects such a tone. However, the disparate elements somehow hold together, and Gowariker manages the even rarer feat of making the nearly four-hour running time fly by.\n\nAamir Khan is a charismatic presence as Bhuvan, and Gracy Singh is certainly pleasing enough as Gauri. Whether forcing the Rajah to eat meat or beating down a villager, Russell is played with such moustache-twirling excess by Paul Blackthorne that his unrepentant villainy becomes laughable along the lines of Snidely Whiplash. Rachel Shelley, bearing a certain resemblance to Courtney Cox, fares better as Elizabeth, though her character seems frustratingly passive despite her bold efforts to help the villagers. Suhasini Mulay lends dignity to her role as Bhuvan's mother, as does Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Rajah.\n\nEach of the Indian players makes individual impressions, the most affecting being the crippled untouchable Kachra (played poignantly by Aditya Lakhia), at first rejected and then embraced because his palsied arm provides an unhittable corkscrew throw. Special mention should be given to Anil Mehta's sun-drenched cinematography which captures the rural landscape well. The DVD includes filmographies for the principals, but of more interest is the eighteen-minute deleted scene which shows more explicitly Elizabeth's efforts to help the team and her growing infatuation with Bhuvan. Even with its predictable story and relatively shallow characters, the film bursts with such energy and historical detail that it is well worth sitting through the lengthy running time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The price of making a four hour film is that of having a much more difficult time holding the attention of your audience for its full runtime. In the case of Asutosh Gowariker's 2001 epic, Lagaan: Once Upon A Time In India, it is rare to at any point have such a thought of losing interest in the cleverly crafted Bollywood film. Gowariker pays special attention to each and every shot as if it were its own innovative painting making sure there is always an array of activity to keep one's eye active.\n\nLagaan tells the story of a poverty-stricken Hindu town that is struggling to cope with the oppression and high lagaan taxes of the British Raj. Upon the initiation of a further increase in the tax, the peasants begin to speak out begging for the tax to be lowered. In result, the British officers lend the proposition of a cruel intended-deal; a game of cricket will be held between the British officers and peasants. If the peasants succeed in victory they are exempt of any taxes for the next 3 years, if they lose, they will pay triple lagaan. This erupts into a predictable yet touching Hindu rendition of The Mighty Ducks from this point on.\n\nAlthough the story is clich\u00e9 and somewhat overdone, it remains fresh to the naked eye due to the remarkable design outside of the script itself. Aamir Khan presents a beautifully performed display as Bhuvan, the only initial peasant to stand up for his community against the British. The supporting cast accents Khan to an ideal level as well, most notably Paul Blackthorne in the dark and immoral role of Captain Russell who plays the antagonist of this film with a respectable conviction and stereotypical \"bad-guy waxed moustache.\"\n\nThis is a visual masterpiece as well composed of gorgeous sweeping shots and vivid color which never seems to fall off the deep end as too \"cartoony.\" Somewhere at about an hour into this drama, we see a musical spontaneously erupt which is covered in long shots opposed to a montage style- an interesting approach to musical numbers in film. Down to the bone, this is a very typical film portrayed in a completely innovative and well-done way; the writing is beautiful throughout as are the performance. It's painful but honest to say that this film overcomes its shallowness by being simply \"really damn entertaining.\""

Songs of these movies are euphonious. It is the music direction by A.R. Rehman-who is one of best music director all over the world. He has already been applauded with as Oscar. And the reputed singers-Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, Asha Bhosale, Sukhwinder Singh make these songs more melodious. And the lyricist- Javed Akhtar made the wonderful combination of words which made song worthwhile ever.The captain's sister plays a wonderful role. She not only sacrifice her relations with her family and British govt but also the love with the Indian superstar. Over all i loved the movie as it is."

Rehman, with poetic classical lyrics written by who else but Javed Akhtar, brings a different dimension to this movie shot in an 1893 british Indian rural setting where the villagers are challenged by the local cruel British Collector that they'd have to pay double their taxes (Lagaan).\n\nWhen approached by the local king, the collector throws a challenge - Learn our game of CRICKET and play with us. If you win, all taxes are free for the next three years. If you lose, you pay triple the amount of taxes due this year.\n\nWith a hand-picked NSD/Pune Film Institute cast, the actors and actresses (Suhashini Muley of Hu Tu Tu, my all-time favorite Raghuveer Jadav, Avneesh Misra - everyone was great) - the team did a riot on the screen. The UK born and raised Gracy Singh was Indian beauty to its core. Her acting (especially eyes, facial expressions and body language) is so authentic, you could not tell she is second generation Indian - hopes for our children? :-)\n\nThe Cinematography reminded me and Mithu of Gladiator, in fact we were wondering if the crowd-scene and team-spirit inspiration came from Gladiator.\n\nGO see it. If you are challenged in rural regional Hindi, do not worry - the film is subtitled.\n\nAn additional reward is Amitabh Bachchan's voice in the background, narrating parts of the story, very similar to Satranj ke Khilari. Vishuddha uchharaN, ninaada kanTha.\n\nRegards,\n\nShoumyo. (Tathagata)"

Now Ashutosh Gowaricker's \"Lagaan\" seems about to change all that. People are going to see his 223 minute musical drama centering on a taxation wager in the form a winner-take- or-lose-all criket game.\n\nBut how can this or any of these film products be separated from the societal conditions of the country from which they come? World tourists to India return emotionally shaken from witnessing the horrid suppression of human rights there. Eye-witnesses of \"untouchables\" without decent homes, diseased beings begging in the streets, exploited to near-slavery conditions -- all in full view and awareness of the government, church, and upper class citizenry -- point to a highly divided, confused, and unjust society.\n\nDoes one just close one's mind to all this, and buy into the fantasy world of \"Lagaan\"? Are all of these products, in effect, used to distract the peasanty and others from the actual injustices being perpetrated against them? The real-life conditions of the country suggest the need for a massive planetary revolution. Yet, here we are, blithely humming the tunes and savoring the romance of \"Lagaan.\"\n\nFor me, there's no joy in Bollywood. Not until the last vestiges of discrimination, supression, and domination are eliminated. Until then, \"Lagaan\" can well keep what it has to offer."

The movie defines perfection of movie-making spanning a feature-film length \"The Making\" and a book about it's making. The idea started in 1996, by Ashutosh Gowariker after his last movie, Baazi (an attempt at remake of \"Die Hard\"), starring Aamir himself was a flop.\n\nInitially, it was rejected by Aamir and several other actors. Aamir himself rejected it 2 times, finally agreeing to take it after several rewrites and even volunteering to produce it himself. The casting itself took almost a year. Aamir, Ashutosh and Reena had multiple trips to London to finalize the British cast.\n\nI will not delve into the shooting schedule, since a whole book has been written about it by Mr.Satyajit Bhatkal.\n\nAbout the story, it is about a group of villagers, in a village in Uttar Pradesh in 1893, who are forced to pay double land-tax, despite there being no rains in that season. When they go to have the tax cancelled, it results in a confrontation between Bhuvan and Captain Russell, resulting in a challenge from Russell to defeat his team in a cricket match to have their taxes cancelled for 3 years, if they win. If they lose, they'll have to pay triple tax.\n\nWhat follows is:- One person, Bhuvan versus the entire village (admonishing him for accepting an improbable challenge), Britishers' oppression, creating a team, ignorance of the game on part of the villagers, ignorance of big-match attitude in players, match fixers, social justice, etc. Sounds like a bad-story, but the screenplay and direction is so magnificent that you will not realize you have sat for almost 4 hours to watch this epic.\n\nAnother clinching factor of the movie is the background score and music. Very often you find Indian movies with unnecessary dance and song sequences. Here is one movie, which does not take the pace off the proceedings, but adds to it.\n\nThe dialogues, accent are perfect penned by Javed Akhtar. The art direction, choreography, supporting cast are very well in sync with each other.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is, how the scenes have been visualized by Ashutosh and Aamir. Calling direction as great, fabulous, unbelievable, excellent, etc would be an understatement. It shows the years of hard-work everyone, from Ashutosh Gowariker to Jhamu Sugandh, has put in to make this cult classic.\n\nTruly a masterpiece!!!!!!!!! Hats off to Ashutosh and Aamir for giving us such a wonderful film......."

This is the most non-Bollywood to have ever come out of India for a very long time. A film as good as this has not left the studios of Mumbai since the 1950s with \"Mother India\". The main character is played by the best actor in India right now, Aamir Khan. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, but not untalenteds. To enjoy this film, all one needs is a broad mind and a sensible idea of a good film. You don't need to know Hindi, or like cricket.

It also captures the triumph of human spirit - and shows that when mind is put over matter - anything can be achieved - in the tradition of movies like The Shawshank Redemption and Chariots of Fire. Just a piece of advice : change the subtitles - they are unintentionally hilarious like the one \"Oh my lovely lassie\" - else this is easily the best Indian movie ever - even better than Mother India or Bandit Queen."

Yes - but not on the streets - on the cricket pitch! It seems the Victorian ideal of salvation through sport is alive and well in India, and its been spun around to portray the struggle against Imperialism. Who would have thought?\n\nTo my mind, the basic plot seems fairly comical, but there is enough meat for serious film students to appreciate the picture as well. The cinematography is first rate, espically of the all important cricket match; the star Aamir Khan has a magical presence (albeit if he looks like an Asian Eminem); and the progressive content - including an untouchable in the team - is still fairly controversial for Indians.\n\nAnyone interested in Indian cinema, I would definitely recommend this film. It's convinced one very sceptical cinema goer!"

The usual Indian penchant for injecting songs and dances throughout is here done judiciously well and in keeping with the ongoing action so that it joyously moves the story along with a great deal of spirit rather than evoking a wince. My only criticism is that the film needed a few more European or American extras because it was obvious that Indians were pretending to be British in the British scenes. Altogether a joyously infectious, spirited romp. Even the inordinate length was not a problem and seemed to fly by, building to a nice tense climax as the poor Indian team tries so hard to triumph. With all the charisma and energy of Aamir Khan as their handsome young captain, how could they possibly lose?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Undeniably the most important movie to come out of the world's largest film industry (Bollywood) in decades, Lagaan rewrites Indian cinema history. At the cost of sounding repetitive and borrowing from Pritish Nandy's review of the same movie in Mid-day (June 20, 2001), \"Our cinema history will now have two eras...Before-Lagaan and post-Lagaan.\"\n\nA running time of over 3 hours and 45 minutes, a period drama set in rustic Gujarat of the 19th century, a largely unknown (at least hitherto not so popular) cast, an ordinary looking debutante leading lady, a two-flop director, no mushy romance, no sex, no violence, a leading star who appears in dhoti.....a sure-fire recipe for disaster? Think again. A sure-fire hit, a stunning spectacle of the triumph of the human spirit, and just about the finest statement made on behalf of Indian cinema...that's Lagaan for you.\n\nSome emotions are very basic. They cut across cultures, time zones and generations. Lagaan evokes those emotions. It touches and activates those basic nerve circuits that send an electric shudder of exhilaration through your body, that rush of blood in to your heart, those goose pimples on your skin. It makes you stand up and applaud, because it stands for everything that an Indian is proud of. In fact it stands for everything that civilization stands for. I always wondered if any movie churned out by Bollywood would truly capture the soul of India. I was disappointed for years, because despite the great movies (oh yeah there are too many Indian movie gems) India produced, there was hardly any movie that embodied the Indian spirit completely. I was also disappointed because the only movie that came close to capturing what India was all about, was Ricahrd Attenborough's Gandhi. A film made by a Britisher, that came tantalizingly close to symbolizing the Indian-ness that I was so proud of. Circa 2001, all that changed. Lagaan changed it all. It made sure I have something to cheer about.\n\nI watched Lagaan for the first time in Bombay's Eros cinema, in it's first week of theatrical release. When I saw ecstatic viewers run up in the aisles towards the screen, dancing and clapping, I felt the same thrill. I felt it then and there. This was a completely new style of cinematic Indian patriotism. Understated, yet strong. Stylistic, yet simple. Multi-layered, yet basic. For giving us this immense, unadulterated pleasure, Aamir and team take a bow! Lagaan is a glorious invitation to the world, to come see India, it's spirit, it's people."

The one thing that keeps them going is their strength of character, personified as Bhuwan.\n\nThis was the movie where Aamir Khan ceased to be viewed as Aamir the actor, but as Bhuwan the patriot. His role in the movie, as well as the efforts he put in for promoting the film abroad, earned him a lot of respect. He extended the spirit of the movie and his character beyond the boundaries of Lagaan. It was far more that what anyone else from Indian cinema has ever done before.\n\nA must watch."

The way this movie has been made and the way this movie deals with several key issue is amazing. I mean how many times you have seen an indian movie dealing with the issue of tax on farmers probably never. A lot has been said about the movie so i guess i don't have to write the whole story but I will point out the strong points of the movie. 1) A very simple and unique story dealt with amazing direction. 2) All the characters in the movie with amazing performance. 3) An amazing soundatrack and background music. 4) Amazing art diection. 5) Great narration by the bollywood legend Amitabh Bachan. These are some of the storng point about the movie. I have many friends who never go for indian movies but I insisted them to go woth me a watch this paticular movie and they rate this movie as one of the top ten movie including Hollwyood movies. I guess if you don't see indian movies this movie is the best movie to start with."

This movie should be used as a source of inspiration by people to avoid the communal fights which have plagued our societies.\n\nI have read many reviews of this movie and amazingly I found a consensus among all \"critics\" that this movie has set a new standard for the next generation of Indian movies. One \"critic\" even stated that after the release of this movie, the movies produced by Indian cinema will be known as Pre-Lagaan and Post-Lagaan. The cast and crew of Lagaan definitely deserve all the congratulations and recognition for a job par excellence. Amitabh Bachchan, an icon of Indian cinema, sums it concisely in his article \"Big B is all praise for little Aamir\", when he says \"I found Lagaan flawless\"."

Another good point about the songs was they were all filmed in rural India and didn't unnecessarily pan-off to the Swiss Alps or London tourist attractions !\n\nThe story was simple and attractive, it didn't exaggerate the situation or capacity of the characters.

        "review_title": "Some additional thoughts about a wonderful film",
        "review_detailed_main": "I think that a film like Lagaan, while good cinema in general, is also a particularly successful realization set of ideas that differentiates Indian commercial cinema from films made elsewhere in the world, and that some understanding of this background makes it and other films like it more accessible to an audience used to the conventions of Western film-making.\n\nIn my opinion, commercial Indian cinema (whether Hindi, Tamil, Bengali ..) derives its basic aesthetic parameters from the 'navarasa' theory governing the conception of the performing arts in ancient India, most famously delineated in the Natyashastra, the treatise on classical dance. In classical Sanskrit drama, there is no differentiation into comedy, tragedy, etc. Instead, the purpose of art is to achieve the right mixture between the nine principal 'rasas' (literally: juices) - e.g. love, fear, the grotesque, pity, anger, the erotic, and a few more. Performing art is said to have succeeded if the right balance is achieved, in which case the viewer should find himself/herself in a state of 'ananda' (roughly 'bliss'). (Okay, I know this is dangerously reductive, but you get the general idea). The parallel with the idea behind calling Hindi commercial films 'masala' films is obvious, but whereas that term is usually used derogatorily, I think there is a real, powerful idea behind its notion of spices being blended together to achieve the right balance of tastes.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting that all commercial Hindi films either consciously try to do this, or indeed that those (if any) that do often succeed. But the historical and cultural justification in the use of comedy, tragedy, heroism, villainy, etc. in the space of a few reels, as typical of Hindi films, derives in my opinion precisely from this. Add to this the absence in the Indian traditional performing arts of boundaries separating dance, music, and acting, so that one artistic form is often an integral part of another, and you have a clearer idea of why Hindi films are what they are. Of course, often this reduces to a 'formula' for mindless inanity and clich\u00e9s, but when a film or a play successfully grapples with the complex notion above, the result can be a very satisfying kind of film, which I think Lagaan - very much in the tradition of early Raj Kapoor films (Awaara, Shree 420) , and of films such as Sholay, Ganga Jamuna or Mother India - is.\n\nIn fact, Lagaan struck me as one of the most perfect examples of the navarasa idea put into practice that I have seen recently. (Ironically, the last film I felt this about was Life Is Beautiful, which of course wasn't Indian at all, but I think it succeeded in striking precisely the right emotional balance, leading in the end to a cathartic experience for the viewer). In presenting a diverse, well-etched out cast of characters, Lagaan manages to evoke a series of different but related emotional responses from the viewer, which does in the end lead to precisely the sort of contentment that the ancients envisaged. It makes it all come together magnificently - I think a lot of Indian filmmakers try this, but it's very difficult to keep the balance and so few succeed. Lagaan, however, manages to pull it off - high drama is tempered with down-to-earth humour (and such humour; its sheer earthiness is a triumph); potential tragedy gives way to romance - but at all times, the balance is maintained so that each episode furthers the narrative and ensures that the viewer is drawn into the lives of the characters (whose very diversity and real-ness is exemplary - very soon, you actually care about these ordinary but highly individual folk and their lives), their concerns, motivations and the constraints governing their lives, but is never bored, and one's interest in the (admittedly predictable) eventual denouement never flags.\n\nWhere Lagaan also works magnificently is as an allegory for the struggle for independence from British rule. It's foolish to take the film literally, as some disenchanted viewers have done. Of course the fate of the Empire wasn't decided on the whims of capricious commanding officers and cricket matches. Rather, Lagaan is best viewed as a symbolic representation of how people from different backgrounds, castes and communities came together to fight for India's independence, a message it gets across with considerable subtlety but also pretty effectively.\n\nOf course, another level at which it operates is a pretty clever comment on the role of race and racism in the world of cricket, which has been an issue from the first years when Indians started playing cricket for the British and is one even today (to wit the current power struggles within the cricketing establishment). Lagaan lays a stake to the game on behalf of the Subcontinent, but doesn't unnecessarily demonize the British in the process. It's also a very amusing introduction to the game for the uninitiated, while being a catalogue of the main issues in cricket's history for the more seasoned. Brilliant!\n\nThirdly, Lagaan is notable for a return to the original idea behind songs and dances in Indian cinema: to move the story forward, to allow the 'unsayable' (whether thoughts or dreams) to be expressed in music. This too it does most elegantly, with Rehman's beautiful score, which is simultaneously modern and folksy. This is something Indian films used to excel in, but over the years the songs have become gratuitous (of course they can still be fun, but it helps if they fulfil this role too). Lagaan thankfully reverses this trend.\n\nFinally - I can't agree more with the person who said that Lagaan is quite different from Ray's work but is also enjoyable without being directly comparable to his films (which I love). I had said much the same in my first review. Ray's humanism was on a different scale from Lagaan's magnificently broad canvas. Ray's works were sublime concertos, whereas Lagaan is best thought of as grand opera.\n\nI hope Lagaan gets a broader international viewership, because I think that as a finely-made, well-directed, wonderfully-acted film, it deserves to. But I think it helps to have some idea of some of the things I mentioned in this review, which is more a set of observations than a review per se: I reviewed it earlier when I saw it for the first time (I've now seen it three times, and loved it each time). Go watch it, especially if it gets that post-Oscar re-release!"

Many Indian films follow the same cheesy storyline, \"Indian\" special effects, and the typical hero who defeats 30 bad guys at a time. This film did not adhere to that typical \"Indian\" formula. To me, it can compete with the likes of other International epics, such as \"Life Is Beautiful\".\n\nThe director used great song, visual imagery & cinematography, and physical action (the game of cricket) to portray a wonderful story. Heartfelt emotion of despair, hope, helplessness, etc were vividly displayed both by these cinematic qualities and awesome acting on the part of Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelly! Paul Blackthorne was a very convincing villain, as well. All in all, it was perfect in the way they presented a real-life situation. Not like the cheesy love stories I usually see in Indian movies."

At stake is everything..however with the help of a virtuous british girl who flips fro local hero bhuvan, the ignorant marginally beat the masters at their own game.the climax leaves the audiences relieved as the drought stricken land is washed up by heavy rains.\n\nthe movie celebrates the human spirit and the director has laid emphasis on existing social problems .the brilliant music from rehman adds to the glory. but the length of the film does tend to get irritating at times.. nonetheless, a piece of brilliance.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Songs / Dances / Emotions / Fun / Thrills / Action. this is what it takes to make a Classic Indian Film. Very few Indian Films ( one may be able to count on their fingers ) can boast of packaging all elements better than LAGAAN.\n\nCLASSIC is the only word for this FILM. The movie has all the ingredients that have been used in the past to make a successful Indian movie. Comedy, Love, 3 sided love (though not well developed), doing the bad part because the person you love loves someone else, Caste / Creed, British rule, Exploitation of poor, Cricket, \u0085\u0085\u0085 the list is endless. The only things it doesn't have is use of vulgar language / Scene (which is used in almost every alternate Indian movie to hit the Marquee) and idiotic Fight Scenes (hero coming and bashing up 10-15 goons alone). The color's used are really earthy and well balanced. The lights (esp. in the night scene's ) are perfectly blended with the set's. The costumes done are really good just plain and simple. And not going for dhoti/kurta for each and every one. Like giving a Kurta / Pajama to the Sardar, flowing Pajama to the Muslim and the good turban on the village mukhia. This gives you feeling that it is a typical village and does not seem like that the people are just dumped there with the same cloths. Only thing is that they are always clean to the spot even when working / singing / dancing in the farms or learning cricket.\n\nThe characters are developed as and when required, it really seems like they come into focus just at the right time. They are developed so much as to bring about the characteristic's they display in the climax. It is really a director's Movie and has done justice to all characters. Full Marks to Ashutosh.\n\nMusic is like the feel of fresh fragrance in the environment. It is really brilliant. The rendering of O Ri Choree is really good and the part where western music is fused, is Masterfully done. Full marks to Rehman. The renderings of the other songs are also as good. The only point where Rehman seems wobbly is that he leaves a feeling that the has taken something for his previous compositions. In LAGAAN also it is not different, the starting of the song MITWAA seem very much like a song from 1 2 ka 4., but the rest is out of the world stuff. The composition of the Bhajan is really good and with the vocal from the ever fantastic LATA Mangeshkar it comes out with flying color's.\n\nAll the actors on their part have displayed that they are really good. All in all LAGAAN is a really good movie and I will recommend to any one and every one.\n\nOnce upon a time in India \u0085\u0085."

But for sheer entertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to look past Lagaan!\n\nAs one reviewer from England pointed out, the plot seems a little bit comical, especially from the Western point of view. How can you stake several lives over a simple cricket match? Guess if you've ever visited India and seen the passion for the game and understood it within the cultural context of the country, you might appreciate the plot as well. In any case, whether the plot is comical or not, what lifts the movie above all else is the stunning cinematography, flawless direction and incredible acting, by both the Indian as well as the British actors. There's just too many good points about the movie to be able to mention them all - not least the songs and the music!\n\nAs for the chances at the Oscars, I haven't seen the other nominees so I cannot compare them with Lagaan. However, if the Academy is looking for movies with spirit and soul within them, I cannot imagine a better movie than this. Good luck to Aamir and co at the Oscars."

This movie has a great plot, with the suspense any sports afficianado finds in the bottom of the 9th inning in baseball, after the two minute warning in football, or watching a #16 seed keep up with a #1 seed in basketball. The movie has wonderful acting, starting with Aamir Khan, who is very well known in India and was focused on making a movie that the masses (Indians as well as non-Indians) would enjoy. And the movie has wonderful songs/dance, something that is not new for Indian movies.\n\nI would recommend this movie to those that like Hindi movies, but also to those that do not like Hindi \"masala\" movies or have never seen one."

Aamir Khan is a stand out performance along with Rachel Shelley and Gracy Singh. A number of great scenes exist - the climax cricket match as well as the scene in which the traitor Lakkha's cover is blown. Kudos for Ashutush and Aamir for a wonderful film.

Naturally, being a bit skeptical at first, I thought it was another \"love triangle\" nonsense. But, this movie showed a high level of professionalism and breathtaking movie production skills.\n\nAamir Khan and Autosh Gowikar, has delivered one of the best and realistic movie about how a group of farmers in a village called Champaner rebelled against a raise in Land Tax imposed by the British. The deal they got was a simple one, defeat the mighty and experienced English team in a game of cricket and be exempted from three years of tax.\n\nThe cast was simply amazing, with Aamir Khan delivering one of his best performances yet. The soundtrack, brilliantly composed by music composer A.R. Rahman was very original,fresh and contemporary of the 19th century India. Don't expect people running around trees singing love songs as the movie exemplifies great movie making realism only.\n\nThe cinematography was a great technical brilliance. A great production from Aamir Khan !!"

But what is new is the perspective, depiction, bring life to each character and then evolving them in a relatable way on the celluloid. Ashutosh Gowariker has shown brilliance of how simply a grand movie such as this can be made. This film boast of many great things, that Indians were aware of till that point but never really realized it on the big screen.\n\nThe love Indians have for cricket when all were ga ga ing Bhuvan Bhuvan at the climax of the cricket match, which I thought would come out only during world cups, but we seemed having a natural affinity to cricket. The triangular love story of Bhuvan, that involves Britihs princess is told subtly without much dramatics, the emotions are mostly imaginary or simply in dialogue and expression. There is no big sacrifice done to exhibit emotions.\n\nThe music, oh my god Rahman gave was so apt that even today, 10 years later it still is one of the best soundtracks of Indian cinema and this will get better I think with days to come.\n\nAnd for the then first time producer Aamir Khan, all my accolades to have faith and belief and this story and investing all he could to make it as director Ashutosh wanted it.\n\nWhichever country you are from please watch it, it showcases human spirit and the gut in a beautiful way. Rating : 4/5"

The picture has tremendous repeat value. I can see this 3 hour plus movie any number of times. There is not a single boring moment in the movie. Apart from Aamir Khan's incredible performance, the greatest asset of the movie is A.R.Rahman's music. He is without doubt India's best composer today and in this movie he has touched new heights. He reminds you of Naushad at his best in films like Mother India and Gunga Jumna. All songs are going to be big hits, especially Asha Bhosle's number Radha Kaise Na Jale and Lata Mangeshkar's Paalanhaare. The lyrics by Javed Akhtar are extraordinary.They are simple yet rich in meaning and poetry.\n\nIn story, music and treatment Lagaan sets a new standard for Indian films. And it is an entirlely original piece of work which you cannot say for many movies these days.\n\nI could write endlessly about this movie but I am constrained by space. I would only like to add that the subtitles in English are excellent and all the non- Urdu and non-Hindi knowing people can enjoy it just as much. In fact, anyone who loves movies will love this one."

Once Upon A Time In India is a Spaghetti Cricket tale superbly portrayed and presented, and yet now I know: apart from the music by A. R. Rahman it just isn't my cup of tea. I'm missing a vital requirement in that (for example) I have no hatred or bitterness towards actual or attempted past, present or future invaders of Britain or any other part of the planet; life's too short.\n\nEvil cheating moneygrubbing British rulers and noble honest moneyless Indian serfs in a drought-stricken Indian province in 1893 conclude a deal to pay no tax for the next three years or be taxed at a treble rate: it all depends which side wins a cricket match. Hope it didn't give present-day Indian or English wageslaves any ideas; but I suppose as most British passport holders despise the game \u2013 and musicals - it shouldn't make any impression here. It's slickly handled with marvellous acting, music, photography and storytelling but \u2013 is it still entirely Bollywood or re-heated Hollywood? I must admit that I prefer the purer simpler films from the past, films like Mughal E Azam, Pakeezah or Roy's Devdas told me more and still give me more pleasure. Why, the cricket match doesn't even begin until after most films have finished! The usual messages are here, of tolerance and self-sacrifice mixed with a hokey competition plot device which becomes the plot...I miss the likes of Gene Kelly and Danny Kaye. Most of the songs are excellent my favourite being Radha Kaise Na Jale delicately sung by Asha and Udit Narayan. I never really liked Aamir Khan especially as a leading man but Gracy Singh impressed as Gauri, a perfect support character. It's Khan's film start to finish and he's seldom far away from the screen; he even bowled more than one maiden over in here too.\n\nIf you understand cricket and are interested in this film's premise you should watch it - if you've seen it once that's probably enough though some of the songs bear repeated listening."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Lagaan,\" directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends sports drama with a historic setting. Set in the late 19th century during the British Raj, the film follows the story of a small village, Champaner, burdened by oppressive taxes (lagaan) imposed by the British. The villagers, led by the courageous Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), challenge the British officers to a cricket match to relieve their tax burdens for three years.\n\nThe film's narrative is compelling, balancing the emotional struggle of the villagers with the thrilling excitement of an underdog sports story. Aamir Khan delivers a stellar performance, supported by a talented ensemble cast including Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley, and Paul Blackthorne. Each character is well-developed, adding depth to the story and creating a rich tapestry of human experiences and cultural clashes.\n\nThe cinematography by Anil Mehta beautifully captures the rustic charm of rural India, while A. R. Rahman's enchanting score enhances the emotional and dramatic beats of the film. The film's length, though over three hours, is justified by its meticulous attention to detail and steady pacing.\n\n\"Lagaan\" is not just a film; it's an epic saga that showcases the power of resilience, unity, and the indomitable human spirit. It's a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences, offering an engaging and thought-provoking cinematic experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Lagaan review :\n\nWhen the first look posters and trailer of Aamir Khan's maiden production Lagaan came up in the summer of 2001, there was not even a hint about its plot or the cricket match it revolved upon. Most viewers were getting a feel of it being closer to Dilip Kumar Saahab's classic Naya Daur (1957) and even some articles were written doubting its commercial viability.\n\n15th June 2001. Lagaan released in cinemas at a time when I was travelling to Baroda for office work. I browsed the in-flight newspaper for the review and it is only then I realised that the film was all about a cricket match being played by local villagers against the British officers in lieu of their tax (lagaan) waiver. The setting was 1890s when Indians didnt know what cricket was and the closest game they played was gilli danda.\n\nAshutosh Gowariker's spectacular vision was given an open hand by Aamir Khan who invested lot of his money to lend authenticity to the script. The production values were A grade, the supporting cast was perfect, AR Rahman was hired to compose some outstanding tunes and bgm and above all, there was no compromise made to Gowariker's creativity.\n\nYup, Lagaan turned out to be a lengthy feature at close to four hours (with interval). At a Baroda single screen where I caught it, the film had two intervals with the final hour and half turning in to a cricket stadium with the audience standing and cheering Aamir's Team Champaner.\n\nClashing with Sunny Deol- Ameesha Patel blockbuster Gadar Ek Prem Katha, Lagaan managed to be a box office success. It swept the Filmfare awards that year and then achieved ultimate glory by getting an Oscar nomination. Wish it had won that trophy. Never mind!! The film is above all awards and accolades and will always feature in any list of Bollywood classics. Just like its peer and fellow Oscar nominee Mother India (1957)!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Lagaan\" was nominated for the Oscar and lost. There is no shame in this, as all the nominees were exceptional that year...though if I had been voting, I would have selected \"Lagaan\". It's a near-perfect film...and among the best Indian films I have ever seen. The only films I can recall being slightly better are \"Kahaani\"\" and \"Three Idiots\". All three films are ample proof that India's films could be the equal to the best Hollywood was to offer.\n\nThe story is set in rural India in the very late 19th century. Their British overlords have a tax ('lagaan') they collect from all the locals each year. The previous year's taxes were reduced by half due to a drought. The drought has continued and instead of once again charging half, the capricious Captain has ordered the tax to be double the usual tax! There is no way the locals can pay the tax and survive...and when they appeal the decision, the Captain responds by tripling it!\n\nPart of the reason for this nastiness is that the monstrous Captain hates Bhuvan (Aamir Khan)...but most of it seems because the Captain loves toying with the locals...like a cat toys with a mouse. However, he does offer them a way out...one so ridiculous that it's obvious he is just toying with them. If the locals can organize a cricket team that can beat the local British team, the tax won't be collected for the next three years. But this isn't so generous...the locals have never even seen a cricket match...let along understand the rules. The loss seems like a foregone conclusion...but Bhuvan isn't about to give up and organizes a rag-tag team.\n\nI loved this film. The cinematography, sets, acting and music were all spot on...and I appreciate that. My only complaints, and wow are they minor, is that the ending is pretty much predictable since the film IS an Indian film AND the nice British lady learns the local language insanely fast...just too fast to be realistic. Overall, a terrific film. Don't let its near four-hour running time scare you from watching it."

I didn't know (and I still don't know) not even a little bit about cricket. I don't usually like sports films.\n\nBut I really enjoyed it. And I still remember it, 20 years after, as a great film.\n\nThe cinematography was appalling, the actors, both Indian and British, brilliant, and I specially liked the colonial context and the anti-colonial resistentialist point of view of the film, portraying the fight for freedom of the villagers against the Brittons."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another solid cricket movie, with great action, plotlines, and some good songs (more on this later). Somehow this movie is 4 times the runtime of Airplane Mode but only feels half as long and infinitely more entertaining. I also liked how much of the movie was dedicated to the actual cricket games which was very fun to watch.\n\nThe first two songs are very very spectacular masterstrokes (especially the rain one) but once Rancho's girlfriend starts singing I instantly wanted to kill myself because her voice is so annoying and her character sucks so much d word but not actually because she is so ugly and annoying. The entire movie she is a massive b word and is super insecure and selfish and petty and annoying and I hate her. I wish she got spontaneously hit by a cement truck and dies like in M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story so I can p word on her grave. Basically she acts like any character out of 3 Idiotas. Also Anish sucks so much a word at cricket and got out on the first ball like a useless dip s word and did nothing else for the entire movie.\n\nOverall, this movie was very action packed, and had a lot of heart and emotional value. I would definitely watch again and would HIGHLY recommend.\n\n8/10 -Rajesh P."

The plot holds your attention and makes you interested and invested in the characters. The main character of Bhuvan is someone you can really get behind and the film sends a good message with fighting against racism and oppression, as well as what how they blended in the influence and even small dismantling of the caste system. I liked the music as well, it was very catchy and memorable and I'm not someone who watches a lot of musicals. It is a bit long, sure, but the stakes are high and the game that they played at the end was a great finally! Check this one out!"
