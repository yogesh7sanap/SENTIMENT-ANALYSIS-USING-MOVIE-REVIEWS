        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil has all of the elements a viewer looks for in a period piece set during the time of British colonial rule. Beautiful scenery and costumes, a cast of thousands, and enough background information to make you feel you are more educated about a time and place than you were before you saw the movie.\n\nWhat this film offers the fortunate viewer that many other movies of its kind do not, are lead characters you can actually empathize with and grow to care about. \"Walter\" and \"Kitty\" are far more likable and worth rooting for than- I don't know, let's say- Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas in the English Patient (see? I don't even remember their characters' names.) The movie's tagline- \"Sometimes the greatest journey is the distance between two people\" succinctly points to the heart of this film, and what makes it work so well; the journey of a couple who married for the wrong reasons towards true intimacy with each other.\n\nOn one level, the plot is so simple and straightforward that a one line summary gives the whole story away, and for that reason, I will refrain from providing that information as much as possible. It is enough to know that it is the story of The Fanes- Walter, the shy, bookish bacteriologist, and Kitty, the shallow, haughty young woman he becomes infatuated in and persuades to marry him. Walter takes Kitty to Shanghai, where he works in a government lab. Circumstances lead Walter to re-locate them to a more remote area of China in the throes of a cholera epidemic. It is in this setting that the parallel stories unfold; the story of a doctor and his wife living in the house of a dead missionary's family as the doctor tries to get control of the conditions responsible for the epidemic, and the story of the couple's journey towards re-discovering each other.\n\nThe impressive skill that Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton bring to their work truly makes you believe that that the first challenge- combating cholera amid colonial unrest and nationalist hostilities is easier than the task of repairing a damaged marriage, and with each uneasy glance and every unsaid word, you feel what these two people feel. And that is the beauty of The Painted Veil. Fans of Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton will have reason to rejoice- this is a performance unlike any I have ever seen Ms. Watts give. There is nothing of what was becoming her trademark \"emotionally fragile woman in shambles\" persona on display here. And what of Edward Norton? Well, after his turn in The Illusionist earlier in the year and now \"Walter Fane,\" all I can say is, move over, Ralph Fiennes- there's a new sexy \"repressed, stiff-upper-lipped, sensually simmering under the surface\" leading man in town.\n\nThe Painted Veil is an intelligently adapted, well-directed film with two charismatic, award-worthy lead performances and a strong supporting cast, including Liev Schreiber, Diana Rigg, and most notably Toby Jones as the Fanes' neighbor. It is also wonderfully entertaining, and a good introduction to the period piece/historical epic genre some viewers have been avoiding due to fear of suffocation."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was nearly eighteen, I married. To the prettiest girl at art college. Lack of confidence vanished with virginity. I loved her with unbearable, blinding intensity. We painted each other with unquenchable desire. What could go wrong?\n\nOur film's title goes back to a stanza:\n\n\"Lift not the painted veil which those who live\n\nCall Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,\n\nAnd it but mimic all we would believe\"\n\nShelley's poem furnishes the title of Somerset Maugham's oriental love story. That classic, set in the 1920s, has three times been made a film. Our latest offering comes like five-year incense from Sinophile Edward Norton, with screenwriter Ron Nyswaner (Philadelphia) and producer Sara Colleton.\n\nTwo people, whose characters are a million miles apart, wed in London. They travel to Hong Kong. Suddenly they can no longer play the game that society has set them. Facing their own true natures is a journey of discovery greater than geographical distance. Visually and emotionally restrained (given the passions and breath-taking scenery involved) the Painted Veil shines with intellectual integrity. If only you can get excited enough about it.\n\nBrilliant bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) only occasionally gives way to anything as unscientific as showing feelings. Kitty (Naomi Watts) is warm and natural, but marries Walter more because it seems like a sensible thing to do than for any over-riding love. She enjoys tennis and nice things. Walter derides such superficialities. And Walter speaks only when he \"has something to say.\" Kitty has an affair with government official Charlie Townsend, a charming and seductive married man who \"made a science of popularity.\" Walter correctly labels her as stupid to think he wouldn't find out. Their trip to a cholera-infested village of Mei-tan-fu, a professional honour for Walter, becomes his journey of revenge.\n\nWalter's sense of superiority is impenetrable. Even though he vomits at his first sight of suffering, he finds a way to save much of the village from disease. Kitty is meanwhile wasting away through loneliness. They have yet to discover the real vibrancy behind each other's mask. As they attempt to do so, the film challengingly asserts the contradiction of sexual versus spiritual love.\n\nAn emotionally unintelligent man discovering the tenderness and complexity of another human being, and a good (yet fairly shallow) woman appreciating her own potential - and the value of another's great mind. But the symbol of the 'veil' goes much further. Norton says he wanted to 'lift the veil' on issues facing China in the 1920s. \"If you're going to make a film set in China during the period, I think there's got to be a reason for doing it other than the inherent romanticism of the location.\"\n\nTo Kitty, the work of the nuns (headed by Mother Superior, Diana Rigg) is laudable, especially with orphans. Walter, on the other hand, points out that they also pay parents for their children so as to indoctrinate them with Catholicism. Every Westerner is a colonialist of some sort, fuelling increasing resentment with the locals. Walter, carrying his torch of medicine rather than the fire of armaments, believes he is 'neutral'. He is somehow 'above' the armed soldiers that he relies on. Yet his rationalism is shallow, limited to believing that if only people would embrace Western ways they would have it so much easier.\n\nKitty stays with Walter initially out of 'duty' but comes to question it when the Mother Superior says, \"Duty is only washing one's hands when they are dirty.\" The philosophical challenge, echoed from Maugham, is whether duty and love can become one. This is the central tenet of the film. Walter, indubitably, seems to be following a higher 'duty' in saving people from cholera. Yet it is the experiencing of love in one form or another that gives meaning and fulfilment. That 'love' must be genuine but also under the domain of duty - else it leads astray. Walter's initial 'love' is respectful, exact - and only with the lights switched off. Kitty's is that of a gifted dilettante.\n\nThe performances are finely chiselled. Watts combines convincing sensuality and tenderness yet still gives her character room to express deep emotion later on. When Walter discovers her sexual liaison with Charles (played by Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts' real-life partner), he goes into heartless-bastard-mode. Norton (who majored in history at Yale) produces a convincing portrait of someone who is sharply intelligent and as precise as a scalpel. His painful awakening to the fact that humans are more than complex microbes is superbly judged. Polar opposites of smooth sleaze-bag Charles and straight-as-a-die Walter are movingly adjudicated by Deputy Commissioner Waddington (Toby Jones). He has more insight into relationships than the rest of them put together, yet are we misled by his persona? \"He is a good man,\" says the young Chinese woman that we saw him tussling naked and unashamed with moments earlier.\n\nGoing beyond what we believe another to be, whether we put them on a pedestal or in derision, may only be the first stage. Being away from familiar surroundings leaves nothing to fall back on. No painted veil.\n\nThis adaptation takes excusable liberties with the plot. It is true to the spirit of Shelley's poem (I had to look it up to fully appreciate that, I think). It is a finely observed colonial-era drama that holds attention with a subdued dignity, quietly resisting the enticement to do a Merchant and Ivory. To the casual viewer it sometimes hangs between wasted opportunity and insipidness. But its themes are lovingly executed with skill and exactitude.\n\nMy marriage lasted precisely one year. We both decided to travel. If we had been isolated in a distant country like the protagonists of this film, we may have discovered a more genuine love. Or killed each other. Unlike this sumptuous historical and emotional travelogue, the games we play don't always paint a pretty picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. This is a surprisingly wonderful adaptation of the W Somerset Maugham novel. Maugham passed away many years ago, but in his time was an incredibly famous and popular playwright and novelist. His best known work is probably \"The Razor's Edge\". Part of the surprise is the beauty of the film since it is directed by John Curran, who has no directing credits to his name since 1995's excellent \"Babe, the pig\". Curran's eye and talent are on full display here with the aesthetics of 1920's China and the devastation of cholera.\n\nThe story is simple, but oh so elegant. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are a very odd couple whom circumstances bring to an ill-conceived marriage. They are quite the odd couple and not the least bit charming together, even in the good moments. Norton stumbles on an affair between Watts and Liev Schreiber and the next thing we know Norton and Watts are on a two week journey into the depths of a Chinese jungle where a devastating cholera epidemic is occurring. The horrible situation brings out the best in each as people and finally as a couple. Along the way, their lives are impacted by two rather odd acquaintances, Toby Jones (off his fine turn as Truman Capote) and the long lost Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior at the local orphanage.\n\nThe story is tight, interesting and believable ... all signs of a terrific writer. The acting is worthy of such fine material and direction. Mr. Norton is wonderful as the quietly simmering bacteriologist who lacks interpersonal skills and warmth until the tragic environment brings about self-discovery. Ms. Watts continues her amazing run of top-caliber performances and is one of our top 3 actresses today. She is so subtle at times that it is easy to take her skills for granted. Mr. Schreiber, Mr. Jones and Ms. Rigg are all excellent in their roles and lets hope that Ms. Rigg will continue to bless us with her screen magic. It has been 40 years since she was the sexy Emma Peel from \"The Avengers\", but her presence on the screen is very welcome and needed.\n\nThere is a haunting score that continues throughout the film and some tremendous piano work credited to Lang Lang. The mood of the music and the film setting work together to deliver the effect of reading the novel as we watch the film. Quite a knockout for director Curran, who hopefully will not now disappear for the next decade!"

Sets, scenery, music, and costumes are dead on. Character development and evolution make these characters well rounded and memorable.\n\nThe story is so realistic that it makes one wonder if it isn't based in fact rather than fiction, and the feelings of the time (hatred for imperialistic foreigners) is documented accurately. The only negative thing I can say is that there was a point when editing needed to be tighter because the movie dragged a bit in defining Kitty's boredom and isolation. The audience got the message much earlier. But this was only a brief irritation because the movie was so fascinating.\n\nThe movie does deviate from the novel in that the ending has changed somewhat, but few people have probably read this novel and most won't even notice. It's a longer than average movie and will probably play better in Europe than America. But for the thinking crowd, it's an absolute must see."

        "review_title": "Exquisitely Layered, Haunting, and Clever Period Romance",
        "review_detailed_main": "John Curran's nearly pitch perfect film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Painted Veil\" begins slowly and patiently, with leisurely flashbacks that elliptically bring us to a singularly absurd predicament: circa 1925, a British doctor (Edward Norton in his second romantic lead following \"The Illusionist\") has brought his lovely young wife (an entrancing Naomi Watts) into the middle of a Chinese cholera epidemic purely out of spite. It's a wickedly clever little set-up that becomes increasingly more complex and absorbing.\n\nThe note-perfect and delicately layered performances of Watts and Norton, two thespians typically acclaimed for their edgy and independent work and playing against type, are anchored with the literary genius of Maugham and Curran's keen eye and steady hand behind the camera. It's all perfectly accentuated by the brilliantly subversive music score by Alexandre Desplat (doing his best work since \"Birth\"). These cleverly designed elements coalesce deliciously into a fully fleshed-out whole, and allow \"The Painted Veil\" to grow in your mind organically and slowly slip under your skin like an infectious disease.\n\nRon Nyswaner does a great job of translating Maugham's writing to the screen. Virtually nothing is lost. That keen British wit, the dramatic sense of irony, and the sincere exploration of many heady themes including loveless marriages, adultery, imperialism, charity, religion, and redemption are all captured beautifully by director Curran and screenwriter Nyswaner. Watts and Norton are given plenty to chew on, not only great lines, but great scenes full of lush scenery, and beautiful and textured visual details that serve as perfect backdrops for their complex and unpredictable relationship.\n\nBack in the heyday of Merchant-Ivory, it seemed like this type of literary minded period-piece was a dime a dozen. There hasn't been a hugely successful film of this type since 1996's \"The English Patient.\" We haven't seen a worthwhile film in this genre since Neil Jordon's underrated \"The End of the Affair\" in 1999, which not coincidentally was an adaptation of one of the great novels from Maugham's fellow Brit and contemporary, Graham Greene, and addressed many of the same themes.\n\nWhat \"The Painted Veil\" lacks in epic sweep it makes up for in scores with its nuanced performances and subversive outlook on romance and true love. Its finely landscaped images of China are transfixing, but it's the look on Norton's face when he realizes the woman his wife has become, and the glimmer of a tear forming in Watts' eye when she realizes what she's done that will haunt you."

Norton and Watts, good as they are, have not a sexual chemistry to write home about. His broken heart doesn't compel us because translated into images, Edward Norton's character emerges as a petulant bore of a child. An unrecognizable Diana Rigg, as the Mother Superior, tells Watts that her husband loves children. If Mother Diana hadn't told her, I wouldn't have known. That's what I mean. There is no genuine kindness in him, not even when he's kind. Naomi Watts's Kitty is a society girl of her day, isn't she suppose to be? Yes. But she stands up from her chair to shake hands with Toby Jones, the move was so out of period and class that it distracted me, I kept thinking that it meant something that sooner or later was going to be revealed. The character's transgression was serious but not unheard of in its day. Standing up to shake hands with a man was. I like Watts and Norton enormously but not here. Exotic locations and a delicious Alexander Desplats score provide a much welcome help to the proceedings."

Great supporting cast as well - Diana Rigg is almost unrecognizable as a Mother Superior, and Liev Schreiber is, as always, terrific as a slimy lowlife. Based on one of Somerset Maugham's best stories, this is a movie that will satisfy anyone looking for an old-fashioned, romantic drama about love lost and love earned. The social quandary of British women after the first World War, which created a generation of unwilling spinsters, is taken as seriously by the filmmakers as the emergence of a new China standing up to its Colonial oppressors. Watts' character's journey from spoiled, selfish Daddy's girl in 1920's fun-loving London to a mature woman in a deprived, cholera-infested third-world country is harrowing."

The film concerns an unhappily married couple, Kitty and Walter Fane (Naomi Watts and Edward Norton). He's a doctor, and in love with her, but she only married him to get away from her domineering mother. She drifts into an affair with another man (Liev Schreiber). When her husband finds out, he blackmails her into going to a cholera-ridden area, where he plans to help fight the disease. She has no choice - it's either that or have her paramour named in a divorce case.\n\nNow totally detesting her, Walter gets her into the area going the toughest, most tortuous route and most probably hopes she gets cholera and dies. She doesn't, but she becomes bored and volunteers to help the nuns, led by the Mother Superior (Diana Rigg). Along the way, she finds out what people think of her husband and grows to admire him.\n\nSomerset Maugham is never easy to film. This isn't the kind of movie that goes down well with many types of audiences today - it's slow-moving without a lot of action. However, I liked it. The performances all around are excellent, including that of Toby Waddington, who plays a neighbor, and Schreiber, as the ex-lover. Watts and Norton create believable characters. For me both actors are underrated and prove again that they are capable of astonishing performances.\n\nWorth seeing for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil (2006)\n\nI'm not sure any author has been adapted to film as much as Somerset Maugham, nor so many so well. (I include even such obvious shoe-ins as Ian Fleming and Agatha Christie.) And here is another that depends, and succeeds, on the basis of his writing. Maugham's novels and stories are often praised and criticized equally for their thinly evoked melodrama, for their lack of progressive Modernism. But they make great reading, and what perfect fodder for the movies!\n\nHere we have what is gleaned from his own experiences--he started life briefly as a doctor, and later travelled widely in the old stomping grounds of the British Empire and beyond, including China where this is set. It is the mid-twenties, and so the set design and music are often richly tactile and moving. And the plot is about a British doctor, played by Edward Norton, who goes to the hinterlands of China to work on a cholera epidemic. He is a noble figure if a bitter one, and Norton plays it a little too close to the chest. Still, we get his dedication and withdrawn fortitude easily.\n\nThe bigger conflict and emotional involvement for the viewer is his wife, Kitty, played with unusual clarity by Naomi Watts. Maugham sets his romantic conflicts in interesting places without letting you forget that it's the interpersonal stuff that matters, not the cholera. Not really. Watts plays the misplaced and a bit lost-at-sea wife really well, though the movie keeps her, as with Norton, in check most of the time. Some will say it's the British reserve, the stiff upper lip, but that's only a public face. Here the director John Curran makes it complete, even behind closed doors.\n\nSome will find this movie too careful, too slow, too pretty, too literate. And those are some reasons it works. It's a really fine film. It breaks no rules, it feels a bit old fashioned like many Merchant-Ivory films do, but like those, it sucks you into this other world and illuminates it as if from within. It may seem at times precious, or even a bit canned (some obvious things have to happen in an epidemic where some townspeople not to mention rustic warlords don't get modern science so well), but overall it makes well-proportioned dramatic sense.\n\nThis is a joint Chinese/British enterprise, and the filming is entirely in China, even the studio stuff. That might help account for the political delicacy of the whole enterprise, but it's a great collaboration and a good dip into one small piece of the complicated Chinese Twentieth Century."

The man is John Curran, an independent director with a profound vision who is riding the right path and if he continues to do so, I dare to say he'll be among the big names soon. That's, of course, if he decides to work more constantly. He's done three full-length features that have garnered awards and recognition.\n\nI've seen two of them; \"We don't live here anymore\" and now \"The Painted Veil\", the life of a couple in the 1920's, where a man came to a woman after knowing her for a day and said: \"I came here to ask you to marry me\". This is what Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) proposes to Kitty (Naomi Watts); and she agrees, of course because it's a chance to get as far away from her parents as possible. Fane is a microbiologist or something like it, however she doesn't care. He takes her to Shanghai, where she meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber).\n\nSomething awful and predictable happens. It hurts a character and the viewer and it lets Curran to deal with a theme he knows well; adultery. Anyway, this is just the beginning of a silent suffering and of a silent life with limited conversations. But strong conversations, coming from Ron Nyswaner's intelligent script, based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel. Overlooked by the Academy, Nyswaner's work allows the characters to expose their feelings mercilessly; which is exactly the way John Curran makes films.\n\nIn \"We don't live here anymore\" the images were violent. \"Do you absolutely despise me?\", Kitty asks Walter. \"No, I despise myself for allowing myself to love you once\", he answers. In scenes like this one, Curran's close-ups are daring; but he's also able to measure his shots to give us some beautiful landscapes. Going back to Nyswaner, he achieves the turn of the story perfectly, providing us a big gallery of characters (Toby Jones as an unpredictable neighbor, Anthony Wong Chau-Sang as a harsh Chinese colonel, Diana Rigg as a caring nun) as he deals with strong issues like terminal diseases and social differences.\n\nSometimes recognized as the most intelligent man in the industry, a versatile and underrated actor, Norton produced the movie (in which he's absolutely brilliant, with the English accent included) and made sure Naomi Watts was in it\u0085Every time she appears on screen in a film she looks different; although we know it's her. Her range is more surprising by the day. Not so long ago, Watts said in an interview that she was tired of dramatic roles where she had to cry all the time; she wanted to get a big paycheck in \"some stupid romantic comedy\". Even so, she produced Curran's previous movie (where she was also great) and co-produced this one: she must care a little bit.\n\nUltimately, with all the things it covers, \"The Painted Veil\" is a beautiful story about love found, as in discovered; a story about regret and the purest forgiveness. I also want to comment that after watching two of his pieces, Curran has something going on with streets in last scenes."

But in this fight another one will come out as he will find out that his wife is unfaithful.\n\nI really liked this movie because it represents very well the truth about this very serious epidemic which destroyed many villages and killed so many people. The direction which made by John Curran was very good and because of this many things which I believe was important shower in a very nice way. Edward Norton who played as Dr. Walter Fane was for one more time simply outstanding and the same I can say about the interpretation of Naomi Watts who played as his wife.\n\nLastly I believe that \"The Painted Veil\" is a very nice movie which combines very well drama with romance and shows us what a person has to get through in order to become better. To become better person not only for the others but also for himself."

But to my untrained ear, it sounded very authentic and did not detract from the film at all.\n\nMy friend and I have been looking out for The Painted Veil ever since we saw it. Meanwhile, it's already almost November and we haven't heard anything about its release.\n\nWe both strongly recommend that you see this movie when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.

Diana Rigg is wonderful as the wise no-nonsense head nun -- but with no makeup at all and a baggy habit she does not resemble the sexy young thing in a catsuit in the 1960s \"The Avengers\".\n\nThe film builds to a revelation (unveiling?) of love which gives you a warm glow."

Naomi Watts is also fine, as is Toby Jones. It's nice to see Diana Rigg again, too. Sure it's melodramatic, but what's wrong with that? When done well, melodrama is a great treat. And this is done VERY well. It sure beats the dreadful Seventh Sin of the 50's and even tops the Garbo version from the 30's. Filming in China adds a lot, and the really beautiful cinematography helps immeasurably. With all the many good movies out there this time of year, I fear this one might get overlooked--and that will be a shame."

The only reason I went to see it is because I am a die-hard Edward Norton fan, and I watch all of his movies.\n\nThe first half hour or so I thought was laughable. The acting and the dialogue were so melodramatic that at points it felt like a soap opera. The scenes were well structured - they contained real drama and not just small talk, like in a lot of movies nowadays (\"Little Children\" for example). Each character had an objective, and a set of actions to match. But the dialogue itself was horrible - a lot of the time they were saying out loud what should have been their subtext. That's the first half an hour.\n\nAfter that, it gets significantly better, and I do believe that if you're the type of person who enjoys such movies (like \"The English Patient\" or \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" for example) you will be entertained and maybe moved. I wasn't.\n\nThe ingredients are all there: stunning cinematography, a beautiful soundtrack, three-dimensional characters, and very strong performances by both Norton and Watts. I did get a kick out of Norton's coldness and apathy towards Watts, and it even got a few laughs out of me. They were both a pleasure to watch, especially during scenes where not everything was said out-loud, and you could feel the tension under the surface. It's the story that was the problem - I just wasn't engaged by it, and the whole thing seemed to move too slowly.\n\nAll in all a decent effort, but not an entirely successful one. 6 out of 10."

Needless to say the waterworks were on not only for her but myself as well as this film meets it dramatic climax.\n\nFor Edward Norton 2006 will be remembered as a banner year (though no Oscar nominations) He was a cool guy in \"The Illusionist\" and the ultimate nerd in this film portraying a bacteriologist who takes his unfaithful wife to the heart of China to deal with of all things a cholera epidemic. Dangerous for a young wife, one might conclude. Norton's character does not care as the love hence felt for his wife has been supplanted by hatred and a thirst for revenge. Naomi Watts is also pitch perfect as the woman who comes to understand her husband and fall deeply in love with him. The resolution of this development is something that I will not spoil here.\n\nVisually the film is one of the most appealing in release as the camera extracts pastels and muted colors from the beautiful landscape (earning a cinematography nod)As with Merchant Ivory like films, \"The Painted Veil\" is here briefly to be cherished as they are making fewer and fewer like it. The \"wait till it comes out on DVD\" excuse is ill advised here as the splendor would be lost, lost even on a 60 inch plasma...."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this period piece, Edward Norton once again plays the smartest guy in the room, as Walter Fane, a dedicated, cold-hearted clinical researcher who travels to the middle of a cholera epidemic in China in the 1920s, with his young wife Kitty (Naomi Watts) in tow. Walter drags Kitty to China partly to punish her for her illicit tryst with a married man (Liev Schrieber). Kitty agrees because somehow facing cholera is somehow better than being divorced and disgraced by Walter.\n\nNow, I like Edward Norton. But having too recently seen him in The Illusionist, I was a little wary of his work here; Walter is not presented as someone who can be fooled, least of not by someone as apparently dumb as Kitty, and sure enough he's discovered her infidelity. Of course, looking at Walter, one can understand Kitty's indiscretion; she's outgoing and adventurous, whereas Walter is dull and lifeless. He snags her after a truly whirlwind courtship and whisks her away from England to foreign lands; she agrees for the adventure and to get away from her sanctimonious, image-conscious mother.\n\nIn China, Walter finds that his abilities as a scientist aren't the cure-all elixir the area needs. As the epidemic spreads, Walter necessarily cuts off the town's tainted water supply, thus provoking wrath against all Westerners. Meanwhile, Kitty bores of sitting around the house and helps a local orphanage. But can they both keep the cholera at arm's length? Can their shared experiences save their marriage? This is, at its heart, a love story, although perhaps not the most exciting one. I can't honestly say that anything in this movie really bothered me, but neither did it particularly enflame any passions for me. This is not a movie that most guys are going to like. Sure, Naomi Watts is good to look at, and she's a competent actress, but here she seems like just another pretty face. The story's focus is on her, but unless you're in just the right mood you probably won't be grabbed by it.\n\nThose of you who love romances, though, might swoon. The bored wife has to cheat on her husband! He finds out and takes her to a place where surely she will die of cholera, if not ennui! Can this marriage be saved? That Edward Norton, he's so dashing and confident! OK, maybe not so dashing, but he looks good in a suit or a lab coat. He's like the Superman of nerdy Everymen. The fact that here he basically tries to kill her (i.e., by bringing her into an epidemic of a highly contagious disease) kind of takes some of the shine away.\n\nThe Chinese scenery is wonderful, though, and everyone seems earnest enough. But it was all maddening dull for me, up until the final twenty minutes or so, when the chemistry of the two leads really clicked. Overall, not a complete miss by any means, but not to everyone's taste, particularly those of us who are impatient."

It was difficult for me to get into it because I couldn't get over the artifice. Although I believe it was shot on real locations - and the locations look great - the actors seem dressed an coiffed by a first class metropolitan expert. I didn't have a sense of hardship, I was told it was awful, but we didn't feel it. Naomi Watts gives her character a contemporary slant that it's not out of the rebellious spirit of a Garbo or Hepburn or Davis but of a miscalculation of the filmmakers. Edward Norton's timid monster is at times unbearable. You don't want this two people to get together because there is not a single moment in which I believe that the implied love is sincere. The lingering shots of the dying doesn't help one bit to make the artificial emotional storm any deeper. Everything happens too quickly although the pace goes from slow to very slow. Strange that after all said and done, compared with the recent film offerings, this is not all bad. However, I longed for the William Wyler of \"The Letter\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil is my favorite Somerset Maugham novel so I was concerned about how much justice could be done to this hauntingly beautiful story of revenge, love and redemption. Is it possible to take a masterpiece and make a decent film out of it in Hollywood? Apparently yes! Could the movie have been better - absolutely, but does it get the job done well? I'd say yes.\n\nEd Norton is Walter - a bacteriologist stationed in Shangai. In Londn he mets and falls in love with the beautiful Kitty (Naomi Watts), hasty marriage and honeymoon in Venice later they are both in China. He is busy - she is bored. And what better way to relieve boredom than an extramarital affair with Charlie - the philandering consular official (Liev Schrieber)? But Walter discovers the affair and decides to volunteer to a cholera stricken province and take Kitty with him. Charlie was never serious anyway so off they go into the jaws of death. In the cholera infested back of beyond Walter and Kitty discover more about each other than they did in many months of marriage. A mutual respect grows into something else but it is a cholera infested region after all. So the tale must have a tragic ending and it does. But it leaves one with a sense of relief as the camera finally moves away from the oppressive dark tones and into light.\n\nThe movie has beautiful performances by Ed Norton and Ms. Watts. His serious, then almost sinister, then enlighetened Walter is the perfect foil to her luminous, wicked and then vulnerable Kitty. Liev Schrieber is good in the brief role as Charlie and all the supporting cast is very good indeed. The locale is stunning and the mood is brilliantly captured in the dark, the shadows and moments of light.\n\nAre there Hollywood moments? Of course there are, mostly during the growing attraction between the lead pair there are the clich\u00e9d moments of \"intoxication\", his looking suddenly more attractive and youthful, her moments with the orphanage kids. But none of it is over the top. The movie is full of mood, sensuous beauty and emotion. I enjoyed the film and I think Mr. Maugham is there somewhere nodding his head in approval at a job well done."

Actor Edward Norton became involved with the project in 1999. Norton explained his attraction to the project, \"It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings.\" The actor suggested casting Naomi Watts for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in Mulholland Drive (2001) and 21 Grams (2003). When Watts joined the project, she recommended director John Curran, with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film We Don't Live Here Anymore.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this film. It was shot beautifully, and it captured the imperfections of humanity. Watts' character has clear moral failings, but in some ways, so does Norton's. Rather than release his wife, he keeps her trapped... to what end? Surely he gets no joy from this. I could do without the love scenes, but I suppose that is to be expected in a film about infidelity.\n\nInitially, the cholera outbreak and Asian-English relations are sort of background elements, but it is interesting how they ultimately become bigger in their own way. How Watts and Norton interact is somewhat less important than how either of them interact with the cholera patients..."

However, Edward Norton is an incredible actor and is the most under-recognized and the most under appreciated big-name actor.\n\nIn the Painted Veil, Edward Norton does not disappoint. The man has an incredible chemistry with Naomi Watts, and delivers a stunning performance. He has different transition periods and in each one he subtly changes his posture, and movement and his tones in his voice in a way that nobody seems to appreciate any more. After seeing the variety of roles that the man takes, this role seems to be sort of boring, almost below his talent; yet he makes the role of a biologist come alive in a performance that no one else could deliver.\n\nThis man is the white version of the incredible Denzel Washington.\n\nListen, Tom Hanks might be good, but Norton is Phenomenal.\n\nBefore going to see this movie, PLEASE see Fight Club or the 25th Hour, or Primal Fear, or ANYTHING else the man has done. If you haven't seen American History X then see that one as well. This cat is so versatile and for you to appreciate this movie as much as I did a contrast point is quite helpful.\n\nHis chemistry with Naomi was impeccable as well. Ms. Watts delivered another stunning performance in her role and the dialogue and the silence between them, the building tension, etc is crazy to watch.\n\nOne final note on this movie: the Gold Globe the Soundtrack took home is well deserved.\n\nPainted Veil is a sleeper film of 2006.

        "review_detailed_main": "If you haven't watched this movie, it helps to be aware that it is a slow-moving story. Don't expect of action or adventure and you won't be disappointed. Although set mostly in an exotic locale under revolutionary-type conditions, it is a bit of an adventure story but it is mostly a subtle romance.\n\nIt's a story of a couple who married despite one not loving the other but learning to as time goes by. Normally, that wouldn't particularly appeal to me, especially with a female that is cold and sarcastic as Naomi Watts' \"Kitty Fane\", but this film had an odd appeal. It has a tension running through it for the first three-quarters of the film, that makes you want to keep watching and find out what happens.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that it's beautifully filmed and that always-entertaining Edward Norton plays the male lead, Kitty's husband \"Walter.\" Norton is one of the few modern-day American actors who could surprise us with a British accent and make it sound natural, forgetting quickly that he's faking an accent. He's that subtle.\n\nShanghai is an interesting place, I'm sure, especially during the period of the unrest in the 1920s, which is pictured in this Somerset Maugham story, but this still is a very low-key romance movie in which the wife slowly learns to love and respect her husband and he, meanwhile, learns even more slowly, to forgive her for her sins, which include adultery. The tension between the two is well-played, not overly melodramatic.\n\nOf the minor characters, Toby Jones as \"Waddington\" was most intriguing. It took me awhile to figure out if he was friend or foe, a trustworthy friend or not.\n\nIf you are patient and enjoy good visuals and acting, you probably will like this film."

It has a bit of the Shakespearean Taming of the Shrew in it, but what there is beyond appearances is splendid! It will let you want to watch it over and over again. I know I do...I would recommend this movie to everybody who believes in the magic of true feelings."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil takes place in Kuomintang China during the early twenties. The interesting thing about this film is that it was done in China and it popularizes the government that the Chinese Communists over threw in 1949. More and more China is surely getting away from the Marxist ideology of Mao Tse-tung.\n\nEdward Norton and Naomi Watts are a British couple in China during the Twenties occupying one of several areas carved out by foreign powers. He's a doctor and deep in his work. The bored Naomi gets into an affair with Liev Schreiber and she's caught by her husband Norton.\n\nSoon afterward Doctor Norton is assigned to a remote area where cholera is raging. Watts accompanies him and is treated coldly, but the work he does and the loneliness of the place brings them together.\n\nThe Kuomintang was the name of a political party founded by Sun Yat-sen and they had the goal of eventually expelling foreigners. China for the Chinese as it should have been. China was hardly a unified country at that time, in fact Norton and the Kuomintang head in the area Anthony Wong Sang Chau have to deal with a local warlord of which there were many. You can see his kind portrayed in such films back in the studio era as the Shanghai Express and The General Died at Dawn.\n\nAfter Sun Yat-Sen died in 1925 the Kuomintang party and government was taken over by Chiang Kai-shek. By that time the Chinese Communist party had been founded and besides Marxism, the Chinese Communists portrayed the Kuomintang as not going far enough in getting rid of foreign spheres of influence. So for the current Chinese government to portray the Kuomintang favorably is really quite a statement.\n\nOne of the key scenes is Anthony Wong Sang Chau telling Ed Norton that while he appreciates the medical assistance it doesn't necessarily have to be with westerns guns backing it up. There aren't in fact too many western guns around in this remote region.\n\nOther noteworthy performances are that of Toby Jones as a British agent and Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of a convent in the area who aid Norton in fighting the cholera. There were a lot of good and bad missionaries in China, Rigg is showed as one of the very best.\n\nW. Somerset Maugham wrote the novel on which the film is based. The Painted Veil is helped by the actual location cinematography in China and the landmark cooperation of the Chinese government in bringing this touching story to the screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Noble stab at the stoic period romance did not seem to break through to any significant emotional territory despite laborious direction and tuned performances. In bringing forth W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 dramatic story, which deals with a struggling British couple's minor adventures throughout a remote, cholera-ridden Chinese village, the results play more like a stilted adaptation then a genuine and relevant piece of fiction.\n\nWith pure intent, everyone on board tries to do what they can to breathe life into the subsiding sentiment, usually getting washed away in the melodramatic nuance of it all. While not as dull as a Merchant-Ivory collaboration at it's uninvolved worst, The Painted Veil rarely grabs spectators for what should have been a more engaging story. At times it feels that all this subtle posturing is merely there to mask an emotional void that envelops the entire production. There are grand moments to be found, but those moments lie few and far between a mediocre morality tale amongst overvalued scenery."

I think it goes deeper into the ideas of what love truly is. I think what is trying to be said through the movie is that the \"painted veil\" is the illusion of life as one wishes to see it. Once that veil is stripped away, one must accept life for what it is...with all of its flaws. People must learn to see the beauty of imperfection. The movie really makes you think about what love truly is."

I was told that \"Iron Man\" was brilliant, funny, terrific, and instead found it boring, silly and markedly unfunny (apart from Ms Paltrow).\n\nThen I was told that \"The Painted Veil\" was tedious, boring and would put me to sleep. And I found it riveting. This is such a well-made movie, it's almost perfect in the way that the pieces fit together so seamlessly - the actors, the dialogue, the locations, the cinematography, the way the story is allowed to unfold. Each component complements the others. It's not big on action, and there's not a lot of suspense in the traditional sense, although the hostility of many Chinese to Westerners, and the threat of the Nationalists lurking in the background, is always in evidence.\n\nWhat it is is a finely made dramatic love story, and I thought it was excellent. Naomi Watts is superb, as usual, and Edward Norton delivers a particularly good performance.\n\nI guess that it'll be \"Iron Man\" that gets the box office and the award nominations, but in terms of quality cinema, \"The Painted Veil\" exists in another stratosphere."

        "review_detailed_main": "Produced by both Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton and directed by John Curran maker of We Don't Live Here Anymore (2004), and also produced by Ms. Watts. The Painted Veil was originally released in 1934 and starring one Greta Garbo then filmed for the second time as The Seventh Sin from 1957. Now, we have the 2006 version of the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham (1874 - 1965) and whose title from Percy Bysshe Shelley's verse \"Lift Not The Painted Veil Which Those Who Live\" is taken from.\n\nThe Painted Veil is as stunningly beautiful in its vision of 1920's China's political and geographic landscapes as its sensitivity of the marriage vows and the way in which it deals with infidelity, regret and possible forgiveness.\n\nThis love story has Kitty meeting young, intelligent, introverted and somewhat dull Dr. Walter Fane, whose forte is the study of infectious diseases, and the convenient marriage that she finds herself committed too. It is in a web of intrigue, and dark clouds, that they head for mainland China. So much as to hide her from herself as to help thwart a cholera outbreak, and possibly cure his failing marriage also, but this is a marriage more than on the rocks. This is a cold, indifferent and loveless partnership in a vast unknown and deadly environment that will test both these flightless lovebirds and with the hardships and tolerances more than any had ever anticipated.\n\nA cinematographer of Stuart Dryburgh's standard, like counterparts' Emmanuel Lubezki for The New World (2005) and Christopher Doyle for Ying xiong (Hero, 2002) has shown us a landscape that is both breath taking and visually involving. This green and unspoilt landscape is the beautiful backdrop to a plague more deadly than any microbe could ever conquer, for here, amongst the tranquil rivers and the magnificent hills, forests and mountains of deepest China lies Pride; the 7th Deadly Sin.\n\nThis is also driven home by the sensual music that is playing throughout by Alexandre Desplat that brings home the sensitivity and grandiose of both the heart and soul of both the Fanes and their enchanting but precarious quarters. Together, with the visual and the emotional aspect of The Painted Veil and its undertones of love and love that wanes and the holding onto the fragile heartstrings that have become stretched and worn. All this is done with fine acting and finer movie-making, a calibre that is more than fitting and respectful of an Independent movie as this, a total pleasure to be enthralled and entertained by.\n\nThe Painted Veil is a virtuoso of what a period piece should be, detailed, refined, eloquent, charming and overall spectacular.\n\nThe Painted Veil is more than a slow boat to China; The Painted Veil is a slow and enduring flight to movie magnificence."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Painted Veil\" is a remake of a Greta Garbo film of the same name and both are based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham...though the 2006 version sticks closer to the original story. The theme is redemption and reminded me in some ways of Joseph Conrad's \"Lord Jim\".\n\nKitty (Naomi Watts) is rich and spoiled. Her mother is upset that Kitty is now 25 and should have married and settled down long ago...and the family pressures her to marry Dr. Fane (Edward Norton). The marriage is not initially a happy one. Kitty is spoiled and selfish and soon embarks on an affair with Mr. Townsend (Liev Schreiber). The husband finds out and gives her an ultimatum--either divorce him and marry Townsend or accompany him to a rural part of China to help with a Cholera outbreak. Considering Townsend never had any intention of marrying Kitty, her choice is simple and she follows her husband.\n\nThe marriage is very cold at this point. However, over time you see that it's not just because of Kitty's infidelity but because the Doctor is emotionally constricted and has great difficulty connecting with his wife. Over time, they slowly begin to rebuild trust...and then fate strikes.\n\nThe film is lovely, as unlike the original, this one was filmed in China. Add to that some terrific direction, lovely music and terrific acting. The only things I should note is that the film is a bit slow and the ending rather depressing...but if you are a person who is willing to give the film time and don't insist on a Hollywood ending, you're in for a treat."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think The Painted Veil is surprisingly a very good movie. I am not a fan of movies about troubled marriages but this one is very well-done. A young woman, Kitty (Naomi Watts), marries a doctor, Walter (Edward Norton), a bit too hastily with a little pushing from her parents. Walter is a man dedicated to his profession. Soon Kitty discovers that it's not the ideal marriage she has dreamed of and a distance becomes to emerge between Kitty and Walter.\n\nWalter takes on a job in the Far East where a small town is stricken with cholera outbreak. Kitty is left with no other choice than to accompany her husband even though it is against her wishes. This is a perfect story of self-discovery and through the self-discovery a husband and a wife discover each other. The setting really helps the story. If this was just a story about a troubled marriage it could be quite boring. But as the characters try to live their lives in the best way possible and get involved with the issues in the cholera-stricken town, the film goes to a deeper dimension. It's not just about overcoming the problems of marriage but overcoming many other challenges in life but the two plots are so perfectly interwoven. After all, this is really a great film. Acting, directing, story, everything comes together perfectly well."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a sucker for love stories. I am a special sucker when love happens between 2 people that don't seem to be able to stand one another. Isn't that essentially what happens in Pride and Prejudice? In The Painted Veil, Kitty (Naomi Watts), a beautiful, vivacious girl from a moderately wealthy family agrees to marry Walter (Edward Norton), a serious doctor. You couldn't find a seemingly more mismatched pair. Kitty likes to play games, especially tennis and cards. She likes dances and the theater. Walter has a scientific, rational mind, and shows little interest in emotion or passion or any kind. He is a bacteriologist (he informs Kitty) and is leaving for Shanghai the next day. Of course, we know it's always those quiet ones . . .\n\nWalter believes he can make Kitty happy in the typical way men think they can. Give them pretty things and an occasional fun night out, and they'll be happy. A fun girl like Kitty wants companionship, something the doctor lacks experience in. She might have allowed him to make her happy if he wasn't such a bore. Even I found this doctor boring, and I am an Edward Norton fan. Divorce was not an option in those days, so she begins an affair with the more suave politician (Liev Schreiber).\n\nWhen Walter discovers the infidelity, he gives Kitty and ultimatum: come with him to an agricultural town that is suffering from a cholera epidemic or he will divorce her in a public humiliating fashion. Option 2 is no option for Kitty. She would return to her parent's house ashamed with no hopes of escape. She chooses to follow Walter although she realizes she'll probably die from cholera. What Walter hopes to accomplish by doing this is unclear. Maybe he's trying to punish Kitty or himself. Maybe he couldn't think of going alone no matter how despicable the company might be. These two treat each other with a casual indifference one reserves for small garden worms.\n\nWhatever his intent, Kitty is utterly miserable in her new home, a barren looking landscape with no companionship. Stuck at home with nothing to do, she chooses to put her hands to work in the same hospital her husband labors each day. And so they begin to notice things about one another. He is good with babies. She plays beautiful music that makes the orphans smile. He is working hard to save people's lives. She is a girl with no fear of death.\n\nAnd they finally love for the same reason that Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy finally do: they realize the inherent goodness and bravery in the other person and cling to it like a lifeboat. When you live through a tragic situation, you see what a person is really made of.\n\nThe foggy, haunting setting in agrarian China is an appropriate backdrop for this love story. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer echoes the lush landscape."

Quite a moving story and yet I'm not moved at all. Either I became cold-hearted over night or this essentially strong story isn't told in a strong enough way. I never heard of this director before, but cast is really great. In leading roles we have Naomi Watts and Edward Norton and they are the main reason I saw this movie in a first place. The most prominent side roles belong to Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan), Toby Jones (Dr. Jenkins in Wayward Pines, Dobby in Harry Potter) i Diana Rigg (Olenna Tyrell in GOT). Those actors themselves make this movie worth watching, but don't expect too much. Nice drama for one watching and nothing more than that.\n\n6/10\n\nThe last scene is so cliche it made me wanna throw up."

The Painted Veil is an outstanding example of such a story. The movie brilliantly narrates the lives of a couple who unite to pursue conflicting goals and end up uniting in every way. Ed Norton and Naomi Watts deliver one of the best performances of their lives and leave the audience spell bound in a movie that boasts of nothing dramatic and yet is a drama in the purest form. Set in England and China of 1920's, this movie depicts the love, the lack of it, and again the love between a couple whose pursuits were different but led them to one goal. To sum it, The Painted Veil is a sedate, sober and yet stunningly beautiful movie that will engage and enthrall you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching the trailer for this film several times, I thought, oh, oh, what we've probably got here is a production reminiscent of typical Merchant-Ivory fluff: a so-so enacted drama wrapped in a gorgeous travelogue to disguise the movie's shortcomings. Turns out that's about right.\n\nThe story, adapted from the novel by Somerset Maugham, is set in 1925 in China. It concerns the frayed relationship of a young married couple, neither of whom is attractive enough to me to care much about, one way or the other. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is an English microbe hunter, a humorless workaholic, trying to stem the evil tide of a cholera epidemic. His wife, Kitty (Naomi Watts), has the imagination of a jackrabbit.\n\nAll Kitty can think of to relieve her boredom is to strike up an affair with a narcissistic, very much married fellow, Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). Oh, well, to paraphrase Rummy, you don't go into a movie that has the very best group of characters you could ever want, you go with the group the filmmakers have given you. And, so, it is difficult to warm to the opening of love between the Fanes, after they leave Shanghai in favor of the isolated back country where the epidemic is raging.\n\nIn fact, it is the rugged, isolated location where most of the story takes place that is the most attractive aspect of this film. Guangxi Province, in southern China, features spiky limestone mountains and glorious rivers. Thank goodness a skilled DP, Stuart Dryburgh, was on hand to record the stupendous beauty of the setting. The couple sitting next to us at the screening had biked through Guangxi just last summer. They say the area is virtually no different today than as depicted in 1925. The towns are humble. Carts drawn by livestock, and wooden passenger conveyances carried by men on foot, are still quite common.\n\nThe best turns are by Toby Jones, as the dissipated but sweet ex-pat, Waddington; Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of a local orphanage where Kitty finds useful work for a change, teaching music to the kids; and Anthony Wong Chau-Sang as Col. Yu, an ultra cool military attach\u00e9 to Dr. Fane, who saves Fane's bacon by subtly intimidating the local warlord into allowing proper disposition of deceased cholera victims. The music throughout is lustrous, brilliant, too much so in fact. The music is downright commanding, providing an unavoidable thrust of manipulation that is all too familiar to us from a gazzilion Hollywood extravaganzas. (In Mandarin & English) My grades: 6.5/10 (low B) (Seen on 12/28/06)"

I love Maugham's novels because they are a deep and humanistic portrait of the human been, with flaws, issues mixing all positive and negative side. As human bees really are. The Painted Veil is an incredibly good novel. It shows how a person can grow while facing the consequences of their own acts but in a realistic, cruel and merciless way (one of the strong characteristics of all Maugham's works). What happened with this movie? The story was completely altered to fit better the \"hollywood model\" of redemption and romantic stories - and this is NOT what the novel is about! They even changed the end of the novel! Plus, as I read in other comments the time dedicated to end the story is quite ridiculous. Maugham deserved better and so we. A big disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Painted Veil\" is an instructive example of how music can (literally) be instrumental to a film, and not merely incidental. This comes at a time when film scores sometimes overpower the action and dialog, and songs do not move the plot along but seem tacked on at the end in a bid for an Oscar.\n\n\"The Painted Veil\" makes use of Erik Satie's deceptively simple yet hauntingly beautiful \"Gnossienne\" as a leitmotiv. The melody is deceptively simple because the heroine, Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts), is able to play it on the out-of-tune piano of an orphanage in China. But, at the same time, it is hauntingly beautiful because it has the power to remind Kitty, her husband Walter (Edward Norton), and the audience of the moment they met and he, at least, fell in love. The \"Gnossienne\" has certainly remained indelibly engraved in my mind, as memorable as Satie's \"Gymnop\u00e9dies\".\n\nApart from the music, \"The Painted Veil\" is a film I was admittedly reluctant to see on the strength of the preview. But I'm glad I finally went. I had expected a romantic-epic saga. Instead, the film tells the tale of a less than romantic relationship that eventually blooms into true, deep, and lasting love. \"The Painted Veil\" serves as a salutary reminder that, like the music of Satie's \"Gnossienne\", love need not always be a stirring, sweeping passion but can also be delicate and sweet."

I, like Edward Norton, want this film to resonate in America, so that a wider audience will be able to appreciate such an intelligent and important film.\n\nFrom the opening scenes in London when Edward Norton spots Naomi Watts, his brilliant portrayal of an English doctor is one in which you would never know that Mr. Norton is an American. The elegance and simplicity of Norton's performance is one that I am disappointed was not recently recognized for a Golden Globe. His painful journey of loving a woman who doesn't love him, on top of the dedication to his research and his travels to China to help with a Cholera epidemic, is one character that I shall remember all year. Bravo, Mr. Norton!\n\nNaomi Watts as the wife is tremendous in her role and her final journey to the end of the film with her husband and realizing what a wonderful man she married hopefully will bring an Oscar Nom for her. And, the incredible DianaRigg as a French Nun rounded out a cast that is superlative.\n\nThe locations and the photography were beautiful to behold and enhanced the story and the characters own journeys. With THE PAINTED VEIL, Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton, have delivered memorable performances that shall last for a long time, both on the screen, and in the minds of the audience."

        "review_title": "Whatever Happened to Somerset Maugham: POSSIBLE SPOILER",
        "review_detailed_main": "Fifty years ago Somerset Maugham was considered a major novelist. \"The Painted Veil\" captures his story-telling skills -- and his limitations. Set mostly in China in the mid-1920's, it is as much a period piece as a typical Jane Austen movie. But what interested me most about this film is that it shows that Maugham himself was a period novelist. Austen movies remain topical essays on the human heart as seen from a woman's perspective. \"The Painted Veil\" has a well-bred young woman (Naomi Watts) marrying an infectious disease specialist (Edward Norton), whom she does not love and accompanying him to Shanghai where she falls in lust with a married British ex pat (Liev Schreiber). When Dr. Walter Fane (Norton's character) reveals his knowledge of his wife's adulterous relationship, Kitty (Watts' character) flies to her lover to ask him to marry her.\n\nCharlie Townsend (Schreiber's character) isn't the least interested. Dr. Fane makes it clear to Kitty that he doesn't love her any longer, that he holds her in contempt and that he is going to the interior to deal with a cholera epidemic, and she has no choice but to accompany him. Reuniting Walter and Kitty in the end because of Kitty's humanitarian activities displays Maugham's undoubted skills as a story-teller. And, of course, after passionate sex between Kitty and Walter, it turns out that Kitty is pregnant, almost certainly with Charlie's child. But after Walter's death from cholera, Kitty remains steadfastly loyal to his memory and, meeting Charlie in London with her son in tow, Kitty coolly rebuffs his attempt to rekindle their relationship.\n\nWhat rings false about \"Painted Veil\" is Kitty's easy submission -- first to marriage to a man she does not love and later, after her married lover rejects her, to a miserable trip into China's interior where civil conflict and deadly disease threaten her very existence. To contemporary audiences, the idea that a woman would submit so easily seems impossible (which would not have been true of a well-bred young woman in the mid-twenties, of course). But \"Painted Veil\" is a period film and Maugham was a period novelist. While his stories may remain interesting, they have nothing relevant to say to the present generation. Maugham today is a curiosity. (As an interesting sidelight, Diana Rigg appears in this movie perfectly disguised as a Mother Superior in a nunnery devoted to caring for sick and orphaned children. That's where Kitty redeems herself in the eyes of her husband.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "2006' \"The Painted Veil\" has so much going for it, it should have been another \"English Patient\" -- a retro romance that sweeps awards and captures hearts.\n\nInstead we have that most frustrating creature -- a very, very good movie that just misses the mark of greatness.\n\nEven so - if you like period romances, you may love what is lovable in this movie enough to forgive it its flaws.\n\nWhat \"The Painted Veil\" has going for it:\n\n1.) The plot of the Somerset Maughm novel. A nerdy, scientific, cuckolded husband, who knows his beautiful, shallow, society wife married him because she was dangerously close to being an old maid and wanted to get away from her mother, punishes her for an affair by taking her to a remote Chinese cholera epidemic. Yawza! How operatic!\n\n2.) Sky-high production values. \"The Painted Veil\" was filmed on location in China. Locations were mixed and matched. At one point they were along the Li River, among Guilin's famous karst scenery. Karst is the \"lumpy\" looking limestone topography. Towers rise abruptly, and weirdly, out of river valleys, fringed by lush rice paddies and bamboo. The village Huang Yao is a five-hundred years old, intact Ming Dynasty town.\n\n3.) Edward Norton is perfection. He gives Walter everything he needs -- as the nerdy, scientist cuckold husband, Walter is, by turns, arrogant, insecure, vengeful, loving, sweet, icy cold, naive, calculating ... you see it all on his face, and fear him, feel for him, and forgive him.\n\n4.) Alexandre Desplat's award-winning score. Minimalist, and yet it conveys the plot's sense of entrapped passions and spiritual dimensions. Very good use is made of Eric Satie's Gnossienne # 1 and \"A La Claire Fontaine,\" a French folksong whose bittersweet lyrics, which can be found on the web, are so appropriate to the plot that they are heartbreaking.\n\n5.) Diminutive blond Toby Jones' depiction of Waddington, a British provincial officer who is just barely keeping up appearances, in his day old stubble, shabby, sweat-stained suits, and live-in Chinese lover, young enough to be his daughter. Jones pumps this small role full of life. In another actor's hands Waddington would have been forgettable; with Jones, he's one of the most interesting features of the movie.\n\n6.) The Love / Sex / Death / Religion / Self-Sacrifice nexus that modern pop culture doesn't even seem to realize exists; any work of art that reminds us that what we love is mortal and that God and Sex live next door to each other in our brains / souls / lives is way ahead of the pack.\n\n7.) A scene from a Chinese opera. A vermilion and turquoise costume. Lin Zheng's brilliant performance.\n\n8.) Anthony Wong as Colonel Yu. Again, a minor part, but Wong is riveting.\n\nWhat I wish had been different: 1.) Liev Schreiber has an unmistakable earnestness that just doesn't work for him to be believable as a rack, cad, and bounder. He was much better as the earnest, befuddled cuckold in \"Walk on the Moon.\"\n\n2.) Naomi Watts. She's very pretty and very sweet and I just never, ever believed her as a shallow, devastatingly beautiful socialite who could drive two men to irresponsible action.\n\nI kept thinking of Greta Garbo in the original \"Painted Veil,\" or Vivien Leigh as that insufferable monster, Scarlett -- as much as you hate her, you are fascinated. Not so with Watts.\n\n3.) John Curran's direction. This is a MELODRAMA, John. Walter says, \"I despise myself for loving you.\" Kitty says, \"If a man doesn't have what it takes to make a woman love him, that's his fault.\" I mean, how can you direct that so anemically? As if they are asking for change to buy cheez crackers from the vending machine? In melodrama, you have to turn up the heat, send a few lightening bolts across the screen.\n\n4.) The ending. I didn't need a happy or a sad ending. I just needed an ending that would serve the plot, and feel less like a dead end, a flat tire, that drained, rather than contributed, meaning to what has come before."

        "review_title": "Ponderous and predictable, gloomy \"romance\" with lush scenery and some strong performances",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Painted Veil\" is a film based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel of the same name. The story is of an upper class, independent-minded woman, Kitty (Naomi Watts), in mid-1920s England. Her family is anxious to marry her off, and she quickly finds herself as the wife of infectious disease researcher Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton). He takes her to his work in Shanghai and then to the remote village Mei-tan-fu in the Southern Chinese province of Guangxi, where he has volunteered to help to combat a deadly cholera epidemic.\n\nThe story is one of marriage to a man so focused on his work that he only speaks when something needs to be said, a passionless relationship that formulaically leads to extra-marital passion. Almost as penance, Walter announces that they are going to a place that Kitty feels no (English) woman belongs, without consulting Kitty and with no regard to her interests or well-being. The stark choice for her is to face shameful divorce or join in; when Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) all too predictably declines to leave his wife and marry his love, Kitty, there seems to be no choice at all.\n\nDespite some strong performances, particularly by Naomi Watts, Dame Diana Rigg in the film as the vivacious Mother Superior in charge of an orphanage, gorgeous scenery, and expectations to enjoy what I thought would be a romantic period film like many others that I have relished (such as Merchant Ivory Productions' 1992 \"Howards End\" or 1985 \"A Room with a View\"), I had serious reservations about \"The Painted Veil\". I thought that the story was rather ponderous and predictable with flawed character development.\n\nI found unrealistic Walter's cold detachment and irresponsibility to not even inoculate his wife. Much as Kitty's character is developed reasonably well, she bears the cross of her predicament in a manner that doesn't seem consistent with her pre-marital characterization. Her somehow uncrushed spirit and the scenes in the orphanage provided much needed respite from the stern, closed Walter.\n\nThe couple's relationship, initially of course a societally imposed one, grew into one that never made sense to me. Walter's almost total self-absorption and lack of sensitivity (such as initially banning all of the villager's sources of water without considering how they would drink - not much of a boon to the community or a cogent public health approach) further hardened and distanced his characterization. In fact, with few exceptions (such as eccentric neighbor Waddington played by Toby Jones), many of the other characters were, to me, relatively flat.\n\nClearly on the personal level there was Walter's patronizing and very unfriendly demeanor, but there was otherwise little plot development about anti-colonialistic resentment of the Chinese toward the English. The more pernicious colonial impact the British had on India seems to be much better known than the Opium Wars and colonial influence in China in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the film could have encouraged a little curiosity by revealing a bit more historical fiction rather than relying on some unspecified fears. Ann Hu's 2000 film \"Shadow Magic\" is but one example that I am reminded of that weaves a much richer background tapestry.\n\nOn the other hand, the scenery was magnificently shot in soft, lush scenes that provided an interesting contrast to the harsh story. Waddington and Mother Superior offer clever dialogue; it was charming, for example, to hear the nun reflect, \"I fell in love when I was seventeen {pause} with God. A foolish girl with romantic notions \u0085. But my love was passionate. Over the years, my feelings have changed. He's disappointed me, ignored me. We've settled into a relationship of peaceful indifference. The old husband and wife who sit side by side on the sofa but rarely speak. He knows I will never leave him, this is my duty. But when love and duty are one, then grace is within you.\"\n\nI liked the costumes, music, and flow of the film, with powerful nonlinearities reinforcing Kitty's entrapment. Walter's eventual understanding that aiding others suggests not a condescending but a compassionate sense of working together, may offer a gentle reminder of some relevance in contemporary society, whether in regard to diplomacy, warfare, or dealing with still current issues of poverty and disease. In a very real sense, the film itself offers promise as, I believe, the first film co-produced between the Chinese government and a Western studio.\n\nI often enjoy romantic historical fiction and, based on other reviews that I have seen (and some awards, such as a Golden Globe for Best Original Score), expect some other enthusiasts of the genre (if indeed this film can be called \"romantic\") to find more merit in \"The Painted Veil\" than I did. I do recommend for those that those who want to see it to experience it while it is on the big screen; the impact of the mountains, rice fields, water, and crowds need to be appreciated in the large.\n\n6 stars out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Painted Veil is an enjoyable adaption of a Somerset Maugham novel. It's about a British couple and their marital troubles and it's set in China in 1925. Britain is the colonial power and there is tension with the locals. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is a nerdy MD who runs a medical facility in Shanghai. On a trip back to London he falls in love with Kitty Koerber (Naomi Watts) after meeting her at party. He proposes and she accepts, although she doesn't love him.\n\nKitty is a frivolous and spoiled socialite and she quickly becomes bored with expat life. She has an affair with a married diplomat Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). Walter finds out and threatens to reveal their adultery and divorce Kitty if she doesn't help him treat a cholera epidemic in the hinterland. Kitty slowly develops a social conscience and helps the nuns at a local orphanage. She grows to love Walter as he tends the sick and dying. Walter had planned the trip to punish Kitty but he gradually forgives her. Toby Jones plays a friendly but decadent local British official who enjoys opium and the charms of his Chinesse mistress.\n\nThe film is about grown-up relationships and the characters are complex and articulate. The acting is excellent, although Watts is a little old to play the ing\u00e9nue."

We were only six people in the house for the screening.\n\nDiana Rigg as a French Mother Superior didn't sound French in the least. One reviewer said that she was almost unrecognizable in the role. Incredible! She looked like the Diana Rigg of all time.\n\nThe lead stars were producers of the film and they must have believed in it, but somehow their performances fall flat. The trailer teases us to believe that this will be an exotic love story pictured in an equally exotic setting. Sometimes I found myself not believing that there would be any dramatic truth to the finale and I wasn't mistaken. I think that the director, John Curran, is a so-so talent and his lack of imagination short changed the drama.\n\nDisappointing, and unusual for me, I'm not interested in seeing this movie again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Walter (Edward Norton) is an English doctor and bacteriologist who has chosen to try and help improve conditions in China. On leave in London, he wants to find a wife and casts his eye on pretty Kitty (Naomi Watts). Kitty is a spoiled society girl who resists Walter's overtures, at first. Nevertheless, when she hears her mother complaining about her to friends, Kitty decides to marry the doctor. Bliss does not follow. Walter is a gentleman who has difficulty expressing his feelings and is very absorbed in his work, too. Young and foolish, Kitty finds affection in the arms of another man named Charlie (Liev Schrieber). But, when Walter finds out about the fling, he gives Kitty an ultimatum. Go with him to the interior of China to aid in a cholera epidemic or face disgrace. For various reasons, they make the trip but they are still seething with resentment towards each other. Can anything good come out of this situation? This is a movie in the grand tradition of David Lean or Merchant and Ivory. The story, based on a Somerset Maugham novel, is first rate, with characters most interesting and complex. All of the actors do a great job, with Norton and Watts giving excellent performances as two very difficult people who learn how to truly love their fellow human beings. As for the China setting, it is exotic and breaktakingly beautiful and the cinematography captures it very well. Compliments should also be extended to the costumes and overall production values. The only drawback for some viewers may be the slow pace and the lack of slam-bam action. This is primarily a movie of character study and that, sometimes, requires patience. For those who stay with the film, however, the rewards are tenfold and more. It is a most beautiful movie, in every way, and one which most viewers will want to see many, many times over the coming years."

The couple, Dr. Walter Fane, played fine by Edward Norton and his wife played by Naomi Watts. Her character is particularly troubling. She is quite promiscuous and unfaithful to her husband with Liev. Schreiber's character. Her husband Dr. Walter Fane is a bacteriologist during the cholera epidemic and needed in a remote region in China. After their marriage, he falls madly in love with her and she marries him to escape her parents. I found Norton's Walter to be cold and cruel at times to her. I found Watts to be captivating and complicated at the same time. Dame Diana Rigg has a supporting role as a Mother Superior in an orphanage. Toby Jones was wonderful in playing Waddington. I just found him to be compelling and worth watching. The cast is first rate. The story is a bit uneven at times. In the end, I felt cheated. Despite the beauty of China in this film, the film's script needed more to keep it going. I enjoyed it though but mostly because I found Watts and Jones to be the outstanding roles in the film and of course, Dame Diana Rigg, too."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a novelist, Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) might have been, as he said himself, \"in the very front row of the second rate\", but he told a good story. The film-makers here have altered Maugham's story somewhat but they have not lost track of its essentials \u0096 a marriage based on superficial attraction on the part of the husband (Walter) and a desire to get away from her family on the part of the wife (Kitty) matures into a real love-match under adverse conditions. This is despite Kitty having being brought up to be a vacuous socialite and Walter being emotionally repressed and very controlling.\n\nAs befits a period piece the film has an old-fashioned look about it (except for the opening montage), but good cinematographic use is made of the Karst landscape around Guilin in Guangxi province and the performances are almost faultless. The Chinese people themselves, in the middle of both a cholera epidemic and a civil war, are given more prominence than Maugham gave them. This is welcome and does not detract from the central story.\n\nNaomi Watts is a fine feckless and then fighting Kitty (a tough class \u0096 Garbo played her in the 1934 version) and Edward Norton gets Walter, the man of science overtaken by emotion just right, though at times I wondered whether another very uptight character he has played, Derek Vinyard of \"American History X\" was seeping through. Liev Schreiber did not have a lot to do as Kitty's faithless lover but he did it well. Tony Jones was very good as the backwoods colonial official Waddington, who, like many of his ilk had 'gone native' but had not lost his manners. Anthony Wong gave a rounded performance as Colonel Yu, the local Kuomintang army commander. I chuckled to see Diana Rigg as a French nun with a very British accent, but she had some of the best lines.\n\nI'm pleased to see this film did well in its first week of its much delayed Australian release (it took over $600,000, according to \"The Australian\" of 30 April 2008). And why not? Here is a good story well filmed with interesting characters well portrayed set in an exotic locale (for us Westerners at least). Perhaps a little dated and with most appeal to an older audience, but plenty of us will still stagger out to the movies to see a sound piece of film-making like this."

He doesn't love her more than she loves him but she is made to feel guilty and she is punished, and its all and well within the massage of the film. It has no underlying layers. Part of why it is boring. So what happens to Kitty is irritating, but her character does not come alive. She looks pathetic at the convent. Kitty and Walter are supposed to change and develop through their ordeal, but everything is so predictable and so shallow. The wise, quirky neighbor? come on. its a made for TV drama, at best. I am not a lover of melodramas but if you want to see a good recent one, see The Lives of Others."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Painted Veil\" (2006) was directed by John Curran and adapted from a novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The movie is set in China in the 1920's, during an outbreak of cholera. Naomi Watts plays Kitty Fane, a beautiful and spoiled young woman who marries her physician husband basically for want of something better to do.\n\nDr. Fane (Edward Norton) works in a British government medical laboratory in Shanghai, and volunteers to travel to the area of the cholera outbreak, although he's a scientist, not a clinician. This assignment is doubly dangerous, because the area is only partially under control of the regular Chinese army. Power is shared with the local war lord. All the Chinese resent the foreigners, even those--like Dr. Fane--who are trying to help them.\n\nThe plot revolves around the relationship between the Fanes as they confront this dangerous, unstable situation. Although both Watts and Norton are excellent, I thought the acting honors were earned by Toby Jones, who plays Waddington, the English official assigned to the area. Waddington has seen it all and done it all, and he's obviously stuck in this remote region because he doesn't really fit in with the Shanghai diplomatic elite.\n\nThis movie is about love, betrayal, and redemption. The acting is strong, the scenery is breathtaking, and the conclusion is dramatic but believable. It's not a film you'll easily forget.\n\nP.S. Diana Rigg (yes, that Diana Rigg) plays the old Mother Superior of a convent and orphanage in the region. I've never known a Mother Superior, so someone will have to tell me whether they are always as portrayed in the movies--intensely spiritual and yet pragmatic and wise in the ways of the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "This simply gorgeous and scandalously overlooked 2006 release manages to be a sweeping old-fashioned Hollywood romance while completely avoiding the righteous bombast that usually makes movies like this so intolerable.\n\nBased on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham (and apparently filmed at least once before with Greta Garbo in the starring role), this film tells the story of a young and impetuous English lady (Naomi Watts) who rashly decides to marry a stuffy bacteriologist (Edward Norton) to escape the displeasure of her family and the danger of turning into a spinster. The two move to China, where the doctor pursues his work and the young woman becomes increasingly bored. She begins an affair with a swaggering compatriot (Liev Shreiber), and when her husband catches her at her game, he decides to punish her by volunteering his aid to a cholera epidemic that is ravaging a remote village, and drags her along with him. Once there, and in the face of something vastly larger than either of them, the two begin to realize how petty their marital squabbling is, and each begins to see the good in the other that up to that point was hidden entirely by the bad. The love that develops between them is not the phony, hyperbolic, passionate love that Hollywood aggressively tries to convince us exists, but rather the much more realistic love that is based on mutual admiration and respect.\n\nThe characters played by Watts and Norton are fascinating, and the two actors do an amazing job inhabiting them. This project was obviously their baby, as both served as producers, and their passion for it shows. They also happen to have a great deal of screen chemistry together. The film is superbly intelligent and unsentimental, and God love it for that. My wife and I found out after watching it together that both of us separately and without knowing it were reminded of \"Brief Encounter,\" one of our favorite movies. It's not like that 1946 masterpiece in terms of plot, but it's very much like it in terms of tone and in its attitudes about love and relationships. Both films are frank and candid about the many flaws human beings bring to their interactions with other human beings, and both honestly address the distinction between love and lust and don't try to pretend that they always go together.\n\nOn top of all that, the film looks spectacular. It's the kind of period drama that the Academy usually wets itself over, so I can't imagine how it was overlooked in categories like art direction, cinematography and costume design. But perhaps the fact that the Academy completely ignored it is the highest endorsement I can make for it.\n\nGrade: A"

One can doubt whether the British in general had such motives when leaving for the colonies but one can not deny that at least some had. The contrast between the British and the Chinese is well developed and the movie does not fail to portray the superstitious prejudices of the Chinese masses as well as the sheer egoism of certain traditional Chinese old fashioned rulers while the more progressive Chinese elements are described in the person of the Chinese high-ranking military officer assisting the doctor.The role of the Mission is well put and is positive overall although the doctor does not fail to put to his wife that it might have selfish motives after all. The frivolous British diplomat and his snobbish wife are members of the British expatriate set in Shangay and do not get very good press.The finale is also very effective in its' ambiguity.The reconstruction of the age in costumes and buildings is also convincing and well-researched."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil is a an American-Chinese co-production based on the eponymous novel by A. W. Somerset Maugham. It is also a remake of the same-titled film filmed in 1934 starring Greta Garbo, and The Seventh Sin filmed in 1957 with Eleanor Parker. The movie tells the troubled relationship of a couple of newly-weds: Kitty Fane, a shallow middle-class girl who marry for practical reasons and without love, and her husband Walter Carwin, a fine epidemiologist going to China to fight an outbreak of cholera, who falls in love with Kitty at first sight.\n\nThe movie goes beyond the usual romance story or period movie, and has a good insight into the historical events occurring in China in the 1920s, but also into the differences between infatuation and true love, which is the focus of the film. This is a story about human connection in a broad level: Connection between different cultures (in this case the British and the Chinese, and how Colonialism affected them) and connection at an intimate level, both with your inner self (seeing a facet of your own personality that you did not know existed), and with another person (husband and wife).\n\nThe movie was filmed completely on location and has a an authenticity to it that is difficult to find nowadays, when most movies are set in a country and filmed in a completely different one. The historical setting, the costumes, and the music create a wonderful atmosphere, very similar to the one old movies used to have. The music by Alexandre Desplat and the cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh are simply magnificent.\n\nRegarding the acting, I initially thought that the leading couple of Naomi Watts (Kitty)-Edward Norton (Walter) weren't suited as the leading couple, but, after watching the movie, I think think they are, although Norton outshines Watts by far despite this being a role out of his comfort zone. The story would have lost authenticity if the leading actor was a super-handsome glamorous actor, which is not what men were at the time; Norton convincingly portrays the logical man of the time, right in his manners, rational, a foolish romantic, a man of honor, and not very expressive emotionally. Naomi Watts is OK in her performance, but somewhat I couldn't believe she was a woman of the 1920s in her looks, body language or performance; in fact she doesn't have any chemistry on camera with her real life husband Liev Schreiber (who plays diplomat Charlie Townsend). Toby James is very good as the sensitive and common sensed Waddington, as well as Diana Rigg as the very human Mother superior, and Anthony Wong Chau-Sang as Colonel Yu. Schreiber is just correct in his portray of Charlie, whose character is just a mere catalyst in the story. The rest of the cast is good in their respective roles.\n\nA beautiful and enjoyable old-fashioned love story."

Where it failed was that there was no noticeable progression of feeling between the two main characters. A non-involved observer is not aware of the depths of jealousy and passion that lurk beneath the surface of Kitty and Walter. Edward Norton adopted an excellent English accent and I found his acting style appropriate to the piece.

        "review_detailed_main": "Others may well disagree, but what I found most disappointing about this movie was the lack of any obvious passion - strange for a movie that depicts itself as a romance. The movie essentially narrates the origins and development of the relationship between Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) and Kitty (Naomi Watts), who becomes his wife, and yet for the most part the Fanes don't seem to possess either blinding love or boiling hatred - mutual disinterest and contempt might be the best way to describe most of their time together.\n\nEssentially, Fane takes Kitty to Shanghai where he works as an infectious disease researcher. He largely ignores her, and after discovering that she's having an affair with a local British diplomat, he packs them both off to a small, remote village suffering from a cholera epidemic. The relationship evolves in this village.\n\nFrankly, this is neither a bad movie nor a great one. It's quite slow-paced and lacking in passion as I've noted above. It also provides an interesting look at the effects of cholera. Having visited a rural (and less remote) area of China as recently as 2005, I have to say that I thought the conditions in the remote village portrayed here (cholera notwithstanding) seemed too good - I'm thinking here of the state of repair of the buildings.\n\nAnyway, this gets a 4/10 from me for a decent enough ending to a somewhat uninspiring movie."

This is pure melodrama and it drags a bit at times, but the acting is great with Watts looking stunning and perfectly portraying the bored and sensual wife. Edward Norton, one of the best actors of the decade, gives a performance that is almost too stiff at times, but still is pretty convincing as a British doctor despite the corny accent. The directing is smooth and consistent, the cinematography gorgeously shows the wonders of China, and the ending is something to be remembered. Overall, this is a beautiful period piece that reminded me very much of the old classic love stories. There are a lot of problems here, but you know they will be worked out."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am usually not a fan of romantic drama's but the dark twist and setting of this movie made me throughly enjoy it.\n\nThe plot: A young doctor (Edward Norton) enters an emotionless marriage with rich, rather spoiled woman(Naomi Watts) and struggles through his relationship, whilst aiding a Chinese village plagued by cholera.\n\nThe writing: Is good and contains a lot of symbolism that could be more subtle. The village they are in symbolized their relationship and its condition changes accordingly. This was done very cleverly and allowed the scenario Norton and Watts to coincide with their relationship. The script itself has some schmaltzy moments but it did endear me to the characters. The conversations between to the two main leads felt natural and none of the lines are ham fisted. The final act (though not as powerful as other dramas ala The Pianist)was effective to make me feel sympathetic to the characters in the movie, due to the atrocities they have experienced. The balance between the plague and the emotional turmoil experienced by the main leads is amazing, and allows the movie to have some spectacularly dark and jubilant scenes.\n\nThe acting: Norton and Watts do a solid performance that is both believable and enjoyable. I truly felt the happiness, hatred, and love they emoted at the camera. However I thought the Asian side characters where quite weak ,and could have been developed more, being only there to die or provide Asiatic stereotypes. Toby Jones is also to be commended for his great performance as an English ambassador.\n\nThe cinematography: The movie used a lot of soft lighting to the audience bringing out the emotive faces of the actors. There was a nice balance between close up shots of the two leads ,and medium shots to illustrate the plagued state of the village.There were also some beautiful and bleak long shots of the Chinese country side and the village.\n\nThe soundtrack: Great using oriental music to fit in with the background, and a more string heavy track for the more distressing scenes. There is also some classical piano songs (Watts character plays the piano) that fits in well with the more western areas of the town (the church/orphanage), and scenes shot in a western district.\n\nCriticism: I thought the ending was quite clich\u00e9 albeit executed perfectly. There were some scenes developing Watts character that were kind of dull (involving the church, and her being bored), and i thought those could have been used to develop Norton's character more (who seemed much more nuance).\n\nThis movie definitely deserves a rent and can be quite heart wrenching given the right circumstances.\n\n7.6/10"

The Painted Veil is one of those incredibly compelling films which deals directly with the human condition, specifically under conditions which warrant reaction. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and Liev Schreiber create an ensemble fitting of a Maugham novel, and their performances are flawless.\n\nFlawless as well is the cinematography and photography in this wonderful adaptation of the novel. Filmed entirely in China, the scenery is breathtaking and lends to the authenticity of the film. This also enhances the \"illusion of the first time\" which is so critical in any film, since the novel is set in China. A huge cast of extras is included.\n\nThe Painted Veil is a film which may not be suitable for the entire family (Rated PG-13 for some scenes of sexuality, partial nudity, disturbing images and brief drug content), but I don't believe it will offend older children, and I know it will entertain anyone who likes a well-acted film."

In flashbacks, their marital troubles are revealed. Kitty found him lackluster at first but her mother threatened to cut her off. In China, she had an affair with the dashing married diplomat Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). She wanted a divorce and run off with Charlie but Charlie won't get a divorce himself. The question is if the couple can reconnect in the Chinese wilderness in revolutionary times. The only neighbors are the Deputy Commissioner Waddington (Toby Jones) and his Chinese woman. A guard is assigned to her as foreigners face threats.\n\nThis is not the sappy romance as one would expect. It is darker than at first glanced. Walter doesn't start in the best light and neither does Kitty. Their reconciliation is something slowly earned. The major drawback is that the couple needs more time together and the movie is a bit too long. Cholera is not necessarily the most sexy thing and she has no good way to get into that part of the story."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil has it all going for itself. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton leading, two great actors. An interesting theme and issue, Cholera in China in 1920 and a great location to tease beauty from, but none of this is taken to its advantage.\n\nDirector John Curran shoots this self-named political romance in a way where it's so trying to be unique, that it turns out to be not so. Curran seems to refuse to even attempt at pulling away from the dreary, wooden lifestyle of the early 1900's that is so majorly presented in other films, and therefore throughout the film seems to sort of descend into not even trying to be unique anymore.\n\nHaving not much earlier experience or success, Curran seems to have jumped at the opportunity of a movie about a politically buckling country, after seeing the Oscar success those types of films have had recently. Namely, The Last King of Scotland and Blood Diamond. In all the excitement however, Curran seems to have forgotten that to have winning political films like them, the films have to be good.\n\nBut, I shouldn't rant on about John Curran when the obvious major culprit is the screenwriter. Ron Nyswaner tries but fails at creating thought provoking and understated dialogue and story. It's heartbreaking when you can tell he has obviously tried at making it these things when it just turns out to look flimsy and thin under the influence of such a promising cast. Edward Norton strives to get something out of his sketchy and single-mooded character but again, fails, just like the rest of the crew on this film.\n\nHowever, there are moments of genuine flair, but this only occurs in obvious exciting bits, which makes you think the Director only chose to do the film for these sequences. Long half hour dull patches are injected with 1 minute scored sequences of someone dying of cholera and the disgust on Edward Norton's face, and despite these only being the good bits because, finally, there's something interesting to watch, you do feel that there may be a tiny bit of promise for the rest of the film, but guess what\u0085the score stops, Norton stops looking disgusted, and we cut to Naomi Watts, sitting in a chair sighing again.\n\nThe writer seems to have run out of ink only when he had established 2 plot lines, a novelty guard, and the idea that making the characters British makes them deep in itself.\n\nSomehow, however, this film drags these 2 plot lines, the guard and the British accents along with it for the whole 2 and a bit hours, to solidify the fact that Naomi Watts isn't as good as everyone says, that just because movies are about redemption and political issues with foreigners, it doesn't make them good, and that The Painted Veil, overall, is a thin, and boring movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Painted Veil\" is an American excursion into the traditionally British territory of \"heritage cinema\", although much of the story is set in China and it is based upon a novel by a British writer, W. Somerset Maugham. It is essentially a study of a dysfunctional marriage. The two parties to that marriage are very different in personality. Walter Fane is a shy, socially awkward doctor, working as a bacteriologist for the Chinese government. While on leave in London, he meets and falls in love with Kitty Garstin, a shallow and empty-headed young socialite. Although she is not in love with him, she is flattered by his attentions and marries him at the urging of her domineering mother. Following the marriage, the couple go to live in Shanghai, where Walter works in a laboratory.\n\nThe marriage is not a success and Kitty is bored by her husband, who seems dull and unable to respond to her emotionally. She begins an affair with Charles Townsend, the British vice-consul. When Walter discovers her infidelity, he threatens to divorce her for adultery unless she agrees to accompany him to a remote area of China where a cholera epidemic is raging and where he has volunteered his services. When Townsend refuses her request that he should leave his wife and marry her, Kitty is left feeling that she has no choice but to accept Walter's ultimatum. During the first half of the twentieth century- the story is set in 1925- there was a curious social convention that it was morally worse for a wife to cheat on her husband than vice versa. Maugham clearly felt that, for some women at least, the risk of dying from cholera was preferable to the stigma of being named as the guilty party in a divorce case.\n\n\"Heaven hath no rage like love to hatred turned\" wrote Congreve in \"The Mourning Bride\", and this is Walter's motivation for dragging his wife on a long, arduous and dangerous journey; his love for her has turned to hatred and he is determined to punish her for her affair with Townsend. Yet, unlike Congreve, Maugham clearly believed that hatred could turn back into love. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, where they live in squalid accommodation, Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other. Yet under the strain of their difficult circumstances, they begin to discover good qualities in one another. Kitty, who once saw Walter as dull and emotionally cold, now begins to appreciate him for his courage, determination and selflessness. Perhaps more surprisingly, he also begins to see good qualities in Kitty, whom he had previously regarded as shallow and selfish.\n\nDirector John Curran said that he wanted the movie to look distinctly Chinese, and to this end it was shot on location in a mountainous area of China; the village we see is real, not a set. Curran's purism must have added to the cost of shooting the film, but I think that it is justified, for two reasons. The first is that, visually, this is a strikingly attractive film. The second is that the film is not just the story of Walter and Kitty's marriage, but is also about China itself. In a way, it is a film about colonialism, but not about the direct political variety, unlike Maugham's novel which was set in the British colony of Hong Kong. The colonialism we see here is of the intellectual and cultural variety, the assumption on the part of Westerners, even many who opposed political colonialism, that ideas originating in Europe or North America were automatically superior to those originating in other parts of the world. Although the film-makers were too tactful to draw direct parallels, Communism can be seen as the ultimate expression of this intellectual colonialism. Many of the disasters which afflicted China in the mid twentieth century, such as the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution were the result of Mao's attempt to shoehorn China into the framework of a nineteenth-century ideology devised by a German sitting in the British Museum and first put into practice in Russia.\n\nEdward Norton, who plays Walter, described his character as \"the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism\". Despite Walter's heroism and selflessness, he brings to his relationships with the Chinese something of the cold rationality he originally brought to his marriage, which means that his efforts are not always appreciated. His performance in this film strengthened my view, derived from films like \"Primal Fear\", \"American History X\" and \"Kingdom of Heaven\" that Norton is one of the most intelligent and thoughtful actors currently working in Hollywood. It always surprises me that he has never won an Oscar. His British accent is pretty good too.\n\nThe other performance that stood out for me was from Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of a local orphanage run by French nuns; Naomi Watts as Kitty and Liev Schreiber as Charles were adequate but not outstanding. The film is at times too slow-moving, but overall it is a well-crafted piece of storytelling. 7/10"

I have always loved Naomi Watts and was interested to see that she was sporting a brunette hair color. Anyway, a few minutes into the film, I realized it was a \"period piece\". After having seen atonement this year, I was prepared to jump into this movie even at the halfway mark. Having to go on the dialog to try to figure out why Ed Norton was so hateful to her, made me realize that I was going to have to see the film from the beginning. I decided to stick it out and the cinematography alone was worth watching a movie half way in. I was able to derive from comments that Kitty had been unfaithful, and that she was paying for it. I was able to watch the movie again later that day and was completely enraptured by the scenery, the story and the characters. The acting is superb, believable and the story is wonderfully scripted. I love the idea that even though they started out so sadly, that there was redemption and love in the end. I think this movie was highly overlooked in the awards arena."

Great performances by Naomi Watts, Edward Norton and Toby Jones (I preferred Diana Riggs mocking glimpses in The Avengers to her sweet loving glances as Mother Superior), but if you would have cut down the scenes of Dr. Fanes self- righteousness to what was really needed, you could have saved half an hour of film."

The couple seems unsuited for each other from the very beginning, but as the stress of the crisis that they're involved in reveals different parts of their personalities to one another, they may find a way to make something less of a disaster of their marriage. \n\nBeyond the obvious relationship aspect of The Painted Veil, it also gives a pretty startling look at how disease was treated at that time, as well as what the British footprint was like in China. I found those parts of the story to really be more interesting than the stuff between Watts and Norton. Other than their dodgy British accents, I though they were fine in their roles. It just would have been nice if events didn't play out exactly as almost anyone could have guessed after the first ten minutes. \n\nHow much you enjoy this period movie will depend directly on how much interest you can put into its fairly typical plot.

His overall sad mien, his intellectual intensity and his surprising flares of passion are riveting.\n\nI got to care what happened to Walter and Kitty over the course of the film. Kitty starts out being a shallow clothes horse, looking to escape from an overpowering ambitious mother, and her character's evolution and growth is the crux of the story.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful and distant and the many bit players are magnificent. Supporting roles of Diana Rigg as a reverend mother and Toby Jones as Waddington, a type of consul in the area, are wonderfully played. Toby Jones pulled me into the world he had created for himself in this barren outpost.\n\nThe theme of journey runs throughout the film, and is also part of the promotional material, I believe. Suffice to say without spoilers is that Walter and Kitty go very far indeed to bridge the distance between each other.\n\nMarvellous, satisfying film. Both stars are amazingly authentic in these magnificent roles. 8 out of 10."

Naomi Watts is just as good and provides a complex character that elicits all kinds of genuine emotions from the viewer: she's flighty and flakey at times, she's sincere and somber, she's flawed and horrible yet has redeeming qualities that make her impossible not to root for. Add in the most delicately balanced screenplay and easily the most visually stunning cinematography of the past 20 years, and you've got the recipe for a 10-star film."

A movie like this needs patience and I understand not everyone was in the right mood to enjoy it, but to my shock, one negative review, which gives 4 out of 10 to it simply because 4 sounds like death in Chinese, is way too mean. I see this movie as not perfect and there's room for improvement, however I admire the passion its cast and crew showed that makes up the missing 1 point and adds up to a perfect 10.\n\nMost negative comments say the painted veil is \"long and dull\". I agree it is long albeit I didn't feel so at watching, but I won't say it's dull. This movie is very eventful IMHO, where transformation takes place gradually and quietly and can be felt through details, just like how changes happen in our life. Such subtlety keeps me engaged throughout the 2 hours. The painted veil isn't as dramatic as some movies that give the audience a twist every several minutes, and it doesn't unnecessarily prolong \"important\" events to dramatize itself. The climax is achieved after the audience's emotion has been slowly built up during those transformations, and it ends succinctly, leaving us to think. I like this way of story telling, simple but precise, nothing wasted. What else I like about this movie, such as acting, screenplay, music and etc, has been mentioned so many times. So I won't repeat them again.\n\nBravo to the team! Thank you for bringing us a wonderful movie!"

Yet with ingredients such as great story, leading couple with incredible chemistry and talent and scenery to die for, it delivers and enchants the audience.\n\nYou have to wonder why they don't make more movies like this anymore.

        "review_detailed_main": "Bored rich girl Kitty (Naomi Watts) marries shy, overly series microbiologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton), mainly to get away from her parents who disapprove of her irreverent lifestyle. Stunned by his wife's brief affair with the caddish Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber), Walter threatens to ruin her reputation by divorcing her, unless she accompanies him into an area of China ravaged by a cholera epidemic. Against this background of hardship and disease they learn to love each other. Maybe for the first time.\n\nAlthough it sometimes surfs too close to the perilous waters of self parody, I actually rather liked \"The Painted Veil\". I wasn't at all surprised that it had been filmed before in the 1930's. Except for some pretty graphic scenes of death by cholera, it is exactly the kind of old fashioned Sunday afternoon melodrama that my Mom used to love so much (and probably still does).\n\nNaomi Watts suffers prettily. (Make no mistake, she is gorgeous, even unwashed and sweaty.) Edward Norton tries on an English accent and finds that it fits. (He is almost an alien from a distant civilization in his buttoned up cream suit. It works, as well, showing his isolation from his wife.) Toby Jones essays an old school English diplomat abroad. (Nearly gone native.) Liev Schrieber is a... er... cad. (Sadly without the strokable moustache). Old fashioned, solid film making. Not the kind of thing I would normally see, frankly, but a grown up proper movie, a world away from robots, wizards, green ogres and Bruce Willis in a vest.\n\nWorth a look."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a good romance movie but didn't seem like a great one. What really drives this movie is the two leads played by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts. Edward Norton since it's Edward Norton and Naomi Watts because she is just good at these period piece movies. This movie deals with misunderstandings and how we can miss out on true love because sometimes we try to see the negatives more than the positives in people. And how even when we find true love and are together still don't know it. Since we tend to miss or lose the things that are right in front of us. The story is decent but the leads really moves the movie along. Just wish there was some better development which can lead to a better believability when it comes to the characters. When it comes down to it though the story is about how \"when love and duty are one than grace is within you\". And how we can miss out a lot in a person just by seeing others in a narrow point of view. Yeah, it's kinda moralistic but the movie has quite a value for a romance movie. The story is nothing all that amazing in my opinion but overall it's a good romance flick.\n\n7.5/10"

Liev Shreiber is terrific in a cameo. It is surely one of the best of Naomi and she is simply terrific and subtle. and never miss this gem if u get a chance."

My expectation were huge but after the film had end i felt disappointed. I have to admit the film has a very beautiful sceneries and it has great pictures and really good performance of these 2 actors but the story is quite simple and in the middle of show i knew how it is going to end. I'm not saying the story is bad but for it was to simple and film was to long. There is another thing like matching of Edward and Naomi. They do match together but i think they could have gave a little bit more. I can't resist of compare this film to The Notebook, which i think is the best romance of the 21 century - i know that is a different type of film but i have to do it and i think the couple from The Notebook looked better and more authentic for me. Edward and Naomi couldn't attract my attention as the couple from The Notebook. I know for sure that i will not see another time this movie so thats why i'm giving to The Painted Veil only 6points."

However you really don't care too much about either of these people. To much story is crammed into the time and it feels much longer than it is. Norton who always plays a little weird is much too wooden for any audience to really feel his emotions. Naomi falls in and out of love without any emotions. It's really 2.5 stars and that is mostly for the look of the film and China's incredible scenery. You will want a bath when you get home because even through the color adjusted film you feel the heat and filth of rural China in the 20's. But I always thought Somerset Maugham to be more complicated than what is presented in this movie."

John Curran as director made the film cohesive by having the story told during a tumultuous moment in China's history (The May Martyr's Revolution) which only heightens the drama between Norton and Watts.\n\nI just saw a wonderful interview with Edward Norton, Ron Nyswaner and John Curran at current.TV that delved into the film very thoroughly at www.current.tv/watch/18923466 that I think you'll find very informative, especially if the trailer leaves you cold.\n\nThis film flows like a poem, and I loved it. The visuals of the photography in Hunan province are worth the price of admission alone, and were absolutely stunning. I am betting this movie will get an Oscar for Cinematography.\n\n-Scott"

It is a slow and steadily paced human and interpersonal drama. These are very real and human characters and watching the dynamics between them unfold as the plot moves back and forth is like watching a flower unfold. This is a beautiful and haunting film. If you let yourself go along for the journey you will find yourself caught up in the lives and experiences of these characters and the drama will get inside you and under your skin.\n\nMost of Edward Norton's films (e.g., American X) are just too violent for my taste. I was very moved and pleased to be able to enjoy his famously fine acting in this film. The rest of the cast is just superb. I knew I was in for a treat as I watched Liev Schreiber, Diana Rigg, and Toby Jones appear on the screen.\n\nThe cinematography of the Chinese landscape is stunning. Definitely a film worth seeing on the large screen before it goes to the small screen.\n\nI didn't know they still made films this rich and good."

Wonderfully nuanced performances by Norton and Watts, and the cinematography is some of the better work I've seen in quite awhile. That said, I found two major faults that really work against it: one, it is difficult to comprehend just how much time passes from one section to the next. Sometimes you find yourself thinking several months have passed when it may have actually only been a couple weeks. The other quibble I have is with the story itself - without giving away any spoilers, I found the plot to have been done so many other times - it is just in another setting. Granted, I despised Titanic for some of the same reasons. The difference is that the storytelling is much better here. Just don't watch this movie expecting anything original."

The very competent cast is further undermined by uncertain direction and trite, clich\u00e9 ridden set pieces. Some of the motivating thrust driving characters to action are unconvincing. Perhaps this is the original author's fault, but the film's script has failed to resolve these important issues. The language of the film is very, very 2006. This is frankly laughable. It would be intolerable to listen to a totally authentic rendering of early twentieth century English, but to allow so many crass twenty first century idioms to litter the script is... crass. The photography is very well achieved even a little too beautiful at times for the situation being portrayed. Overall this is a bit of a disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a simple story about the power of love, and the virtue of leading a morally sound life. By the sound of it, you may think I'm a religious fanatic: quite the contrary. I was raised Catholic, but I 'lost the faith' a long time ago. I believe in God yes, but I believe he works within us, within each individual. He is not some grand, all-knowing being with all the answers to the universe in the palm of his hand. In my mind God is the essence of virtue; humble, and at all times learning new things- so that he may know himself better.\n\nSo how in God's name does this relate to the movie? Well, after having seen it, I believe the movie speaks with a touch of God in its voice. This idea is not always financially viable for producers of such movies, but consider the source: with Jean Francois Fonpult, Mark Gill, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton as producers, it makes a lot more sense to me that this movie was made. I have even more respect for them now, being bold enough to fund such a unique and simply developed story.\n\nMoreover the film was beautifully crafted- Stuart Dryburgh's framing and lens mastery were of the best in the business. Alexandre Desplat's score was gorgeous and captivating. Alexandre de Franceschi's editing was superb...a fine balance between art and story. There are no extraneous moments throughout the film- there is no incessant humor to dilute the story, just to fill the cracks. As Norton's character 'Dr.Fane' states: \"...I've not been in the habit of answering questions I had no response to.\" So does this film do its work with graceful and intelligent dialogue: which cuts to the heart of what's at stake for these characters.\n\nActors: Go see this film. There are no bad performances. Each player knows his or her place, and commits to telling the story with discipline and courage. Ron Nyswaner-well done. Directors: What better way to study structure and fluidity and to see the two become one- in a seemingly effortless manner? John Curran's voice is there, but you only hear it through the respective movie's seamless synchronicity of matter and spirit.\n\nMoviegoers: See this film if you want to be moved in a very profound way. If you like action films, this ain't your cup of tea, but if you're ever ready, this film will quietly wait- it will be around for film connoisseurs of the future to say what a beautiful film it was, and see how it was overlooked? Chances are many will not be ready to see what lies beneath the Painted Veil."

The dialog is meaningful and full of insights about marriage, communication, infidelity, forgiveness.\n\nEdward Norton is suited to the distant doctor. Naomi Watts is perfectly lovely and captivating in this difficult role. It's no mean feat that she manages to keep one's sympathies throughout.

Also, one of the thinnest endings for a 2-hour-plus movie I have ever seen. It is the story which is most thin. I think all of the shot footage made it into the movie. This is a problem with \"artist as producer\", since both Norton and Watts were executive producers. I would not recommend this even on free TV. 1 out of 10 is nearly too good a rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though some readers who are familiar with the novel, 'The Painted Veil', may have quibbles about the altered sequences and places of action and character emphasis in Ron Nyswaner's screenplay, those disparities pale in comparison to the superb acting and cinematic treatment of Maugham's story about the development of love in the most unlikely situation. John Curran directs his superb cast with fluid movement, allowing the story to unfold in flashbacks in a manner suggestive of the longing and the nightmares of dreams.\n\nBacteriologist physician Dr. Kane (Edward Norton) is devoted to his work, and part of his work is to quickly marry so that he may proceed with his obsession with his career. In London he is introduced to the reluctant Kitty (Naomi Watts), a lass who continues to look for the perfect love of her life, but is confronted with reality when her father demands she marry. Kitty is not attracted to Dr. Kane but agrees to marry him and soon they are off to China. While in Shanghai (no, not Hong Kong) Kitty is bored until she meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) who, though married and a man of public image, sweeps Kitty off her feet. Their affair is discovered by Dr. Kane and he insists that Kitty either follow him to a small village in interior China, a town besieged by cholera, or go public with a divorce. Kitty turns to her lover Charlie who refuses to divorce his society wife and Kitty sadly follows her husband to the sick village.\n\nOnce settled in the village the couple is befriended by a fellow British gentleman Waddington (Toby Jones) and while Dr. Kane works devotedly with his patients and his epidemiological efforts to stem the cholera, Kitty finds refuge with a group of nuns who care for the children of the dead. The Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) helps Kitty to adjust and to see the inherent good in her husband, a man who is not only a fine physician but also able to accept the fact that his once disconsolate wife is pregnant, probably as a result of her dalliance with Charlie Townsend. As the couple begin to accept and appreciate each other the disease strikes home and the story ends with evidence of inner growth in everyone involved.\n\nNorton, Watts, Jones, and Rigg are radiant in their understated roles - Norton's English accent is superb. The beauty of the film is due in a large part to the beauty of the landscapes of China, but also in an equal part to the eloquent cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh and the musical score composed by Alexandre Desplat (with a nod of Satie) and played by pianist Lang Lang. The film is as soft in appearance as a painted veil and the mood it creates lingers - even for those who prefer the written novel! Grady Harp"

Naomi Watts as Kitty Fane, the vain character lifted from this novel by W. Somerset Maugham.\n\nThe original film with Greta Garbo was astoundingly visual and vibrant. That said this is a noteworthy remake, and Watts has depth and her character transforms toward the middle of the film. We see Kitty Fane, a selfish London aristocrat as she first meets the doctor. He is smitten with her at the outset. She is indifferent but her mother is an intolerable socialite, and Kitty decides marriage is a good escape.\n\nKitty meets Liev Schreiber and his shallow wife one evening at kabuki theater. She is attracted to him as he is the reverse of her husband, outgoing, Vice-Counsel for foreign relations in China during the cholera epidemic of 1930's. She has an affair which leads to nothing, he will not leave his wife.\n\nMeanwhile her husband learns of the affair and decides that Kitty must accompany him to the rural parts of China where he is doing research to mitigate the cholera outbreak. The visuals are effective and artful, we see the peasants dying in the streets, Kitty is at once horrified and outraged that her husband has required she accompany him.\n\nAfter a time, she meets a Mother Superior (Diana Rigg, you will see in the credits) and Kitty decided to work with the orphan children at the Catholic orphanage if for nothing else, to maintain her sanity and avoid her husband.\n\nKitty plays piano and works with the children, she discovers a better aspect to her personality in that she is maturing, and desirous of internal fulfillment other than cards, tennis and social clubs, as he husband had so maligned her character. She now sees the validity of helping others, to learn more about herself.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack including Satie and other beautiful flowing scenes as the water and mountains of China are shown, lush and misty. Beautiful scenery in the midst of a cholera epidemic. The contrasts are many.\n\nThe end is dramatic yet believable, and she has a son and becomes self-actualized. As she runs into Liev Schreiber in London, she has released that part of her life, he has lost her, and she walks away knowing her life is now complete and peaceful. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A young doctor and his wife, unhappily married in 1920s Shanghai, travel to inland China to help tackle a cholera outbreak. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are outstanding in this period drama that perfectly captures the quiet desperation of women suffocated by social mores. Britain is fast approaching its end of empire phase. Women will soon have suffrage, and China is the sleeping bear beginning to rouse. The script deftly weaves in nods to these momentous social changes, but only as background to a tense marital drama crushing in the unhappiness it brings for its inhabitants. The doctor husband seems to have murderous and/or suicidal intent in dragging his wife to a cholera-infested region. There seems no way back for this couple after initial infidelity, but incredibly they fashion a reconciliation in an unlikely setting. There is top calibre support from Toby Jones and Diana Rigg as the foot soldiers of imperialism. Wonderful production design and cinematography, this is period cinema and literary canon adaptation at its best."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil is more than just a brilliant score, surely. Walter Fane marries Kitty, a spoiled higher class lady whose only rebellion is to marry someone she doesn't give much thought about, just to be away from her mother. Kitty finds another man and thinks she is finally happy, only to be taken aback by the true nature of the man who is unable to leave his wife. Be it a disappointment, or be it self-destruction, she embarks on a journey with Walter to a kingdom far, far away, China, albeit one doomed with a cholera epidemic, with inconceivable consequences. One would think the journey takes them so far away, and yet, in all that despair and too-wild-for-a-British-lady circumstances in Southern China, the real story begins. \"Sometimes the greatest journey is the distance between two people.\" -W. Somerset Maugham.\n\nWalter knows what he needs to do, Kitty thinks he's crazy, Kitty has to follow him, Walter works to save others but destroys himself, Kitty suffers, Kitty thinks, Kitty wants to follow Walter, Kitty becomes Kitty Fane for the first time in a lifetime. It's a painfully real love story, where two people first blindly (yet brilliantly) follow their heart only to find they didn't know any better and yet, embark on a journey together to truly save themselves, and for the most part, each other. It is also a love story that empowers us to want to be better than who we already are, which is truly distinguished through both the narrative originally penned by W. Somerset Maugham and the sometimes chillingly sane adaptation by Ron Nyswaner.\n\nA movie for generations, The Painted Veil will stay a classic for more decades to come. Wonderful cinematography with a backdrop of both England and China in the 1920s; splendid score by Alexandre Desplat that informs his Oscar-worthy achievements; subtle yet emotional performance by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts...there is some life behind every scene to derive and ponder, despite the sometimes gloomy depiction of despair in the epidemic-stricken countryside of Southern China, of course. This is probably the first Edward Norton movie I have seen, even before I caught up with Fight Club. Undeniably, I name The Painted Veil my favorite Edward Norton Movie, but let's see what Motherless Brooklyn has to offer!"

I enjoyed the cinematography throughout the show. Look out for an outstanding performance by Anthony Wong! The plot is nothing extraordinary; it is a typical love story which all movie goers can accept. Do take note of the change in character in the both lead as the film progress. The music and visuals amazingly bleed into one another, and it complements the shifts in the emotions of both Kitty and Walter.\n\nStrangely, this film has not been heavily 'pushed' in the build up to Oscars; I remember all the hype that Cold Mountain had when it first came out. I hope viewers will give this film a chance, despite its lack of publicity."

In this film, all the characters are recreated in a way that reflects their presence in the novel; but nonetheless, the movie falls flat. Key to the book is Kitty's often harrowed internal mental state, which Maugham showcases sympathetically but without asserting that his heroine is in any way morally superior to those around her; in the film, she just glides gracefully through cholera-infested China, superficially special but without the story giving us any real reason for caring for her. Some of the dialogue is clunky (a British doctor describing himself as an 'M.D.', for example), and the added action scenes seem wholly peripheral. Finally, as in 'Madame Bovary', a critical section of the book is the final period, after the death of a key character; but this is shortened and morally simplified in the film. The book is uncannily perceptive in its depiction of all of its characters; this film just passed ineffectually over me."

I am a born romantic so there were some aspects of the film that disappointed me but hey that's life.

The characterization, the cinematography, the music, and the landscapes are breath taking and completely emphasizes the message of the story. I didn't see a bad character in this movie - films such as this can be seriously let down by supporting actors, however this was not the case. Everything from the strange and matter-of-fact neighbour to the sweet, clumsy guard to the quiet and reserved lab partner - everyone played their part to perfection.\n\nMy only complaints are sometimes the lack of expression on Norton's face in the more sentimental scenes and the slow start and fast ending.\n\nI seriously recommend watching this touching and emotional movie - perfect for watching with a boyfriend/girlfriend to learn not only a little history but also to learn of love."

Naomi Watts shines as the lovely yet shallow Kitty Fane and Edward Norton is at his best as the withdraw, heartbroken bacteriologist, Walter Fane. Aside from the sheer beauty that the plot brings to the film, the scenery is one of the most awesome things i have ever seen. It takes place partly in London, then Shanghai, and finally, a rural village in China. The rivers, mountains, and lush location adds a whole other dimension to the movie. I only wish that this movie was more recognized at the awards (Oscars, Golden Globes, etc.) earlier on in the year. You must see this movie! I love it!"

I missed this film in the actual movies, but I have made up for not seeing it there, but buying a copy and watching it about 45 times since.\n\nNaomi Watts is just perfect in this tale of woe, love lost, love forgotten and love never to be? Edward Norton is also perfect just being himself in this complicated love story taking place in the Far East!\n\nThis film makes you feel like you are there with them, that is how good the scenery is, the choice of location is key, the characters are appealing and the tale is compelling to say the least!\n\nI just loved it, and as I said-this one I loved so much I purchased it to re live over again.\n\ni have since read some of the other comments about the film, please I beg of you, see it again-the original book expresses the characters to be from the 1920's ( The Norton character was even more hum drum in the original book, and Naomi's character was a Hotsie totsie type ( so they actually made the movie better than the book:) people don't realize how life was back then-this was true to force for people of that time. give it another chance, it really is a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this movie both Edward Norton and Naomi Watts deliver captivating performances. Norton's portrayal of Dr. Walter Fane is marked by a subtle intensity, capturing his character's internal struggle and complex emotions. Watts, on the other hand, brings a nuanced depth to Kitty Fane, effectively conveying her transformation from a superficial socialite to a deeply introspective individual. Their chemistry and individual performances are central to the film's emotional impact, making it a compelling drama.\n\nEdward Norton and Naomi Watts both deliver remarkable performances in \"The Painted Veil.\" Norton excels in portraying Dr. Walter Fane with a remarkable blend of restraint and emotional depth. His ability to convey internal conflict and a brooding sense of duty adds layers to his character, making Walter's journey from a distant, clinical figure to someone grappling with profound personal changes both believable and compelling.\n\nNaomi Watts, meanwhile, is equally impressive as Kitty Fane. Her performance captures the complexity of Kitty's evolution, from a superficial and self-centered woman to someone who undergoes a genuine transformation and finds deeper meaning in her life. Watts brings a poignant vulnerability to the role, showcasing Kitty's growth and the internal struggles she faces as she contends with her own shortcomings and her evolving relationship with Walter.\n\nTogether, Norton and Watts create a powerful dynamic that drives the emotional core of the film. Their interactions are charged with authenticity, and their performances are instrumental in conveying the film's themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the search for personal growth. Their strong portrayals elevate the story, making \"The Painted Veil\" a moving and memorable cinematic experience."

Every second i expect something to happen - it's very intriguing - the way the story develops...it's like slow river( it's strange definition, but that's the way I feel about it). and the love story makes you feel dizzy only the way the smell of flowers and trees in springtime makes you. For an eternal romanticist like me the love between Walter and Kitty is the perfect one. I love the fact they fall in love after they get married. I really admire Walter Fane. He is strong and tender, sensitive and considerate. Edward Norton is great actor and he is my favourite actor ever since i saw FIGHT CLUB. I love his movies."

The scenery (filmed in Guilin, Guangxi\n\nprovince) is MAGNIFICENT. Interesting to watch the characters go from\n\nloathing one another to a sort of reunion. Definitely worth a watch.\n\nLove the scenery, costumes, music, and melancholy lighting. Would have\n\nliked to see more of Waddington.\n\nJeez, I have to add more lines to my review. Most people have the attention span of a goldfish, IMDb! What else is there to say...wish I saw more from the Chinese character's points of view, so they weren't just stereotypes , i.e. Chinese Peasant #1. Would have liked to known more about the experiences of the French nuns--what gives them pleasure? How about seeing the local foods? There was a humorous scene where Dr. Fane meets up with a Chinese warlord--reminded me of the Supreme Leader of North Korea. Good movie, definitely if you can get though the dreary English scenes--where I wish more character development had occurred--you will love it. And Lieve Schreiber makes an excellent DOUCHEBAG character!"

His British accent was impeccable, to the point that I could not tell the difference. He carried off the accent so easily it surprised me. The film is a little slow and drawn-out, so if you don't like that kind of thing then I would give this a miss if I were you.\n\nWatching the 2 main characters slowly fall in love under the most difficult and tragic of circumstances, was a pleasure. I have never read the novel, but taking the film purely on its own basis, I give it a 9/10. It is a true love story, and wholly believable.\n\nThe downside to the film, and the reason I did not give it a 10, is it is rather long-winded. I became a little bored half way through. Also, I did not like Liev Schreiber in it. I felt he was miscast and his half-hearted attempt at a British accent I found annoying. Especially as both Norton and Watts did such a good job with theirs. But overall, it is an excellent film, if you are into that kind of thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Imagine being in a foreign land, knowing no one but your spouse who hates you. This is exactly what Kitty Fane (Watts) goes through when her husband decides to drag them both into a cholera epidemic in imperialist China. In \"The Painted Veil\", Kitty is a vivacious young woman living in the 1920's England when she agrees to marry the shy, introverted Dr. Walter Fane (Norton) in order to escape her nagging mother. While Walter is desperately in love with her, Kitty is merely indifferent to him. She and her new husband move to Shanghai, China where Walter works a bacteriologist. Kitty soon finds herself falling for the English Vice Consul, Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber). The two soon begin a secret affair. When Walter finds out, he gives Kitty a choice: either accompany him to a small town that is suffering from a cholera epidemic or he will divorce her, creating a huge scandal. As they work through the problems they face due to the cholera, they also learn to appreciate each other.\n\nThis amazing motion picture, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, truly captures what China would have been like at the time the movie takes place and what the English who were living there would have gone through. The main reason why the country is portrayed so realistically is because Warner Independents and Yari Groups, the two companies in charge of the film, collaborated with a Chinese film company to help improve scripts and make it as accurate as possible. The music also adds to the authenticity as it's a mixture of classical European music as well as Chinese-based sounds. The costumes are also accurately portrayed. None of the costumes are over done or out of place for the story. Norton and Watts do a wonderful job of portraying their character's emotions and making them seem like real human beings.\n\nThe one change that I would make to this spectacular movie would be to vary the camera angles somewhat. The shots are almost always straight on and it would add much more variety to the movie as a whole if there were varied shots. Besides that, this is a film that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you are in the mood for a period flick. I would give the movie four out of five stars. \"The Painted Veil\" is a movie that I've seen many times but each time it brings something new to my attention."

Not only a faithful and loving husband, his selfless desire to help others is unbelievable. It's sad that it happens in real life, and most of them weren't given enough recognition. Edward Norton is so soft and his voice is so tiny and gentle, that helped the audience immensely to empathize with him. 2nd, Naomi Watts is so beautiful. Like how is that even allowed?? I felt for her, her eyes are so emotional, and you could actually feel for her sufferance, towards redemption.\n\nThe thing that men do, the silent treatment, whenever you commit a mistake, is painstakingly hurtful. I'm just experimenting words here, aren't I? What I meant to say is that we see Dr. Walter Frane as a selfless, and loyal husband who would never hurt his wife. Yet he punished her, in a very deliberate manner without physically hurting her. He wanted her to own up to her mistakes herself, to feel the remorse by herself.\n\nThis one is definitely worth watching. Very creative dialogue, making it easy for a foreigner to empathize even though it's set in a different era. Great cinematography, and fantastic score! Alexandre Desplat never disappoints."

It features two strong performances from Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, who also produced the movie, giving their participation in it extra meaning. Norton gives a beautifully crafted depiction of Walter, a doctor who is by turns cruel, intent, vulnerable and passionate. Watts is excellent as always in her role as a spoiled socialite completely unsuited for a journey to rural China, but who matures as the movie progresses. Both these performances are textbook examples of how to present a character. The music and clothes, not to mention the stunning photography, give it the sense of a David Lean or Merchant-Ivory production, yet it has far more honesty. The movie will resonate with people who have traveled to China or who are interested in the role of English missionaries (for Walter is something of a missionary) during the pre-WWII era. Moviegoers who enjoyed The Motorcycle Diaries, who liked Watts in 21 Grams and who appreciate the details of film-making should see this movie."

The characters were sublime, the locations just gorgeous, a tragic love story of the kind that simply isn't written anymore. When the last scene faded away, the entire theater sat in silence for several minutes, no one wanting to get up and disturb the magic we were a part of.\n\nThe story begins with Kitty, a young British girl of a marrying age, whose parents are eager for her to leave the nest. She has idealized notions of marriage, and wants to remain single until she finds true love.\n\nDr. Walter Fain, a micro-biologist studying epidemics in Shanghai, \"sees her from across a crowded room\" and immediately takes a liking to her. He is very quiet and shy, but after several walkabouts with Kitty, proposes to her. Kitty is shocked, as she is too self-absorbed to have noticed Dr. Fain's pining.\n\nKitty's parents give her an ultimatum: Marry, or move out and support yourself. Walter promises to do anything it takes to make her happy, so she accepts his proposal. They move to China and all is well for a short time, until Kitty meets dashing, married Charlie. Charlie is everything Dr. Fain is not and Kitty quickly falls in love with him and begins a torrid affair.\n\nNaturally, Walter becomes suspicious and when his fears are confirmed, he exacts revenge by transferring to a very rural and remote part of China that is facing the worst cholera outbreak ever seen. He forces Kitty to accompany him, but continues to punish her by ignoring her, avoiding her and leaving her entirely alone while he works to contain the spread of the epidemic. Will the disdain Kitty and Dr. Fain have for one another overrule their relationship?"

Pretty soon he discovers his wife cheating on him falling for Liev Schreiber behind his back. She gets involved with Liev Schreiber although when the topic for a divorce is raised she gets baffled by an agreement of Edward after Liev flatly rejects her. However she follows Edward to a camp in China (as his agreement demanded) where the disease of Cholera was widespread like an epidemic. Edward being a doctor tries to help the people while she realizes how stupid she had been to betray a guy like Edward. She realizes her mistake and jumps in to assist him in every possible way.\n\nThe movie is wonderfully directed which apparently involved a great storyline. The flick is a worth watch as it toys with human emotions and elucidates both sides of the coin in a subtle manner. You have to sympathize with Norton and Watts sometimes although you would want everything to end happily.\n\nThe credit entirely goes to Edward Norton and Naomi Watts because of their joint venture and the magic that they created together. Although the director John Curran did some great directing here the writer W. Somerset Maugham's novel shouldn't be forgotten which deserves more kudos than anything else. Cinematography was brilliant. The story was well portrayed with an apt screenplay."

I believe it's one to be seen on the big screen -- don't wait for the DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Probably one of the most stylish movies in the past few years. I would say it is a 100% of what Maugham's novel should look like on screen. The colors, the scenery, the mood, the slight touch of old style, the accent gave me the feeling that I am actually inside a book, inside this story, and not only sitting in front of a bright screen chewing Haribos from Candy King. In fact, I forgot all about my Haribos after the first 15 minutes of the movie. What is one of the best achievements of this movie is the successful balance on the thin line between humorous and tragic. Good acting, too. I was 100% on Norton's character's side, although he obviously appears to be a negative personage for his actions towards his wife. What I liked even more is that there are no \"good\" or \"bad\" characters in this movie, and they all seem quite human and real. All in all I consider this movie worth watching. In a relaxed unhurried mood though."

        "review_detailed_main": "To watch this film after having seen the Greta Garbo version of 1934 is a challenge indeed. They are both excellent but at the same time each other's contraries. This version is truer to Somerset Maugham, while the Garbo version is so much more efficient and dramatic. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are bleak and almost insipid in their performances in comparison with the passions of Garbo, Herbert Marshall and George Brent. The 1934 film is also much more interesting in its rendering of the Chinese reality of those days. Compare for instance the couple's visit to the Chinese opera. In 1934 it's a phantasmagoria of festivities, while here it's just one actress miaowing.\n\nOn the other hand, this version is so much more beautiful. The Chinese landscape is intoxicating in its beauty, and Alexander Desplat's music, always enchanting, casts a soft spell of sweetness over the film in a sad mood of inevitability. Edward Norton's role is a difficult one, it is never sympathetic, and Naomi Watts does not cut a very sympathetic figure either, while Greta Garbo still shines the more after 80 years. The tempo is slow, you are bound to yawn at times and maybe even fall asleep to the soft dullness, while the 1934 film keeps you wide awake all through indeed. On the other hand, this film does not abandon Somerset Maugham but walks the line all the way."

For example, Baltimore is a fairly large city, and only one small theater is currently showing this movie! So I find it hard to believe the filmmakers, in their infinite wisdom, needed to show extremely graphic images of people dying of Cholera, not to mention grotesque scenes of corpses, to the very people who already have a pretty good idea about what dying from Cholera is all about.\n\nAs a result of being caught off guard by these rather gruesome images, I literally lost my dinner after the movie was over. Where do I send the bill? Can anything be left to the imagination, anymore? Why are so many films these days so morbid? Is the movie going public becoming so desensitized that nothing is shocking? Are American filmmakers helping to turn us into a nation of mindless voyeurs? If I wanted, or needed, to learn more about Cholera, all I have to do is hop on the Internet, or God-forbid, pick-up a book, and read. I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to be nauseated!\n\nAll I can say is thank God for the man who invented the purification process for public drinking water - he should be nominated for sainthood! And the next time you gripe about your Government spending money on foreign aid in very poor countries, keep this movie in mind! For Cholera still kills plenty of people in the developing world, each, and every day - because a huge segment of the human race still does not have access to safe drinking water!"

First off, I never saw Edward Norton in a bad film and the Painted Vail is no exception. The film starts off rather slow, but remains interesting throughout. The script is entirely realistic, believable, and cleverly written as well as masterfully executed. The acting and directing are top notch. Its a film mainly about relationships and the imperfections in each of us. There are many issues explored in this film and some of them relate to our present world situation. Its essentially a tragedy, but its beauty and meaning surpass any depressive aspect to move us to recognize what is best within each of us."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2006 and 2007, the two poorest years in terms of quality films, it doesn't take a lot for a film to be outstanding; but PAINTED VEIL offers audiences quite a package.\n\nFirst you have an outstanding story based on a fine novel: Broken love and how it can motivate a person into unpredictable paths, such as fighting a cholera epidemic in a remote village in China. Second, the on location filming in China and the brilliant re-creation of the 1925 Old China --- pretty much destroyed during the 1950's when Chinese villagers were rounded up by the Red Guard and placed into forced labor camps, families destroyed, etc. Third, the excellent performances by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts.\n\nEdward Norton is always an asset to a movie, one of my favorite current stars; but Naomi Watts deserves a few special comments: First, she'll be compared to Greta Garbo in the original. I say there is no comparison. Sorry, Grandpops, but Greta was nothing to look at and her acting was flat (and overrated). Naomi Watts, a girl of today, never fails to play an authentic 1925 woman --- with all the limitations they had in those times. I never thought Miss Watts could overcome the silly and awful role Peter Jackson (today's worst film director)saddled her with in his dreadful gorilla \"remake.\" Jackson ought to be prosecuted in court for the damage he inflicted on Miss Watts, as well as the mess he made (for $150 million) of a great American classic (King Kong). The jury is still out on her career recovery, as this fine film is still unproven at the box office.\n\nMovies aimed at adults (and free of special effects excess, men wearing capes or having over-sized white wings, toilet humor) have become so few that Hollywood ought not expect adults to return to movie theaters just because an occasional fine film is mixed in with the abundance of trash."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is an earnest, old-fashioned movie about love, marriage, sin and redemption, with an exotic setting; it's not on an epic David Lean scale, but the production is big enough to provide a sense of adventure and escape. So what went wrong?\n\nPity the poor director, who was stuck with two lead actors who also happened to be the producers...so they could not be fired (or sent back for intensive voice classes). Why are so many Brit actors able to deliver convincing, nuanced American accents, but not vice versa? Edward Norton does not have a particularly memorable or resonant voice to start with, and his lame attempt at sounding British constrains his tinny voice even more. Naomi Watts does slightly better, but over the duration of a 2-hour film, her insipid accent, too, begins to get on your nerves. And let's not even talk about Liev Schreiber; fortunately, he's not in the film very long.\n\n(Diana Rigg must also deliver a phony accent, this one French. It, too, is unconvincing, but again, hers is a small role.)\n\nAn actor's voice is one of his or her most powerful tools. By forcing themselves into roles in which their voices are constrained and weakened, Watts and Norton simply cannot do justice to their parts. Imagine this movie with, say, Ralph Fiennes or Colin Firth in the lead, and imagine the difference it would make with the delivery of every line...like night and day! Ultimately, it's the performances of the two producers that kill this movie."

I am more and more convinced that I should track down and watch all films with Naomi Watts in it now. Edward is his own excellent self as usual.\n\nThe characters are very well done, the background, the story and the main plot lines are all excellent. Even the Chinese village (to me anyways) appears very authentic. So what happened to my rating? What I thought the movie was trying to do - i.e. the message, the moral of story, the meaning of the feature, was somehow average in its delivery. Maybe it's the screenplay, or directing. Like the title says, The Painted Veil has a very simple and clear message and it is very repeatedly said in many ways throughout the film, but somehow they managed to be separate from each other, and it did not build up, the momentum wasn't there. The climactic moments were un-climactic to the movie's central theme. And thus at the end, it did not leave me with a strong impression or a take-home message. With the death of Walter, it felt more like a documentary film than otherwise. It could be just that I was hard to impress."

Norton's extreme nuance and awkwardly professional prose makes for one of the best performances in recent memory. A shining work certainly robbed of much needed award recognition. Naomi Watts is equally powerful. A beautiful structure shifted from utter selfishness into deep empathy and selflessness by the end of the picture. The transition of their love is very engaging as it progresses from a resent, to utter hatred, to actual sympathy and a very real love by the time it's too late. The actual love scene is one of the most passionate and romantic in recent years. Norton's final scene absolutely broke my heart in two."

Next thing you know she marries Walter and they have marital relations. However we have to assume that Walter doesn't make the grade because Kitty is soon committing adultery with one of his friends. Walter realises what is going on and decides to take up a position in a cholera hotspot in China - he threatens to divorce her if she doesn't accompany him.\n\nFrom here on in it is pure Hollywood nonsense - destroying the soul of Maugham's masterpiece. But then - this is what talentless writers are best at - we see it in other great writers work all the time - notably Agatha Christie which has become ludicrous.\n\nI don't know what has happened to the copyright process - it certainly isn't working these days.

Well I was half right. First of all, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton's characters don't really connect in the beginning and are rushed into marriage and Watts character spends most of her time being resentful.\n\nThat being said, this is a remarkable film in terms of its character development, beautiful cinematography, music score and some top notch performances from Watts and Norton who make some sympathetic characters who also have a good amount of chemistry. You get to really know Watts character Kitty and Walter (Norton) who both have somewhat different views of life in terms of relationships, views of the world and the downfalls of real life for those who suffer the most.\n\nWhile this is set in China and touches on some political issues, it doesn't get swept away by it luckily which would have turned this film into an anti communist type of film praising the westerners for interfering. This film ignores that and focuses more on the feelings of compassion and redemption and how through it people can come together and overcome their bias and opinion of each other due to past circumstances.\n\nPerhaps the french song played near the end was a bit of a weird choice and it didn't really make the emotional impact as good as it could which is a pity, but luckily it doesn't make it too emotionally overwhelming and keeps you in oddly high spirits, almost as though its a lesson you have learnt despite the adversity.\n\nThis is a beautiful film and I enjoyed myself and got swept away by the characters and the time I invested with them.

        "review_detailed_main": "Tagline: A beautiful piece of painting with plenty of substances\u0085\n\nReview by Neo: The Painted Veil is one of the most beautiful movies, Neo have ever seen. In the world of commercialism and with Hollywood making less and less money, flicks of this sort is an absolute piece of a gem. Along the lines of Quiet American, exploring the messy times of the 1920s China, The Painted Veil scores in every aspect. From touching and powerful performances from the leading characters in Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, on the mark supporting actors in the likes of HK legend Anthony Wong and colliding with a wonderful piano score, this movie is simply beautiful to watch.\n\nIt is interesting to witness through the times that the current reviewer's grandma have been through and countryside mainland China is still very much in need of civilization. While big cities like Shanghai and Beijing makes China, the self acclaimed new superpower of the 21st century and beyond, the problem of water and varies diseases are still a prominent issue within the populated outskirts of the mainland and poverty of the situation.\n\nEdward Norton has always been a nerdy type and here he is perfectly casted as a doctor/scientist wanting to make a difference in a foreign country. With so much spoken of the issues of China, The Painted Veil at its very core, it is actually a love story. Perhaps more fittingly, a story of change, the growth of understanding and ultimately a fulfilling yet tragic love story about a young couple going through the lessons of life.\n\nAussie favourite, Naomi Watts is compelling as a young adulterous wife who is constantly shaped by the context of her difference experiences of changing culture and society. Watts is a talented actresses and it is a great sight witnessing a fellow Australian balancing between art house flicks like 21 Grams and this one with commercial hits like King Kong and Hollywood re-make of The Ring series. Possessing a pretty and sexy appearance and matching it up with some quality acting chops, Watts have a bright future ahead.\n\nThen again, for followers of HK cinema like Neo, there is the ever dependable Anthony Wong. While it is true that Wong's acting is limited by his English, his presence alone lifts up the film and made his paper thin role as a head guard much more interesting than he should be. Perhaps, Wong is in line for more Hollywood appearances in the future, but this is certainly not a bad way to launch an overseas career.\n\nIt must be credited to the director John Curran for making the most of China's best lake sequence and imagery. Not only will this be a great promotion for the upcoming Beijing Olympics, but showing the beauty of China, despite the constant clich\u00e9s of seeing images of the industrial progression and pollution landscape of places like Shanghai, Canton or Beijing. Some scenes like when the boat is slowly paddled through the beautiful lake, reminds the audience of a little movie called Hero, where it contained the ballet-like battle of the minds between Jet Li and Tony Leung Chiu Wai.\n\nAll in all, The Painted Veil is certainly a beautiful movie to look at and what makes it better than other similar clones is that it never bores. This is despite its 2 hours running time and the branding of being an independent flick. The Painted Veil scores on nearly all levels and comes extremely highly recommended from the current reviewer who didn't allow his eyes to close, despite just sleeping 4 hours last night. It is a movie that follows a novel and somehow is also a remake of a 1934 movie of the same name, but as it turns out The Painted Veil is very much a big success. Adding in Anthony Wong and the pretty faced looks of Naomi Watts, The Painted Veil is like a beautiful piece of painting and the good news is that Neo loves it as he is finishing off this review within the next couple of seconds\u0085 (Neo 2008)\n\nI rate it 10/10"

In the meantime, the husband decides to move to China where the cholera epidemic is taking a thousand lives.\n\n***********Spoiler ahead...\n\nI think this movie is hugely overrated.\n\nThe first meeting of Walter and Kitty is unclear. Falling in love suddenly isn't love at first sight at all.\n\nKitty sits with Charlie in their first meeting where Walter sits in front of them. Why? Why the newly married husband wife do not sit together?\n\nThe servants are assuming their mistress is napping in the bedroom. How does her lover come into the bedroom, where no servants know anything, but her husband only?\n\nKitty, Walter, Waddington, and his Chinese mistress are drinking together, where Kitty only gets drunk and slept alone whereas Waddington and his mistress are making love. On the other hand, where was Walter then? From where he comes and gets Kitty from there?\n\nKnowing that he is not the father of the baby, Walter's expression wasn't real. Even knowing her affair and sexual relationship with another man, how did he proceed to make intimate relations with her? Though they were drunk the next day they didn't repent.\n\nKitty comes to Walter when she finds her lover Charlie can't marry her.\n\nA plot hole! Kitty is looking at the saline which is almost finished, whereas the security guard is telling Waddington that the reserve of saline is finished. But Kitty doesn't know it. Yet she never seeks another saline bag to the doctors.\n\nAn unexpected, but too much coincidence that Charlie meets Kitty and their son Walter Jr. In London. Kitty doesn't proceed their relationship forward. Thus she has been considered an honest and holy woman. How ridiculous.\n\nThus in this movie, an extramarital affair and sex are considered as automatically forgiven facts.\n\nThe worst message is given by this movie.\n\nThe only positive is the production design, acting of the leading pair, cinematography, and photography.\n\nWorst in direction & writing.\n\nIt deserves a 6.1 rating on IMDb.\n\nRecommended 10%."

        "review_title": "A nice melodrama where political themes should not have been addressed.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is the result of a partnership between the US and China. The script is a cheap romance, in which a futile girl marries without love and betrays her husband, a doctor who truly loves her. From there, they live a marriage that only exists formally and things get worse when they go to a secluded hamlet in China, where an epidemic of cholera broke out. The country's political situation will also cause problems, as China, recently transformed into a republic with the deposition of the last emperor, becomes a troubled country, with internal conflicts and a huge aversion to foreigners.\n\nThe plot adapts to the cinema an absolutely dry and heartless novel, but it does so in a way that's sometimes a bit melodramatic. I understand the intention: to increase the dramatic effect, the writer sweetened the story and altered it a bit, to make it more digestible. That's good but, just like when making a cake, we have to be careful not to overdo the amount of sugar. Unfortunately, sometimes it abuses the sugar but, at the same time, the epidemic and the misery of the people help to bring the film to a more realistic background and cut through this excessive sweetness. Thus, everything becomes more balanced, harmonious and pleasant. The political part of the plot, however, seem to be totally out of context and never fit into the overall story. I say this because this didn't make any difference in the story itself. It's totally dispensable. What happened here? Did the writer decided not to develop this subplot or Chinese CP demand that the film speak of this issue in a sort of political-historical revisionism? If the later was the true, it was something that did not really interest. China, however it tries to look like a westernized country, will only be truly modern with free and multiparty elections, a free press and freedom of opinion. None of these things exist behind the polluted and ultra-modern image that China likes to show us, and there is no smoke curtain strong enough for the Chinese dictatorship to hide that.\n\nEdward Norton and Naomi Watts are two well-known and talented actors. The two have already seen their names on the list of Oscar-nominated actors. They worked very well but Norton's character is more able of captivating public's affection, while she will have a long atonement ahead. Anyway, Watts was able to show the moral and psychological evolution of her character, and that was difficult even for a good actress. The remaining cast, unfortunately, is remarkably insignificant. Toby Jones is good enough but has little to do, as can Diana Rigg and Liev Schreiber. Better than them are the scenarios and cinematography. China has shown in this film some magnificent landscapes, which the film has been able to explore. The soundtrack has some excellent piano pieces of a mournful and sad tone, which harmonizes with the mists, disease and love affairs that are the core of the story itself."

This beautiful movie as about love and loss, at least it is for me.\n\nIt is set in the 20ies, and tells the story of Walter and Kitty, who are married. However, Kitty isn't in love with Walter and she starts an affair. This happens in China, and when Walter (Norton) finds out, he takes Kitty (Naomi Watts) with him to a village where there is a cholera-epidemic. At this point they hate each other, and it is Walters intention that Kitty shall die of cholera. But along the way they start to see each others good sides, and after months or even years of marriage, they fall in love. The way they fall in love is beautiful, and it doesn't feel cheesy at all, like some may expect. The ending is extremely sad, but it makes the movie very strong.\n\nOverall, this movie is sad and beautiful, with superb acting, heartbreaking music and lovely scenery. The only downside may be that, for me, it started of a bit too slowly, and the last 10 minutes weren't necessary.\n\nBut it is one of the best and most beautiful movies I have ever seen."

Yet they are so far from their opinions , way of living , attitude towards life - this film depicts journey of those two paths which in time tries to follow the same path of love.\n\nAlso, one of the best soundtrack that goes along with every emotion so well that you can not separate the beats and the moment in the movie.\n\nThe movie is bit serious and does not have any light moments as you look through it which can be seen as one of the weak points.\n\nDirector John Curran does a great job with the given script by slowly opening the revealing core of the lead characters. Capturing the beauty of rural china in the most unique way, also gives this movie a different feel than the other Romantic-drama films.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch with your loved ones.\n\nI'll give this movie 7 and half Stars + extra half star for its beautiful background Score and Cinematography"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched The Painted Veil on the evening of Mother's Day and thought, as I sat to write this piece, that this movie would have certainly appealed to my mother. In fact it would appeal to most mothers or anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned melodrama.\n\nThe story has been told and told again. A shallow woman marries a man to escape the clutches of her family. They travel to China circa 1925 where he conducts research on bacteria. She has no interest in his work and almost as little in him. He is, to say mildly, less than outgoing in his relations with his wife. She falls into an affair with the local lady's man and is given the choice of receiving a messy divorce or traveling with her husband to the Chinese outback where he is going to help stem an outbreak of cholera. The wife finds that her lover has feet of clay and will not leave his wife, so she regrettably accompanies her husband. Events occur in this remote region which change the lives of this unhappy couple. I told you it was melodrama! Its good direction, professional acting, great production values, and incredible scenery that make this version of The Painted Veil so appealing.\n\nNaomi Watts plays the wife. She does an admirable job at showing us a shallow young woman who matures into a person of value. In the 1934 film, Greta Garbo played the roll. I would have thought that someone such as Bette Davis would have done a good job at this part ala Jezebel.\n\nThe distant husband is played by Edward Norton who shows us a man whose emotions are slowly drawn from an inner self to develop into a full grown passion for both his work and his wife.\n\nWith just the right amount of sexuality, humor, and bad-boyishness, Liev Schreiber plays the lover.\n\nCharacter actor Toby Jones who was so excellent as Truman Capote in Infamous plays the local government official who has long since succumbed to the exotic charms of China - no British superiority here.\n\nFinally, those of us who lusted after Emmy Peel, get to see Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of the local orphanage and clinic. Yes, she's old and wrinkled, but damn, she still looks good.\n\nTake this tale of imperfect people who learn from their mistakes, add a backdrop of some of the most beautiful scenes of nature imaginable, and mix with talented acting and you get a great \"guilty pleasure\" movie for a Sunday evening."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Painted Veil presents us with a remarkable combination of actors, setting and drama. The characters of Edward Norton and Naomi Watts play the simplest possible roles they could have had - a spoiled princess and a doctor living in a bubble - but only their remarkable skill as actors could give these characters so much life. From the start, the grandiose landscape of China and the first few moments of the movie guarantee that this is going to be quite a different piece of cinema. Unusual, confusing, terrifying even, it engulfs us as we are thrown into the lives of two people that grow to love each other and learn the painful truth about the world around us.\n\nAnd although this movie is really, quite excellent, I was still left slightly unsatisfied with certain moments in it. The portrayal of early 20th century China is somehow incomplete. The few moments shown and few pieces of information given are not enough to make the viewer realize the morbid feeling of impending doom and chaos that was quite common in that period. Some scenes left me with unanswered questions, others left me wondering why they even occurred. And most of all, there was a certain lack of time perception; it was quite difficult to say how long has passed between the scenes and often what felt only like days, would later turn out to be months in the movie. This problem with continuity of the plot though probably unintentional, has however made a movie even more enjoyable as we as viewers share a certain sense of confusion and almost feel lost in translation as to what exactly is going on.\n\nOverall, this is a great movie staring two of my most favorite actors and although they are not going to get Oscar for any of the performance in it, they still did an incredible job. 9/10"

The actors Edward Norton (Walter Fane) and Naomi Watts (Kitty Fane) did an absolutely amazing job. They were perfect for their roles. The storyline was even better. I'd say it's a love story, but not the kind that makes you sick. It has a delicate touch, but it doesn't make you feel like it's just some bubbly fantasy. But then again, there's more to it than the complicated love story. My interest was never lost. Like many have already said, the scenery was amazing. I loved the way the camera took advantage of the scenes. The editor of this movie even impressed me. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who takes film seriously. Edward Norton never ceases to amaze me. As well as Naomi Watts. I felt like I could actually feel the emotion of the movie. It was that good. I also wanted to comment on the screenplay; the screenwriter didn't overdo it. He kept it simple but not so simple that you feel an empty.\n\nI give this a 10/10 because I have yet to see a movie made in this period of time that will impress me as much as this movie did. I know all this seems a little too much, but once you see it, you'll understand what I mean.\n\nGO BUY THE DVD!"

The excellent use of time and place allows the viewer to be in their world, and I loved the sailing. That and that wonderful music! I bought the soundtrack, it was so beautiful.

Most of us would rather intoxicate ourselves with the effervescent words of the great sages of love... this is why as high-school students, naive and idealistic, WE ALL loved Shakespeare...\n\n\"Let me not the marriage of true minds, admit impediments, Love is not Love. Which alters when it alteration finds...\"\n\nTo some, Shakespeare was a blind optimist, but to many, he was the man, the real deal.... Preaching a kind of romantic love that does not alter when everything else does. A love that does not falter in the face of chaos and fuss...\n\nWalter (Ed Norton) and Kitty (Naomi Watts) do not have this kind of love.\n\nSet in the 1920's, Walter is a bacteriologist more enamored with books and diseases than anything else in his uncomplicated life, but when he encounters the beautiful Kitty, he falls in love and proposes marriage.\n\nKitty, despite her obvious lack of feelings for Walter accepts the proposal for selfish reasons. She wanted to get married ahead of her younger sister and longed for freedom from her pushy parents.\n\nThe couple relocated to the British Colony of Hong Kong. Here, Walter continues his research as Kitty becomes more and more restless. Kitty then meets a dashing diplomat named Charlie Townsend and starts an affair with the married man. Walter found out about this and threatened to divorce the unregretful kitty and make a scandal out of it. Fearing the scandal would ruin Charlie, she begs Walter for a quiet proceeding.\n\nWalter agrees, on one condition. - That Kitty asks Charlie to divorce his wife and marry her. If Charlie refuses, Kitty will accompany Walter and (obviously as punishment) must live deep in a cholera-ravished province in mainland China.\n\nOf course Charlie refused, and Kitty, left without a choice, must live with a husband she doesn't even care about, in the middle of an epidemic, and without the comforts of the life she used to live.\n\n***** A painted veil, based on the classic novel by Somerset Maugham, is a one of a kind romance movie. A story where two flawed, hardly likable characters learn the true meaning of love. Love that is not borne of passion, but of forgiveness and 2nd chances.\n\nPart of what makes this movie so good is how it makes the viewer an accomplice, we care for the characters genuinely and almost will them to be together. We become catalysts with our intentions and our hopes.\n\nLoveless though as they may seem, they do not fight, something worse has happened to them-- they have settled into a kind of cold but respectful indifference towards one another. Never knowing what the other is thinking, never saying the things that should be heard, not because they can't or would rather not, but because it plainly doesn't matter anymore. This void, to me, is the abyss of any relationship.\n\nYet we have this eerie notion that somehow, for some cosmic reason, they are destined to be together. You see, Kitty and Walter do not necessarily subscribe to the Shakepearian platitudes. They are humans, and they're proud of it. Proud in the that they do not find fault in making mistakes, because there's no fault in being imperfect, fault lies in the inability to forgive AND the inability to learn."

        "review_title": "Beautiful movie about unhappy romance during an epidemic of cholera in China.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is my favorit romance movie, if you can call it that? This movie deals whit a few different subjects and elements but love is a big part of it but not necessarily happy love, no very much the opposite. But it's not just about love, it's also about how life can be, it's about a certain time period and it's about an epidemic and people who works in infected areas.\n\nWithout good acting, a movie like this becomes terrible, useless and probably just silly. But that's not the case here. Edward Norton proves once again that he is an actor that truly embodies his parts. Here he plays a very low key quiet and reserved person, but still his performance is strong. Naomi Watts is also really really good, it's almost like she becomes this young girl that she's suppose to play. A girls that's is a fragile and naive person, that still proves she has some real strength in her as life gets harder and you really feel for her during this movie. Naomi Watts portrays her role with great conviction, you can really feel the pain she feels because of her faith but also how she learns from it. Supporting actors are all good as well, really good and their characters are also important to the story.\n\nThis is a slow movie that unfolds in a way that it almost feels like you're reading a thick novel. I myself can easily be bored by movies like this but not here, something about the tone made the story feel very real to me, you can truly sense what each character are going through, even if it's never spoken, somehow that's enjoyable even if what these characters go trough is not something one would envy. Sad story, very sad but not melodramatic much more melancholic, which I found pleasurable. Maybe that's a bit sadistic? I don't know, I hope not.\n\nAnd that the cinematography is just astonishing beautiful, that doesn't hurt either. And the score with some quiet piano melodys in the background that are simple but beautiful works very well for the story as well.\n\nIf you enjoy melancholy films, I think this is a good watch for you ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this film to be very moving and poignant holding my full attention and gripping my emotions for its entire length. Somerset Maugham no doubt based some the \"Painted Veil\" on his early career as a doctor in the London slums and later on his visits to the Far East. But director John Curran and actors Watts and Norton have convincingly extracted from Maugham's story the powerful relationship between a man and a woman torn apart by human weakness then finding each in the depths of poverty and the heights of human sacrifice.\n\nEdward Norton seems to have captured most of the accolades for his portrayal of Doctor Walter Fane fighting cholera in China in the 1920's. And he certainly does a great job. But for me it is Naomi Watts who deserves an acting award for her portrayal of the selfish, spoiled and unfaithful wife who is later to learn the true meaning of existence.\n\nWhat a delight to see a good film without death defying stunts, cars crashing through plate glass windows and a trillion bullets going off every 3 minutes. All you need is a good story, competent actors, professional direction and something that the audience can relate to. \"The Painted Veil\" has all of these ingredients. Please give us some more of this type of film!"

They finally got to see each other and found the beauty of who they really are through the unexpected lifestyle. The true love is so simple that just two of them can rely on each other in this extreme situation.\n\nYou gotta admire the crew to find this location to film Mei-tan-fu back in 2005. A expedition within 8000km in 10days and find Huang-Yao village with 1000 years history in Guangxi province. The shooting was so extraordinary and it made the film even more romantic. I have been in there and step on every footprint Watts and Norton have stepped on it. That's a such experience being inside the film..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't read all the posts so please forgive if I'm repeating. This thoroughly enjoyable film suffers from one major defect. Ironically, it is a defect that results from the excellence of today's technology. In effect, the picture is so clear and the colours so vivid that it looks as though it was filmed five minutes ago! Not good for a story set in the British colonial era. Other movies have used muted colour or even sharp black and white to give that period feel. (Recently, \"The Good German\" in black and white and I understand that the John Boorman film \"The General\" was filmed in colour but printed in B/W) More consideration should have been given to the film's colour."

        "review_detailed_main": "Edward Norton and Naomi Watts star in a romantic movie that feels like a Merchant/Ivory production. Norton plays a doctor who is not very comfortable around people and falls in love with a young socialite, Kitty, played by Watts. Despite not being very keen, Kitty marries the doctor due to family pressure, and they move to Shanghai to start their life together. However, in the big city, Kitty finds comfort in the arms of another man. When the doctor learns about her affair, he takes them to a small village that is struggling with cholera. It is here that both characters experience a significant change in themselves.\n\nThe on-screen chemistry between Norton and Watts is evident right from the start and only gets stronger as the story progresses. John Curran has skillfully captured the beauty of China on film, while allowing the actors to carry the story. The movie is based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel and is a romantic and artistic experience from start to finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "The painted veil refers to life, from a Shelley sonnet. Being a movie adaptation of a book by W. Somerset Maugham, it couldn't have been really bad. And being with Edward Norton and foxy Naomi Watts, it couldn't have had bad acting. I mean... he would have been motivated :)\n\nAnyway, this is the type of slow movie that is worth it, at least as romantic movies go. It's the story of an estranged couple finding love in remote China of 1920, during a cholera epidemic. The movie is quite long and may bore people, although I didn't feel bored at all. It presents the shallowness of the British high society of the time, the life of Hong Kong Chinese during the British occupation, the subtle and insidious way in which Catholic orphanages spread their religion, it shows beautiful scenery, but most of all, it shows how you can live by stupid society rules and not see the good things that are right next to you.\n\nThere is an earlier adaptation of the book with Greta Garbo in 1934, but I don't intend to watch and make the comparison.\n\nThe film is worth seeing in slow, romantic nights. It is not a romantic comedy, if that's what you are looking for. It's deep and dramatic. I mean, it came from a book... :)"

Teamed with one of the most famous Asian actors, it should attract many Asian views at the premier. It's sad. This movie is just as beautiful as where it was chosen to take place. It's recomendable for a veiw for those who look for nostalgia"

Both the actors chemistry was superb and the ending almost made me cry.\n\nThe cinematography of this movie was fantastic, I loved how things are going slowly and not in a rush.

The sets were excellent. The photography brilliant. Even the Public Health stuff about how to not catch Cholera by letting your water get contaminated by corpses was spot on. How many films contain such accurate science ?\n\nBy the way, I loved Naomi as a brunette too. She should keep it. Was this because Greta Garbo was in the original and they thought that she should try and keep to the spirit of the original ?"

When I saw the previews I was not impressed and thought it would be way too emotional and romantic for my tastes. It was not. I thought Ed Norton did a great job and I don't agree that the role would have been better played by Fiennes. He played the role perfectly. From an historical standpoint, the subplot of rising Chinese nationalism was interesting although I felt it could have used some additional scripting and the connection between activities in Shanghai and the village. There is an underlying spiritual message throughout the film and, although it takes place in 1925, could easily be translated to our culture today."
