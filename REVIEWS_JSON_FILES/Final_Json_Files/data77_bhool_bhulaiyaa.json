        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the fact that the movie was promoted as a comedy, the film is a physcological thriller with a few comic situations. Priyadarshan does a good job as a director. In comparison with his previous films, he takes a leap as a director by making a movie with a genre of its own.\n\nIn my opinion, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is way better than the original movie, Manichithrathazhu. Probably because of the technicians have improved since then.\n\nAkshay Kumar does his usual comic act, and he's funny here as well. Shiny Ahuja hams, but is good in parts. The last 45 minutes belong to none other than, Vidya Balan. Throughout the movie she doesn't have much to do but the steals the show with her superb performance towards the climax. Ameesha Patel looks ethereal and is effective in a small yet important role. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially Paresh Rawal, Rasika Joshi and Manoj Joshi.\n\nThe songs are good; Labon Ko is easy on the ears.\n\nAll in all, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a well-executed movie, though lengthy in parts! Time-pass!"

Well cooked story, nice and gripping presentation, power-packed performances.. and a humor different than the conventional slapstick humor that we get in movies these days (well, at least it was presented differently).\n\nPriyadarshan is really a come-back in this one. Though I liked this fella always, but his movies had been following a routine kinda trail and all his experiments like Bhagam Bhaag have been failing miserably. But this movie was really a welcome break from his side.\n\nAkshay Kumar, as he has already proved several time, has got a great comic timing. He brings twists to the movie's plot as well as inside your belly as you go laughing all the way. Vidhya Balan looks very sweet except for once, but I'll talk no further to ruin your suspense if you haven't seen the movie yet. Paresh Rawal & Rajpal Yadav are once again a treat to watch.\n\nGo see this movie. Its an ultimate stress buster. Go with the guys, and you will have even more fun. :-)\n\nI vote, \"Highly Recommended\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a movie tagged as a comedy, one which featured the likes of Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar plus directed by Priyadarshan. Naturally everyone expects this to be a comedy. Wrong !!! This is probably the best thriller of the year. A horror flick which has touches of comedy scattered around. Kinda reminds you of Johnny Depp's Sleepy Hollow.\n\nI won't go far as comparing Sleepy Hollow with Bhool Bhulaiyaa, because they are not comparable. One is a Hollywood flick and the other Bollywood. One which is high budgeted other relatively low. But you cant but feel that the comedy which seemed forced in Sleepy Hollow is same for this flick. It really appears forced. One can feel that they can do away with the comedy in the first half of the movie all together. The sequences where the bloke has to be dumb in order to complete a holy task, just appears too forced.\n\nAnd yet again, Akshay Kumar's comedy reels appear so natural. But like Priyadarshan's previous Bollywood movie Bhagam Bhag, this one also is a thriller. The difference is Bhagam Bhag remains a comedy, whereas Bhool Bhulaiyaa is indeed a thriller.\n\nVidya Balan gives a stellar performance, (I won't say why cause then you have too see the movie, I wont be giving out any spoilers) and so does Akshay Kumar, despite his so late entry almost an hour into the movie. Shiny Ahuja also appears impressive, he always does. Manoj Joshi was also very good as the elder figure of the family. Rajpal Yadav is probably the only true deserving gag reel of the movie. His small role is quite pertinent and gives you the laughs just about when and how it's necessary. Paresh Rawal and Asrani are wasted in the movie. An actor of Paresh Rawal's capability shouldn't have been used in this role. Amisha Patel is also wasted. A tinsel beauty of her caliber deserves far more screen time, though still she gives a very nice performance. But end of the day this movie will definitely be remembered by Vidya Balan's performance which is nothing short of mind blowing.\n\nKeeping in the theme of the movie, very few songs have been used. Just three in fact apart from the title track which is shown during the end credits. And the music, background score is also to the point and perfect. The camera work is superb. One might feel towards the beginning that there are some bad editing, but towards the end you can feel that everything was actually kept intentionally and are all pertinent towards the climactic sequence of the movie. The sets were crafted lavishly and the entire locations are stupendous and exquisite.\n\nLast of all, the direction, well what can I say ?? Priyadarshan is definitely the best Indian comedy director in my book, but this being his first complete horror/thriller he receives kudos in my book.\n\n9/10 !!!"

I live in the Netherlands and only can get copies of Hindi movies. So without having any knowledge about the story I could watch this movie with fresh eyes and just loved it. The trailer is very misleading and letting people believe that it is a comedy. And I was glad that it wasn't. It is a real good suspense movie. Not in the sense that it was thrilling every minute. But you just feel that something is up. The comedy and horror elements are there to put you off course. I love the fact that they play around with superstition,religion and science. It is quite a remarkable psychological thriller. Be honest. There aren't many Indian movies like this compared to Hollywood movies. Not one minute I got bored with this movie. And let me tell you that is saying something. I have seen a lot of (American,Korean,Japanese,British,Dutch and Hong Kong)movies this year and with most of them I was very disappointed. And now you have \"Om Shanti Om, \"Johny Gaddar\" and \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa that did quite the opposite. For me this movie rocked big time. And there should be much more movies like this one."

Great acting, gripping screenplay, mesmerizing music and above all the great humour in between the horror made this movie a perfect horror comedy movie.\n\nThis is a kind of movie that Bollywood seriously lack and it's the main reason that the movie has now attained the cult status. This movie is undoubtedly the landmark movie in Indian Cinema whenever we will talk about horror comedy movies.\n\nActing is strong in fact it's superb and it's the charm of Akshay Kumar who will make you enchanted with his Charismatic performance, remember he arrives after almost an hour of the start of the movie and as soon as he arrives on screen he hijacks the entire environment, I remember watching the movie in movie theater and the viewers literally applauded the entry of Akshay Kumar by whistling and clapping, this would not be a shocking scenario in a small city cinema hall but in a Multiplex in a major city was a shocker and exciting for me. Vidya Balan was just stupendous in her character and I think no one could've portrayed the character better than her. Rest all the characters be it Ameesha Patel, Shiney Ahuja, Paresh Rawal, Manoj Joshi, Asrani and Rajpal Yadav, they all are multi talented and had played their part perfectly.\n\nScreenplay of the movie deserves special applaud and mention as the screenplay is knitted so perfectly that it doesn't gives a small hint till the end of the movie as who is Manjulika and comes as a shocker for almost all the viewers. The director and screenplay writer were successfully in feeding the mind of viewers with many guesses until the revelation in the climax. Climax of the movie is just great and gives a perfect and happy ending to the movie.\n\nMusic and background music were mesmerizing, the background score of the movie has been great in creating the mysterious atmosphere. The songs of the movie were also great with 'Hare Krishna Hare Ram' was a chart buster and is still famous.\n\nThere might be few Horror comedies before Bhool Bhulaiyaa and there were several good horror comedy movies which came after Bhool Bhulaiyaa such as Go Goa Gone and Stree which are good horror comedies but the status or level attained by Bhool Bhulaiyaa might not be surpassed by another movie easily. A surely must watch flick."

There is a room on the third floor which was kept locked and tied with a holy string to keep the evil spirits from coming out.\n\nThe news of the marriage left Radha (Amisha Patel) with a broken heart as she was in love with siddharth.\n\nBoth Siddharth and Avni are educated and do not believe in ghosts. One day Avni's curiosity got the better of her and with the permission from her husband she opened the door.\n\nSince then, series of calamities and accidents have occurred. The locals blame the Avni for their misfortune, however, Siddharth thinks it Radha who has concocted these accidents to make Avni look bad and eventually be a threat to Avni's life.\n\nSiddharth thinks Radha is mentally ill and asks his friend Dr Aditya Shrivastav (Akshay Kumar) to investigate and help Radha.\n\nYou will have to see the film for the rest and I'll tell you, it is very interesting.\n\nAkshay Kumar was a very mediocre actor during his early movies and has slowly blossomed into a great actor. He's very good to watch whether it be in a comedy role or a more serious role. This brings out the best of both these roles from Akshay.\n\n7/10."

If ever u need to to be proud of an Indian film in front of an American, this is what u'll need. A very intelligent mix of drama, suspense, thrill and comedy with traces of romance thrown in between.... Right from the start, the movie never sags. All the characters r well chosen & the storyline is taut. The plot is of a couple returning to the husband's native place and a haunting they encounter there. Although the plot has been explored before, the performances by actors here are commendable. The couple seems an actual couple, the father looks like a father, everything rings true and credible. Its hard to believe they r acting. The suspense unfolds gradually and is very ably switched with other elements but the interest is never let down. The crazy doctor looks like he can do nothing! But looks can be deceptive. A very well-chosen protagonist! Different, in fact from the conventional ones...Twists n turns at d right times and finally, a fitting climax....short enough to hold attention throughout. A masterpiece of effort! A bigger budget n a little better dialog delivery esp. from Akshay cud hv made d movie flawless...In the scene where Akshay explains his discovery, he seems to be struggling for words...just a bit, though!!! All in all a gr8 movie....Rating 9/10"

Except for the starting, everything is a plain copy of Manichitrathazu.\n\nIn original, we never see Shobana's face in the scenes when she was at Nagavalli's room. But in Bhool Bhulaiya, the camera shows Vidya's face many times in the same scene. The suspense factor is not kept by Priyadarshan here. Also, the characters of Shridevi in manichitrathazu was so well written but here, the character of Radha has no role in it and even she had, Amisha patel killed it with his acting.\n\nEveryone's acting was from poor to okayish. Shiney Ahuja was the biggest dissapointment. He was little too loud every time. Rajpal Yadav and Paresh Rawal had no role in this, complete waste of talent. And why was Ameesha Patel even there?\n\nThere was also an aspect at which this one was better than the original. It was that it doesn't contain the paranormal stuff at the starting like Manichitrathazu. Thus, the story makes more sense.\n\nBut overall, it's an average flick."

Even the cars look tastefully royal and the interior decoration, while a bit monotonous at times, is accurate.\n\nComing to the story, well, it's a no-brainer that it has been inspired from a National Award winning regional film. However, the adaptation has been well thought-out and competently executed. While not gripping, it is engrossing, except when Shiny Ahuja and Vidya Balan mouth their lines. Those two form the extreme ends of bad acting, with Shiny epitomizing over-the-top hamming and Vidya being more wooden than the classy cupboards in the palace. Apart from this, the cast is good, the music ably supporting, and the editing crisp. The rationale for the mystery is nothing less than sophisticated mumbo-jumbo but, it works nevertheless.\n\nNow, if only I had a palace like that too..."

But since I have seen all the other versions of the same movie, I feel like its not worth the hype given to it. Because the original was in Malayalam and then came Aapthamithra in Kannada (AMAZING Performance by Soundharya), then Chandramukhi in Tamil (Okay movie but thanks to Rajini baba that it was worth watching it) and now is the Hindi version of it.\n\nIf you haven't watched any of the other versions, I strongly advise you to have a bucket of Pop corn along with you while watching Bhool Bhulaiyaa."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhool Bhulaiya gives us what it does not promise. The trailers pronounced the flick to be a comic caper, prompting parents of infants to throng the theaters with their little ones in tow. What the film turns out to be is some different dish altogether. It is what the fine print said all along, a psychological thriller. Just that the fine print should have been the meat and the comic reliefs the periphery. However, to judge the film in isolation from the trailered promise, it is not a bad production at all. The first half is dedicated as a build up for the second half with the director attempting to keep the audiences involved and entertained with slapstick comedy which more often than not falls flat. There is the usual bathroom humor and situational confusions which may elicit a tickle from the infants spoken about above but are given a pass by the adult members of the audience. Have no illusions about it, the film is whole and sole about the second half. The entry of Akshay Kumar brings in a new life into the sagging build up and one realises that for all his faults and shortcomings, the guy really does have screen presence. The audience practically stirs out of it's slumber the moment Dr Aditya (Akshay Kumar) starts to unload himself on the movie. Even the humor starts being, well, humorous. The suspense builds up with twists and unpredictable turns and though you may have a strong opinion on the eventual guilty party, the motive is well hidden throughout. Overall BB is a reasonably well woven tale about a stereotyped village with it's share of village belles and bumbling idiots, a family of earstwhile royals, superstitions and supernaturals, the way we know it. Recommend a watch. And yeah, do leave your kids behind lest they scream and rant at the horror scenes and spoil the show for those around."

When compared to the malayalam original 'manichitrathazhu', Bhool bhulaiyya is a crass comedy/thriller which just scratch on the surface of the original subject. Please see the malayalm original which contains scintillating performances by sobhana and Mohanlal.sobhana,the Mitr actress has won her first best actress national award for this movie. while the malayalm original excels in its adept screenplay by Madhu muttam this film fails to mix the comedy and thriller tracks convincingly. Just like his other remaking exercises this film too takes out the subtlety of the original and replaces it with loud and lewd comic situations. The textual undertones of the malayalm movie about the unconscious desires of a so-called innocent wife of a nuclear family has led to many serious textual studies in malayalm. But this priyadarshan farce with its superficiality leaves no such chance."

Shiny , determined to find the true reason of the extra normal activities, he calls in his friend , akshay kumar, who deals with such paranormal activities.\n\nTo add to this mystic they are presented with a caution to enter in a particular room which has remained closed for ever so long and sole cause of the activities.\n\nPriyan has by far given true justice to the script , and perfected the art of 'Thriller film making'. It isn't the kind of comedy that you normally expect from Priyan, but the overall well presented, but the comedy scenes do see to be too verbose.\n\nThis film is a true treat for the philanderers of the Akshay-Priyan-Paresh combo."

Hats off again.\n\nI just watched it in last show yesterday and in spite of absence of Akshay Kumar for 45 mins. hardly I felt boring in few minutes but I got returns of those minutes in 2nd half which was damn damn damn interesting, gripping and psychological in last 30 mins.\n\nIn short, I loved this movie so much and it is purely an entertainer and shown us great depth of human psychology and gave a hidden message to stay away from blind faith related to ghost and witches.\n\nI admire Bhool Bhulaiya"

No more repetition of traditional boring hero heroine stories.\n\nBhool Bhulaiyaa is that kind of movie which caters to that part of audience which understands the director's narration through the movie yet Bhool Bhulaiyaa manages to entertain all types of audience. The story starts with the revelation of the legend of the Haveli which seems to be haunted by the soul of a dancer who had committed suicide many years ago after her lover, a court dancer is murdered by the then king who was in love with this beautiful dancer.\n\nParesh Rawal, Asrani, Akshay Kumar are the culprits of the movie who almost manage to turn this into a comedy but all praises to all of them as they have given their best works. Akshay Kumar has a rare talent unlike other stars which manages him to bond with the audience easily. Vidya Balan does a decent role in the movie and does more than justice to her character towards the end of the movie. Manoj Joshi who plays Badrinarayan has a lot of talent I must say. Shiny Ahuja & Amisha are as good as a show piece in the movie.\n\nOn an all the movie is very entertaining. The courtroom dance scene is very unique & beautiful, a directional work which only few Indian directors are capable of directing. Although a remake of a south Indian movie the performance is very original.\n\nI give it 6.5 out of 10"

Again , I have to add , the songs were so not needed.\n\nIf I am watching movies like Dhoom 2 , I really don't mind as the songs are as 'break a leg' melodious as they are in their right places .. plus we all know how those movies are gonna end .. but we show up just to watch some beautiful faces and have a good time.\n\nBut movies like BB have a suspense to build up ...i mean who likes songs during suspense ... not me.\n\nBut the movie doesn't let the horror get to you as it also has a scientific angle attached to it. Actors like Paresh Rawal , Akshay Kumar , Asrani and Rajpal Yadav make sure that its not a Bhoot kind of a horror which aims at nothing but to induce horror in it.\n\nShiny Ahuja and Vidya Balan play the married couple. Hey you get to see Amisha Patel as well. Now thats a pretty face which had gone missing.\n\nIts all about a newly wed couple who just return from the US of A to a small town in India and go to live in a mansion which was locked away for decades as it was thought of to be haunted. Then the story gets more and more interesting and complicated.\n\nSome months back a rather spirited Telugu speaking friend of mine forced me to watch a movie ( not sure which south Indian language was that ) as a part of the bargain because I made him watch Batman Begins. I somewhat liked the movie ..I agreed to it as the movie had Rajnikant ... if nothing else I thought I would certainly get to see some stylish cigarette throwing , chewing gum bouncing , bad guys falling , out of this world style fighting.\n\nI remembered a scene from that movie of this King sitting and a dude and a girl in ethnic Indian dance wear dancing in front of the king till the king gets mad at some thing and slices of someone's head.\n\nMaybe my mind was playing tricks on me , maybe it was a coincidence or maybe the movie was inspired from that one. But anyway I loved BB.\n\nA very neat and decent effort I would say. Maybe I praised the movie a little too much for many people but hey the only 3 genres I like are horrors , thrillers and comedies .... and fortunately for me this movie fell under all the three.\n\nI would easily give 3 stars out of 5.\n\nA must watch !"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had the luxury of seeing this movie with no expectations, the non-stop factory that priyadarshan runs is turning out one lacklustre comedy after the other, and the quality is only deteriorating after every shift.\n\nBut this was not copied from an English movie (unlike all his earlier films which were supposedly remakes from south films but the fact that the south film was a remake was ignored), and the stellar cast that all his films contain is always good for some entertainment.\n\nThe movie started out well enough with the obscure town in Rajasthan with some good cinematography (good because with a canvas like rural India/Rajasthan its impossible not to have good visuals).\n\nThe regular cast returns with a few new faces namely Namely Vidya Balan, Shiny Ahuja and Amisha Patel. Shiny Ahuja gave a convincing performance, while Amisha Patel could well have been a bystander, VIDYA BALAN LOOKED HIDEOUS, DRESSED BADLY AND TOWARDS THE SCENES AT THE END CROSSED OVER THE LINE IN THE DISGUSTING CATEGORY, the acting talent may be there but its discomforting to see a 35-40 looking actress doing the role she does.\n\nThe movie gives us the regular Priyadarshan/Neeraj Vohra comic fare with a twist, after Akshay Kumar enters there's a bit of weird humour not unlike the one seen in sleepy hollow but half the flair.\n\nYet the first half is enjoyable maybe even good, as you wait in anticipation for the climatic second one.\n\nThe regulars do what they do, ie give stellar performances with varied forms of humour and drama ranging from the downright corny to the brilliant. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM PRIYADARSHAN, BESIDES CHURNING OUT ORDINARY COMEDYS.\n\nThe mystery have been all to predictable for me (got in 5 minutes,i got the motives wrong though), but by the interval most people had the same idea.\n\nThe second half takes a steady and rapid decline, till it reaches a point which is equivalent to running of a cliff. The last half hour (i think felt like 1 hour) is to pathetic that after a long time, i actually felt a headache. When i cried out in frustration (and much to the annoyance of my parents \"Woh Jo Bhi ho bhaad me Gaya Pichar Khatam Karo Bh!@@(*d\" the whole theater mirrored their agreement with a bout of laughter that far exceeded any in the movie.\n\nThere are some really nice scenes specially in the earlier half like Akshays entry, Paresh Rawal pleading with the pseudo ghost, etc etc.\n\nBut these scenes were supposed to be the filler for what was supposed to be a climatic, mysterious and maybe even funny second half, but ended up being the best part off this otherwise pathetic movie.\n\nSome social issues were touched but these were lost in confusing end.\n\nEven though Priyadarshans movies are degrading with time, this is the first time that a pathetic last half hour is making me tell people to avoid this movie unless they are hardcore fans.\n\nWatch at your own risk.\n\n-s pathetic last half hour, Vidya Balan, confusing and deteriorating second half, bad songs (the title song isn't being shown in many theatres).\n\n+/-s mystery or comedy ???probably fails at both.Have we had too much of Akshay in the same roles???.\n\n+s Stellar regular cast, some good scenes, good technically, lovely visuals.\n\ntotal 3.5/10 (and not factoring in my low/no expectations because any higher rating may be misleading, i cannot emphasize how bad the last half hour is, to add to that now we have people complaining about the Buddha statue so Adlabs isn't showing the title track.)"

The comedy scenes whenever he appeared it delivered something new to the movie. Alall the other actors done a brilliant job. In the climax Dholna performance by Vidya Balan would have been one of the finest performance by her. Excellent Climax. Without a doubt you can not miss the movie. A must watch."

Its the movie with the most repeated views in television. Coming to the remake, technically its brilliant according to the time its made, priyadarshan stayed true to the original unlike p vasu who made a mockery out of it. But its the casts performance which letdown this remake. Vidya balan suited the role well, she tried her best but couldn't reach the level of shobhana. Akshay shines in comedy but fails miserably in serious scene. Take for example, there is a scene in the manichitrathazhu where the psychiatrist argues with the exorcist that he is ready to break all the conventional concepts of psychiatry for his friend. The intensity with which mohanlal says that leaves an impact not only in that exorcist character but also with the audience(mohanlal redubbed that scene because he wanted to get perfection). But akshay says that dialogue without any seriousness and that nor doesn't impact the exorcist nor the audience. But the worst performer would be given to shiney ahuja who hams and overacts so badly that my respect towards suresh gopi as an actor increased. Only paresh rawal and manoj joshi gave good performances. Due to this reason bhool bhulaiyaa just turned out to be a normal horror comedy film for hindi audience instead of becoming a cult classic like the original or priyadarshan's previous remake hera pheri."

Shiny Ahuja & Manoj Joshi were also good. I think Amisha Patel overacted a little but still was good. Overall, I love the movie very much & it's a good thriller. I urge all those who loves good stories & scripts should watch this one. This is a sure blockbuster.\n\nThe music as well as background score has been done well. There are some spine chilling moments in the movie. Don't feel a little disappointed by the first half because second half is far far interesting than the first."

Mohanlal-4/5 and Akshay kumar - 0.5/5.....many bollywood fans may not like this comment...because they haven't seen \"manichithrathazu\"....i know the truth about awfulness of its remake because i have watched both the movies....watch \"manichitrathazu\" and u will know the huge differences"

He follows the script, mostly everything is almost logical, good music and really great comedy. Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar are brilliant. Amisha Patel looks alright and surprisingly doesn't have a big part. Vidya balan is great. The movie keeps you captivated with quite a few lol moments. Towards the end however, the overly explanatory tone of the movie slows it down. This is where I thought a little subtlety would have been great, but then remember, this is for the Indian public and most directors do not want to take any chances. Anyway, watch it and you will not be disappointed."
