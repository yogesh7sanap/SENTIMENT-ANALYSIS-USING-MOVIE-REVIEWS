        "review_detailed_main": "'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', originally released Friday, December 7th, 1979. - ORIGINAL Theatrical Version, 1979, Running Time 2hrs&12mn, Rated \"G\" by the MPAA - SPECIAL Extended Version, 1983, Running Time 2hrs&23mn, Rated \"G\" by the MPAA - The DIRECTOR's Edition, 2001, Running Time 2hrs&16mn, Rated \"PG\" by the MPAA - CONTENT for all three versions includes: Mild Adult Language, Mild Sexual Innuendo and Mild Violence.\n\nMy take *** (Out of ****) - or 7/10 on the IMDb Scale.\n\n'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is the big screen debut of the continuation of the science fiction television series 'Star Trek'. The show chronicled the adventures of the crew of the space-going USS Enterprise. The ship explored the galaxy during a historic five-year mission under the command of the charismatic Captain James T. Kirk. Other crew members included the logical first officer/science officer Spock, a half human/half Vulcan hybrid (Vulcans are an alien race, complete with pointed ears) and the passionate country doctor Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy. The TV series ran on NBC from 1966 to 1969.\n\n'Star Trek' takes place in the latter half of the 23rd Century. Mankind has formed alliances with many alien races from planets throughout the galaxy, collectively forming The United Federation of Planets. These societies thrive peacefully and continue to develop together and independently. To protect this Federation from hostiles and seek out new lifeforms and new civilizations is Starfleet. This organization is diplomatic and scientific, yet serves as a military force as needed.\n\nThe movie opens two & 1/2 years after the completion of the starship Enterprise's five year mission. The spaceship is orbiting Earth, in a dry-dock of sorts, completing a complex overhaul. The planet Earth is in the path of a potential destructive alien intruder. The now Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) doesn't have time to spare during this crisis. He takes a grade reduction to captain, wrestling command of the Enterprise away from a less experienced skipper (Stephen Collins), and sets out to counter the alien threat before it can reach Earth. Most of his original crew has been re-assembled for this undertaking. Shortly after Kirk & team embark to stop the intruder, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) joins them on their quest.\n\n'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' trades in on the action, good drama, suspense and wit the TV series offered to a degree. Kirk & company are here pretty much for the ride, instead of being the leaders they're known as. The movie moves at a slow pace, gradually getting into the intricacies of the alien menace. There's a lot of time adoring spaceships as they travel through space. There's not much in the way of real character development.\n\nDespite the compromises, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' works on some level. It's interesting to see the familiar crew in action once again. There are some very fundamental questions asked in the movie that we all have asked ourselves. I found those questions to be intriguing. ST:TMP wants to be intellectual and it succeeds a lot of the time.\n\nJerry Goldsmith, the film's music composer, provides us with one of the most memorable scores in motion picture history. This is a huge plus for a movie noticeably deficient in personality. This lovely score helps to make up for that. The film almost plays like an elaborate special effects music video set to this grand rousing score. I appreciated the film on this level too.\n\nThe special effects by John Dykstra were highly imaginative for the late 1970s. They still hold up well over the decades and continue to enthrall me, especially with the mystery of the alien intruder. The intruder sound effects also succeed in giving me an appropriate sense of awe and dread.\n\nThe 2001 Director's Edition is the best version of the movie. The theatrical version was rushed to make the movie's scheduled release date. It was regarded by director Robert Wise as incomplete. 'The Director's Edition' restores Wise's planned vision for the movie. This version streamlines the pace of the movie, adds a little more depth to the characters and has the originally desired sound-mix and completed special effects restored for this edition.\n\n'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' was followed by nine sequels to date and four new TV series. There is an eleventh movie currently in production.\n\n'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' was a shaky start for the launch of the 'Star Trek' film series. It's better to simply except this picture for what it is, rather than for what it isn't. It's not a perfect movie, but it did what it set out to do. It invited me for a journey offering good special effects, a great music score and a beloved crew back on the job. The movie also gave me something to think about. It could have been a better movie, but it's still a marginally satisfying one. Though clearly not for everyone, I recommend it to those who would welcome the philosophical ride it offers."

For late Seventies it's got some fantastic visuals and some great production value. The wormhole sequence was very trippy and the overall feel of the unknown spacecraft, once on it looks surreal and futuristic, even more futuristic than the Enterprise.\n\nIt's got a great Cast, but it's also a continuation from the Show, anyways we have William Shatner, George Takai, Deforest Kelley, James Doohan and the one that steals the show, Leonard Nimoy as Spock.\n\nIt's also got a great score by Jerry Goldsmith who I remember as the composer for the Gremlin Rag. His score is very Large Scale and Grandiose with a sense of exploration to it.\n\nThe Dialogue is also pretty great at times, along with the acting, mainly from Nimoy as he didn't become iconic in the role of Spock for no reason, he's very intellectual, logical (as all Vulcans are) and stiff with a hint of humanity to him.\n\nNow comes the part where I say what I didn't like.\n\nThe main complaint I have with the film is that it's slow paced and at just over two hours it begins to drag, especially in the third act before the last maybe fifteen to twenty minutes kicks in, then it gets more engaging again. However I found it somewhat difficult to pay attention to once they reach their destination and right before they realize exactly what they're dealing with, the span of time between those two points just became a bit of a slog.\n\nThat being said that was really my only major problem with the film, but it's a bit of a big deal cause if it can't hold your attention and stay engaging, you might lose your audience unless they are really invested or have a better level of patience than what modern films have been catering towards.\n\nIt's a decent start to a legacy film franchise that I heard gets way better by the very next film, so I can't wait to dig into Khan further down the line."

This film really isn't about the Star Trek crew, but about the vast visual effects laden V'Ger and how the Enterprise spends 2+ hours exploring it. The score by Jerry Goldsmith only accentuates this epic-ness - this is one of his best scores and brings a majestic quality to the Star Trek crew. Never really is this film funny (unlike 4) or action-packed (unlike II) but regardless will always have a place in my heart because it tries to be as epic as Star Trek can possibly be. Overall, a 7 out of 10 (mostly because of the state-of-the-art effects of its time in 1979 and a superb score by Jerry Goldsmith RIP)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of course the number one most memorable thing about The Motion Picture is the visual effects. The movie manages to show (for long sequences of time) how good the film looks with its budget and it is just incredible to watch. It also helps with the soundtrack being as good as it is. However, although the film has a beautiful look and a great soundtrack, the essential film itself does tend to drag. There are long (and I mean long) periods of time where nothing is happening. It seems like the director and writer were going for a different feel then the normal Star Trek feel. So overall while it does drag, Star Trek The Motion Picture still has some enjoyment to it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've heard George Lucas talk about the change of pacing between films of the 1970's and of films now. He talked about how the pacing of the first Star Wars film was considered rapid at the time but by today's standards, pretty slow. I feel the same can be said about the first Star Trek film (The Motion Picture). The first hour of this film is quite a drag. The special effects are dated, but sometimes that can be forgiven if the story around it is epic (Original Star Wars). The story for this film is embroiled in mystery as we don't even know who or what the villain is for close to an hour and a half.\n\nOverall, I think I can say I enjoyed watching Star Trek: The Motion Picture as it brings back all of the same characters and dynamics from the original series, but the story dragged and I don't feel like this was the particular plot they should have revolved the first feature film around.\n\nThe enterprise this time is investigating an alien spacecraft that gets mysteriously close to earth, known as V'Ger. Captain Kirk returned back to his position as head of the Starship Enterprise. Kirk replaced the new head of the enterprise, Decker. Obviously, you know that the dynamic between the two will have plenty of tension knowing there's two captains in the same ship, but it doesn't go to the extent that a normal Hollywood film would do.\n\nYes, the tone and feel of the film is the same as the series but I think it was lacking the magic. There's a lot of time in the film spent on showing the numerous special effects shots and set pieces they created for the film. With that said, I don't feel like there was enough time spent on character development for people who didn't know the characters from the TV show.\n\nIt's not that Star Trek: The Motion Picture isn't a good entry in the series, it's just that there's merely nothing special at all about the film. Its constantly told to us that this mission is to save the entire human race and has a huge scope, but we don't really see that being played out. I liked the ending reveal involving V'Ger, but it didn't save the film from being an average entry in a history franchise.\n\n+Same feel as the series\n\n+Cool reveal\n\n-Don't get a sense of the scope they were going for\n\n-Too much time spent on establishing shots and showing off average special effects\n\n6.3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently watched this movie for the first time in ten or fifteen years. When I was younger I thought this one was even worse than Star Trek V, because as bad as \"The Final Frontier\" was, at least it had some action and colour.\n\nThe version I just saw wasn't the new Director's Edition, just the old video, but I was still completely surprised by just about everything -- partly because I hadn't seen it in so long, and partly because it's so totally different from all the following Trek movies. I even kinda liked the silly space pajamas everyone wears.\n\nAfter this, the movie series turned to action-oriented stories, a more militaristic look and feel, and infinitely less challenging concepts. True, the pacing of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" drags in parts, and the behavior of its stars is a little cold and stiff. But instead of treating us with space battles and phaser shootouts, it gives us long, loving shots of the newly revamped starship Enterprise, and instead of rather tawdry plots grounded in mundane reality, it takes us on a metaphysical voyage into an unknown, bizarre, and palpably huge alien device. The relationship of the three main characters has changed a little after several years apart, and they're each getting used to things all over again: Kirk has to deal with the unfamiliar new ship; Spock, after trying to purge his emotions, must confront his human half; and McCoy is \"shanghaied\" out of retirement for the trip. Decker and Ilia, the new characters, provide enough interest that they were virtually resurrected as Riker and Troi in Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nThe sense of scale is important. The cloud surrounding V'Ger is gigantic, and the ship at the heart of the cloud is a whole world to itself. The Enterprise must fly into the cloud and communicate with the ship, and it's the only time in any of the ten movies that the heroes actually confront something new and unknown. This was a staple of the original show, and some of the best episodes of the spin-off series. The subsequent films were content with setting their battles and chases in space, but \"Star Trek I\" actually wants to explore that space. The question at the centre of the film, posed by Spock, is \"Is this all we are? Is there nothing more?\" Kirk, Spock, and V'Ger are all searching for an answer to that question.\n\nHowever, the thing that definitely drags the film down is the sound. The red alert blares every other minute, and mechanical computer voice-overs announce just about everything they possibly can. In the process of updating the ship, they've emphasized the computers and mechanics of the vessel in a way they never had before or since, and the effect is jarring and interesting at the same time. The Enterprise is much more of a physical ship traveling in space, and less of a device to facilitate storytelling.\n\nThe visual effects are amazing enough to warrant some digital cleaning, and the movie should be seen in widescreen, preferably on a large television.\n\nIt's too bad that this movie wasn't more of a success, because I would like to see more Star Trek in this style. After many years and many TV shows, I admit I've gotten a little tired of space battles.\n\nUPDATE: I recently watched the Director's Edition DVD. The sound effects are fixed, and the film has been re-edited to tighten the pace ever so slightly. The changes made are not on the level of the Star Wars special editions, but they do make the movie more watchable. It's a little more coherent now, and I like it even more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having been one of the shows that was part of my childhood and growing up, the original 'Star Trek' still holds up as great and ground-breaking, even if not perfect.\n\nThe first 'Star Trek' endeavour, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', was and still is heavily criticised by critics and the opinions on fans is a mixed bag of passionate defence and extreme hate. Personally belong in neither extreme. 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is not as bad as its reputation, but it is a deeply flawed (even for the first 'Star Trek' film and everything has to start somewhere) and paved the way for better 'Star Trek' films, apart from the critically derided 'The Final Frontier'.\n\nStarting with 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture's' flaws, the pace definitely could have been tightened with the first half being particularly ponderous and aside from the visuals uneventful. This part could easily have been trimmed down and considerably shorter rather than being an effort to disguise that there was not enough story to justify the overlong length.\n\nCasting is uneven, with subtlety once again eluding William Shatner and very little done with the Enterprise team. Stephen Collins seems out of his depth as Decker in a role that didn't seem that difficult, instead seeming underwritten. Persis Khambatta spends much of her screen time looking awestruck. Some of the script is too patchwork and talky.\n\nHowever, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' looks amazing, a big improvement over the production values of the show. Whereas the production values were one of the original series' few faults, the production values are where this film most excels. It is beautifully and atmospherically photographed, with a '2001: A Space Odyssey' (which is quite a compliment) influence and awe-inspiring special effects. The music by Jerry Goldsmith adds hugely, it's rousing stuff and the main theme is iconic. The sound effects have a suitable eeriness.\n\nMuch of the script is intelligent and thought-provoking, while the more plot oriented and character-driven second half has the delightful interaction, conflicts and development that made me a fan of 'Star Trek' in the first place, this element was always one of the original series' biggest strengths. There is a thrown in and underwritten subplot, but there is an astonishingly clever and shocking subplot and a suspenseful climax There is a '2001' grandeur to Robert Wise's directing.\n\nWhile the Enterprise crew disappoint and Shatner refuses to reign in, the rest of the original 'Star Trek' crew are on top form and their interaction a delight. Can never get enough of Leonard Nimoy or Spock.\n\nIn summary, could have been better and the criticisms are valid but there are a lot of things to admire that makes the film much better than its reputation. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was an under-rated film in the first version, and it is improved a great deal with the changes that Robert Wise made just a few years before he passed away. There has been a backlash against this picture, mostly for two reasons; it was not Star Wars, and it was not what people expected of Star Trek.\n\nIf you put these expectations aside, and if you also have some attention span and willingness to relax into a picture this is a remarkable experience. I often here people use words like boring, too long etc. Well yes, if we are expecting a quick-hit, film that can be digested in 90 minutes like a TV show, this is not that type of film. If we apply these standards to Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Blade Runner, Bridge on the River Kwai, or Citzen Kane (which Robert Wise edited, none of these films would have ever been made.\n\nIf you put Star Trek The Motion Picture in context of it's scale and the craftsman involved you start to appreciate it's quality and elegance. Robert Wise does not need qualification. He brings an elegance and texture to work and life in space that StarWars has not put to screen to this day.\n\nStar Wars even now seems like nothing more than an impressive exercise in effects and sound. It is always reminding us that it is a movie. ST-TMP on other hand departed into an \"immersive experience\" developed by Robert Wise, with the amazing talents of Doug Trumbull and John Dykstra, and the enormous contibutions of Jerry Goldsmith. Likewise, the photography, the scale of the sets and the editing of the film all contribute to a immersive world that saturates the viewer into the film.\n\nYou gain a lot of knowledge and appreciation of this film and the experience that they achieved by watching the Director's Edition DVD and listening to Wise, Trumbull, Dykstra, Goldsmith and others discuss the production. This was a uniquely creative and enormous effort, and considering the technological limitations, the demands of the studio, and the many demands of the Star Trek Bible that qualified the creation of the movie. I am pleased to see that other reviewers here have come to appreicate this movie many years later. I encourage the skeptics to find the time to relax and watch it on the biggest screen you can find."

If you want a lot of dialogs in an adventure and you aren't Tarantino then don't do it. To be perfectly clear I don't hate it, I honestly think it looks quit pretty,but looks only in a movie are not enough and the the three nominations for Oscar seem to me a bit to much and the fact it didn't won proves me, from my point of view, right. I know that this review may angry some trekkies, but lets be honest here, the Motion Picture does not hold up, sorry but despite that it isn't for any reason a bad film, the fact remains that is boring and dated."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Star Trek: The Motion Picture was originally released, I was eager to see it, so much so that I traveled fifty plus miles to a theater in Huntington W.V. to see it. After Star Wars, I was anxious to see the transfer of Star Trek to the big screen, where it would not be saddled with the confines of the budget of a t.v. series. I should have saved myself the trip.\n\nThe budget is up there on the screen, and the makers of this movie are darn proud of it. So much so that they forgot to give us a decent story line, any interaction worth between the crew members, or any decent dialogue between the crew members. What we end up with is two hours plus of gosh, gee whiz, isn't that cool, special effects that are extremely pretty to look at. A dozen roses is pretty also but I don't want to sit and watch them for over two hours either.\n\nWe have one long long long sequence outside the Enterprise while it is in space port. We get a long long sequence of the Enterprise going through a worm hole early on, that is neither intense or exciting, just hazy. Later, we get lots and lots and lots and lots of shots of the Enterprise traveling through a space cloud. I do believe I actually dozed off through this sequence and was surprised it was still there when I woke up. Then as if that weren't bad enough, we get another never ending scene of Spock doing the future equivalent of a space walk! Perhaps they should have called this Star Trek: The Never Ending Special Effects Show.\n\nWhen it was over, and I left the theater, I have to admit it was nice seeing the old Star Trek gang back together again, for one last time as I was sure that after this Galaxian Slide Show, it would be their last appearance. It was one time I was glad I was dead wrong about something.\n\nThis review refers to the original theatrical release. I'll watch the DVD directors cut when I'm ready to take a nap."

        "review_title": "Superior slice of science fiction adventure filmmaking; a resounding Star Trek tale for older fans and newcomers alike.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first Star Trek film of 1979 is an exciting, expansive and rather tense first foray into feature length filmmaking for the popular franchise - a bold going where very few, if any, television shows had gone before. There's a polished sense of spectacle, adventure and smarts all wrapped up into one about it; a sheen of precision and careful planning about the production \u2013 a sense of craft to it. Indeed, \"The Motion Picture\" rather than \"the movie\", or anything else for that matter, is a perfect subtitle for something that has a swagger about it; a piece that has pretensions to be something a little more than your average space adventure blast 'em up, without possessing much in the way of arrogance that comes with a self-conscious knowledge that it's heading down this respective route. The film is set in a distant future further still within deepest of deep space, and yet its chief source of spectacle arrives in the form of the speaking; reasoning and communication between a number of its characters, most notably its protagonist and new-found antagonist during the final act.\n\nThe film follows a relatively familiar, if unspectacular, singular line framework, for sure - in that regular battles must be conquered along the way to ending where they do and that the individual misunderstandings crew members have with each other need to be resolved, but it is remarkable how by the time the final act as arrived, the piece is willing to abstain from conventional conclusion. We begin with the focusing on what will come to form as the film's primary source for plight: a huge energy cloud thousands of miles away from an Earth, whose own measurements of time has seen it reach the 23rd century. We observe some spaceships passing by, our eye unsure on what to focus on as lingering shots of the crafts and the distinct turrets that stick up out of them capture our gaze more than anything. A cut inside reveals some ugly looking creatures using an alien language and distinct technology, technology they use to attack the large purple energy cloud before it itself wipes them out with relative ease. The desired effect of lingering on space ships we have never before encountered, and therefore require time so a to become familiarised with them, before cutting inside to reveal the ugly creatures said edit reveals and concluding the process by having those creatures killed off, is an effective procedure establishing distinct hierarchy within this new world and immediately implements this glowing energy cloud at the centre of all the film's tension and wonder.\n\nDirector Robert Wise has effectively blended a slow-burning approach to telling a space adventure with an overall narrative framework of race-against-time. The cloud is heading for Earth; it's unstoppable; nobody knows what it is or what it wants and thus far, has only reacted aggressively to what it's encountered. Luckily for Earth based space programme organisation Starfleet, the one ship nearby and able to head on out to intercept and investigate is the famed U.S.S. Enterprise harboured at its sunny, welcoming, radiant and busy-bodied San Fransisco headquarters; far away from the large, open, gloomy, ominous locales of the previous sequences. Said ship is, of course, headed up by its chief: a certain Admiral named James Kirk played, as in the TV show of the 1960s, by William Shatner, somebody whom storms in unopposed and assumes control from acting captain Willard Decker (Collins) thus nicely teeing up the friction existing between the two of them thereafter. The film also makes decent use of a back-burning item in the form of The Enterprise's overall physical state, its potential to malfunction ominous when we recall what the energy cloud is capable of to fully functioning ships; the death of two people trying to use the transporter beams rather-a stark forcing home of this.\n\nThe crew will eventually come to be made up of varying people of varying ethnicities, in that an African American; a Hmong man; a young Aryan; etc. will form the nucleus of the ship's diverse operators, successfully getting across a sense of the whole thing being a multicultural effort. Also along for the ride is Indian actress Persis Khambatta's alien life-form named Ilia, who's given a Lieutenant rank and shares a romantic history with the demoted Decker. Of the original crew, a foil arrives for Kirk in the form of the ship's doctor named Bones McCoy (Kelley), whereas male specimen of the Vulcan race variety Mr. Spock (Nimoy) comes aboard when he is drawn to the cloud due to the effect it had on his usually transparent emotional state. Wise shoots the unveiling of The Enterprise, as it undergoes repair work in a series of longing close ups. Kirk and one of his engineers very slowly veer up to it in a transport pod, the reaction on Kirk's face and a general sense of awe is inferred onto the audience, namely the die hard fans of the show, so as to help along the reaction as The Enterprise is revealed on the big screen for the very first time. Wise shoots what feels like all corners of the ship, from all possible angles and compositions, as people stand around it on apparatus seeing to it: a literal repair job for what's happening within the film, a metaphorical preparation/revealing job as the final touches are made and the big reveal is made.\n\nThe film is a surprisingly remarkable piece of drama, with Wise wedging great peril out of the simplest of ideas such as the being on collision course with a small but devastatingly effective asteroid as well as some uncanny happenings during other encounters which are instead helped along by the special effects that greatly enhance the ominous predicaments, rather than just cruelly ageing film and sapping out drama. The film is engaging and workmanlike enough in equal measure to work as both decent escapism and as smart, brooding science fiction."

Why is this particular Star Trek movie so underrated? I'll never understand.\n\nThe way the characters are re-introduced to the audience and to each other - no to mention the U.S.S. Enterprise - was fantastic. The only character that did not get a grand introduction was Nurse Chapel (I hate she didn't get her grand entrance) but otherwise it was a wonderful way to bring all the characters to the big screen from the TV show.\n\nThe story is interesting: there is a highly intelligent life-form threatening to rid the universe of planet Earth. But exactly who, what and why does it want to do such a thing? What does it really want? Captain Kirk and crew are called in to investigate and solve the puzzle.\n\nA severely underrated Star Trek film that really deserves to be re-watched.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture was Paramount Studio's attempt at cashing in on the Star Wars craze that was sweeping through the late seventies. However, instead of getting a fast-paced action romp, they got something more in tune with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Therefore, the first big screen Star Trek outing was always left in Star Wars' shadow. This, of course, was slightly rectified by the sequel (and darker and more action-orientated) The Wrath of Khan, but that's another story.\n\nIt's easy to see why Star Trek: The Motion Picture never set the box office alight, it's slow, very talky-talky, with lingering shots of things that you don't really know what they are and absolutely no action. However, that said, it's actually quite good (but only if you're in the mood).\n\nIf you're looking for something fast-paced then you should probably ignore most of the Star Trek saga and skip straight to the 2009 reboot. Whereas if you are a fan of slow-burning (and dare I say it?) 'intellectual' science fiction then you might get something out of this.\n\nAvatar it is not. Interesting it is. Although, it should probably have an 'Eighteen Certificate' slapped on it - not because the content is particularly 'adult' in nature, but simply because there's no way anyone under eighteen would ever appreciate it and have the patience to sit through it.\n\nMay the old crew live long and prosper."

Alas, as much as I, a die-hard Star Trek fan, enjoy looking at the expensive new model Starship Enterprise, this is one of the most boring films ever made! I recommend it be avoided at all costs! If you want a movie to contrast with Star Trek: The Motion Picture, watch Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, directed by Nicholas Meyer. Instead of watching the most expensive (and most boring) Star Trek film made, you can watch the least expensive yet the best. Star Trek II is hands-down the best Trek film period. Second-best is (surprise, surprise) Star Trek VI, also directed by Nicholas Meyer (I sense a pattern). However, Star Trek: The Motion Picture did break the ice for the Star Trek films and set the bar low so that Mr. Meyer could show off his directing expertise. The pain of Star Trek: The Motion Picture can be lessened by listening to \"The Blue Danube\" waltz (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey) during the laboriously long segments showing the Starship Enterprise. Yes, I am a Star Trek fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "The beloved television series got reinvented for the big screen with this noticeably ambitious production. Paramount obviously sunk a fair amount of money into this, and it shows, in a story of a mysterious energy field that quickly makes its way towards Earth, and could spell doom for all on the planet, unless the Enterprise intercepts it first. Kirk (William Shatner reclaims his most iconic role in style), aggressively obtaining command from a man named Decker (Stephen Collins), takes control of a brand spanking new Enterprise, and is reunited with many of his old hands.\n\nThis initial feature film is admittedly imperfect; for one thing, the pace is so sedate that less patient viewers may be squirming in their seats. Some viewers may also feel that the enigmatic alien intelligence (eventually to be identified as \"V'ger\") really isn't enough of a presence in the film. As it is, it relays information and requests through the body of a crew member, Ilia (the striking Indian beauty Persis Khambatta).\n\nTo its credit, \"The Motion Picture\" explores intelligent and provocative ideas (Harold Livingston scripted, based on a screen story by noted genre author Alan Dean Foster) and does create a genuine sense of awe and wonder. The sets are re-imagined on a truly grand scale, and the picture can boast some real eye-catching visual effects.\n\nThe veteran cast members (Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney) settle right back into their old roles quite comfortably. Kelley's \"Bones\" has always been a favorite for this viewer; I love the way he can always come up with a humorous assessment of a plot point. (When the creator of \"V'ger\" is likened by Spock to that of a child, Bones quips, \"What should we do? Spank it?\")\n\nExcellent Jerry Goldsmith music is a perfect accompaniment to \"The Motion Picture\", which proved that despite the cancellation of the original series, that Gene Roddenberry's concepts have continued to carry a great deal of weight over the decades.\n\n\"The Motion Picture\" may have gotten eclipsed in overall quality by some of its sequels, but there's no denying that it certainly has its place in the scheme of the franchise.\n\nSeven out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Always my least favorite (and naturally least watched) of the six original 'Trek' films, I was surprised to find that I was really into the first half of 'ST:TMP'. Things like the often mocked 4 minute shuttle ride were suddenly pulling me in rather than putting me to sleep. Listening to Goldsmith's heroic score blasting away as Kirk looks at the re-fitted Enterprise like a man returning to his long lost love really moved me. And as our heroes gather together to go off into the unknown I was on the edge of my seat despite having seen this at least half a dozen times before. But then in the second half it screeches to a halt as they engage in a tedious, drawn out mystery that's meant to be profound, but ends up coming across like the kind of paperback self help hokum that was filling shelves and nightstands in the late 70s.\n\nBut my biggest problem with the movie remains the characters. Not only do they all suddenly dress like intergalactic dentists, they don't act like themselves, save for McCoy. Spock is explained to have been undergoing a purge to expel all emotion, but that doesn't soften the blow for us when he shows up half way through acting like a jerk. And Kirk is just... off. Again, I think his sudden vulnerability is supposed to be a plot point, but it's not Kirk. Kirk doesn't doubt. Kirk doesn't lose. Kirk doesn't admit that he's wrong, because he's never wrong. Kirk swaggers down the halls of the Enterprise, has adult relations with green women and beats up lizard men. He does not play second fiddle to the creepy dad from 7th Heaven, and he damn sure doesn't let him get the leggy bald chick.\n\nTruth be told, the story here is probably closer to that of the original series than any of the films that follow, but it just never quite feels like 'Star Trek' to me."

It lacks virtually all of the charm and humour with which the series was infused. The chemistry between the actors, and so the characters, is entirely absent.\n\nThe plot, what there is of it, seems to be based on The Changeling, an episode of the old Star Trek series, and on a bad episode of Space: 1999.\n\nFor a real reunion of the crew of the Enterprise, forget this blunder and look at Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

Don't think that \"action\" I mention was fighting and shooting, it wasn't. Perhaps lack of silly fighting makes (all too) many people to say that this film was too long and slow paced. Well, I disagree - this is exactly the kind of science fiction I love, you are given chance to use your own imagination. Some say pacing and the film is similar to Kubrik's 2001...I won't argue against it.\n\nThe film had amazing special effects for its time. No, not amazing, incredible. But don't watch it for special effects only, the real interest of this film lies in the nature of the alien \"cloud\" and Enterprise crew trying to figure it out and trying to cope with it. Special effects were used as a tool to launch YOUR imagination, as they should be.\n\nThis film is probably closest to spirit of original series, without much campiness though.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's amazing how many Trekkies I meet describe Star Trek the Motion Picture as \"A good sci-fi film, but an awful Star Trek movie.\"....And that's when they're feeling generous!\n\nThis statement can't be farther from the truth. The story is well written and director Robert Wise makes the characters believable. The movie is not filled with the goofy jokes and ridiculous Shatner back-flip fight scenes that some Trekkies seem to enjoy. Instead, the battle with the mysterious alien entity reveals the dynamics and inner conflicts of the crew. Spock realizes that pure logic alone cannot answer all, but must be coupled with emotion in order to tap into our creative imagination and see the possibilities of our universe. Kirk is portrayed as a daring and brilliant captain, who learns that as a leader he needs to rely on the expertise of those around him. He is a more believable figure who is fallible and struggles to learn from his mistakes.\n\nThe Enterprise is not envisioned as an easy to fly wonder ship that requires no more than the main Trek cast to run, but as a complex machine that needs precise tuning of components balanced by a crew of hundreds. The scene where Spock and the engineering crew struggle with balancing the mathematical models needed to program the warp engines convey the real dangers of space flight.\n\nAdditionally, both the visual and audio effects add to the impact of this movie. For a film made in '79, before the advent of believable CGI, the special effects are superb. Believe it or not, I've noticed special effects scenes in Independence Day taken directly from Star Trek:TMP footage (scan the shots of the inside of the mother ship (ID4)when Will Smith is making his escape run).\n\nAll in all, the ingredients of good character development, believable conflict, and hard science make this movie the true precursor to Star Trek: The Next Generation. Unfortunately, Star Treks III, IV, and V avoid the hard work this movie required and depend on the silly antics of its maturing crew."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have decided that I wanted to tackle an entire franchise of films. When posing this idea to Tom, he immediately stated that I should see all of the Star Trek films. Eek, I thought!! Not ever being a fan of it, I had only been exposed to the original series that was shown constantly on BBC Two as I was growing up, and the later series The Next Generation, that I had seen a few episodes of from the late '80's, and I was never enamored by it - I am certainly no 'Trekkie'. My only experience of the films was the very recent J. J. Abrams 'reboot', that I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed. With trepidation, I began the series, inevitably, from the very start. And I have to confess I was pleasantly surprised with it, despite it being an odd number film (if you are unaware, the fan world suggests that only the even numbered Star Trek films are any good).\n\nThe main crux of the story focuses on an unidentified phenomenon that is heading towards Earth, destroying everything in it's path. This brings back together the original crew of the Starship Enterprise: Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Bones (DeForest Kelly), Scotty (James Doohan), et al. Their task is to stop the strange enemy. The villain of the piece is certainly an interesting one. A more cerebral monster, in a state of existential crisis, the team have quite a task to penetrate it's unknown dangers.\n\nAside from the awfulness of Shatner - he genuinely can't act - the characters are interesting, and with Kirk's usurping of the Enterprises captain at the start seems to create an interesting duality. This is quickly thrown to the side. There is an interesting and theoretically disturbing scene at the start of the film, we see the teleportation units that 'beam up' crew members go horribly wrong. The result - whilst not seen - is horrifying, as the fundamentals of teleportation require that the body is broken into it's most basic molecules and reconstructed in a different place. This transaction was never completed, and therefore the bodies of the travelers, are never fully restructured.\n\nWith some science consultancy from the great sci-fi writer, Isaac Asimov, the film surely had some credentials. The special effects were overseen by Douglas Trumball and John Dykstra, and the results are often astounding, even today. Whilst not capturing the fun and excitement of Star Wars (1977), this more cerebral, esoteric space adventure, offers a more 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) stance on space than the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers elements of Star Wars. It's not a great film, but I was absolutely amazed that it was actually good. However, at an exhausting 132 minutes, the film could have been tighter with a few trims here and there. It would have benefited with a 100 minute running time.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

The always-dynamic triangle of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is broken up and, even though all three are in the film, too much of the film's focus is on the Stephen Collins/Deltan woman failed romance instead. The script lacks humor. The characters lack camaraderie. The plot lacks action and conflict. Instead of showing us the updated interior of the ship, we get many, many slow-moving exterior shots of the ship.\n\nIt's a rather boring film. Thank goodness The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock are coming."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture has its unique place in cinema history as probably the first television series to get a big screen motion picture. Completely due to its special fan base, the like of which has never been seen before or since.\n\nIn order to keep the phenomenon going Gene Roddenberry knew he had to have something special to offer and he did. The continuity from the television series was accomplished effortlessly, in fact one of the new characters Commander William Decker is the son of William Windom who was another starship captain in an episode. More I can't say less I give the plot away.\n\nIn fact Decker played by Stephen Collins would be commanding the newly fitted Enterprise if it were on a routine mission. But with the threat of an immense alien being on a direct path to earth now Admiral James T. Kirk takes command of the starship himself and with Decker reunites all the old crew from the TV series to meet the threat.\n\nFans of the original series will also see the similarities in plot between another episode involving the Enterprise meeting up with an old space probe that now has taken on some new functions. The same idea forms the basis of this film's story although in every way it has been expanded and a new ending conceived. Here's a hint, a budding relationship between Collins and new ship's lieutenant Persis Khambatta is what ultimately saves the earth.\n\nJust as you remember them William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, and Walter Koenig are all back and completely in character as you remember them. The new people Collins, Khambatta and the rest are integrated nicely into the story.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture received three Academy Award nominations, for Best Art&Set Direction, Best Visual Effects, and Best Musical Score. The special effects never overwhelm the telling of a good story which is the primary mission and best asset of the original television series and its successors.\n\nIf you're not a Trekkie before seeing this film, you may be come one upon viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the very first STAR TREK flick after the show ran its three seasons and was years in the making. Parts 2 through 6 have a different feel to it and vibe than the original film. This to me is more like an extended version of the show itself. Spectacular effects drive this film, but in the end it has its definite flaws and because of those this in fact may be my least favourite original STAR TREK film\n\nRight at the start of the film we see a great power in the universe that totally destroys a Klingon Bird of Prey ship. The Federation finds out that it is headed directly for Earth. So Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) heads The Enterprise to meet up with the power in space and find out its deadly intentions.\n\nThe costumes of this film are only used here in this film. They are different than the show and to me they look like they belong in a space disco or something. When Part 2 rolled around they had a much more military styled look that I much prefer.\n\nAll the original cast are back to join Kirk including Spock (Leonard Nimoy) who is great and I like how his character is added into the story as he is no longer with The Federation and is on his quest to become one with total logic and Bones (DeForrest Kelley) who has been drafted to join this quest as he is no longer with The Federation either. Also includes two new characters Decker (Stephen Collins) who was supposed to Captain the ship until Kirk was given The Enterprise back, so there is some good tension between the two and from the Deltan race Ilia (Persis Khambatta) who do create a nice heart to the story with their relationship.\n\nAs I stated earlier the effects are spectacular especially since some of the effects still hold up extremely well today and this was released in 1979. They were nominated for an Oscar for the effects, but lost out to Ridley Scott's ALIEN. The problem I have with the effects though is that the movie stops on a number of occasions just to show off the effects really. It slows the story down to a crawl when the story needed some beefing up.\n\nThe score is spectacular as well by Jerry Goldsmith and was nominated for an Oscar as well. He lost out to A LITTLE ROMANCE. The one thing the STAR TREK movies always had was great scores. This one is especially amazing, but was dropped I believe after this part, but returned again for Part 5.\n\nI am not saying miss this entry altogether as I do enjoy it. You need to start at part 1 if you have never seen the original movies. I have even seen some people proclaim this film that was directed by veteran Robert Wise as a masterpiece, but I find the flaws do drop the rating perhaps 1 or 2 stars. Also starring original cast members James Doohan, Walter Koenig, George Takei and Nichelle Nichols."

Instead, all the money was sunk into an adventure confined completely on the board the Enterprise, making one wonder where all the money went.\n\nSince the setting never changes and the acting of the original crew is uncharacteristically wooden, the film seems stagnant and goes nowhere. Decker and the bald chick, unlike the female Vulcans in future films, are terrible additions to the cast. They are little more than boring intruders stealing screen time from the people we really want to see in action."

        "review_title": "Better than it's reputation would suggest ... yet not very good either",
        "review_detailed_main": "You can pretty easily see why this film was a commercial failure in 1979. Although another \"Star Trek\" project had been bandied about for years, it's clear that the reason that a very big budget film was made as opposed to a new TV series was the unprecedented success of \"Star Wars\". The problem is that this film has virtually nothing in common with \"Star Wars\", and is instead very much indebted to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing though. Although you probably won't make piles of cash with a \"2001\" homage, that film is a masterpiece in it's own right (arguably more of one than \"Star Wars\"). Director Robert Wise had not that long ago made \"The Andromeda Strain\", a very good science fiction film very indebted to \"2001\" in it's own way. So ... why isn't this a masterpiece?\n\nI think it's a very good film with two glaring problems. The first is that \"Star Trek\" and \"2001\" aren't very suited for each other. The heart of \"Star Trek\" seems to lie in the pretty jovial interactions of a set of very appealing characters, and that noticeably clashes with long, slow sequences devoted to special effects and metaphysical grandeur. There are sizeable chunks of this film that mostly involve characters sitting and reacting to stately special effects, and I would argue that that's not why people come to \"Star Trek\".\n\nOne of the smartest things Kubrick did with \"2001\" was not to explain the central ideas in the film. It's not that they are too complex to explain, but rather they are pretty straightforward and just saying them out loud diminishes their power. (It's also that there's a certain ineffability to the film's final images.)\n\nThe issue this poses for a film like this one is that Kubrick's strategy depends on having characters that say very little, and you clearly want the \"Star Trek\" characters talking. This leads to a situation where this film's final ideas, which are not all that bad in and of themselves, get a lot of painful explanation that really exposes how silly they sound. Vague ideas get concretized and they sound, frankly, pretty dumb.\n\nIt's a far better film than it's popular and critical reputation at the time would suggest, but it would almost be a better film if it had nothing to do with \"Star Trek\" at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like this film a lot, but it's quite quite flawed. The plot is largely reused from an original series episode. But the biggest problem is it's 60 minutes of plot squeezed into two hours.\n\nThe original cut was rushed because they ran out of time, and the Director's Cut fixes up a lot. And this cut absolutely sets the standard for adding new fx to a film decades later. In most films, it's painfully obvious when new fx are added. ET, for example. The added cgi of ET is obviously cgi that is glaringly different from the puppet used in most of the movie. Very distracting. It usually feels like they want it to look different so viewers will notice.\n\nThe TMP new effects were great, mainly because they took exacting detail in adding grain and such that you simply can't tell it's added. Also, they added in some fx they had not been able to film in 1979 because they ran out of time. BUT, they only added fx that was intended at the time.\n\nBut even the Director's Cut is still slow. Much of it comes from the characters on the bridge staring at the view screen in awe, despite it being mostly screensaver like video. You have to think they were going for 2001: A Space Odyssey here- but it doesn't work. In 2001, Dave was going through a mind blowing experience, and the crazy fx were abstractly depicting this. In TMP, we are watching characters watching a screen.\n\nIn TMP, the unveiling of the new Enterprise is lengthy, and I'm actually ok with that. It was the first live Trek in ten years, and the refit is breathtakingly beautiful. And there's an in-story reason for the slow approach: it's Kirk love affair with the ship.\n\nHOWEVER, there should have been cuts even there. It's great to see Kirk enthralled with the new Enterprise. But then, there are several shots where he's looking in awe at parts of the dry dock.\n\nThere are also major problems with depicting Vger's gigantic cloud invading. Usually it's a frame filling blob that could be a nebula or many other things. It's basically screen filling undifferentiated whatever along with very threatening music. Plus, it looks completely different when ships get close to it vs far away. There's no apparent connection at all.\n\nAlso, there are several poorly constructed split diopter shots. I found this distracting before I even knew what it was. Using split diopter allows two areas to be in focus at once. It pretty much ruins the effect if you can see the blurry seam between the two, and this happens quite frequently on the bridge. It's almost impossible they didn't do this intentionally, but regardless of intent, it looks quite amateur.\n\nStill, with all the flaws of the film, it's nifty to have a Star Trek film made in this weird Space Odyssey brainy pretentious style. It's also notable that this film looks strikingly like first Star Trek pilot The Cage. This may well be quite close to what Gene wanted."

Show a special effect (many similar to, but not as interesting as the sequences in \"2001, A Space Odyssey\" filmed a dozen years earlier). Follow special effect with reaction shot. Then another reaction shot. Then another special effect. Then another reaction shot.\n\nThe amount of interesting dialog could fit on the back of a cereal box, in large print.\n\nSpends so much time showing the exterior of the Enterprise it seemed like porn for nerds. Slow pacing.\n\nI was thinking it would be a good exercise for a film class on editing to see if you could get a good 45 minutes out of this. But I'm not sure it would be a fair assignment.\n\nLook, I like Star Trek. I watched it in the '60s, watched it in syndication in the '70s, have seen most (perhaps all) of the movies. Have seen many episodes of each of the ST franchise. This movie stunk.\n\nMost significant fact about this movie -- William Shatner appeared to be in better shape than when he was in the series, or in later films. Of course he may have been wearing a truss\n\nI looked up Robert Wise's other credits, and he did know how to tell a story at one time. But I can't imagine he was proud of directing this one.\n\nUltimately, skip this one. Even if you got the boxed set and think it would be fun to watch them all in order. If you do watch it, keep the remote handy to speed through the many special effect / reaction shot sequences."

        "review_detailed_main": "What started as a late-seventies television show revival being developed by the original Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry turned into a full motion picture under the control of a seasoned director and studio.\n\nThis meant that effects models, props and sets had to be re-prepared for the detail of a cinema screen and the production entered new territory as Roddenberry was eased out.\n\nThe premise was to reunite the original crew of (an updated) starship Enterprise and bring them to face an ultimate threat to planet Earth. The plan was to also give us brilliant effects on par with the recent Star Wars explosion and give Paramount a return on its previously mishandled Star Trek property.\n\nWhat resulted was an over-long, over-dramatic but interesting film that entertains the fans nonetheless and presents a high concept in its story. Many have commented on its ridiculously long effects shots and the lack of personalities in our beloved bridge characters. But underneath these is the core of a good science fiction film, just maybe not a brilliant Star Trek film.\n\nAfter a trio of Klingon battlecruisers are destroyed by a mysterious cloud of energy, Kirk takes command of a new, untested Enterprise starship to intercept and investigate the object which is heading directly to Earth.\n\nAs they find a way to communicate with it, the object stops trying to destroy them and instead welcomes them deep inside itself where further information is revealed after a number of events.\n\nFor the first time in Star Trek history, we return to 23rd century Earth as the object threatens to destroy all life on it unless Kirk and crew comply with its demands, which leads to a startling discovery.\n\nThe original budget blew out to almost four times its original allocation, partly due to the project carrying the burden of an aborted television series and hefty sums paid to numerous writers and Leonard Nimoy to get him to reprise his role as Spock.\n\nWhatever you say about the effects, you can't say they are not impressive. They are beautifully created by 2001: A Space Odyssey effects specialist Douglas Trumball and legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith delivers a brilliantly-matching musical score to give the film a grand feeling.\n\nThe screenplay for this film went through many, many rewrites from an original story by Alan Dean Foster, but unfortunately they didn't capture the soul of the original series that came before it. Perhaps the story was too serious or a victim of its difficult development but it is considered by many to be a poor start to an on again / off again run of 11 variable films that followed it.\n\nThe film has been released in its original theatrical version, special video versions and a DVD-era re-edited Director's Edition that addressed some pacing issues and shortcomings of the original special effects that were rushed due to budget and time constraints. Some of these improvements work well, some don't.\n\nOverall, a great science fiction adventure and a giant leap for the ongoing Star Trek franchise."

The story is told better than any television episodes of its kind and the visuals hold up very well to this day.\n\nThe lukewarm reception of this film may largely have to with expectations. This could have been among one of the most fondly remembered television episodes. But stretched into a feature film length it is a slow-paced one. Many may have been expecting something more action-packed akin to Star Wars or some of the later films. Though if you are looking for classic Star Trek then The Motion Picture delivers."

I mean we get to sit there and watch everyone stare at this thing that they're going in to. Then we have the really long boring footage of the ships. Yeah, nice toy ships, great. The dialog is bad, as others have put it, Spock talking flower child and crying and laughing. I thought Spock was supposed to be logical and without emotions. They really screwed up. Good thing Paramount realized that and took it out of Gene's hands before he made a movie that was worse than this. And what was with Decker and Ilia, they got more screen time than Sulu, Checkov, Uhura and Scotty combined, and their sub-plot felt tacked on and pointless. This is not a good movie. This movie makes ST2:TWOK look like it belongs in the high ranks of Casablanca, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption."

Unfortunately this is because today's audience doesn't see the beauty and message behind this Robert Wise (the sound of music) masterpiece.\n\nWhen wise vision this film he dreamed for it to have the impact which \"2001\" gave to its audiences, but sadly audiences of the late seventies had already found a new and more interesting form of sci-fi - Star Wars.\n\nIt is because of this lack of interest, which caused people to criticize it as \"boring\", \"uneventful\" and \"Lacking action and pace\". This however is not what the true Star Trek television phenomenon was ever about. It was based on moral issues and meaningful story themes and this is what Wise has built up in The Motion Picture. From Spock's emotional struggle to V'GER'S missions true purpose, which are both connected as humane achievements which prove to be what both beings are all about.\n\nAnother aspect that Wise introduced into the Star Trek phenomenon was the critically acclaimed special effects. He thankfully succeeded to awe us with the magic he created through the images and wonders then and still to this day.\n\nUnfortunately the acting and dialog in the films center became a quite stale, causing it to drag on for a period of time. But when you have a main cast whose only real big experience was in television nothing really can be helped.\n\nNot only Star Trek fans but also people looking for a movie with true meaning and a great story should definitely look this movie back. With the new Directors special coming out this year which has been reworked with extra scenes, updated special effects and sound, which were all in Wise's original vision, but couldn't be produced due to budgetary constraints added, this film will hopefully be recognized for the classic sci-fi movie it is."

This particular movie of the series, not talking about the reboot or the sequels, is more a philosophical science fiction like 2001 or Solaris, than an action sci-fi as Star wars. That also means this is slower, but that won't mean that it's bad. Simply different.\n\nTHe huge minus to the star trek universe is special effects and set designs. Special effects are most of times unrealistic. Set designs look fake even for being science fiction starship locations. So that's my only complain... if we see 2001 even if 11 years earlier still looks more realistic. To me it's hard to believe that this movie had almost the triple of budget that star wars had. So that's the reason I'm not giving a 9 or 8 to this.\n\nWhat is to note the music, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, not really a composer I'm used to hear in movies, that actually reminded me much of many John Williams compositions"

The \"Villain\" was poorly done, both visually and story-wise.\n\nIn short, if there is one Star Trek movie that you would want to miss would be this one. Only containing a brief glimpse of another species, the Klingons (who look very different from the show), we only really get to see humans. If I were you, keep away from this and go to Nemesis.

And I grew up on \"Star Wars\", and thus I never really took a liking to the \"Star Trek\" thing.\n\nBut I have seen the movies over the years, though never managed to sit through the series in their entirety. So I opted to sit down and watch the \"Star Trek\" movies that I haven't reviewed and thus not seen in a long, long time. Which lead me to start with the 1979 movie \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" from director Robert Wise.\n\nThe storyline in \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", as written by Gene Roddenberry, Harold Livingston and Alan Dean Foster, was actually quite good. And I will say that this movie from 1979 is definitely quite a step up in production from the original 1960s TV series. It is a story that take you on a space adventure and actually leads you by the nose, as you are left kept trying to figure out what is going on with the alien vessel. And once it was revealed, it was actually quite a nice twist to the storyline.\n\nThe acting in \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" was good. And it was definitely nice to see the cast members from the original series turn to the big screen and reprise their characters and roles, as it just gives a good continuity to the franchise.\n\nWhile I am no Trekkie, by any means, then I can still say that \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" was an enjoyable and entertaining movie.\n\nMy rating of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

Star Trek is a movie you need to have patience with. I mean, it STARTS with an Overture, not the most wisest thing you can have in a sci-fi film. Well, OK, 2001 had one, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist (Sorry Scotty!) to compare a lot of the goings on in this movie to 2001, problem is, Robert Wise, the director of this, is almost 10 years too late. Story and loopy psychedelic imagery aside, it was almost a guilty pleasure to see William Shatner play Kirk again after a long absence. He clearly, CLEARLY relishes the role (or maybe the camera), and chews it with a LOT of intensity. For the opposite of that, Is there any better example of awesome underplaying as Leonard Nimoy as Spock? What a champ"

I would never consider myself a Trekkie, but I have certainly spent a good part of my life devoting myself to Kirk and the boys (it breaks my heart to see him such a mess these days). This has the Serlingesque plot of dealing with real artifacts of a bygone time; much as several episodes were. Kirk gets to emote all over the place. Everything is so serious. But they win the day by making use of their earthling intellects (with a little Vulcan thrown in for good measure). I know that some believe this to be a \"thinking man's (or woman's)\" movie. I wish it weren't so simplistic. With \"Star Wars \" stealing their thunder, Roddenberry and the other writers should have come up with a masterpiece. Either they weren't up to the task or they were trying to pander to a lightweight crowd. I don't know.

Love it. It has the suspense and music from the 2001 version but being remastered in 4k has brought out a great sounding cinematic score, and the visuals during the journey into v'ger are what they were meant to be, I discovered the uniforms were not as gray as I remembered, just very muted blues, reds and yellows. Some of the crew wear the muted reds while the main cast are in the muted blues and yellows or cream. I think the visual effects were great, more grainy than cgi would give but very effective.\n\nSo 10 stars for the best version of itself."

And change your perception of the future....by taking you there.\"\n\nIndeed it will and does.\n\nLet me start off by saying, by all means: You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to get into this movie. I'm not. Just watch it, and the motion picture will do the rest. I've been told countless times that Star Wars is the greatest Sci-fi film of all time. I'd like to correct those people. Star Wars is the greatest \"action and special effects sci-fi film\" of all time. Nothing more....and nothing less. I'm a big fan of Star Wars. It was my favorite sci-fi movie--even beating out Alien, 2001, and Starship Troopers.\n\nThat was until I saw this film. I remember right after watching Star Wars that I felt good inside because it was a rush that one can only get--from eye candy. Star Trek: The Motion Picture gave me a different rush--a more profound touch that made me realize movies can have a deeper meaning. Much like 2001, this deals with life....actually more about the \"meaning\" of life. The purpose of existence. Some of the best quotes in cinema history can be traced to this film. My favorite line is from Spock. It pretty much sums up the theme of Star Trek: The Motion Picture\n\n\"Each of us, at some point in our lives, turns to someone - a father, a brother, a God - and asks, \"Why am I here? What was I meant to be?\"\n\nOne thing that really stands out in Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith that makes me wonder if it was blessed by God. Star Wars could never get me to buy the soundtrack on CD. This movie has. I wonder why this didn't win an Oscar for best score.\n\nNow to the plot:\n\nWhen three Klingon (Alien) Starships are attacked and erased from existence by a vast giant omnipotent cloud, drifting in space; a close by Star Base finds out that not only is the cloud headed directly towards them, but is also on a direct path for Earth. The Star Base in question (The Epslion 9) sends a message to Star Fleet for a Starship to be sent and prevent it from reaching Earth.\n\nThe only Starship in enough range to stop the cloud in time is none other than the famous Enterprise from the infamous 1960s television series. The Starfleet legend and hero Captain Kirk and the rest of his crew from the also famous five year mission of the show, make a comeback for one last mission (and many more later, but those are other movie reviews).\n\nBefore the crew can start on their mission, they patch up old wounds put aside their anger for each other to face the menacing unknown that awaits them, realizing this may be the last time they speak to one another...alive.\n\nNot much is known about the cloud or why it is erasing everything in it's path from existence; other than what Spock, the science officer of The Enterprise, has sensed from it....\n\n\"It only knows that it needs, Commander. But, like so many of us, it does not know what.\"\n\nSuspense eats away at you when the final showdown between The Enterprise and the intelligent vast cloud finally comes. And the movie doesn't stop their. Like I said, the movie talks about the meaning of life.\n\nIf you can, buy the director's cut on DVD or VHS. This IS the most beautiful science fiction movie you will ever see."

I remember watching this movie in 1979. People enjoyed it a bit more, back then. Most of these reviews are more recent, and we all had time to digest this, not to mention comparing it to more modern movies with much better special effects, etc. When this movie first hit the theaters, we were all very excited to see our childhood heroes again. We didn't take it too seriously, and we didn't need to. Did anyone watch the original Superman, from a couple of years earlier? I rest my case. I enjoyed this movie, but I had issues with things that most critics didn't bother to mention. I hated the power blue uniforms; they were horrible. I didn't care for the fact that they \"over did it\", with Spock's Vulcanism; his character was too stiff and almost unlikeable. Captain Kirk now had more hair than when he was in his late twenties! Lieutenant Uhura's hairdo was right out of the disco era ! The list goes on. A little more attention to detail would have gone a long way. It's a entertaining movie that you'll find yourself watching over again, and in there is the magic of this movie. Live long and prosper!"

It's so disappointing that the first thing the original series did after years of reruns was a terrible movie. However, the Wrath of Khan was excellent, so that at least somewhat makes up for the poor quality of this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR TREK I: The Motion Picture is a good movie, but it would better as an TV episode. Before I state the problems, here's a better history first, for understanding:\n\nThe Motion Picture's plot came from a script for a \"Star Trek: Phase II\" episode. Of course, the series never premiered, and we got this movie instead. Though, the content was not enough for a movie, so they had to 'elongate' some moments during the film.\n\nAn example of 'elongated' moments is the \"Starship\" scene during the first 30 minutes of the film. Scotty and Kirk are in a pod, slowly moving towards the new Enterprise, during it's pitstop. Instead of attaching the pod to the entrance immediately, they decide to take a 'sightseeing tour' around the Enterprise. At first, you might be gazing at the ship, noticing it's features and visuals, but after 5 minutes, they're STILL not on the ship yet, and you're feeling like a child forced to look at your grand-mum's photos of deceased cats, with the mindset of \"Please, end it. Please, Lord, when will it stop?\" The scene is possibly around 15 minutes, though I'm not completely sure. But if you can last through multiple of those scenes, it's a good movie (though for me, I had to watch it within 3 days because of my sanity wearing off)"

This movie is about sex but doesn't go about getting to the sex in any satisfactory manner. Instead the movie is all about V'GER using some bald chick's body so that Decker goofball can get it on on her, which is way too complicated. For no good reason Spock is extra Spocky and doesn't dial that shtick back for over an hour. And speaking of wasting time, huge amounts of running time is just characters staring at the Enterprise or ogling at V'GER, you all need some fast forward."

And by golly, this turned out to be a recognizable episode, but expanded and much enhanced. So it came down to the usual \"oh, THIS one again\", slightly disappointing for the retread approach, but we were glad to have it. Evidently the producers felt it best to play it safe.\n\nThey also thought the cast was getting too old to be of interest to a younger crowd, and threw in Persis Khambatta to be the Pretty Girl and Stephen Collins to be the Handsome Guy-- though of course their roles in the story wouldn't have been practical for any of the regulars. The company just wasn't sure if the thing would take off. Needless to say, they needn't have worried. It still makes a good watch today, refreshingly lacking in today's heavy emphasis on amped-up fight and battle sequences."

Starting, naturally, with the first. The only one I had never seen. And I finally understand why. It's awful. Cinematography, storyline, acting, costumes: it's trash. Yes, it was the late 70s, but Star Wars had proved sci-fi films no longer need suck. Star Trek failed to read the memo.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture showed clear visual inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, which preceded it by a full decade but still outclassed it in every way.\n\nThe Wrath of Khan (II) is a far superior film, but the series does not achieve true cinematic quality until The Voyage Home (IV). The first three films, alas, reside at made-for-TV levels from a production standpoint.\n\nSide note: if our Star-Trek-1-envisioned future involves thin polyester jumpsuits that barely cloak the penises that reside below, please count me out."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review will not recant the plot, or mention anything about the concept of Star Trek, or it's characters. That has been done many times over by many others. Instead, I am going to review what it's like watching this film in the year 2012. Over 30 years after it's initial release. I'm doing so because my memory of originally watching was greatly altered with time, and yours may be too.\n\nAt the time of it's release I thought it was pretty good, if slow. I thought the new Enterprise looked fantastic, and the effects with the \"Cloud\" the team is investigating were beautiful and stunning. The story was average, devoid of much suspense or conflict. In this aspect it was blown away by Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. But it was an okay movie.\n\nWatching TMP again, in the year 2012, on a nice HD television, reveals many flaws. First, the effects are nothing special, at times the cloud is interesting, but much of the time only because the design of it is somewhat innovative. Instead the effects look somewhat soft, even bland. The scenes of it, and the Enterprise go on forever. I'm sure when they made the film, and I first saw it, this was hypnotic to watch, to see something so new and special. But it's shine has long ago worn off with time. Some of the effects shots are almost laughable. They look very old. I tried my best to keep in context when the film was made, but even with that in mind it was at times hard to watch. There are other flaws as well, such as the tactical display of the cloud looks nothing like what they show you in space. It creates confusion. There are also other scenes that seem like interludes to show you effects and they drag. All of these things made the film difficult to watch.\n\nHowever, if you are a ST fan, and can accept that and somehow get past it, how is the film? I still believe quite average. A lot of ST fans dislike this film and Star Trek V, but others think people missed the point. Having recently seen ST5 I now get that one, and think it's message is reflective of many episodes from the original series. It too is flawed, but I like it's idea, and it has a classic ST antagonist. But TMP doesn't have this. It's mostly just about re-discovering the characters, which was too subtle and took too long, and investigating the cloud. And in that regard I think even a lot of ST fans are going to find it difficult to sit through, and simply too long and uneventful."

Although if you think about it, it was the trekkiest star trek film ever made. It had all the elements of what star trek stands for, it was philosophical, it made a connection with history. It was a sentimental film in a sense too. The details of V'ger for instance was very good, the music was great as usual and the acting fitted the story fine.

        "review_detailed_main": "What is \"V-ger?\" V-ger wants to meet its creator. But, like the \"whales\" Star Trek movie later to come, this first film uses the same plot to threaten the Earth. In this movie, the Creator does not answer because no one still uses AM-Modulated Radio Waves 300 years in the future!\n\nFor an Original Star Trek movie all the characters from the TV series \"should\" have significant roles and dialog. Not the case here.\n\nThe story focuses on Stephen Collins as Capt. Willard Decker who has command of the Enterprise but gets temporarily demoted to Commander and Executive Officer after a desk bound Admiral Kirk must take command away and pursue a mysterious \"cloud\" that is threatening to destroy the Earth. Former Miss India, the late Persis Khambatta (she died in India at age 48 of a massive heart attack) plays Lt. Ilia, the former love interest of Capt. Decker when they were together on some past planet. She, robot like, informs Admiral Kirk upon coming aboard the Enterprise that \"My affidavit of celibacy is on file.\" That's all we ever find out about their past relationship. Of course, you know the writers will do something in the end to get Decker and Ilia together.\n\nCommander Decker is upset that the Enterprise has just spent 18 months being retrofitted and that Kirk, himself, recommended Decker for Command. The systems are not the same as when Admiral Kirk was its Captain. It's a whole new Enterprise. Of course, you know that Decker has to save Kirk from almost destroying the ship due to Kirk's lack of knowledge. This technique is repeated in Wrath of Khan when Kirtie Alley as Lt. Savvak has to quote regulations to a mental-lapsed Admiral Kirk.\n\nAdmiral Kirk causes Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy to be recalled, beard and all, out of retirement back to the ship. Why didn't he shave and change into uniform before reporting back on board? An angry McCoy is calmed by Kirk's exhortation that \"Bones, I need you!\" So, Bones falls into his stereotypical role of watching over the mental health of Admiral Kirk and taking potshots at Mr. Spock's lack of human understanding.\n\nA reluctant Mr. Spock was on Vulcan undergoing the \"Kolinhar\" ritual to purge the last of his emotions but, because he \"senses\" the presence of V-ger, he fails the test and departs to come to the Enterprise to make contact with that which disturbs him. Mr. Spock acts the coldest he has ever acted towards all the crew, to everyone's bewilderment.\n\nScottie keeps on giving Kirk, Warp Power, Aux (Auxiliary) Power in emergencies and getting Kirk out of jams when he needs action \"2\" minutes before they all die. Lt. Uhura, Lt. Cmdr. Sulu and Lt. Cmdr. Chekov's speaking roles were minimal in this movie. Any other crewmen could have been substituted. Their characters were less important in this film then the fine stories they shared in the TV series.\n\nGene Roddenberry's real wife, Majel Barrett, plays Dr. Christine Chapel. She was originally Nurse Chapel in the TV series working with Dr. McCoy. She must have gone to medical school during Dr. McCoy's retirement because he didn't know that she had become a doctor until he arrived on the bridge of the Enterprise once again. Majel is also the \"voice of the computer!\" \"Working!\"\n\nCaptain Decker and Admiral Kirk spend most of the movie challenging each other's authority. In the end, Capt. Decker and Lt. Illa are officially listed as \"missing\" in action when they merge to become a new life form.\n\nThe first 40 minutes or so of this movie runs very slow, mostly, development of the mysterious \"cloud\" as a threat. This movie must be 80% visual.\n\nThis movie has limited dialog development. Most of the speaking parts are utterances of two or three sentences. The picture becomes more interesting when the Enterprise reaches the \"cloud\" and the special effects of the time (1979) are integrated within the film. Lots of space ship model work and docking is shown. But, lets take out the \"noise of a space ship moving through dead space.\" Space is essentially a vacuum and sound is a mechanical wave that cannot travel through a vacuum. There is no Doppler Frequency Shifting as human hears cannot hear any audible \"whoosh\" noise of a space ship going past a camera reference point in space.\n\nWho and What is \"V-GER?\" Think NASA of the 20th Century!\n\nBecause of poor dialog and limited character utilization, this movie only gets a 7. For as much as fans love anything Star Trek, you would think that the writers, producers, and director would make every Star Trek movie a perfect \"10.\""

The effects have held up in much the same way that Star Wars' effects have; the miniatures are sleek, and the lighting creates a rather convincing outer space illusion from time to time. There are also \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" vibes on a regular basis.\n\nHowever, instead of being consistently stimulated, I found myself yearning for more character interactions. I wanted to see Kirk investigate unfamiliar territory with Spock, McCoy and a poor ensign chap. Bottom line, I wanted more action. All of the characters, even Kirk, play second banana to the sets and special effects, which I found to be rather boring.\n\nHowever, I feel like this was a good start for me to get into the Star Trek films, and I look forward to watching the rest of them.\n\n*** / *****"

You remember the idealized image, then find yourself awkwardly confused to find the latter-day reality not matching your lofty expectations.\n\nThat's the impossible task of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Paramount's hit-and-miss epic effort to leverage 70's Star Wars mania into a resurrection of the popular 60's era science fiction show about the Starship Enterprise and her crew.\n\nThe unrealistic expectations given ST:TMP almost derail the film before the first frame is photographed, yet Paramount's confused production direction and assumption that Trek's TV genetics will naturally migrate to the big screen make the effort a nearly impossible task. Yet, even given the obstacles and production hassles, ST:TMP still carves out its own brand of success. Jerry Goldsmith's legendary score stands out as one of the most memorable in film history, narrowly losing an Oscar for Best Original Score. Doug Trumbull stitched together a last-minute effects package after director Robert Wise realized late in production that most of the completed effects produced by Robert Abel's Apogee were unusable.\n\nThe film's lethargic style is somewhat improved in the much-acclaimed Director's Cut, wherein Robert Wise was allowed to give the film a final edit not afforded due to the film's shortened production schedule arising from its guaranteed release date back in December 1979. The cut's new visual effects work to transition previously awkward story arcs, but can't entirely solve the at times ponderously over-told story of an alien probe in pursuit of earth.\n\nClaustrophobic performances by William Shatner et al seem all too conscious of and intimidated by the movie's grand scale, with each character working too hard to create dramatic ennui with each line. The results, at times, seem like heavy-handed direction. ONly as the film nears its end do we begin to see the \"regular\" Trek personalities emerge - but by then, the movie's almost over. Wise's Director Cut cleans up many of these dialogue transitions and weaknesses, and does help the film's narrative momentum about as much as could reasonably be expected, without the benefit of pickup shots or voiceovers as might be part of a final edit.\n\nTMP's lethargic style, whether in original release or Director's Cut revision, is not helped by a somnambulent design for the Enterprise's refit interiors, which seem to wander between varying shades of grays and blues. Unfortunately, the same colors were chosen for many of the crew uniforms, which turn the bland into the downright boring. Its worth noting that crew uniforms were completely redesigned prior to the 1982 sequel, The Wrath of Khan.\n\nTMP aspires to tell a story of human introspection, but tries to force an epic ambiance into a story that cannot support it. The end, one in which the villain alien simply disappears in an array of light and Trek doublespeak, leaves the viewer wondering \"Is that all?\" Rather than trusting Trek's principals to execute the kind of story that made the notion of a Trek rebirth worthwhile, the effects-heavy realization that did, at times, achieve fleeting moments of \"wow,\" cannot be termed in the broader view as anything other than disappointing - not so much for its own failings, but for what might have been. Yet, despite critical shortcomings, TMP was successful enough to justify a string of sequels and, later, a suite of new TV series. That, alone, might be just enough to call it a success after all..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching the director's cut of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, first off, is probably the only way to go. I'm not sure if the original theatrical cut fared better, but I can't imagine it getting any better than this. Which is to say that I think the other cut would probably not be much of an improvement over what is essentially a good piece of pop science fiction, more operatic than the usual Trekkie fare but worth the price to check out once. Right away we're reunited with all of the old gang (\"Spock!\", as Kirk exclaims upon seeing him again, gave me a bit of a grin, knowing what would come of him in the sequels), and even given a new character (Stephen Collins) as part of the Enterprise crew. The story this time chronicles something even more abstract than would be expected for a ST flick: a mysterious entity, as in a kind of astronomical force that may be a little too technical for some fans just looking for a Klingon or two (though there are actually one or two at one point), heading for Earth.\n\nThe same drama and drive for solid, if cheesy, emotional catharsis is all there, and the only drawbacks come with maybe too much fanfare, with Robert Wise edging on going the route of 2001 when it isn't always necessary. The scope, however, is proportional for the subject matter, and when it comes down to it the main drama is not all just about deep philosophical questions edging their way into the central conceit (in this case it's the basic one: why are we here?). It's also in seeing a vessel like a sea captain on a big ship take charge, as with Kirk (Shatner, in good if typical form as usual), dealing with taking charge of the Enterprise for the first time in years. There's also another character, played by Khambatta, who is another kind of alien presence to the ship, and this helps add just that little extra tension needed among the crew. Although all of the revelations involving the big space cloud comes in a drawn-out manner- and it is more drawn-out than I would usually tolerate if not for it being the guilty pleasure that is Star Trek- it does lead to some truly amazing visuals, and some high-level emotions from the crew that make it worthwhile.\n\nNot quite the best introduction to the films for non-Trekkies (go for Khan or The Voyage Home for that), but it is in general a fairly well-spun elongated sci-fi serial, loaded with pomp and circumstance, and the best to be expected from the Enterprise crew."

Spock seems overly vulcan in this film till the end and i much prefer the logically funny Spock then the silent Spock. this film is well worth being watched by all trekkies though i advise non trekkies to give it a miss - you wont see the point."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is a special edition. No, not a longer edition. It needs to be taken back to the cutting room and made into the 50-minute Star Trek episode it pretends it isn't.\n\nThe last few times I've tried to watch it, I could never finish it. To say that it plods is an understatement. There are precious few scenes that wouldn't benefit from judicious pruning. I left during the Enterprise inspection flyby to get some food. When I got back minutes later, the scene STILL hadn't finished. The wormhole scene was supposed to take 22 seconds, according to the dialogue, but it lasted more than a minute. Worse yet are the scenes inside V'Ger. One can watch characters gaping at the passing scenery for only so long, especially when the scenery is not all that spectacular.\n\nThe dialogue is some of the most hackneyed in sci-fi movie history. Even such groaners as Galaxy of Terror or Nightflyers had better dialogue. On the day it premiered, most of the theater chuckled when Kirk said, \"I need you, Bones...badly!\" Every attempt to bring the jargon \"up to date\" rang hollow to the ear, abandoned by Star Trek II.\n\nActing and direction were two of the weakest points. Many of the actors seemed to be sleepwalking through their roles, as if being there was enough. With apologies to the late Persis Khambatta, she was a pretty lady, but couldn't deliver a single convincing line of dialogue. Robert Wise had the actors exchanging looks so often that it becomes almost a running joke.\n\nDespite what some think, the effects were widely derided even in its day. Matte lines around the Klingon battlecruisers were so thick, they were renamed \"matte fissures.\" Star Wars did it better two years before, and even Battlestar Galactica often looked better.\n\nFor the legions of fans who subsisted on reruns for ten years, it was both invigorating and disappointing. They had to wait three more years before they got the Star Trek movie they deserved."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek the Motion Picture was my first experience in disappointment. It came out when I was in the sixth grade. Just two years earlier, I had been wowed by Star Wars. Already a Trekker, I could not wait to see what Gene Roddenberry was going to do with his franchise. Never in my life was I so bored at the movies. Older, I stand by the statement I made as an eleven-year-old. It begins several months after the end of the first five-year mission. Scotty has just spent the last 18 months refitting the Enterprise for her new commander, Captain Will Decker. Unfortunately, something is approaching Earth, eating planets, asteroids, and Klingons in its path. It is up to the Enterprise to stop it. Rear Admiral Kirk uses the emergency to get command back, and re-activate Dr. McCoy. Spock has retired and is going through the final purging of his emotions known as the Kolinhar. Of course, Spock shows up. I will concede that the movie has a magnificent score, and keeps with the television show's spirit of exploration and contacting new life forms. It also unveils the new and improved Enterprise. However, it drags and drags too much. The Enterprise spends too much time going through special effects for the cloud, reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's overindulgence in 2001 A Space Oddessy. In other words: no action. No star battles, no hand-to-hand combats, or Kirk and Spock out-thinking a hostile alien or nemesis. And who came up with those pajama-like uniforms? There is too much introspection, too much philosophizing, and too much of the Enterprise stuck in the midst of weird special effects. The worst part is there is no chemistry between the characters prevalent in the television shows and the latter movies. They serve as props to the new Enterprise. Of course, this was a segue into Star Trek's glory movies, II, III, and IV. I guess just like the series, it got off to a rocky start."

Not every time of course, they're the ones footing the bill, but Paramount should have never wrested creative control away from Roddenberry. Never slight the creator. V,Ger needs the creator. Anyway, one time jump away in 2001, Robert Wise was finally allowed to edit the film the way he originally wanted, adding scenes and arranging the narrative of his first vision, thus giving the audience, and of the original Enterprise crew the triumphant return to the screen they deserved. All be it, some thirty odd years later. The first release wasn't a disaster by any stretch of the imagination (Jerry Goldsmith's score is amazing) but let's face it, it wasn't what audiences wanted then. That happened in the next Star Trek outing. This version is awesome however and thoroughly entertaining for Trekkers."

Thought-provoking SF (rare on film), not exciting but interesting, and conflicts solved in an intelligent manner by thinking characters. The slow approach to the Enterprise will probably bore general audiences to tears nowadays; I find it not a second too long. The SFX inside V'ger have a dreamlike quality not unlike those at the end of 2001, and the V'ger set itself has an otherworldly, yet simple, look that's sorely missing from many of today's SF which always tries to go for gritty/realistic."

        "review_detailed_main": "I knew I had to watch this today, because I'm writing about Robert Wise's movies soon, and this is one of the most high-profile ones he directed that I hadn't seen. It gave me a weirdly vivid dream last night where I was watching it already, and for some reason, I was under the impression - while in the dream - that John Williams did the music for this. So I woke up looking forward to hearing a John Williams score. However, when I started the movie, to my surprise, it was Jerry Goldsmith who actually did the score to this. I wasn't disappointed for more than a few seconds, because Goldsmith's score was pretty amazing.\n\nIt's honestly the best part of the movie, especially for someone like me who doesn't dislike Star Trek by any means, but isn't really that big of a fan (I've seen a handful of movies old and new now). The special effects were mostly good for their time, and there is a certain amount of charm to be had watching a science-fiction movie that's not 2001: A Space Odyssey or Solaris that doesn't really have an emphasis on action scenes.\n\nHowever, the one thing most people say about this movie is that it is kind of slow, and I felt that way too. I think for fans of the original show, this probably hits all the right notes and satisfies, but coming at this as someone who's not a huge fan, I just thought it was alright. It did the job, and I didn't hate watching it, but it also didn't exactly grip me for the entire runtime. Not bad, not great, but, as the title says, it is indeed a motion picture (such an old-fashioned term; it braces you for the old-school, slow-paced nature of the film)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even though this movie, is not considered one of the better Trek films, it is not that bad. There are many things that are right with the movie. You have of course the entire cast of the original Star Trek TV show from the 60's, ten years after the show was canceled. So it is a treat to see the original cast back on the big screen. A wonderful musical score, written by Jerry Goldsmith, then state of the art special effects, an award winning director Robert Wise, probably the most distinguished director to direct a Star Trek film. However, having all those good elements that would seem to make anything a classic, its a classic case of too many cooks, can spoil the broth. The state of the art effects, while truly spectacular, even by today's standards, seemed to over run the film. Sometimes it felt like they were just put in to see how cool it would all look. With all of the special effects overpowering the movie, it was less about the people on the Enterprise. Many of the actors never got to really do much, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty, Uhuara, even McCoy were all overshadowed and didn't have much to do. While the newer members of the crew, Commander Decker and Lt Ilia got a lot of the screen time. Another problem would be writing and directing. The story of The plot, while a probably a good TV episode,(in fact, the story was to have been a pilot episode for an aborted 70's Star Trek TV show which was dropped in favor of the movie) was dragged out for SO long that it made the movie really dull to watch. And while Robert Wise is a great director, he probably wasn't the best choice to be a Star Trek director.\n\nOverral, I wouldn't say it was a bad movie. In places, the movie was awesome and had some truly great Star Trek moments. Like when Kirk sees the beautiful re-fitted Enterprise. But unfortunately the problems that I just stated, really hurt the movie as a whole. But it would get better for the Star Trek movie franchise....."

The story though fitting perfectly within the mythos of the original series, some have criticized as being slow and with very little action. The pacing though a bit slow builds in its registered characters brilliantly. I happen to be a fan of this film and while I understand its detraction's, overall find it to be an enjoyable film. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is fantastic and bring the film to another level. The effects for its age were top notch but may be considered aged during this high effects laden film age. Some nay argue that Shatner once again over acts but i find it to be a joy to see not only the old crew back together again, and its principal players playing off the chemistry which made the original series such a pleasure and joy. Star Trek The Motion Picture is a a pure cinematic joy and a must see for any fan of the sci-fi genre as well as Trek enthusiasts."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I am a Star Trek fan, so I have no axe to grind with the show or characters. But I still think this was a bad movie. First off, the props and costumes were all wrong. It almost had the goofy retro future look that dates a sci fi movie really quickly that Roddenberry tried to avoid. His designer, Jeffreys, worked on a limited budget in the original series but had enough sense to keep the props and sets simple and smooth, okay, too many canvas rocks in caves. The designer here forgot that one. They had those goofy uniforms which looked like some doctors' summer hospital outfits, or those utterly ridiculous helmet and harness rigs they stuck the security men in, instead of the classic red shirts. Then there was that warp drive handle, which looked like a cheesy automatic transmission floor shifter, on Sulu's console, and in close up no less. Their instrument screens had the shape of a fifty's style television screen, how silly too. In the series the those \"screens\" looked more modern and up to date. The Buck Rogers chemically powered rocket belt Spock used was not only dated by standards of the 1970s, but in Star Trek technology they would have had some sort of advanced ionic drive. Maybe the flames looked cool or something.\n\nThen there was the directing which seemed to be made up of too many repetitive shots of the crew looking agape at the satellite, Veeger thing as they stared into the bridge viewer. Or way too many pans of the incomprehensible 2001 inspired Veeger whatever it was: nebula, solar system, spaceship? Though to give some credit to the original movie, the DVD version I saw probably was doctored up with modern computer effects.\n\nThe directing and screenplay flopped all over the place while the core of the story itself wasn't a bad rewrite of an episode, but it only needed to be 48 minutes long not two hours. I agree with some of the paid posters here that a good sci fi movie shouldn't degenerate into endless war and fight scenes, and may actually be better without them. Tell that to the producers of the last franchise, \"Enterprise\" who turned every episode into some war movie it seemed."

But it's one of the most popular franchises and the Trekkies are really out there and is still growing.\n\nSo with the new 2016 entry in the franchise it was time to watch them all. First off is the 1979 full length flick that already set some emotions amongst the viewers. Way too long and rather boring.\n\nOn the part of 'way too long' I can agree that the beginning was way too long. When Kirk is going to the Enterprise it takes to much time to see him looking to the ship again and again. To make a flick clocking in over two hours you really need a strong story and that isn't really the fact. Earth is under attack and that's almost it. Why we see those aliens in the beginning and only then is still an enigma for me.\n\nI can't say that it was boring, it's a typical Star Trek adventure. No real fighting going on between humans and aliens there's a lot of blah blah going on. The effects used were top notch back then but on Blu ray it's easy to spot that a lot of blue key was used. But to see San Fran in the future dis work out fine.\n\nSo sometimes really slow, as said the captain watching Enterprise and especially the Enterprise discovering the other space ship.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1979, the STAR TREK franchise boldly went where it had not yet gone before: the big screen. The cast of the popular canceled series is reunited: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Walter Koenig, George Takei, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, and even Majel Barrett and Grace Lee Whitney. The film begins a few years after the original Enterprise's mission ended. James Kirk is an admiral and has been acting as Chief of Starfleet Operations. The Enterprise has been refitted and is about to to embark with it's new captain, Willard Decker. When a mysterious gas cloud appears and begins swallowing everything in it's path, Kirk re assumes command of the modified Enterprise to investigate and intercept the object before it reaches it's final destination: Earth.\n\nThis film did it's best to be epic. The production brought on talented director Robert Wise (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, etc.) and visual effects guru Douglas Trumbull (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, etc.), but it wasn't enough to save it from mediocrity. I'll give the film credit, the special effects were great for their time and the director's edition has been improved nicely. You can tell they were proud of their $35 million budget. When we're first given our introduction to the new Enterprise, it occurs in a lengthy flyby sequence in which Scotty pilots a transporter pod far enough around the ship to give Kirk, and the audience, a nice long look. Later, when the Enterprise arrives at the cloud and begins making it's entrance into it's depths, it's a full five minutes of nothing but the filmmakers showing off their visual effects with the cloud interior. On the flip-side, all of these long visual effect sequences add up to a pretty hefty run-time of more than two hours. And it's feels longer.\n\nThe entire film is very slow paced as compared to the original series. Gone is the campy action-adventure vibe of the show, making way to a somber atmospheric attempt at serious science fiction. Though it did retain some of the show's original sci-fi camp (e.g. the Ilia abduction scene). I'm not saying the story is poor, just very drawn out and lacking in any real action sequences to jolt the pace every once in a while. One final complaint, though it is a minor one: I was not a fan of the new uniforms here and I was glad they changed them again in STAR TREK II.\n\nI don't want anyone to think this movie isn't worth a viewing. It's still an interesting treat for fans of STAR TREK searching for a more serious take on the series. And for those familiar with the later series and the species of the Borg, the climactic ending almost takes on a whole new meaning."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most science fiction films emphasize action over thought. Of the few that offer intellectual as well as visual or visceral stimulation, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is certainly among the best, especially now that legendary director Robert Wise has released a 'Director's Edition' which much more fully represents his original intentions (no review based on any previous version, none of which were approved by Wise, should be considered valid any longer).\n\nThe plot is almost excessively simple: a gigantic energy cloud of alien origin is headed toward Earth, and the starship Enterprise must find a way to communicate with it and to take whatever action is necessary. But the point of ST:TMP is not the plot as such; rather, it is an examination of the balance between rationality and emotion which is vital to maintain and succor a genuinely human life (make no mistake; ST:TMP is, at its deepest level, about humanity, not spaceships and alien clouds). We see here a classic tension-- between the coldly rational mind of Spock (and, beyond that, of the entity inside the cloud) and the brash emotionalism of Captain Kirk and, particularly, Dr. McCoy. Underlining this is the one-time love affair between Commander Decker and Navigator Ilia, an affair cut off through fear of what each might have become, of the deep personal changes necessary in true mutual love. The elements come together in the magnificent finale, in which each of the main characters confronts their own greatest need and discovers that their quests can succeed only through the transcendence of the very desires which provoked the quests in the first place.\n\nHowever thoughtful, the film does not lack for superb production details. Wise has edited the film much more tautly than before, so that each sequence stands in elegant balance with every other. The trip through the cloud and over what lies at its center is among the most beautiful such things in science fiction (easily surpassing the similar moments in 2001: A Space Odyssey). The first views of the Enterprise, shot largely from Kirk's perspective, are filmed almost as one might gaze at a long-absent lover finally seen again, slowly and sensuously and with great care not to miss anything. The set designs are superb, and the overall cinematography polished to a high degree. And of course Jerry Goldsmith's score, nominated for an Academy Award, remains among the finest of film scores; time and again it undergirds and enhances the action or the visuals absolutely stunningly.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture, like 2001 and Tarkovsky's Solaris, is not a fast-paced film, and those seeking action-packed adventure would do best to look elsewhere. But understood as what it truly is-- a moving and powerful meditation on a fundamental dichotomy of human consciousness-- it stands as a major achievement and an almost overwhelming cinematic experience."

Yet despite the impressive visuals and terrific score by Jerry Goldsmith, the film missed out the camaraderie, humour and banter that held the TV series together. The cast sit there starry eyed looking bored whilst the optical effects try to emulate 2001 A Space Odyssey.\n\nFortyunately the idea for a a Star Trek series of films didn't die after this. Paramount gave it one more try and the result was the brilliant 'Wrath of Khan' which came out three years later on a much reduced budget but was made by a different director who understood the dynamic of the TV show a lot better than Robert Wise did."

With some critics viewing this movie as being quite long and slow, others welcome it with open arms! Written by well known Science Fiction/ fantasy novelist Alan Dean Foster, consulted by known Science Fiction novelist Issac Ashimov, the overall movie experience first introduces the cast and the new and improved USS Enterprise, flying through an a ray of space formations, inspired by \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" because of the space travel through the galaxy- it's visually fascinating! The other picture focuses on a possible theory, which would've worked well as a 45 minute spoof when it was a TV series, about losing one of Earth's many satellites to a black hole, collecting important data, without anyone to relieve any of the information to, before creating a powerful enigma on it's own, to which they discover that Veger is actually Voyager, a powerful satellite that became powerful enough to destroy galaxies and planets since it relies on logic than it does emotions."

These assumptions could have made this movie into an icon but that never happened. The director's exaggerated ambition has created a nearly three-hour film that does little or nothing good. The rhythm of the film is almost a torture session: it creeps into unnecessary scenes without any reason. It even seems that the editing team just did not want to get bored doing their job decently. The film has no screenplay for such length. In fact, it has no script, it has an idea for a script that did not find any happy development. The main actors (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley) were perfectly up to the challenge, but the rest of the cast left unwanted, lifeless interpretations to match the scenery and costumes that look like pajamas or nurse's robes. In fact, everything on that ship looks like a hospital corridor. If all this had been different, we would probably be facing a classic as dear as the original series. Unfortunately this did not happen."

Although the Klingon commanders do everything in their power to destroy the object, it is they who end up being destroyed. The scene then essentially shifts to \"Admiral James T. Kirk\" (William Shatner) being given permission to take over command of the starship Enterprise--which is currently in space dock near Earth--in order to intercept this large alien object and try to prevent it from doing any further damage to Federation property. The problem is that it doesn't seem to respond to any kind of communication and it seems intent on destroying everything in its path. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I remember how disappointed everyone was when the original television series was taken off the air by the arrogant executives at NBC who thought they knew more than their audiences. So, when the announcement was made that a Star Trek film was being produced--10 years later--people lined up to see it. No doubt creating great embarrassment to those NBC executives. Be that as it may, while audiences were certainly gratified to have Star Trek back, the actual movie wasn't nearly as good as it could have been due mainly to the fact that the film ran a bit too long--with several scenes needlessly showcasing music and CGI at the expense of the actual plot. Even so, although I don't consider this movie to be nearly as good as some of the others in the series, it was still a decent film for the most part, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

Captain Kirk is still my favourite character just like I said in my review of 60's Star Trek & that I would prefer him over Picard! The costumes were outstanding and the production designs & special effects were amazing! The music was epic and even though this was their first Star Trek movie in theatres it was fun to watch from beginning to end! Overall it's not as good as the Original Series it's still better than Jar Jar Abraham's Star Trek and I'm looking forward to watching & reviewing Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan that's why I'm giving this a 6/10! Hopefully, you'll enjoy it as much as I did! ;-)"

You might say that you would need to watch the TV series before watching any movies based on it but the reason I watched TOS was because I was amazed by The Motion Picture.\n\nNone of the movies based on TOS are very good, other than this first one. The Wrath of Khan is about as overrated as TMP is underrated. The Wrath of Khan doesn't have much more action than The Motion Picture, despite what fans might tell you. And Khan and Kirk don't meet in person. How disappointing is that? The rest of the first six movies are only okay. J.J. Abrams's reboot was insanely stupid. It was so stupid that I haven't even watched Into Darkness.\n\nAnyway, TMP is highly underrated. I really liked the themes, the special effects, and the music. Some people have said that it tries too hard to be 2001: A Space Odyssey but I liked TMP more because 2001 has no interesting characters. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a science- fiction movie that is almost as good as Blade Runner, in my opinion (which means that it's very good)."

I can still see 'Chromatic aberration' on the Enterprise in effects shots like leaving the dry dock. Also with the digital back drops of Earth and VeJa in the back ground which is very contrastie which is very annoying and noticeable. There are scenes where entire shots are digital animated. If only they could combine the shots to clean it up!\n\nFor the 4K UHD version they've done great work on cleaning up the sound and music mix, with replacement audio effects."

I enjoyed the storyline, character development, music, and even dialogue. Sure, Shatner sounds stilted. But that's just James T. Kirk. We don't want or expect Shakespeare out of Shatner.\n\nThe late Persis Khambatta is beautiful and Decker is believable as the combative Captain torn from his command. In addition, Nimoy delivers a powerful portrayal as the Vulcan, Spock, recently washed out from the Kholinar.\n\nThe rest of the T.V. cast deliver adequate performances. Sulu's strange facial expressions during the approach to \"VGER\" are a little annoying. However, the blame should properly be laid at the feet of the editors.\n\nDespite some minor and a couple of major flaws, this film is still strong. Don't expect \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" but \"Barbarella,\" this film isn't."

It suffers mostly in comparison to Star Wars that came 2 years earlier. The story misses the sure hand of a well written script. Considering the winding road the production took, it came together better than can be expected."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture is one of my favorite examples of a movie that starts out promisingly but builds up to nothing. The premise, if nothing else, has sometimes been praised even by people who don't like Star Trek. The real trouble is, it doesn't do enough with said premise, building up to nothing. Anyhow, the good:\n\n-The opening scene gets the movie off to a misleadingly fast start. It's ominous, and it's a trip. Plus, we get the first glimpse of the redesigned Klingons.\n\n-The first glimpse of the Enterprise. Many people think it's such a lousy scene because it goes on a bit more than it ought to, but the first minute or so of it was the first time we ever saw the refitted Enterprise, and on the big screen.\n\n-The transporter accident. Some of us can't help thinking it might have been prevented, but it was disturbing, sound and all. It may have even been there to try to keep the film going, but that's actually a good thing.\n\n-The wormhole. Another Enterprise glitch that briefly jump started the movie. After that is when it gets the most boring, as the movie lumbers to a stop.\n\n-When (SPOILER) Chekov agrees wholeheartedly not to interfere with V'Ger hacking the ship's computer. A friend of mine once said that one moment was the only good part in the whole movie. Shortly before that was when I officially got bored.\n\n-The \"Spock Walk.\" Most of what this movie's supposed to be about is here, though many viewers were asleep by then. Easily one of the most fascinating scenes in the film. Not sure how many people wrapped their heads around it, instead of just expecting a space battle or something.\n\nStar Trek TMP isn't as boring as almost everyone thinks, but it is boring. The V'Ger flyover could have been edited at least a little, and Robert Wise still could have gotten the point across. Ditto for the scene with the Enterprise in drydock. It's great that the movie isn't just another shoot-em-up space cowboy movie, but it didn't have to be just the opposite. At least (or maybe at most) space operas are fun (witness the Trek reboots), though stereotypical.\n\nThe climax didn't make sense to everyone, but I understand what happened. It just wasn't powerful enough to justify sitting through the whole movie.\n\nSo all in all, I liked Star Trek: The Motion Picture in some ways, but it's hard to believe that it took so much preparation and rejected, in some cases better, scripts to end up with what we finally got. Just lucky The Wrath of Khan got things on track."

This may be a long movie, but so are many others so that's not a reason to hate it. Yes it does have lots of dramatic staring scenes. This is a device to create suspense, for those who don't understand. I get that some people who have microscopic attention spans have issues with this. These are sometimes the same people who have to \"go to the toilet\" because they are addicted to social media, poor souls.\n\nNot sure what the \"Emotion picture\" quips are about. You prefer movies without emotion?\n\nYou need to remember this was essentially the film that kicked off the Trekkies fandom. ST-TNG started 1987 so this was the first Star Trek production after the ST-TOS which ended in 1969.\n\nIt was fantastic in 1979 and it still is, sorry millenials."

        "review_detailed_main": "It took a good ten years to adapt Star Trek, one of the best and most famous sci-fi TV shows of all time, for the big screen. When they finally did, Star Trek: The Motion Picture premiered to showcase a big, bold, extravagant spectacle, and a story that promised to be the end-all be-all Trek adventure.\n\nThe problem is, watching this film has always been a weird experience. Despite the gorgeous model work and special effects, there really isn't much action to this, and the pacing overall is rather slow. Even at its smartest, the Star Trek series and all its future incarnations always had an adventurous spirit embedded with its stories; this movie strips away the adventure in favor of a strict and somewhat cold piece of hard sci-fi. There's little warmth, and certainly no real bang, to this picture.\n\nThat being said, it still has its merits. The interstellar odyssey through the V'Ger cloud could be seen as something wondrous and awe-inspiring. The biggest draw to this film will be its story, which showcases a very clever high-concept premise with strong overarching philosophical themes of existence, purpose, and the human spirit.\n\nThe plot holding these concepts up is a pretty standard affair, but is stretched rather thinly due to a number of lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut from the film. A lot of screen time is devoted to endless beauty shots of the Enterprise, there's a weird and silly scene where everybody's trapped in a wormhole for some odd reason, and there's a seemingly-pointless scene involving a transporter accident. What really throws me off, however, are the characters. The original cast is all here - Captain Kirk, Commander Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, Scotty - but Spock is the only one of the lot who actually feels like a main character. In this movie, it's Decker and Ilia who take the center stage, and they go through a romantic spiel that borders on being sappy.\n\nPhotography and editing are generally good in this film. Acting is disappointingly dry from the classic Trek crew, possibly because they're not given much to do as they are in the sequels. Leonard Nimoy is easily the biggest standout here; William Shatner does the best he can to make Captain Kirk cool again, and DeForest Kelley throws out some occasionally crass and witty lines. As the true main character, Stephen Collins comes off as rather dull. Persis Khambatta might be the best and most interesting performance here. Writing is not bad, especially regarding the high-brow aspects of the film, but it lacks a certain personality overall. This production has some rather gaudy costumes, but most sets, props, and special effects are great. Music is great too.\n\nIn the same fashion as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I have to really be in the right mood to watch this film. Both 2001 and Star Trek: The Motion Picture are space operas with very big special effects and very big ideas, but aren't that big on character building. As a Trek film, this first feature can be a rather dry and bewildering experience, especially if you're looking to see the original Enterprise crew in action. As a piece of intelligent sci-fi, with a pair of entirely strange new characters in the lead, it can be an interesting and rewarding experience. Especially for the Director's Cut of this film, which is a little more evenly-paced, and features some smashing new special effects.\n\nIt's worth a look for interested sci-fi fans and most Star Trek fans.\n\n3.5/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)"

        "review_detailed_main": "40+ years down the track, ST:TMP still stands as a solid first step into feature films for the beloved TV franchise, and it's a decent enough film, though it remains something of a curate's egg, and given the stature of all involved, from Robert Wise down, it really should have been much, much better.\n\nThe core problem was, and remains, the plot. For a movie that had so much riding on it, it's even more noticeable now that Paramount and Roddenberry were evidently determined to play it very safe and not mess with the formula, so the decision was made to stay on familiar ground and \"upcycle\" a plot from The Original Series. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as Nicholas Meyer proved brilliantly with ST:TWOK, but Meyer made an action-packed adventure *sequel* that completely revitalised the canon, where TMP remains a slightly bland, if glossy remake whose prime directive was to reassure fans that the franchise was in safe hands.\n\nAnother problem is the tone, which is just too mushy and reverential - c.f. the almost sexually voyeuristic space dock sequence in which the refurbished Enterprise is revealed - and now that the contemporary fan excitement about getting the the old gang back together has long faded, it all seems curiously and lacking in any real sense of spark or danger or consequence. Sure, V'ger is threatening to deep-six all life in the galaxy, but there's never any real doubt that Jim and his crew will save the day.\n\nPace is a problem. It is too long by about half an hour, it really DRAGS in spots, and in the immortal words of Mister Plinkett, there's just TOO MUCH TALKING.\n\nThe aesthetic also doesn't stand up well. The remodeled Enterprise interiors are so beige they look like Woody Allen was art director, the uniforms are bland, stodgy and unflattering, and the muted colour scheme makes the crew resemble the staff of a run-down regional hospital rather than the elite crew of the flagship of the Federation. Whoever decided that fawn was the right colour for Uhura should be horsewhipped.\n\nCheesy plot holes abound - why is the Enterprise the only starship within range that can intercept V'ger? (too bad for Earth, apparently, if the Klingons or the Romulans had decided to mount a surprise attack that day). Why, after having three battlecruisers vaporised in minutes, did the Klingons not send a massed force to attempt to stop an intruder that was obviously traversing Klingon space and annihilating everything in its path? Why does V'ger just conveniently vanish? Why aren't the Klingons suspicious that V'ger was a Federation weapon, or that it was somehow in league with the Federation, or (given that the Enterprise penetrated to the very heart of the alien ship) that the Federation might have privileged knowledge of the V'ger technology?\n\nThere's also a lot of redundant biznis. The transporter accident that kills Commander Sonak. Totally unnecessary, particularly since its already been telegraphed to us in block letters that Spock is on his way. The entire scene with the wormhole is a TOTAL waste of time and resources, and should have been cut at the first draft. It's a clumsy, over-long, painfully corny episode that serves only to elaborate on the (ultimately plot-pointless) Kirk v. Dekkard tension. The effects in this sequence are dull and dated, and it's just plain embarrassing to watch veteran actors still having to throw themselves around an obviously static set (STILL no seat belts??) and pretend to talk in slow motion. Just awful. The entire scene goes nowhere, does nothing to advance the plot, doesn't create any real tension or help develop any meaningful relationships. If a spanner in the works was needed, it would have been far better to have had the Enterprise dropping out of warp confronted with, say, a fleet of Klingon ships sent to chase V'ger and having to figure a way around them without starting a war.\n\nThe visual effects for V'ger are still pretty impressive, although many other FX shots show their age and should have been corrected digitally. Blue screen outlines are glaringly evident in many shots (e.g. as the Klingon ships are approaching V 'ger), the matte and optical work is not always great, and the VFX work for Vulcan in Spock's opening scene is just plain terrible.\n\nOn balance, it's a still worthwhile experience, though it inevitably suffers from the weight of expectation that saw it take the safest possible route instead of taking the big chances that Meyer was able to do in the sequel to such great effect. That being said, I'd still rather watch this every day til I die than ever see The Phantom Menace again, so don't take this as anything more than nitpicking. It's not the greatest Trek Movie, but it let Nick Meyer make that, so we should be grateful, and at its best, it's a finely crafted work that tries to grapple with some serious ideas, and presents scenes that still have the power to dazzle. And of course, there's the oh so fine Jerry Goldsmith score ..."

Show it to someone and see if they can tell if it is paused or playing. My guess is they will get it wrong most times. Watching this was like watching a PowerPoint slide show of stills taken during the filming of some other actual movie. Calling it \"Star Trek The Motion Picture\" is a lie. There is no motion in this movie, just endless still shots of people staring.\n\nThe music was ridiculously loud. I felt more like I just spent the evening at an orchestral concert than watching a movie.\n\nI thought that perhaps my review is unfair. I admit that if I was watching this and reviewing it in 1979 when it was made, I would judge it less harshly. And granted, it was probably, as some suggested, the first movie based on a TV series. But still, Star Wars IV came out 2 years before. Odds are that the popularity of the Star Wars movie helped this movie come into existence. So they could have taken some notes from Star Wars and had something happen on screen, at least once in a while.\n\nSo anyway, I am not going to review this from a 1979 perspective, because no one can read my review that way. I saw the movie for the first time in 2020, and anyone who reads this will do so in 2020 or later, with all the history of movies that we now have. And from that point of view, this movie was terrible in every way.\n\nI must admit, I hate everything TOS and would never watch the series, so there was little chance of me liking this movie. Also, it is almost guaranteed that I won't like any movie made before 1980, but this movie just proves that point. I am a fan of TNG, and I like DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and Picard. I only watched this because I am going to watch all the Trek movies in order during the quarantine. At least I can guarantee that they will get better from here, because it is not possible to get worse. I am only writing this review to vent my frustration at sitting through this disaster.\n\nI will admit, the story was creative and could have been interesting, but by the time it came around, I really didn't care anymore. I just wanted it to be over. But the story could have been the plot of a half hour episode of Twilight Zone. There wasn't enough to drag it out into a full movie. But the ending didn't make sense. How is absorbing Decker communicating all the gathered knowledge back to humans? Don't bother answering, I don't care anymore.\n\nI just read up on this movie, and saw that the director was falling asleep during filming. Didn't anyone see that as a sign of how boring this was? They did rush this out in response to Star Wars, and didn't care if it had a plot or not. I also read that they didn't have an ending to the story during filming. That is pretty obvious."

It's just not a combination of sci-fi story aspects that works out too well and also constantly provides the movie with a lot of slower moments, which lets this movie sort of feel like a very stretched out \"Star Trek\" television episode.\n\nAnd the story is also being pretty standard and simple. Basically they spend the first hour of the movie trying to figure out what's the dangerous object that is on a course to Earth and they spend the second half of the movie trying to figure out what it wants and not necessarily how it can be stopped, though the one thing still leads to the other of course. And this story there are some pretty good and interesting ideas, which does give the movie some more depth but overall they didn't do quite a good enough job with it and left some missed opportunities here and there.\n\nAlso please don't watch this movie expecting to see a lot of sci-fi action or spectacle. There is absolutely none of that present in this movie! No, not even a simple space fight or some hand to hand combat. Not that this is being necessarily a bad thing but it would had spiced things up a little more at times, which was something this movie truly could had used.\n\nThe special effects are pretty good. It's no \"Star Wars\" material but it's definitely acceptable looking, for 1979 standards. And some of the visuals are definitely impressive and great looking actually and help to give the movie a certain look and atmosphere, which makes it definitely a notch above the average sci-fi entry of its time.\n\n\"Star Trek\" always had plenty of characters in it but yet this movie still feels the need to introduce new once as well. Not really anything necessary and it prevents some of the Enterprise crew members from shining in this movie. Doubt the fans would have complained too much about it though, since they were probably just more than happy to see their favorites characters return to the screen, 10 years after the first series had already ended.\n\nI still did wished that the movie would had given some of the other characters some more room to shine. The movie gives you the feeling it could had done a lot more with the Spock and Dr. McCoy character for instance. But it's really mostly being the Captain Kirk show instead and my oh my, does William Shatner's acting stink! It's completely over-the-top but it does has its charm, I'll admit to that.\n\nAll in all, far from a great movie but still one that deserves to get the benefit of the doubt, since it has some good moments and there is also still plenty for the fans of the franchise to see and enjoy in this movie and it has a beautiful Jerry Goldsmith musical score as well of course!\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

It is good to see all the original cast members once again but surely a better film could have been made for them? The special effects may look good - which they do - but a film needs more than that (shades of how films tend to be these days)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first in a long line of \"Star Trek\" movies recycles a premise from the original series as the Enterprise has to deal with an immensely powerful entity heading to Earth on a cryptic quest for the 'creator'. To avoid comparisons with \"Star Wars\" (1977) film deliberately ensued 'action', unfortunately leading to the mocking pseudo-title \"Star Trek: The Motionless Picture\". The iconic cast is fine, given the constraint that they daren't deviate from their 'original series' characters, and honorary 'red shirts' Decker (Stephen Collins) and exotic Deltan Ilia (Persis Khambatta) are OK (Khambatta's scope is greatly diminished when she becomes a monotone voice-box for V'Ger). The revamped USS Enterprise looks nice (although Mr. Scott's roundabout tour of the ship in 'dry-dock' goes on a bit long) and the scenes of the beloved starship drifting through V'Ger's technicolour immenseness are spectacular. Some of the interior details don't really work, especially the bland and implausible uniforms (Kirk gets to wear an official Star Fleet T-shirt, perhaps to reward William Shatner for the crash diet he put himself on to diminish the captain's middle-age paunch). The ship's security team's uniforms are particularly ridiculous (a neo-classical helmet and some kind of leather vest designed to protect the crotch). Not enough happens to make the 'V'Ger story' particularly compelling, the human conflict between aging Kirk and youthful Decker doesn't really go anywhere, and the sketchy back-story of Decker and Ilia's passionate past-relationship doesn't do much beyond setting up the predictable and mushy climax. Despite A-list director Robert Wise, the film lacks any real drive and ends up simply being an overly serious, lengthy, vaguely pretentious, and simplistically delivered episode of the original T.V. show, albeit livened up by some great visuals courtesy of Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra, and their crew. Followed by far more entertaining \"The Wrath of Khan\" (1982), which jump-started the franchise and extended the original NCC-1701 crew's mission by another decade before they were finally put out to pasture in 1994's \"Star Trek: Generations\". As a standalone story, the film doesn't have much to offer, but as an visually interesting entry into one of the best known franchises in the genre, ST:TMP is watchable by most people (and undoubtedly repeatedly by fans)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always loved Star Trek. I was 13 in 1979 when the first motion picture based on the popular TV series came out. I waited so long to see it and ultimately was disappointed. I remember being dismayed that the producers/director passed up on exploiting a great idea in favor of what seems to be two hours of blue cloud visual effects. And not very good blue cloud visual effects--the whole film looked like an amorphous blue blob. For years I called it \"Star Trek--The Motion Boredom.\" Then the new Director's Cut came out on DVD...and WOW!! What a difference! From the documentary included with the release, it seems Robert Wise was very rushed to get the film out on time and had to release the film in it's original below standard shape. THIS DVD release is the movie he says he wanted to make. Everything looks less stilted, the special effects actually add to the awe and provide context for the events on screen. Gone are the endless blue sparkling clouds. Now we SEE the VGer vessel and its activities with clarity.\n\nBut the greatest improvement is in the sound department. Gone are the annoying faux-computer klaxon's announcing everything from a red alert to the flushing of the officer's head. Everything, audio & visual, enhances the viewing experience, ceases to distract and really makes for a much better film.\n\nIf you've only seen the old one, give this one another try."

The Characters are really exaggerated : Kirk is selfish,authoritarian and almost nervous like a mix of his worst sides, Spock is OVER cold and scientific minded without any consideration for Kirk for example, McCoy is like an old Grand pa without any constructing critics...Even the uniforms look like pajamas, more than in the TV show!!! (an exploit!) The scene where the crew sees the Enterprise is really beautiful but...very long and hyperbolic too! despite these critics, the optical based special effects are really good, a big tribute to Kubrick's 2001 odyssey, not a copy of Star Wars, that could happened according to the success of this film and finally,the story brings the audience in a world really imaginative that the trademark of Star Trek!

It had a great feel to it, was shot really well, was a well written story, the ending of it was absolutely fantastic. It was a compelling story with a mystery aspect to it. Great sci fi and effect, great storytelling. Good performances, at least as good as the TV show. I guess because it was different from the usual Star Trek series people were a bit disappointed by it but I thought it was great. The best Star Trek movie in my opinion is still the second one, Wrath of Khan, but the original Star Trek movie is probably second best in my opinion, with the later movies really suffering in quality, and I have no real love for the next generation series or movies at all. The new movies I haven't seen yet but I have high hopes!"

I was never much of a trekkie when the TV show came on, but I was a little curious about this movie.\n\nIt seems that Captain Kirk is now Admiral Kirk and they're having to try to communicate with something that is draining power and destroying spaceships. (At least it kicked some Klingon butt before the Enterprise decided to get on the case.) It is something called Vejur, and, as the movie progresses, the slowness of the plot is worth the wait once you find out what Vejur is.\n\nNormally, this doesn't bother me too much, but maybe it's because they tried to stretch what used to be a one hour TV show into a two hour movie. There just seemed to be a little bit too much padding. No need to develop most of the characters, we already know who they are. And there is no need to spend a whole lot of time developing Captain Dekker and Ilia. True, they need to be developed, but it seems they spend way too much time with this. Dekker is just annoying with his bitching and whining every time Kirk gives him an order. Kirk is his superior officer, dammit, he should obey his orders.\n\nEven with all this, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE isn't bad. It's a lot better than STAR TREK V anyway (and I can't remember what that one was called). 7 out of 10."

However I did enjoy Dr McCoy's scenes & I sympathised with the unfortunate Decker who has his ship usurped by the less than admirable Kirk. I detested him on sight. Look out for the alien who was just as appalled as I was. I'm a fan of the tough security teams on Babylon 5 so was disappointed by the ineffectual Starfleet variety. All they do is stand or ask dumb questions. To add insult to injury they're forced to wear dreadful helmeted uniforms. The \"staring\" scenes (worst offenders - Enterprise & V'Ger) are frankly boring. It's the people I want to see, not the technology. The soundtrack is beautiful but the overture with the star scape soon gets tiresome. So the 2nd time I viewed the film I used the FFW. Not a bad film but they should have concentrated more on characters. Final rating 6/10."

It's so disappointing that the first thing the original series did after years of reruns was a terrible movie. However, the Wrath of Khan was excellent, so that at least somewhat makes up for the poor quality of this movie.\n\nIn summary, could have been better and the criticisms are valid but there are a lot of things to admire that makes the film much better than its reputation."

I disagree...Star Trek: TMP is STILL the best of the nine movies to date. I find it amusing that fans always go on about how Trek never captures Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future...but here, when they actually GOT it for once, all they could do was pour scorn. TMP is an *epic*...full of imposing images, with suitably majestic music. The sequence where the Enterprise penetrates V'GER's cloud barrier is a visual tour de force akin to 2001 - the movie that TMP owes the most to on all counts. The whole film emanates an air of unearthly weirdness that I dig enormously. Almost every shot is packed with visual information that demands repeat screenings. Granted, the film's pacing is bad, but that's because Robert Wise wasn't given long enough to cut it properly! Vital character scenes that should have remained were deleted...the extended cut brought out on video shows just how good the movie could've been had they just spent a bit more time on it. Now that the heavily reworked DVD edition is out, people can see the movie as it should have been from the beginning. BRILLIANT movie...damn the critics. For the next two films, it was forced humour and mawkish melodrama...you can keep that, I'll have cold alien beauty any day.\n\nBelated update...the DVD Directors Edition is the only way to see this movie. Truly brilliant...TMP as the late Bob Wise wanted it to be. If you can't get that, the TV version is better than the theatrical cut, even if the sound is appalling and some of the matte effects aren't there!"

The thing I can't understand is that this film got an Oscar nomination for visual effects and the sequels didn't. All the other \"Star Trek\" movies (with the exception of Part 5) I thought were more deserving of a Oscar nomination for visual effects that this film. That doesn't make sense. Also, the movie is too long, and I was bored at times. However, their are some good things about it. First off is the very effective music score by Jerry Goldsmith.

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture is, in my opinion, the best of all the Star Trek movies. It's direction is superb and its creativity is on par with the best of science fiction movies. Many people who have seen it found it boring because it spends a lot of time on each scene. Similar to Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" it has a lot of slow camera shots of space, the various ships, etc... combined with awesome musical scores. I found that this \"slowness\" helps bring you into the whole futuristic world and subsequently assists you in believing the rather far fetched story. Apart from the obvious things about the movie, it turns out that it has a very interesting and subtle underlying story (or at least message) that only comes out in symbolism (missed by most everyone including me) and perhaps with some of the logic vs. emotion, evolution of living things and love. I was introduced to this at a barb-e-que one Memorial Day. A philosophy professor (specifically Eastern philosophy) pointed out that the whole platform on which V'Ger sits is in the shape of (I forget now exactly what he said) some Hindu temple (or something) and that V'Ger sounds out a Hindi (or possibly another Eastern language)word for love. This would go along with the story of the machine becoming sentient and, in the phase of being a child, now searching for the meaning of it all and requiring love. I don't know how much of this pans out, but check with someone who is well versed on Eastern philosophy and ask them about this movie and how it relates. The person who turned me on to this had much more to say about it and myself and those present only understood about 20% of what he said (many PhD candidates in the related field of mathematics). One of the main characters, Lt. Ilia, was portrayed by an Indian actress who spoke Hindi, so it is possible. Regardless, the movie not only has a compelling, if hard to swallow, story coupled with beautiful photography and direction, but it also gives the audience a lot to think about."

One major downfall of that movie was the \"new series\" that was supposed to launch a new station on tv as well. \"We all create god in our own image.\" Those were Deckers words, which is the linking to the abandoned tv pilot. The T.V pilot was the only thing that really damaged that movie. I mean it still made 100 million................"

        "review_detailed_main": "I love Star Trek. Now, I'm a bigger fan of The Next Generation than I am of The Original Series. But you can't give birth to greatness without a parent to release you from their womb. But this film, oh I have no love for this film. Two reasons, reasons many others have picked up on but bear repeating.\n\n1. This film is long and boring. Many times there was no action or dialogue, just people staring at a screen with some poor graphics that would have fit better in a class on fractals with some hippie music playing. The pacing is poorly done. The entire first half of the film is worthless, since the plot is all in the second half. I'm willing to bet you could even edit this down into a 45-minute episode and avoid putting it in the theater altogether.\n\n2. It's a bad science fiction film, but an even worse Star Trek film. If this was some other crew, I'd say it's just some movie about people in space looking to stop a machine from reaching Earth. That's a pretty basic plot. A poorly done one in this case, but easy enough to do.\n\nIt's a worse Star Trek movie because the characters served no purpose. Most of the other movies have some development of the characters, we see them age and learn more about them. Not here. We didn't need Spock, Kirk or Scotty. Yeah, there's some vague reference to a ritual Spock went through, but it's not really important to the plot and is never really explored. I care about the characters but left with nothing gained here. We learned Spcok is smart and Kirk loves the Enterprise. What shockers!! If you're a Trekkie, you've already seen this film. If you're not, don't let this be your introduction to the series or you maybe never give it a second chance."

Anyway, this movie I saw well after its special effects were \"new\" and \"flashy\", but I really am pleased with how the movie is done given the time. Ok, its nowhere near the best, and is in fact in 8th place if i had to rank the 9 ST films, Insurrection being 9. This movie was, and plays like a elongated TV episode, not a movie. Hey, the plot is great and finding weakness given the time it was done is hard to do. Very imaginative and creative, especially the V'ger thing. I recommend getting the Director's Cut, which i have, and makes it infiantely more enjoyable. I sat down and burned a whole day watching it, and the bonus DVD, which is simply amazing. Trekkers, youd best get your ass in gear if you havent seen this classic yet. if theres one thing Sci-Fi fans are good at, its no passing judgement on films with outdated effects."

Bob Wise's direction is classic of his style and the story line is reminiscent of the old series. Star Trek for years held the attention of sci-fi fans who preferred the hard core quasi-realistic \"what if\" over the decidedly non-scientific space opera style of Star Wars. Star Trek veered from this reputation in several of the subsequent sequels in pursuit of blockbuster status.\n\nThe sets in this movie are fantastic and pioneer a sense of realism now very popular in cinema. The ending left me a little unsatisfied but all-in-all a pleasant way to spend an evening if your a trekkie."

        "review_detailed_main": "1979 was a tough year to be a sci-fi film. The recent memory of films like 'Star Wars,' '2001,' and competition from the genre re-defining 'Alien' the same year were all going to raise certain expectations of what 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' could or should have been. Consider also that there was great emotional baggage where this project was concerned. Fans of the original series had created a huge set of expectations that were going to make this project both eagerly anticipated and highly scrutinized.\n\n'ST:TMP' is largely successful. It has two great and highly memorable set pieces. The first is early in the film and involves an incident with the transporter. The second comes near the end of the film when the true identity of V'Ger is learned. These alone would make the film worth watching but the camaraderie of the crew, the philosophical depth of the screen play and the excellent and steady hand of Robert Wise make this film a welcome addition to the Star trek canon.\n\nThematically the film looks at something very basic and innate. It asks: \"Is this all that I am?\" Where does the quest for knowledge lead? What purpose is there when I answered all the questions I needed to ask? What next? 'ST:TMP' borders precariously between hopeful existence and complete and total nihilism. If there aren't answers to these questions, then what is there?\n\nThere are flaws. Many criticize the length of the film but I think that the pacing is just right for the most part. It is a meditative and intelligent film and the questions that it asks need a little time to percolate and mix with the grey matter between your ears. Robert Wise was a graduate of the Val Lewton school of film-making: taut direction, tension in steady crescendo and an unseen antagonist with a big payoff. Those early lessons pay off well in this film. It may actually have been to his advantage that he wasn't a passionate fan of the original. He was able to come to the project and approach it with a cool, dispassionate eye. Things unnecessary to the plot were eliminated so that only the core of the story would be addressed. Unfortunately one thing that this eliminates is the heart and the comedy of the original series. If I missed any one thing greatly in this movie, I regret the loss of the comedy that would be restored in later films. My only other minor objection was the style of the costuming -- mercifully aborted for the subsequent films in the series.\n\nGreat Oscar-worthy score, complex fun, and a welcome return to the series. Essential viewing for fans of the series and a good introduction for those who are new to the Star Trek universe."

        "review_detailed_main": "James T. Kirk returns to lead the Enterprise when a threat emerges.\n\nThis is an enjoyable movie for those with a taste for the franchise and an appreciation for the technical crafts of sci-fi filmmaking.\n\nIt reintroduces some of the original series characters in a good way, particularly Spock and Kirk. Plus it has some decent guest characters in Captain Decker and Lieutenant Ilia.\n\nKirk's portrayal is arguably the character's most unlikeable in the franchise. He is written as more selfish, humourless and unfulfilled than ever. Spock is taken back to a more basic state than we saw in the original series. Presumably, these characterisations were to give both room to develop during the movie and sequels, plus it allows Spock's arc to parallel V'Ger's journey quite cleverly.\n\nDecker and Ilia are an important part of the story and have some of the movie's best moments. It's clear to see some early inspiration for TNG's Riker and Troi in their scenes.\n\nI like the story as an ambitious and expanded version of the original series episode 'The Changling'. The themes tackled like the pursuit of knowledge and logic, the role of feelings and emotions, and the search for purpose in existence are very interesting. Plus it has a great final twist.\n\nThere is not quite enough plot for a film of its length, so it moves slowly and stretches certain scenes with sci-fi spectacle. It is in these lengthy effects-driven sequences where I think you find out if you really are a hardcore fan or not. I love the early parts that set the scene well and show us the Enterprise in all its glory. In my imagination I see the likes of Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise awed by the production values of movies like '2001: Space Odyssey' and wanting the same level of razzle-dazzle in this franchise.\n\nThe visuals throughout are generally epic, particularly in relation to the tech designs, space effects and alien characters. The Klingons for example have a style and makeup revamp that stayed consistent throughout the sequels and shows.\n\nOne aspect I do not find very cinematic is the redesigned Starfleet uniforms. They are mostly beige and grey set against numerous beige and grey backgrounds. Give me the old red, blue and gold of the 60s any day!\n\nIt has to be said that as good as they look, some scenes feel overly drawn out, especially when the aesthetic of the cloud entity is revealed up close. I lost count how many times I have passed out during late night viewings of the bridge crew staring at the views presented on the big monitor. There is nothing interesting about watching someone else watch TV.\n\nTo end on a positive I have to mention Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic score that feels way too exciting to fit with the pace and cerebral tone of the movie, but it is an iconic piece of music."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is always difficult to review movies that have been made in a different time. Movies today are faster, action-packed, full of CGI and the main actors are young, good looking and athletic. Dialogues are mostly short because the receptivity of the audience today is a lot shorter due to smartphones, movie streaming and TikTok. You cannot really compare a 40 years old movie with a movie from today.\n\nBut even though this film is over 40 years old, I wonder if the movie goers back in the days really enjoyed this movie in the cinemas. This movie is a snoozefest. Nothing actually happens during its over 2 hours runtime. We see minute long shots of the Enterprise without dialogue or even longer shots of the blue nebula. The acting is weak, Kirk is portrayed as an arrogant amateur that does not have the wits of a captain and is mostly unlikable throughout the movie. And why Bones is needed for this mission is beyond me. What does he actually do?\n\nWatching a bald woman that speaks and acts like a robot half the movie is also no fun. The CGI - well, not sure how it has been perceived when the movie came out. But today, it looks cheesy and cheap. And boy the uniforms. The film was made at the end of the 1970s, yet it has the charme of the 1960s. The uniforms are really, really bad. Most of the time Kirk basically wears a T-shirt. Scotty looks like he is wearing PJs and why they have this fanny bag like thing stitched to their bellies - I don't even know. When you compare this to Alien or Star Wars which also were released 78/79 then you see a completely different costume and set design that does not look like it came from the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nEveryone who writes, this film is a classic or one of the most underrated movies: Not it isn't. It is even overrated when I read through some of the comments. I had to watch this movie in two sessions because I fell asleep after 1 hour."

Granted, I've never seen a full episode of that. For me, it really did seem like a long episode of the show. As I said in my \"Doctor Who\" review, that's not really a good thing.\n\nThis is the longest \"Star Trek\" movie ever made or at least it's tied with \"Star Trek: Into Darkness\" a far superior movie. This film suffers from lingering shots of space that are pointless. It's irritating with such a long movie. Interestingly enough, in a certain way it did work a bit. It made the movie really leisurely to watch. I mean, it's still boring, but it was something you could take your time with. The visual effects really do hold up. The story itself is okay, with the characters journeying to stop an anomaly from reaching Earth. It's pretty much a mediocre movie, but it's still interesting given how significant it is as a film. **1/2"

The musical score is another credit to the film as well.\n\nAlso 'The Motion Picture' represents a one off attempt to translate the essence of the TV show into a big screen package. After this the film series developed very different tones and a very space fantasy theme rather than a mixture of sci fi, fantasy, human morality and human exploration.\n\nThe attempt at depicting alien-ness and the scales of megastructures and space travel is worthy of note.\n\nIf this film is ultimately to be considered a folly and a mistaken production I think that it is also a testament to overreaching and some of the attributes of the film are worthy of higher regard.\n\nI rate 6/10 for the sheer impact of scale and scope plus the legendary model filming of the starship Enterprise."

This is not my favorite Star Trek movie, in fact not even in my top 5, but there is something majestic about this movie. When I was younger I hated this movie, and claimed that the movie series started with the second movie as far as I am concerned. This movie moved at such a slow pace that I always would get bored with it and quit watching it. But, being that I love Star Trek more so than any other movie franchise, I would force myself to go back and still attempt to watch \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" again and again. Then finally one night at around 2am I finished it for the first time. And once I was finally able to finish it, I absolutely loved it. And I have watched it from start to finish several times since then.\n\nThe starship Enterprise has been rebuilt (refitted) and is a completely new starship from the ground up. There is long scene of nothing but footage of the Enterprise sitting in Space dock while Jerry Goldsmith's masterful Star Trek Theme song plays. I know that sound silly, but it isn't, for some reason you n ever get bored at that scene. The Enterprise is such a beautiful starship, that it looks so amazing that you never get bored of watch it sit in space dock while that majestic music is playing.\n\n::::::::::: SPOILER ALERTS;;;;;;;;;\n\nThe movie about a monster cloud moving through space and destroying everything in it's path, and it's headed strait for Earth. Admiral Kirk is assigned to take over the Enterprise from Captain Decker and intercept whatever it is that's inside the cloud, a very simple and strait forward plot. (Written by Sci-Fi novelist Alan Dean Foster \u2013 the only screen play he ever wrote). But things get a little more complicated when they arrive at the cloud and discover that it is far more powerful than anything they ever encountered before. It probes them and eventually abducts one of the crew. Only to send a mechanism back to the Enterprise in the image of that abducted crew member. Spock figures out that the vessel at the hart of the cloud is a giant living machine named Veeger. They eventually discover Veeger is really an old NASA Voyager 6 satellite that has traveled the entire galaxy and amassed so much knowledge that it achieved artificial intelligence and became alive.\n\nYes this movie moves at a very slow pace, it's not an action packed thrill ride. But its still a great movie. But I'd take this any day over J.J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek movie.\n\nI'm lucky enough to own a VHS Copy of the 1983 \"Special Longer Version\" that has everyone one of the deleted scenes re-edited back into the movie, something that the newer Blu-Ray \"Director's Cut\" doesn't have."

For example, when Captain Kirk first goes on the Enterprise, there were long shots of the ship, with the only other thing that we saw was Kirk admiring the ship. The visuals were absolutely stunning, but I got so sick of viewing them.\n\nThe plot was also dull, and very pretentious. I can't even bring myself to call the ending a climax because nothing happened in it. This was the first time in the history of watching Star Trek that I didn't care about what happened to the characters.\n\nIf you're having a Star Trek Marathon, skip this one. It doesn't relate to the other movies so it won't matter. Plus, you get to kick off your marathon with the excellent Wrath of Khan, instead of this snooze fest. I honestly tried to find one good thing about this movie, other than the cast, and the only thing I can think of are the visuals, which are impressive, but they show those visuals for far too long."

Ive now wached it on abig tv on blu ray. MUCH BETTER! OK, its 132 mins long but i watche it in 3 bits. Its very visually striking. How it didnt win best effects i dont know. There were other space features that year of course like alien, the balck hole and roonmaker. The premise is pretty cool. Although in 300 yrs not much could possible be learned.. 300 years in space is nothing.. the neaqrest planet requires afew milennia travelling ! Yes the dialogue is a bit jargony and the clothes are vwery 70s. But its reviews are harsh. The score is great too. The bald lady is a intersting character. The ned is pretty cool. One more thing, how this ship looking for its reator just ahppend upon earth? So surely it knew it already? Yeh some things amke no sense, same any other film really.. so yeh the effects. So good! And paved the way for the effects laden 80s.."

        "review_detailed_main": "The William Shatner Star Trek was before my time and I never got into The Next Generation. I grew up seeing more parodies of Captain Kirk than actual Captain Kirk. Unfortunately, those same parodies reared their ugly heads while watching Star Trek: TMP. I couldn't even take him seriously. With every line I just saw Jim Carrey or insert-comedian-here who's done a Captain Kirk impression.\n\nThe movie starts with an unidentifiable amorphous entity attacking and destroying three Klingon ships. Starfleet command ascertains that this powerful and enormous alien object is on a course set for Earth. The U.S.S. Enterprise is the only Starfleet vessel close enough to intercept this alien force hence Capt. Kirk hops aboard the Enterprise to play hero.\n\nThe run time of the movie is 132 minutes. I mention that only because there was a lot of dead space. They spent too much time on glamour shots. It seemed like 30 minutes of run time between close up shots on the U.S.S. Enterprise and the alien orb. It was like this was some new technology in film and they couldn't wait to show it off.\n\nWithout giving away the ending I think it was probably the best part of the movie. In fact, I'd say the ending gave the movie some validity. As it was going it seemed like it was going to be a dull affair with a lot of space jargon. The ending gave the movie a pulse, however weak, but a pulse still."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I agree that the film is very slow, and the special effects shots were too long ( although they were fantastic ), it is still great to see the original crew back in action. The story is actually quite good, although I am led to believe it borrows heavily from an old episode, not being a die-hard trekkie I never noticed. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelley, James Doohan and all the other regulars all slip back into their roles with ease. Plus the beautiful Persis Khambatta makes an interesting addition to the crew alongwith Stephen Collins as Decker. Jerry Goldsmiths score is excellent and helps make the overlong effects sequences bearable. I think the storyline is quite well realised and offers a better answer than other sci-fi films, 2001 for example. All in all an enjoyable Star Trek film but not as good as the second one or my personal favourite Star Trek IV: The Vogage Home. ***7/10***"

        "review_title": "A Defense",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Motionless Picture is a pejorative people have used against the first Star Trek movie since its release. This has to do with the fact that the movie has very little plot and takes a long time to get there.\n\nThere's a reason for that. The Motion Picture actually started life as a script for the aborted attempt to bring Star Trek back to television called Phase II. It was supposed to be a single episode in length, but when the opportunity arose to turn it into a movie, Gene Roddenberry never really fleshed out the script in a conventional way.\n\nYou see, Gene Roddenberry was never a very good writer (one writer from The Original Series said that there was no script that Roddenberry ever touched that he didn't make worse), but he did provide two unfiltered versions of his vision of the future in Star Trek. The first was the original pilot to the television show, \"The Cage\", while The Motion Picture was the second. The Cage\" also happens to be my favorite hour of Star Trek because I am under the impression that science fiction should be weird, and that episode does capture that feeling while also telling a cogent story at the same time. I feel much the same way with The Motion Picture. It's not a great movie (for all of my defense, I am happy to acknowledge the film's flaws), but I do think that there is genius to it.\n\nThe Unknown\n\nWhat is the basic plot of this movie? A giant space cloud is heading to Earth, the Enterprise intercepts and keeps it from carrying out that mission. It's really not much, but the point of this movie isn't plot, but theme.\n\nThe theme of The Motion Picture is that we are small in the face of the enormity of the unknown. That idea is both terrifying and awe inspiring at the same time. Whether what is out there is friendly or not is actually beside the point. The point is that while we may be making bold steps forward, there's stuff out there that's been there for much longer.\n\nThat's easy for me to say, but how does the movie go about saying that? Do characters mention it? Does Spock have a speech towards the end where he solemnly says, \"We are but small creatures in the face of such enormity? \" No, nothing that obvious. Characters marvel through dialogue about the cloud's size, but they never make the comparison to their own smallness explicit. It's actually accomplished visually.\n\nLook at the below sequence. This is one of the most derided sequences in the movie, but I think it's actually very key.\n\nThat flyby of the Enterprise takes about 5 minutes of screen time. For many people that feels like 5 minutes where nothing is happening. \"Yes, we see the ship, can we move on, please? \" But what are the visuals telling you? The way the Enterprise is shot is to convey a sense of scale. The humans are small in comparison to the great ship, and the triumphant music is meant to underline that fact. What we're being told is that the Enterprise represents a crowning jewel of humanity's engineering abilities. It's big, it's impressive, and it's spectacular. Maybe the film could have conveyed that, still visually, in less time, but still, the effect is there. In fact, that was pretty much what the shooting script says it should be:\n\nThe great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.\n\nThe second half to this visual puzzle comes in the below clip. But before we get to that, look at this image:\n\nThe Enterprise is framed with the space cloud so that they are of similar size. The cloud is bigger, but not enormously bigger. We know that they aren't the same size, but we're told visually that they're comparable. And then the Enterprise actually moves closer to the cloud. Below is part of the Enterprise's journey into the giant space cloud. While the idea seems silly when phrased that way, it should seem much less silly as this sequence progresses.\n\nObviously, it's more than a space cloud, but it's also more than just giant, it's immense. The scale of this alien thing is so much larger than anything we can imagine creating (there's a line of dialogue earlier in the film that describes the size of the cloud as 2 AU, which is roughly the size of Earth's orbit around the sun). This is where the previous sequence comes into play. We'd been told, visually, that the Enterprise is one of the great feats of human engineering, and as the ship flies further and further into V'ger, it becomes more and more obvious how small our great feat is in comparison.\n\nDo you see how small that great feat of human engineering is in comparison? It's puny. If it came down to a shooting match between the Enterprise and the giant space cloud, would the Enterprise stand of chance of annoying the cloud as much as a mosquito annoys a grown man?\n\nThis impression is also explicit in the shooting script:\n\nCAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a parallel-closing course - Alien continues to GROW IN SIZE. Although it already seems an impossibly large vessel compared to the Enterprise, in reality they are still tens of thousands of kilometers apart; the incredible size of the Alien is nowhere near being realized yet.\n\nThe fact that that impression and theme is played out completely visually is impressive. That is why I think the movie is a work of genius.\n\nThough...not great\n\nThe Motion Picture was made in the wake of the success of Star Wars and Roddenberry took his rather large amount of control of the project that Paramount allowed him to push the first Star Trek movie in as far of the opposite direction as he possibly could. Where Lucas provided popcorn entertainment in space, Roddenberry wanted to provoke thought like Kubrick did in 2001. Where people think he failed, I think it's because it's a big budget studio movie that doesn't really have an antagonist. The conflict is more nebulous than something like some of the classic Original Series episodes provided. \"Space Seed\" had Khan. \"Balance of Terror\" had the Romulan commander. Even \"Arena\" had the Gorn while dealing with similar themes as The Motion Picture. The movie has a space cloud that possesses a young bald woman. It's not quite as viscerally satisfying as Kirk pounding a rock over the head of a rubber suited stuntman.\n\nAs I said earlier, the movie's not great. The sequence with the asteroid is curiously filmed (perhaps funnily) while adding nothing except an \"action sequence\" that changes nothing. The ending of the film undermines what I see to be the central theme. Instead of V'ger remaining this vast and unknowable thing, it becomes very human and knowable (it's looking for its creator, which is understandable). Decker is arguably the main character of the movie while Kirk is sidelined a bit more than he should be (a result of Phase II looking to cast a new lead in case William Shatner didn't want to come back). And, we get to see Gene Roddenberry write out his fantasy of having with a computer when Decker merges with V'ger. Seriously.\n\nStill, I love the heady quality, and how it's done mostly wordlessly (there is dialogue demonstrating the character's awe at the size, but it pales to the impression the visuals give themselves). Combine that with one of Jerry Goldsmith's best musical scores, and you have a movie going experience that I find very engrossing, if a healthy couple of steps from great. With over 700 hours of Star Trek, it's hard to say what Star Trek is. It's taken on so many forms over the years that to say that it's a Western in space seems facile and ignorant of most of Star Trek. It's not really one thing, so I'm happy to have one iteration where's it's 2001's less intelligent younger brother.\n\nPart of me wishes that the movie series had continued in this vein: throwing millions of dollars at the screen to be heady and weird. But then we got Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan which is one of those movies that I have a hard time calling anything other than perfect. I'm happy with what we ended up with afterwards, but still, I wonder how Star Trek would have manifested in the movie theaters had The Motion Picture been more accepted by audiences and critics. We would have probably avoided Star Trek: Insurrection, at least."

So, ten years later Gene Roddenberry and the cast try to get a new access to \"Star Trek\" as well as the viewer. That is no easy task!\n\nTo make sure it is a success Paramount hired one of the greatest directors, Robert Wise. No specialist in sci-fi, and that is the problem. For him this universe seems to have no meaning and so it is no wonder that the characters lack the behavior we\u00b4d come to love in the series.

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite being familiar with it due to its spin-offs (I've seen several full episodes of both 'Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-1994)' and 'Star Trek: Voyager (1995-2001)'), remakes and general pop-culture importance, I've never actually seen the original 'Star Trek (1966-1969)'. As such, 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)' is, essentially, my introduction to these iconic characters (though I am aware of their rebooted versions, of course). Regardless of my unfamiliarity with its direct source material, I never felt lost. The piece does a decent job of introducing you to the crew of the newly upgraded Enterprise, giving most of them just enough characterisation to make you care about their journey to prevent a giant entity from engulfing Earth. The most obvious thing about the picture is its scale; there's a night-and-day difference between the size and scope of this when compared to the original show, or even its subsequent spin-offs. Everything is just so big and it all looks absolutely spectacular. It really is rather impressive, to be honest. The visuals are a pure treat to behold, easily the flick's strongest aspect, and they are often genuinely awe-inspiring. The movie clearly knows that, though; it typically spends just a bit too long indulging in its special-effects-driven spectacle. This ties directly into the picture's biggest issue: its pacing. It is, as its reputation would suggest, rather slow. It's too long and feels as though it could have done with a relatively significant trim. I mean, at least twenty minutes could have been excised from this at no detriment to its story (which is relatively thin considering the thing's length) or, even, its awesome effect. The pacing is also just odd in the sense that the affair spends, after a pretty snappy introduction, an hour and a half getting its characters to the ominous entity they're tasked with stopping and then just turns into a more traditional episode of the show and plays out as such for the remaining forty-ish minutes. Still, it's not as if the experience is especially boring. It's generally engaging and is entertaining pretty much all the way through, even though you can certainly feel its length and occasionally wish for it to, I suppose, get to the point. There is a compelling sense of mystery regarding its enigmatic antagonist. The final reveal is actually quite intriguing and has plenty of intellectually stimulating implications. It could be considered a tad hokey, I suppose, but I appreciate the way in which it resolves itself not with violence, but with communication (which is, from what I understand, one of the things the show is renowned for). The existentialism that runs through the flick works rather well, even if it does occasionally feel like the affair is straining to be the next '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)', and the conclusion's focus on creation over destruction is refreshing. It's a satisfying conclusion, though it arguably doesn't justify the gargantuan length of the journey taken to reach it. The picture also does a decent job at giving its core players a bit of character development, most keenly felt when it comes to the subtle but significant arc that Nimoy's Spock undergoes. The cast are all pretty good here, feeling confident in the roles that they're undoubtedly most known for. Shatner's delivery is really odd (he boldly pauses... where no man... has paused before) but only a handful of his lines are truly baffling and I gather that this is one of his character's trademarks (or, I suppose, charms). Ultimately, the affair is an uneven but mostly successful one. When it works, it really works. However, its pacing is problematic and some of it just falls a bit flat. Still, it's a solid effort overall. If this is one of the worst entries in the series (as many have suggested), then I suppose I've just taken the first step in a pretty entertaining journey. 6/10."

William Shatner gives the performance you expect from him (\"Damn it, Bones, I need you! Badly!\"). Leonard Nimoy seems bored. DeForest Kelley steals every scene he's in and has all the best lines. The new cast members, Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta, are bland and unimpressive. Collins is especially weak and his 'one raised eyebrow' stares are enough to give anybody giggle fits. I actually liked the plot, particularly the ultimate reveal behind the space cloud thing. It's very old-school sci-fi. Unfortunately the movie is talky and overlong without much action. The special effects are nice but never so impressive to make up for the ponderous pace. The frequent shots of the Enterprise slowly moving along to Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score is just poor filmmaking not up to director Robert Wise's usual standard. Not a big fan of the colorless uniforms, either. Overall it's definitely one of the weaker Star Trek movies but not without merit and not as awful as its reputation would suggest.

There are scenes of this movie that are basically Star Trek Music Videos, where we ogle starships for multiple minutes at a time.\n\nI love me some good cosmic-unknown science fiction and it's great to see the reunited Star Trek crew deal with their time away and maybe the strangest alien life force they've ever faced. The balance of what can be best described as Kirk's mid-life crisis, the hesitancy of crew members to work with him again, and the movie's loving adoration of these characters... it's great stuff, honestly.\n\nThere are so many shots and scenes that are clearly supposed to be about filling out other parts of the Enterprise the TV series never got to show, or never got to show in such budget or detail. There's almost this sense of triumph for everybody to be back in the saddle doing Star Trek again. It's really remarkable.\n\nOkay, sure, yes. Parts of this movie are a little slow. But that's kind of what you want from this sort of science fiction, right? I enjoyed the heck out of it."

Failing to capture the magic, pace and momentum of the TV show, 'The Motion Picture' does not move with the energy and excitement that a movie requires.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it sorely lacks accurate characterisation, as Kirk is discernibly unlikeable and badly conceived, Bones has little to do and Spock returns far too late and seems even more vacant than usual. The main 'villain' of sorts is a cloud of rainbow gases that is not adequately explained in emotional depth or is interesting enough to warrant caring about - the ending to it being so poor that it emphasis this point.\n\nThe outfits and designs in the ship are beige and pale green, looking more like a vintage nicotine filled aeroplane than a spaceship. However there are pretty CGI and atmospheric details and in the right mood it provides an easy slow burn."

He directed the greatest musical of all time, West Side Story, has two Oscars, edited Citizen Kane (which alone would give him a hallowed place in movie history) and he has a remarkable resume. But, every genius has some dark spots in his career, and Wise's are The Hindenburg and Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\n\nThis film proves one thing: that the movie going public has an unsatiable thirst for Star Trek. It spawned a hugely successful franchise, and although it has its ups and downs, I see every film without fail. I am not a trekkie, I have never watched DS9 or any of the new series, but I enjoy sci-fi.\n\nThis movie is significant only due to the fact that it is the first in the series. It is a little silly and little shy on plot, especially considering its length. It is not a bad film, but I would have expected more from Wise as a director. A great score and some good special effects for the day. For Star Trek junkies only - there are much better instalments in the series. **1/2 out of ****."

Coal can turn into a diamond under pressure but the pressure here to turn out a hit using the success of the series worked against it. We wanted to see the characters unleashed and free to do whatever they wanted based on what they previously did. The story lacked and I am surprised for this as the original series had so many unique and interesting stories to tell making one wonder why they didn't use one of those? Well they ended up realizing this afterwards and did just that. They took the episode \"space Seed\" and turned it into The Wrath of Khan for Star Trek # 2. Also getting a Director with a passion makes a difference too. Eventually the series itself found its footing and had all its positive ducks lined up and did a nice run. Of course they had to end it as the characters were aging terribly. They left us in good condition however. When I first saw this, I was a Trekkie so I endured it to the end. But this is not a movie you would see again because it has no memorable scenes. Good snack movie with a tasty drink and if you want to visit with this please do because after all, it is a Star Trek movie and that makes it okay"

        "review_detailed_main": "When all's said and done - and many have said it - it was the pacing that made most of the episodes of the original series so watchable. Of course, they had great ideas written into the plots, but it was those moments of tension and action during each act which made them so exciting. For this, the first film follow-up to the sixties original series and the animated show of 1973, the filmmakers focused on an idea - and pacing be damned. I first viewed this film when it played in theaters in '79; I was in my late teens. Afterwards, I told the first person who asked me - how was it, that I nearly fell asleep in my seat. I was young; I'd seen all the episodes in reruns and had been dazzled by their energy. This film was like the anti-Trek to me at this point, a complete reversal of the things which made the original show so great. We are asked to worship the Enterprise when she first appears, waiting to be launched, but the sequence ends up alienating us - forcing us to wait as the story pulls to a dead stop - a major miscalculation to be repeated a few times. It was a somber, even depressing mood throughout the film's storyline, with most of the main characters (especially Kirk & Spock) quite grim, as if they'd just escaped a Romulan prison after 10 years of captivity (wait, Romulans do not take captives). Yes, there was a major threat to be faced, but there was not so much anxiety as just plain dark moods, for some reason.\n\nBut, there were no Romulans in the film; there were Klingons, however, briefly: new brutish versions who encounter some vast mysterious entity out in space as the film begins. It's this initial sequence which immediately sets the tone and, unfortunately, the slow pace for the rest of the film. The lovingly-detailed warships move slowly towards their fate, as the camera pans over, under and all around. This really tests the patience of most in the audience and it's magnified later when the Enterprise slowly - oh, so slowly - drifts over the surface of the gargantuan vessel which we will soon come to know as V'Ger. The story takes place only two and a half years after the end of the 5-year mission of the original and animated series. Kirk is now an admiral in Starfleet Operations. Spock seeks to purge himself of all emotion on his homeworld of Vulcan. McCoy has grown a beard and gone into private practice. The rest (Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, now Dr.Chapel and even Rand) are working on the tail-end of the Enterprise's 2-year refit. The interior of the ship had changed quite a bit. So had the uniforms - an abrupt shift to an almost monochrome palette; it looked like everyone was caught in their leisure suits. All this is, by necessity, covered very briefly; after all, we need the time for that wormhole problem they encounter soon, when everything goes into slow motion. The scripted dialogue seems unrefined, uninspired: the grand reunions we wait for are anti-climactic, with Kirk constrained to comments of how he needs McCoy, then Spock. No, really?\n\nThe new characters are Decker (son of \"The Doomsday Machine\" Decker), the young new captain of the ship who must stand down for Kirk in the one hint of melodrama, and the Deltan female who has taken a vow of celibacy. Hubba-hubba. So off they go, to save the Earth, which we finally see for the first time here in the 23rd century, specifically San Francisco (no real change in the skyline after 300 years? come now!). It's at about this point, watching the film a 2nd and 3rd time, that I realized this was a film made for 2nd and 3rd viewings. All the hubris attached to viewing it the 1st time is now almost gone. I could kind of let go of my nostalgic inclinations of worshiping a legendary sixties series and try to savor the elegance striven for by director Wise and the screenwriters. Our beloved characters have been transposed to a thoughtful awe-inspiring quest, seeking answers to hazy, almost mystical questions. They're surrounded by $40 million dollars of budget (in seventies dollars!), a grand expense which will probably never be matched in the Trek film series. On my 2nd viewing, I had the luxury of settling back and studying these characters, as they steadily but surely get closer to some metaphysical answers. Was this copying \"2001:A Space Odyssey\"? Perhaps, to some extent, but if one had to pick a science fiction film to copy...\n\nOverall, they had trouble getting into a certain groove again, perhaps reflected by the characters' years of separation, but I could even relax now as Scotty takes Kirk on that lengthy exterior tour of the starship - it can be cool, sure. Now, if I was coarse and flippant, I might point out that Kirk and his crew probably should have guessed half of those answers sooner, based on their experiences from an earlier adventure, titled \"The Changeling.\" But, I won't do that. No, let's just leave it where it is, a grand if flawed experiment in magnificent Trekking, which may just gain more appreciation in time. At the conclusion, the Enterprise appeared to embark on its next 5-year mission, but we never saw it, except in comic books. No, we next see the Enterprise crew about a dozen years later(!) in \"The Wrath of Khan.\" That was when Kirk really began to regret...but that's a story for another time."

Fantastic work by Goldsmith and the poeple who remixed the sound. The character arcs leave no fat to chew and the visual effects are clean and beautiful.\n\nI like the extended views of the various spacecraft and their environments. The sheer mystery of the story also holds well. We have little idea of what is to come. Last time I watched it was long long ago, and I'd completely forgotten what the plot involved. So this was like watching it anew.\n\nHad to have a giggle with the reveal near the end on the origin of V'Ger. I instantly recognised that object.\n\nThe only annoying thing was the three minutes of music at the start with no image.

        "review_title": "The film that gave Star Trek back to the world",
        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek The Motion Picture raises some of the so-called eternal big questions for humanity as a whole and for individuals (to the extent that anyone really bothers to consider such questions): 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' 'Is this all there is?' 'Is there nothing more?' As a sentient life-form, V'ger hopes to touch and join with its Creator to find its own answers. Considering the murderous and inhumane cavalcade of human history, one can't help but wonder if there might be any truth to McCoy's bitter observation that V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment. Perhaps if we stop to ponder such big questions and look up from picking fluff out of our navels, we'd be less inclined as a species to slaughter our fellow human beings or stand back and watch while innocent people are being mown down and dispossessed by brutal, self-justifying and opportunistic State, sectarian and political entities.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture is very much a film about individual characters on their own voyages of self discovery. The question being raised for each character: Is their concept of fulfilment sufficient? In the end, is this all there is and Is there no more? The answer may lie in our feelings for our fellow human beings and in the relationships we form.\n\nAnother important issue that is raised concerns humanity's ultimate destiny and the role that our technology may play. Could it be possible that our own evolution may involve a melding or joining of our biology with our technology and that eventually our technology will supersede human beings entirely? Will an entirely new species evolve combining elements of humanity (emotions, thought processes) and artificial machine intelligence? Could this new life-form then reach out into the cosmos or traverse dimensions and establish contact with similar entities?\n\nMany critics who have expressed disappointment with the film and its portrayal of the characters have missed the point of 'change' as being part and parcel of life. During the interval between the original series ending and the filming of the motion picture, the actors playing the characters had themselves changed as individuals and such change would also inevitably be reflected in the roles they played. Yes, we the audience longed for a reunion of characters we all knew so well and hoped that they would hug each other, hold hands and sing Kumbaya as if nothing had changed. We also may have wondered what ever happened to those bright primary colours that festooned the Enterprise interior and Starfleet uniforms and why they were replaced by neutral colour schemes. Well, guess what? Everything including people change and if there's no change and people choose to Klingon, sorry cling on to the past, and wallow in nostalgia then there's only stagnation to look forward to.\n\nMuch has also been made about actor dissatisfaction with the scrip; frequent script re-writes by the actors themselves; delays and more delays; issues with characterisation; on and off-screen lack of chemistry; unfamiliarity with and departure from the true spirit of Star Trek and on and on.\n\nAlthough director Wise was unfamiliar with the background intricacies and in-and-outs of Star Trek that lay behind and formed the context of the film, he did rely on the actors, especially William Shatner, to ensure consistency in terms of dialogue and characterization.\n\nSome critics have whined about the film's pacing and complained about long stretches without apparent action or dialogue. Take for instance, the first close view of the Enterprise as Scotty and Kirk view it on approach in the pod. In our modern 21st century attention deficit disordered society it might be difficult for audiences to handle an absence of rapid quick cutting shots, meaningless babbling incomprehensible and inaudible dialogue, stuff constantly happening and so on. The slow approach toward the starship and the time given to taking in its whole exterior is designed to evoke what Kirk must have felt upon seeing his beloved Enterprise after so long a time. It's called savouring a moment when you just have to shut up and let your senses take it all in.\n\nThere has over the years been a plethora of mixed reviews for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. In answer to the mumblings of many of these celluloid nit-pickers, let's check out the results of the end product:\n\nWhen the film opened in the United States and Canada it set a box office record for the highest opening weekend gross, making $11,926,421 in its first weekend. The film went on to earn $17 million within a week and was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1979 in the US. Overall, the film grossed $139 million worldwide. Star Trek:The Motion Picture was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score.\n\nIn the United States, the film sold the most tickets of any film in the franchise until Star Trek (2009), and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation. The film's budget of $44 million, including the costs incurred during Phase II production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. Had the film been unsuccessful, there's every chance that the franchise would not have continued."

        "review_detailed_main": "I base this on the Director's Edition. I suppose part of the explanation behind why this movie is, well, the way it is, is it's simultaneously attempting to reacquaint old viewers with the core people and their relationships, and introduce it to new-comers. A good deal of this consists of establishing, and as a direct result, the characters don't have a lot to do, nor is the overall story given as much screen-time and attention as it could, considering that this is the longest of these. The plot isn't entirely original, if the resolution is satisfying. The moral is also retread ground. This isn't particularly action-based, but, rather, something to think about. That may have been to further distinguish it from Star Wars. This does, however, come off as relatively Hollywoodized, maybe especially when compared to the show itself. All of this isn't to say that this is poor... it certainly has its worth. There is genuine drama and tension herein. It feels like a film, grand and epic, with a masterful score, fantastic(although probably improved in the newer releases) special effects, and a budget that allowed it to achieve a greater scope. The pacing is uneven throughout. The language is gratuitous, albeit not harsh. This contains more of such than the entire television series put together. This isn't as fine for children to watch as earlier efforts in the franchise, though aforementioned(be aware that there are a few disturbing details) is the only thing that isn't handled in a tasteful manner. And there is a reason this has been referred to as The Motion Sickness. The acting is solid, and this in general has next to no silly or goofy moments, but works as a serious piece(just don't take *all* of the science as fact). Thankfully everyone remembered how to portray their roles, and the writing is credible as well. This should be seen as a starting point, from where the later entries would spring forth. The 2-Disc DVD set holds a commentary track, several deleted/additional scenes(of varying quality), a bit of promotional material including trailers and TV spots and a couple of featurettes/documentaries(one on the making and another on the recent retouching, both are well-done) many of which are interesting and worth the time. I recommend this to Trekkies as well as those who have never seen any Star Trek, and fans of sci-fi that holds food for thought. Just know what to expect. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The late Gene Roddenberry's \"Star Trek\" is one of TV's greatest oddities. During its original network television run on NBC from 1966 to 1969, \"Star Trek\" never ranked any higher than No. 35 in the Nielsen ratings, and it was axed after the end of its third season. But reruns in syndication during the Seventies helped build a large and worldwide following for the series; its millions of fans became known as \"Trekkies.\" And what had once been a failed sci-fi TV series instead mushroomed into a seemingly never-ending series of films, all of them significant hits at the box office. STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was the first, released at the end of 1979.\n\nMost of the series' original cast, especially William Shatner (as Kirk), Leonard Nimoy (as Spock), and DeForest Kelley (as Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy), are reunited for this extremely lengthy first \"Trek\" film, with a redesigned U.S.S. \"Enterprise\" as the centerpiece, and a new captain (Stephen Collins) whom Kirk, now basically promoted to Admiral, lords it over. On this mission, and onboard an \"Enterprise\" that has not been tested, Kirk and company are sent out to intercept a massive alien cloud heading towards Earth. The alien force calls itself \"V'Ger\" and has taken control of the body of one of the crew (Persis Khambatta) in order that it may make contact with the \"Enterprise.\" It also transpires that the alien cloud has intercepted and taken control of an ancient \"Voyager\" space probe that had been launched from Earth three centuries before. In essence, this probe has returned to Earth looking for its Creator. But in its search for the Creator, it is threatening Earth with destruction. As it had been in the TV series itself, here it is up to Kirk and his crew to convince \"V'Ger\" that those of their species are the ones that created it.\n\nOriginally budgeted at $5 million by Paramount Pictures when production started in the summer of 1977, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE quickly grew from a modest undertaking to an extraordinarily ambitious and visual spectacle; the final cost, once it reached the big screen, was a then-astounding $40 million. Much of that money, not surprisingly, was spent on the production design and the elaborate special effects work. As a result, and with the measured pace at which the story was laid out, many audiences thought it very tedious. STAR WARS had been in release for two and a half years; and the gee-whiz heroics of that film were far removed from the perceived ponderousness of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE. Indeed, this film owes as much to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY as it does to the original series itself.\n\nStill, the reappearance of the cast from the original series is welcome. When it came to directors, Roddenberry, serving here as the producer, made an excellent choice: Robert Wise, whose credits included the 1951 sci-fi masterpiece THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and the 1963 horror classic THE HAUNTING, among many others. For the special effects, Wise got top-notch work from the masters in that field, Douglas Trumbull (2001), John Dykstra (STAR WARS), Richard Yuricich, and many others. Finally, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is blessed with a superb score by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, who won an Oscar in 1976 for THE OMEN, and was nominated again for this film. Besides its main theme, which was used for \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", the score seems to utilize a combination of motifs from Claude Debussy's \"Nocturnes\" and Gustav Holst's \"The Planets.\"\n\nIn its final 144 minute form, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is still a long movie, but its ambitious scope makes it eminently watchable, despite its flaws (some of which came inevitably with the original series itself). It's not a masterpiece, but it is arguably better and more intelligent than what mostly passes for science fiction in our day and age."

Being too slow-paced is not the real problem; the plot was simply too thin for such a long movie. So, the movie is not thrilling, nor dramatic or introspective (although it tends to be)... there is an initial spark of mystery, followed by a tone of inconsistent and uninteresting scenes; but it has a very interesting conclusion. I don't know if this idea has been used before, but I liked it very much! So the movie had a redeeming conclusion, but did I really need to spend more than 2 hours for that?"

It's grand, epic, heroic and true to the Star Trek ethos. Goldsmith's score is incredible and it fits well with Wise's direction. Two brilliant examples are Kirk's journey to the Enterprise in space dock and the crew's trip through the mysterious depths of V'ger. I particularly liked the tag line at the end of the movie - \"The Human adventure is just beginning\" - which in my opinion sums up the reason I watch Trek in the first place. From it's start in the 60's, the Star Trek series has been an attempt to explore that statement. What does it mean to be human? Star Trek: The Motion Picture did a wonderful job at looking at this question while raising some of it's own. Will computers eventually replace \"carbon-based life forms\"? How does a human differ from a machine composed entirely of raw data? Could there be more to life than the accumulation of facts - what about emotion and morality? A real pleasure to watch and a recommended film to all explorers at heart."

To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I guess the clue was in the title: 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is far more pompous than 'Star Trek: The Movie'.\n\nForty years later and I can now appreciate a little better what writer Alan Dean Foster was trying to do: address far more weighty subjects than the adventures of a farm boy with family problems. Star Trek: TMP touches upon theological and philosophical issues such as religious beliefs, the evolution of mankind and what it is to be human. It's grandiose stuff, worthy of discussion, but why did it have to be so painfully slow?\n\nEvery shot of the Enterprise is drawn out to a painful length: a shuttle journey past the docked ship takes almost six minutes and is excruciatingly tedious, while the journey into the heart of V-GER is at least three times that, giving FX guy Douglas Trumball and his crew plenty of time to experiment with colourful visuals. It's often impressive to look at, but also something of a drag.\n\nWould it really have hurt to include a little mindless excitement to contrast the more thought-provoking stuff?"

Had this been a box office failure, think where the Star Trek generations would be today. Star Trek TMP set a standard, a film that truly soars with mighty ambitions and creative thought. It has its rough bits and drags in parts, but the amazing special effects and race to encounter an unknown enity are exciting. Watch the Special Edition DVD with the commentary on it and you will see the movie in a whole new light, and feel the excitement of seeing Captain Kirk and the crew returning.. they're back! After all this time away from TV, it tingles one's soul to see them back on the bridge. The amazing overture at the begining only entices you to the historic drama of Star Trek. There are many questions in the movie, such as Spock's devotion to starfleet or to his own interests, that the film deals with, and the competition between Kirk and Deckard (and it sets up the wonderful relationship for Picard and Riker in TNG). Watch this again, it's a good, good start to a wonderful movie series and ten times better than Star Trek 5."

This movie has some interesting aspects but moves at less than a snails pace.\n\nStar Trek in general has always been great at giving us both a great sci-fi adventure and outlandish characters but with a moralistic theme woven throughout. In this movie we get one out of three, but that one is still strong. The story and where it takes us is will have your brain engaged and the FX (coupled with a brilliant musical score) are simply spectacular - some of the best of any Trek movie.\n\nHowever it's unfortunate that that is where the positives end. We just don't get the great character moments we need to really get invested. The only thing keeping the cast afloat is the content from the original series. If this was someone's first Star Trek movie it's unlikely they'd want to continue. New characters simply aren't interesting and don't go anywhere.\n\nBut the main thing bogging the movie down is the pace - it is incredibly slow. It's been speculated that the film makers wanted to emulate 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a noble goal but it doesn't work as well in the context of Star Trek. It takes way too long to get all the characters together and even longer to actually get the main plot together. Once that plot gets there it really does pick up but the sluggish right to that point will test the patience of many watchers.\n\nIf you're a die hard Trekkie give it a go, but honestly the series works if you just skip to the next one."

He seems constantly constipated, as if the responsibility of carrying a MAJOR MOTION PICTURE was too stressful for him. Although his performance gets better towards the end of the picture (perhaps it's not a coincidence that Shatner's performance becomes better as Spock begins to thaw emotionally, and their relationship begins to resemble what it was in the series). Still, the Enterprise fly-by, as Kirk sees the re-fitted ship for the first time, is still worth the price of admission for any \"Trek\" fan, and the story, though well-worn, is, nonetheless, inspiring."

        "review_detailed_main": "Only because of the great special effects and the fact that as a Trekkie, I was thrilled to see all my TOS favourite characters together again, could I speak even remotely well of this first Star Trek movie. The plot is plodding and not in the least memorable. Even worse, while all the Enterprise crew is back, the old chemistry of their interactions just isn't there.\n\nThe setting is three years after the original five year mission of the Enterprise. The legendary Admiral Kirk is summoned to command the newly refitted Enterprise on a heroic mission to intercept a strange alien craft which has destroyed everything in its path and is now headed to earth. Joining Kirk are Dr. Leonard (Bones) McCoy, engineer Scotty, and all the rest of the old crew except Spock. The half Vulcan is on a soul searching quest of his own, but comes aboard the Enterprise with all the appropriate drama later in the movie.\n\nFirst, the beautiful special effects. It's both a visually stunning and an emotionally moving spectacle when the magnificent, newly refurbished USS Enterprise emerges from dry dock to boldly go forth into space once again. Probably no Trekkie in the theatre audience back in 1979 had completely dry eyes. There are beautiful sequences reminiscent of 2001: A Space Oddessey, another painfully slow moving film and one which I personally disliked. The spectacular special effects in this first big screen Trek are simply not enough to make this a compelling movie.\n\nThe theme of logic versus emotion should be engaging, though the plot is so slow, it's hard to become truly involved with any of it. The alien spacecraft turns out to be a logical entity named VGER, which is programmed to learn everything possible and transmit that information back to its creator. Its ultimately threatening quest becomes intertwined with concepts of logic and emotion. Some find it all beautiful, but to me it not only lacked action but failed to capture MY emotions.\n\nReally, there's no fun here at all and no character development either. For me, Star Trek is all about the characters, especially the Kirk / Spock / McCoy interactions. The old chemistry of the Enterprise crew seems sadly lacking. A couple of new crew members are introduced including Commander Decker, handsome but not very interesting. More notable is the bald Lieutenant Ilia, who has previously had a romantic relationship with Decker. She is a Deltan navigator who has taken an oath of celibacy before working with other species, rather an entertaining little character twist.\n\nPersonally, I would lap up ANY movie with the old TOS crew. However, looking objectively back at this film, it was definitely a disappointment. I agree with a comment that the storyline would have been great for a one hour TV episode, it just wasn't enough for a movie. My own personal view is...lots of great effects but not enough story or character development."

Over a decade after the demise of the tv series it was revived as a major motion picture and all of the principal cast was brought back to reprise their roles.\n\nThe crew is brought back together aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise when it is needed for a mission to save the planet earth from a 'cloud' of 'energy' headed on a direct course for the earth. Time is running out. The U.S.S. Enterprise seems to be earth's only hope. Will the star ship and her crew be able to save the earth? Will the crew and ship perish in the process? Those are the elements of suspense in this movie.\n\nThe acting is okay and the special effects are okay and the directing is okay in this film. Unfortunately, the pace of the story is extremely slow. \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" lacks action, humor, real suspense and even character development. It is stated in the documentary that this movie was made under the pressure of a deadline which was very challenging. Well, it shows! Additional editing and work on making the film more stimulating would have been wise choice.\n\nFor \"Trekkies\" and buffs of science fiction movies, \"Star Trek\" does have some nice touches, and they will no doubt be delighted to see the original cast back together again. All others beware!\n\nFortunately, this box office success of this movie set the foundation for much better sequels which came after it. I give this movie a 7/10."

It's ambitious in scope and a space opera at its heart. The one thing people agree about, that it's slow. I felt the filmmakers wanted to create something more cerebral and thought provoking. Time has been very kind to this film and I honestly felt I've missed what is a slow, but rewarding film. It wasn't the Wrath of Khan but that's what makes Wrath of Khan so good. This laid the foundation for the return of the original cast and was tagged as boring. It's slow and it's the scope of the film that rewards. This deserved a revisit."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's one scene in Star Trek: The Motion Picture that is hard to watch. It involves Captain Kirk and the Enterprise Ship. What the two are doing is hard to explain but they seem to be romantically attached. It may sound incredible yet discomforting but believe it or not, it's what we see.\n\nTwo years after the Star Wars franchise kicked off with A New Hope in 1977, Star Trek decided, \"You know what? It's time for a motion picture.\" And like that, Star Trek: The Motion Picture was brought to screen and immediately discarded. Why? Because it was an insult to the series - yet it grossed a good amount at the box office.\n\nAnd so the motion picture begins with an astonishing discovery of an alien energy and the enterprise are called to seek it and do whatever to save its targets. The story, yes, is very simplistic and could have easily been a rejected idea for the canceled series. It never takes off, only somehow is replaced by cheesy lines and bad acting. William Shatner would later put on a better performance in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but for now he'd best not to act too much like a tree.\n\nStill if you're not upset by that, it's possible you're a trekkie: the film's dedicated audience. How come? I think you'll know once the Enterprise spaceship is introduced for a few dead minutes. Trekkies will cheer, non-trekkies won't. When Captain Kirk's introduced, trekkies will cheer, non-trekkies won't.\n\nWhat saves the film is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful soundtrack. Now that is the only thing that could rival Star Wars and appear proudly on your Ipod.\n\nTrekkie or not, Star Trek:The Motion Picture will most likely dishearten viewers. It doesn't take charge of itself at any moment, only acts as a pre-school student. Although the film's success would spawn a fascinating number of sequels, it's poorness would be the thing you'd like to not keep in mind."

The back-story of Captain Decker and Ilia are explained in a couple of cliched lines. There is hardly any real action in the story; most of the characters just look out the main viewer for long periods of time. However, there are some good aspects such as the sumptuous score by Jerry Goldsmith, a quite stunning looking cloud and alien ship entity, and an ending that although is not as deeply profound as `2001', is clever. I must recommend the Director's Cut DVD. It adds some special effects that the filmmakers literally ran out of time to create. More importantly, it subtly tweaks several scenes to give the movie a much better flow. Therefore, a 6/10 for the original movie version and a 7/10 for the new DVD."

NBC canceled it's most popular series with teenagers in the 1960's because they didn't know anything about target audiences in that era.\n\nWhen they chose Robert Wise to produce this he created tremendous special effects but all of them are over-produced & so long that they make the viewer bored & interrupt the plot flow of the movie. There are shots showing the Enterprise in the hangar waiting for launch & in the nebula later on which if they were shortened would improve the flow of the film. It is not surprising Wise would do this, as if you want another example of this watch The Hindenberg to see the same thing in too many blimps shots interrupting some excellent acting by George C Scott.\n\nOverall, this film sold tickets because the original cast was back, & the original series was so popular in re-runs, that this was a slam dunk for the box office."

        "review_detailed_main": "For Paramount to release this kind of movie at it's infamously methodical pace within 2 years of Star Wars taking over sci-fi, that's especially ballsy regardless of how you feel about this film.\n\n'Star Trek: TMP' is perhaps the most unique of all the Trek films to date. Its a smaller character driven story set against the backdrop of a visually arresting plot involving a gigantic craft concealed by gas slowly making its way towards Earth from parts unknown. The dust is brushed off the newly redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise for it to intercept this anomaly before it is close enough to pose an immediate danger. (At one point a crewman mentions its diameter as being over 82 AU's, making it far larger than our entire solar system). Newly minted Admiral James T. Kirk assumes command of his old vessel along with the rest of the returning crew from the original television series that had ended 10 years earlier. I really must stop the synopsis there as the slowly unraveling mystery is the part that really pulls you in. No one will ever call this the most exciting Trek movie of this or any era, but I found it to be one of the most thought provoking and is really the only entry in the series to deal in exploration, investigation and discovery like Shatner's immortal introduction lines of the series suggested. Some of the plot points can be a little convoluted and it may be a little too cryptic for its own good when it comes to general audiences, but it is, ultimately, a very rewarding experience and the famous Enterprise has never looked better."

Amid all the nerdy stuff, the movie is more of a philosophical look at humanity's place in the universe. V'Ger's communication attempts mirror HAL's discussions with humans in \"2001\". Even Spock - usually the guy who has a problem understanding emotions - proclaims \"Logic is not enough\".\n\nIt probably surprised people that Robert Wise (previously known as the director of \"West Side Story\" and \"The Sound of Music\") directed a movie that was sure to appeal to nerds. I, for one, imagine songs like \"I've Just Met a Girl Named Ilia\" and \"The Stars Are Alive with the Sound of V'Ger\". But Wise knew what he was doing here (he was wise to direct it, you might say).\n\nMy personal favorite of the the Star Trek movies is \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\", in which the Enterprise goes back in time to pick up some whales. But I also recommend this one. The franchise remains one of the most intellectual ones ever (the Star Wars franchise always seemed like it went more for high action). It's not a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it.\n\nAs for Nimoy and Bennett, there's no doubt that both of them lived long and prospered."

I don't watch any of the current series, for no other reason other than I'm not interested in doing so.\n\nBack to the movie, I loved it and still love it, but I'm not sure why other than I love that it collected all of the cast from the original show into one place at one time. The pacing of the move is a little slow, but I didn't even mind that. I guess, more than anything, is that this movie reminds me of a good time in my life. Like the characters were safe for me and when I watch it now, I recall that safety with fondness.\n\nI would recommend this to any SCI-FI fan, or anyone who had ever watched any of the older star trek shows, even in passing. The story kind of stands on its own. I didn't know, until I was reading that trivia for this film that originally, they were going to try and bring the series back but opted for a movie instead.

While nostalgic they were disappointed by its slow pace.\n\nWhen I first saw this as a kid it bored the hell out of me so I often dismissed this and went straight to Wrath of Khan. However I found there are some fans who argue the movie is underrated so I was interested to rewatch it. While I found more enjoyment out of it the second time round, I found it to have serious pacing issues.\n\nThe movie oddly enough starts with an overture which I found bizarre for a movie from this time. However, Jerry Goldsmith delivers a fantastic score which makes the slow moments slightly bearable.\n\nIt also likes to dwell and linger on special effects which I'm presuming was done to show the advancement in technology since the original show. While there's great model work and some impressive optical work it doesn't progress the story in an engaging way.\n\nI know some people would argue this isn't Star Wars so don't expect an exciting action packed movie, but even the episodes from the original show weren't sluggish to this extent.

A probe in deep space destroys some Klingon ships, the Enterprise is called, Kirk, now an Admiral, takes command of his old ship, the USS Enterprise, much to the chagrin of the current Captain, Decker. Kirk gets the old band together and they head off into deep space to investigate the probe.\n\nIt's something of a shame the pacing is so bad in places, because this movie does have things to say that are actually of some value regarding, in the words of Douglas Adams \"life, the universe and everything.\" The main story asks considerably deep questions about man's place in the universe, the responsibilities of sentience, and the emptiness of knowledge not applied. In Star Trek terms, the film increases the strength of the Klingon Empire, a thinly veiled reference to the then still on going Cold War between NATO and Russia.\n\nIt is also the first look we have at a more mature and developed dynamic between Kirk and Spock, as well as development of Scotty, Bones, Chekov, Uhura and Sulu's character arcs they will take in the film series. All of this is aided by a stellar turn from Stephen Collins as the ambiguously fated Decker, who superbly conveys his character's animosity towards Kirk (who's actions on more than one occasion border on reckless endangerment) taking over his ship and also his frustrated love story with the ostensibly beautiful (but here completely bald) Persis Khambatta as Ilia, who was taken from us far too early at the age of 49 in 1997.\n\nTo do this film justice, one must try and understand the context. The show had been off TV for over a decade. The rise of Lucas and Spielberg had seen special effects take a quantum leap. For fans of the original, this was their chance to be reunited with the characters they loved, and also see their story told with the improved effects that they deserved. The long scene with Kirk gazing at the Enterprise was there as much for fan service as to boost the running time. Here was a convincing big budget model shot of the USS Enterprise, in all of its glory. The interactions between the characters work and the film shows enough coherence and skill to prove that there was a big screen life for the Star Trek franchise. While the Star Trek films grew out of the original TV Series, they quickly developed a universe of their own that viewers, like myself, who were not overly familiar with the TV series could enjoy and understand within their own continuity.\n\nStar Trek the Motion Picture is slow, with dated effects now, but is still a worthwhile film, which asks questions of the viewer and one can see what a thrill it would have been for fans of the show at the time. Well worth watching and unquestionably a significant film."

It's way overlong and nothing much happens for much of that running time; the pacing is off, and there are way too many scenes of the actors just sitting around and watching computer effects taking place on a screen in front of them. It doesn't make for very dramatic cinema.\n\nI understand that the makers of this deliberately avoided making it an action-orientated movie in the wake of STAR WARS, but the storyline just isn't interesting enough to generate much suspense. Plenty of mystery is built up, but the denouement is a bit lacklustre and you end the film thinking 'is that it?'.\n\nStill, there is some entertainment value to be gained along the way, mainly from the performances of the returning cast members and seeing how they've changed since the original days of the show. There's Bill Shatner, wearing heavy make up and lording it over everyone in his usual arrogant way; there's Leonard Nimoy, incredibly aged in the decade or so since the small screen. Walter Koenig and George Takei haven't changed much, but DeForest Kelley must surely be ready for his zimmer frame soon, and portly James Doohan looks to have been enjoying life a little too much.\n\nIt's a pity none of them have much to work with, and much of the drama is given over to younger actors who fail to register very much. The dated special effects are fun and by rights it's hard to fault a piece of entertainment so deliberately thought-provoking and old-fashioned, but STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is hardly what you'd call a classic."

The fact is that doesn't stop it from being one of my top 20 movies of all time. The Special effects are incredible (especially for 1980), the music haunting and majestic (I own the soundtrack), the acting flawless, especially Stephen Collins (Decker), the plot extremely cerebral, intelligent, and well thought out, and a ending that blows one away. There were scenes in this movie that brought tears to my eyes (Kirks first head-on view of the enterprise, when you hear the revamped Star Trek theme in full concert) and made me cry the cry of the unbearably happy (the movie geek cry). In my opinion it is best watched in widescreen, as that shows you exactly how incredible this movie really is. And yet, it's almost painfully slow paced. It drags on and on and on. I think that's why some people disliked this movie. I admit it is really slow paced, but it is still, in my eyes, a great achievement in filmaking and a really good movie."

Obviously it's not all bad, the heart of the story is interesting and true to Star Trek the solution lay in exploration and investigation and not a show of power or combat. Truly the best thing about the movie is how it sparked renewed interest in Star Trek that led to better movies and new television shows and that continues to this day with terrific new content like Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Not a great movie on its own, but an exceptional legacy."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is almost as great as Kubrick's 2001 (which is the greatest film of all time). In some ways it even improves on the 1968 masterpiece: Star Trek: TMP offers a coherent plot alongside the deep hard science-fiction ideas, epic visuals and grand sense of awe-inspiring mystery. Space Odyssey still edges it due to the superlative camera work, massive timescale of the story, and haunting use of Ligeti's music.\n\nI've always been bemused by TMP's low ranking, even amongst Trek fans. This incredible flick isn't just one of the all-time great sci-fi movies, it's also a high-end yet faithful continuation of The Original Series. And I should know, as I've just watched all 80 of them over the last few months (see the List on my profile for rankings & comments). TMP is a fine cocktail of elements from The Changeling, Immunity Syndrome, Doomsday Machine, Corbomite Maneuver, Lights of Zetar...those 'mysterious powerful things from space' eps...here as a spectacular movie production. TMP is a TOS ep on steroids!\n\nThe characters are consistent with TOS too, the main trio each with a twist on their usual traits: Kirk is authoritative & tactical but he's out of Starship-practice, Spock is investigative & problem-solving yet hasn't seen his friends in a long time, McCoy is purposefully supportive & antagonistic (as usual, depending on situation) but is retired and had no real interest in returning.\n\nThe support-cast, famously underused in TOS, only get minimal chances to shine but do a fine job. Solid work from the two guest-characters, especially Ilia: some excellent subtle acting from Persis Khambatta (and incidentally from Shatner as well).\n\nA common criticism of TMP is its supposed slow pace, but I don't feel it. On the contrary it feels breathless once the Enterprise make first visual contact with V'Ger...less than an hour in, and doesn't let up until the end. But then I love the visual feasts of the alien vessel: the spectacle of how tiny the Enterprise appears while flying through it is the kind of EPIC moments I look for in movies. The imagination soars! There is the infamous 'ogling at the refitted Enterprise' scene which many folk say drags...but I wish it went on longer. It felt like a reward after 80 TOS eps with their modest original FX (note: not the CGI-Remastered TOS FX...which frankly are mediocre).\n\nI wish big-budget Star Trek made more imaginative stuff like this. Wrath of Khan seems to have an unwarranted reputation as the best: and this reputation somehow inspired most of the post-TOS crew movies to go with 'bad-guy-out-for-revenge' stories instead of actual science fiction.\n\nI recommend the Bluray-Theatrical version. The scenes left out by the Director's Edition are missed (e.g. A scene building up Spock's exploration of V'Ger is removed, making his decision-making less tentative and thus less interesting). The scenes added by the DE are a little 'on-the-nose' character-wise...not really necessary."

As a child I was a rabid fan of Next Generation, however this is my \"first contact\" with Star Trek in at least 7-8 years. Though this film certainly had some very good moments, I think you'd have to be a fan to truly enjoy it. The plot plods along at a snails pace, repeating itself and making me think the director wanted to cut as little as possible. Every scene went on much, much too long in my opinion, Id say the film could have been 45 minutes shorter and still just as good. With a few exceptions, the actors were awful. Every stereotype about Shatner is completely true, and I found myself in hysterics after some of his totally monotone delivery. His \"acting\" aside, his character just plain wasn't likable. From the first few minutes it convinces you not to like him as he acts like a total jerk, for lack of a better term. There was one good character though whom I wish would have been used more: Dr \"Bones\" McCoy. His dry and sarcastic attitude was hilarious and a breath of fresh air amongst a cast that takes themselves far to seriously. One thing that it did have going for it were the effects. As much as I disliked this film, I cant think of a single bad thing to say about the effects; they were phenomenal! Too bad it didn't have much else going for it...\n\nOverall, if you're not a big \"trekkie\", Id avoid this like the plague. If you are a \"trekkie\"...I suppose you must not like this review much, eh?\n\n4/10"

Having already seen all 10 films, I know which are going to be like pulling teeth to get through. And speaking of which, watching 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is like visiting the dentist without any Novocain. A (literally) star trek in the opening (still not sure what the screen saver was all about prior to the credits rolling) followed by 45 minutes until the Enterprise actually leaves space dock, the movie is so incredibly slow. However, I can see why. Fans of the original TV series never got to see their favorite characters/Enterprise on the big screen, so why not take half the movie showing off the icons on the big screen. And that was the impression I got: this movie was made specifically to see the 60s show on the large screen. The film involves an extremely thin plot: (newly) Admiral James T Kirk has been vacant from the Enterprise's bridge and desperately wants back on (I guess shadowing the same desires of the real-life William Shatner and the spotlight, instead of the Enterprise.) With an \"enemy\" heading to \"destroy\" Earth, mankind's only hope results in the familiar crew who must solve the mystery along the way. Extremely little depth (aside from Kirk) is given to all the characters, so if you're not familiar with the original series, you're given nothing to go on, pending this was your first experience. And that's one of the film's biggest flaws; when you're trying to introduce a new audience to a potential franchise of films, you absolutely need to reintroduce the main characters. Sad, with over two-hours (when it should've been less than the normal 1-hour episode) they failed on that very simple rule."

        "review_detailed_main": "Since this film was released so long ago there would be no point in repeating the enormous amount of information that has been written thus far. But for the purposes of \"newbies\" just entering the Star Trek Legacy, rather than review this film, if you have no prior experience with the Star Trek Universe, or are experienced, here is a brief primer for your enjoyment.\n\nSTAR TREK THE TV SERIES Star Trek was originally a TV series which takes place in the 23rd century. Each hour long episode revolves around the crew of the galactic starship, the USS Enterprise, as it goes through its daring missions in space. As a teenager I initially had doubts about the series, even though my mother (God Bless her SyFy Soul) absolutely loved it and would schedule her day in order to insure she wouldn't miss an episode. (For those of Generation X and later, this was 1966, many years before the introduction of technology that would allow home audiences the sublime luxury of Internet, cable, or streaming entertainment into their homes to view at their leisure. If you weren't glued to your TV at the time your show aired, you'd missed it). Many more years would pass before TV series would become syndicated and terms like \"Re-runs\" would be introduced into our evolving vernacular. In any event, the first Star Trek TV episode aired September 8, 1966 and lasted 3 seasons. The final episode aired June 3, 1969.\n\nThe series was the ultimate \"Love Child\" of its enigmatic creator, Eugene Wesley Roddenberry (better known as \"Gene\"). Gene had a very tight budget to work with for this series, and compared to, say, \"Raised By Wolves,\" Star Trek was very basic when it came to special effects, scenery, etc. Season 1 cost $190,000 per episode, Season 2, $185,000 per episode, and the final Season, 3, $175,000 per episode. In today's world (2022) those meager budgets wouldn't even cover the cost of \"end credits.\"\n\nThe ST characters, nevertheless, were as carefully defined and memorable as the iconic characters in the classic 1939 film, \"The Wizard of Oz.\" But instead of Dorothy, The Tin Man, The Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion, the Star Trek televised series featured a \"John F. Kennedy handsome\" Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), a half- human/half-Vulcan science officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy), the ship's sarcastic physician Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForrest Kelly), the indefatigable engineer, Scotty (James Dothan), the \"Davy Jones of the music group The Monkees look-alike\" Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), the frequently at the helm Lieutenant Commander Sulu (George Takei) and the witty and beautiful Communications Officer Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).\n\nRoddenberry's 79 TV episodes and 3 seasons, regardless of their popularity with television audiences, experienced frequent network and sponsor interference. Often entire scripts were severely edited or censored, including wholesale censorship of scripts and film footage. This constant \"tampering\" was ultimately the series' demise.\n\nSTAR TREK THE FILM The first ST film was based on an adaptation of \"In Thy Image,\" a 1977 pilot script for the aborted \"ST Phase Two series.\" It was written by Harold Livingston, based on a story treatment by SyFy author Alan Dean Foster, who based his work on a story idea by Gene Roddenberry entitled, \"Robot's Return.\" This eventually came to be called \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\" On a budget of approximately $44,000,000.00, the film grossed worldwide around $88,000,000.00 (see trivia below).\n\nAs of this writing (2022) there are 13 Star Trek films, with a 14th film still in discussions. Most of the original ST crew return in various capacities throughout the motion picture series, although William Shatner's Captain James T. Kirk was eventually phased out with two (that's right) heart breaking death scenes. His last words on camera were an ironic, \"Oh my.\" Patrick Stewart successfully replaced Shatner as Captain Jean-Luc Picard.\n\nNo spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that Paramount arbitrarily set an original budget of $8 million for this film. Gene Roddenberry knew that audiences in 1979 would be anticipating a wave of special effects, especially after the successful theatrical releases of \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\" (1977) and \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" (1979). But like a tenacious bulldog, Roddenberry persuaded Paramount to \"dig deeply\" and eventually obtained a more reasonable working budget of $44,000.000.00."

We understand that technology has improved in the 10 years since The Original Series ended, but most of the drawn-out scenes felt like a giant pat on their own back.\n\nWhile the visuals have improved and the movie feels much bigger than anything preceding it, I would take nearly every episode of TOS over this movie (okay, maybe not Spock's Brain). The characters feel off, the plot pointless and nothing memorable happens in this movie.\n\nBest Character: Decker Best Scene: Understanding V'GER Best Quote: \"Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

Before getting into the movie too much, a ground work based on the various Star Trek series and movies must be established so that this film can be discussed within that context.\n\nThe original Star Trek series had a very 1960's look to it. The characters were 1960's characters and the feel of the show was very similar to other 1960's shows. Compare the original Star Trek series with the Next Generation and it is quite clear. Captain Kirk exhibits confidence, decisiveness and always maintains control of his ship and his crew. The captain on the Next Generation and other series is very understanding with everybody, non-confrontational and tries to portray a very complex character. Two different captains for two different era's.\n\nFor the most part, the episodes in the original Star Trek series were self contained, and one didn't need to see the previous episodes to enjoy a particular one. Starting with Star Trek the Next Generation, the series seemed as if it was being made only for hard core Star Trek fans, who never miss an episode, by putting all kinds of stupid technical talk and a kind of soap opera theme to the show.\n\nSomething similar can be said for Star Trek the Motion picture when compared to the movies that followed it. One cannot watch Star Trek 3 and fully know what is going on without having seen the Wrath of Khan. Or how confused were some of the \"non Star Trek fans\", who never saw the second or third films when they went to the movie theater to see Star Trek 4. References to Spocks death and why the crew was not in the Enterprise must have been confusing. Star Trek 5 and 6 are self contained, but there are still a few references to events in the previous films in them. The other problem with the Star Trek movies was the continual, ongoing conflict with Klingons. Films 3, 4, 5 and 6 involved Klingons (4 to a lesser extent). And the Klingons got badder and meaner with each film that it eventually became kind of ridiculous. Star Trek kind of ceased to be science fiction and became just some other action movie taking place in outer space. The actors also seemed to overdue their characters as time went on. And by the time Star Trek 6 came along, a good amount of the dialog seemed as if it was all part of some inside joke.\n\nStar Trek the Motion picture avoided all of these problems because it was the first movie and because of when it was made. Star Trek the Motion picture is a true science fiction story, it's not another battle between Kirk and the Klingons. It is simply a story independent of any other Star Trek story. Indeed, it is placed within the framework of Star Trek (the characters, the Enterprise, the 24th century), but it is completely independent. The actors play their roles much more seriously and realistically than in later movies. There are a few jokes, but the seriousness of the mission is always looming over the movie. Nobody is cracking jokes or one liners as they are presented with the prospect of Earths destruction.\n\nKirk seems almost as youthful as he did in the original series (in the Wrath of Khan he seemed to have aged a lot). William Shatners hair was not permed yet, it looked like it did in the 1960's.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the movie though is the art direction. The sets, the ships and the lighting are all very good. Too many science fiction movies today make the future look like it will be filthy, unsanitary, very gloomy, very depressing. Movie sets are usually overdone with all kinds of black stains everywhere, junk lying around, ooze running down walls. Very gritty and grimy. And the people are always sweaty. But, in the 1950's through the end of the 1970's, the vision of the future was always clean, shiny, comfortable. This futuristic vision kind of manifested itself in Disneylands Tommorowland. This version of the future was dominant in Star Trek the Motion Picture's art direction. There were not very many big budget science fiction films which were made that had this particular look to them. Star Trek the Motion Picture did it on a big budget, and it looks very good.\n\nAs important as the sets and spaceship models themselves was the lighting. Star Trek the Motion picture complimented its clean, futuristic looking sets with a kind of dark lighting while still using some color (mostly blues). America's space program at the time when this film was made must have had some influence on this. Images of dark mission control and radar rooms as well as dark space capsules redefined the futuristic look. Because of this, the purple and green lights (which were partly used to give some excitement to the spartan sets) of the original Star Trek series were gone. However, just enough color was used so that the stale look of contemporary science fiction movies was fortunately missing. The outside of the enterprise seems to not be a bland gray, but rather it has a slight yellowish-brown hue to it, as does the inside of the enterprise. Other parts of the ship have a nice pale green or blue tint to them.\n\nAll in all, this was a good movie, unfortunately slow at times, but still an interesting storyline to follow. From the sets, to the lighting and the special effects, this was probably the pinnacle of 1960's-1970's science fiction. And it was good to see this type of science fiction film finally produced with such a big budget and such professionalism. It was probably the last and greatest movie of its kind."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was in a theater.\n\nThe senior, senior trekker speaks\n\nI was in a theater that had not one empty seat.\n\nI was in a theater filled with people that gave this film a standing ovation at the end.\n\nI had just watched a movie based upon my favorite show, ever. So had everybody else that was in the theater on that day.\n\nI wasn't watching this film to complain about changes in the uniforms, I was in the theater that day to become engulfed in the Star Trek universe.\n\nThree Klingon D7 battle cruisers are fighting an incomprehensible cloud. From a distance, they appear very much like the Klingon battle cruisers that we saw in the original series.\n\nBut as the camera zoomed in on the lead cruiser, we could see details on the hull that we had never seen before.\n\nAnd then the big reveal as Mark Leonard (aka Sarek) played the captain on the lead battle cruiser. Klingons appeared in such a way as we had never seen them before. Their spines grew over their skulls. At that time they did not have brow ridges, just a section of spine growing into their foreheads.\n\nAnd everybody was sitting with their mouths dropped. We didn't know that this was a change that would eventually be explained in two episodes of Star Trek Enterprise. Nobody talked about it, nobody said anything.\n\nA lone federation outpost watches the events... and they track the course of the cloud.\n\nAnd then we finally got to see the main Starfleet base in San Francisco, as Kirk converses with a non-Spock Vulcan.\n\nAnd then suddenly, Kirk is transported up to space station Regula one, only, it was upside down at the time. And then we see Scotty for the first time since 1968.\n\nThey made the reveal of the USS enterprise a big deal, it had just been refit completely. Showing the shuttles approach, we got to see every angle of this new version of the enterprise.\n\nAnd Matt Decker's son from The Doomsday Machine was the captain.\n\nNo more jellybeans as buttons on the library Access computer station. The warp core in engineering appeared to go on endlessly, as did the conduits feeding into the warp nacelles.\n\nMeanwhile, Spock is over on Vulcan performing some pure logic ceremony, we had never seen images of Vulcan in this way.\n\nDespite the problems with the making of this film, they gave us something that started off a 20 year adventure. I had heard they did not even have a story or script before they started filming scenes. In fact they had different sets that were actually designed for a new TV show that never got made, which was known as \"phase 2\". Not the same as the fan film production of the same name.\n\nYou would not have known any of this... the story, bulky as it was, moved along seamlessly.\n\nA story that brought us into a mysterious cloud that showed us stranger and stranger imagery the deeper in they got.\n\nAnd even with the enterprise new refit, they were no match for this thing.\n\nBack in 1979 there were no social websites for everybody to jump onto and then immediately start pounding out one star reviews.\n\nThe reaction was very positive, despite some of the issues.\n\nBack then, we were reacting to the immense amount of work that had gone in to making this film happen. And most of the people in that theater had just seen Star Wars two years earlier.\n\nSo for the film at that time to get the reaction that it did get it, was amazing. Because it was, of course, being compared to the trench run scene from Star Wars.\n\nThis film was literally one of the last very big Hollywood releases ever made. Directed by Robert Wise, one of the most acclaimed directors of Hollywood. Films started changing drastically after 1980.\n\n44 years later there are documentaries we can watch that explain the struggle between Robert Wise and Gene Roddenberry... Gene would literally rewrite scenes after they had been filmed. The amazing thing about this film was that it got made on time and was released in the theater. And that was all Robert's doing.\n\nI have just watched the latest 4K release of this movie, Robert Wise directors cut, which is a little bit different than the HD version released a few years ago... it has a few more added scenes, and some scenes are shown from a different angle or they have more detail.\n\nOn the whole, this film is still an amazing experience for me. I have enjoyed it today as I did on December 8, 1979.\n\nAnd if we look close, we will see special effects that were worked into Star Trek the next generation, and also set pieces, hallways, gadgets. For 30 years, they saved every minor prop. And then, suddenly, they sold all of it to the world's richest billionaires.\n\nThis film is literally the beginning of a franchise and story that is now coming to a peak with the final episode of Star Trek Picard.\n\nThis film also represents a very short period for Starfleet, uniform designs changed drastically. The fan series \"Star Trek continues\" reveals how these buckled uniforms came to be, and also Kirk's promotion to Admiral.\n\nBetween 1979 and 2023 the reaction to this film has become jaded. Because people watch this film now not as what it was, not as a representation of the time when it was made. But in comparison to everything else from 2023. Which is the wrong reason to watch it. This film is movie history, people these days, refrain from giving it the proper respect that it had earned when it was released in the theaters. And despite what IMDb says today, in 1979 it was rated much higher.\n\nI am switching this review back to no spoilers, because I really didn't give away any plot points."

The movie in large parts is based on the old team reuniting and the minutes-long scene where Kirk arrives at the Enterprise in orbit, would only be fully appreciated by those who can share Kirk's loving eyes.\n\nThe story is what surprised me the most. It's a rather clever one with a nifty ending. You are fed new information at the exact right pace to keep you learning but still wondering. And for a movie that is almost totally action-free and has no larger focus on the love story on board, it must be said that it keeps you captured intellectually (and maybe somewhat visually).\n\nI think it is Star Trek at its best. You really get join the crew in their exploration of the unknown. To be entertained without violence, love or comedy, is today a rare commodity."

The movie excels in capturing the essence of space exploration, showcasing stunning depictions of the USS Enterprise and the vastness of space.

The plot, centered around a mysterious alien entity, has its intriguing moments but sometimes feels overly drawn out and lacks the tight narrative structure of later Star Trek films.\n\nOverall, *Star Trek: The Motion Picture* is a nostalgic and visually striking film that will appeal to dedicated fans of the franchise, but its slow pace and somewhat convoluted plot may leave casual viewers wanting more excitement and coherence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by saying that I never watched any episode of Star Trek before I saw this. Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek: Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan.\n\nNow granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version).\n\nI think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek: The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, \"Logic is never alone\", implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment.\n\nSo as a whole, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek.\n\nOn the other hand, I still love Star Wars better.\n\n8/10."

I did like The Wrath of Kahn, and saw the one about the whales (ok, but not great).\n\nToday, I found ST:TMP on a cable channel, and started watching it about 1/2 hour into it (Spock just got there). So I missed the \"reunion\" part.\n\nBut it took very little time to see this as a rehash of \"The Changeling,\" and I was really surprised when I saw that not one of the 113 user comments in this database mentioned that episode from the 1966 series.\n\nAlas, the rehash stretched the hour-long episode into a 2-hour+ long movie, not by introducing any interesting sub-plots or emotional conflict or even a little touch of humor, but only by stretching fuzzy exterior effects scenes beyond where no yawn has gone before.\n\nAt least the re-write didn't reuse the over-worked ending that befell Nomad - logicked to death.\n\nI am glad that it was enjoyed by enough people to revive interest in Star Trek and introduce it to new generations (of the 20th century kind)."

Small moments like Spock in Sickbay calling his captain 'Jim' are a reminder of how much was lost on the big screen, most of the main actors somewhat awkwardly repeating their roles with little differentiation (for once, Kirk comes off as incredibly unlikable). Two new characters do stand out, in particular Persis Khambatta, whose shaved head as Deltan Lt. Ilia was strikingly beautiful, and Stephen Collins, whose Commander Will Decker was intended to be the son of William Windom's Commodore Matt Decker from \"The Doomsday Machine\" but went unmentioned on screen. If a second feature film would be made, it needed to be done on a budget under this film's massive $45 million price tag (the worldwide box office was $139 million), the old cast deserving of better material."

This review is to inform you of which version to see.\n\nThere are 3 versions: the 1979 theatrical release (132 min), the 1983 VHS edition (143 min) and the 2001 director's cut (136 min). If at all possible, find yourself a copy of the 1983 VHS (143 min). It features 11 scenes missing from both the theatrical release AND the director's cut. At least 6 of these 11 scenes are very important to the movie. I have no idea why they were chopped.\n\nIn a movie where dialogue is already sparse, they decided to chop out a lot of key script. Sulu's humorous flirtations with Ilia are gone. McCoy's irate criticism of Kirk is gone. Decker's philosophical commentary on god is gone. Ilia's slow transformation to \"human\" is gone. Why couldn't they leave it the way had it in '83?\n\nBut the worst travesty is the added CGI special effects. WHY OH GOD WHY do directors think these classic scifi movies need CGI facelifts? Just like plastic surgery, CGI is fake, artificial, dead. It kills all character and leaves us with a lifeless lump (are you listening, Michael Jackson?) I'll say this much: The Star Trek CGI crap is no where as bad as George Lucas's laughably incongruous mess he did with Star Wars. But it's still distracting. In particular, a fantastic scene (walking on the saucer) was chopped out of this movie and replaced with a very video-gamey shot from a distance. We no longer see the 5 crewmembers emerging with their shadows stretched before them. Instead we see what looks like 5 little specks in the middle of a cartoon with stupid lightning flashes that I could've drawn better with my left foot.\n\nYeah, I admit this review is very harsh. Like I said, most people will hardly notice the points I'm talking about. But if you're a total Trek nerd, I'm sure you catch my drift (btw, don't even get me started on \"Star Trek 2.0\" where they're mercilessly redoing the old TV series with flashy new computer effects. Hailing frequencies are CLOSED).\n\nNow get on Ebay and find yourself a copy of the 1983 VHS. Unfortunately I don't think it's available in widescreen, which pisses me off. Maybe in the years to come, they'll reissue yet another version which gets it all. Good luck."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" is clearly the biggest-budget Star Trek Movie to date, with its detailed special effects, expansive sets and occasional crowds of extras. Unfortunately, all that money seems wasted on a story that's kind of a snoozer.\n\nThat's right, as you've no doubt often heard, this movie is \"slow.\" However, I must confess that \"slow\" is an imprecise criticism. What does it really mean? After all, Sergio Leone movies are slow, and people love them...\n\nWhen people call the Motion Picture \"slow,\" what they really mean is that they don't care about the plot. V'ger - a big blue cloud - is a very surreal and not too engaging enemy. And its search for self-actualization is kind of interesting, in a psychology textbook sort of way, but it's not emotionally involving. Paradoxically enough, this film about \"human\" adventure is so sterile and cerebral (in the pompous sense of the word) that it's ultimately alienating.\n\nThe other big problem is that the regular cast members are poorly characterized. Kirk is like a bossy brat, trying to wrest control of the Enterprise from Decker - who is himself a truly bland personality, distracting from all the characters we know and like better. And Spock's all wrong, too. He's basically 100% Vulcan in this movie, cold and distant, no longer game for verbal sparring with McCoy or buddying around with Kirk. In fact, the three-way Kirk-Spock-McCoy dynamic that makes Star Trek tick is basically absent here.\n\nI'll admit that the Director's Edition DVD improves the film, if only by providing better sound quality and a few new effects shots. That's why I upped my IMDb rating to a 5/10. But even on DVD, all polished up and spit-shined and simonized, this is still kind of a boring movie. Not \"slow,\" necessarily - just sort of preachy and bad! Imagine how disappointing it must have been in 1979, for the fans who'd been waiting for it for years..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even though a lot of the Star Trek fans prefer 'Wrath of Khan', the second feature film with the original crew, my favorite's gotta be 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. And I prefer even more the director's cut that unbelievably never got a bluray transfer since, so it seems, the effects never got rendered in HD (how in the hell...). Star Trek I is a slower movie that privileges the journey/discovery and the intellectual aspect of space exploration rather than immediate action. This makes it an all time favorite scifi film to me and a great movie full of spirit! Other points that make this an outstanding Star Trek film: 1st - 'To boldly go where no Man has gone before'. How many Star Trek films explore the Unknown and stick with this motto? Well, basically 2 perhaps. The 1st and the 5th, the rest mostly deal with Kirk's enemies, or Spock or going back to Earth. This is important to me, to see a starship, discovering something new, and the first Star Trek deals with it. 2nd - The special effects. No Star Trek movie has ever had the incredible effects of the 1st movie. The aura and clouds surrounding V'ger, the huge V'ger complex, the machine World, etc... and even more if we're talking about the Director's edition. 3rd - The music score, faithful to the original series thus truly Epic, spacey and atmospheric when it comes to V'ger's World. Plus, the director's cut features several minutes of great introductory music with space in the background. 4th- The characters. Bit more 'mysterious' than in the original series, slightly colder let's say. 5th- The relationship between Kirk and The Enterprise. This is superbly written and directed. He's outdated, the ship is new. Still he needs to possess her no matter what. This defines Kirk as the ultimate captain, a man that doesn't give up, ever. ' I don't like to lose' as he said on Wrath."

Harlan Ellison called it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture, and he was right on target. (Bear in mind I am talking about the theatrical release--haven't seen any other versions). It starts off on the wrong foot with this somber music over the titles. Then the first scene, with a Big Space Thing attacking a space station. The actress in this scene, who mercifully does not appear again, gives one of the worst line readings ever. Later we see Kirk flying around the new Enterprise. He looks at every square inch of it for what seems like hours. (I am told the studio insisted on getting in as many shots as possible of their expensive new set.) Kirk replaces Stephen Collins as captain, which is a good move--Shatner is not exactly stretching himself in this role, but Collins is severely charisma-challenged. Tho he is a better actor than Persis Khambatta who is bald and beautiful and nothing else. The Big Space Thing finally arrives, and the camera flies over it at tricycle speed while the crew Stares In Awe. Somewhere along the line, the producers and writers lost touch with a simple truth. The TV show was so much fun because it had real villains--you know, nasty folks with attitudes and zap guns, who spoke lines of threatening dialogue instead of hovering menacingly. If this film has arrived in theatres without the legend of the show and the years of fan-mania, it wouldn't have lasted two weekends. We should all thank our lucky stars that Star Trek II had all the humor and action that made the TV show a classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "After screening this effort, you'll need to apply an entire box of Bland-aids.\n\nThis film doesn't come anywhere near warp speed. In fact it should be studied by all editors and directors, since every other shot in the opening 45 minutes is a \"cutaway\": Show a wide shot of the ship, cut away to Kirk looking lustful. Back to the long shot of the ship, back to Scotty looking fatherly. Back to the wide shot...you get the idea. Now...tighten that puppy up a bit and you're cookin'. Problem is, the resulting movie would only be 45 minutes long, and the suits in the Gulf + Western tower would have started throwing the furniture about.\n\nThis is doubly ironic, as director Robert Wise started as an editor. His most famous edit-room effort was a little art-house film you may have heard of called \"Citizen Kane\"!\n\nSaavy Star Trekkers will know that one should skip the odd-numbered films in this series; the even-numbered ones were the best of the litter -- it's logical. This prime-numbered edition features bland hunk Stephen Collins sporting a Dick Tracy two-way wrist radio, Phersis Khambatta as the bald chick (long before the grunge look was pop), and the rest of the lethargic crew mailing in their performances. They hadn't worked as a troupe for years and it shows. Some of the \"Rocky Jones\" serials from the 50s have more action. The biggest waste of genuine talent is Marc Lenard (Spock's father in later editions), hidden under 50 lbs of Klingon makeup, and with all of one good line: \"REEESH!\"\n\nThis movie suffers from $10 million worth of stunning special effects (produced at genuine warp speed to meet an insane deadline by Douglas Trumbull of \"2001\" and \"Bladerunner\" fame, after the original effects house was photon-torpedoed), mated to a $10 script, essentially a warmed-over version of one of the TV episodes.\n\nThe movie also features the most screamingly funny unintentional gag in the entire series, Decker and Checkov yelling at each other in slow motion as they go through a \"worm hole\" -- \"Noooooooo......beeeeelllllaaaaayyy tttthhhhhhaaaaattt ppphhhaaassseeerrr oooorrrrddeeerrr!\" The only moment more painful has to be Kirk, Spock and McCoy singing \"Row your boat\" in ST5...but that was many films and light-years into the future. Worth seeing if only for background, but far inferior to the \"multiples of 2\"-numbered films that followed."

        "review_detailed_main": "With this movie being the very first Star Trek film of my reviewing career, I'd like to start off with the positives it has.\n\nFor a film of the 1980s, especially next to that of the original Star Wars trilogy, the special effects that it had were impressive. Whoever was in charge of them was literally able to make the movie seem like it was being filmed in outer space, and the misty cloud and giant machine seemed so real, one can't help but feel like they're actually witnessing them, and inside of them.\n\nThe musical score by Jerry Goldsmith was also something that I found to be groundbreaking. It may not be able to compete with John Williams's work in the original Star Wars trilogy, but it does come strongly close thanks to having a lot of emotional resonance.\n\nIn spite of these positives, however, the film as a whole...proved to largely be a waste of time.\n\nMuch of the blame for it all especially goes to the direction by Robert Wise, the story by Alan Dean Foster, and the screenplay by Harold Livingston. Considering that producer Gene Roddenberry also contributed to the script, I'd say that he's to blame as well.\n\nThe problem with the film was that it was excruciatingly slow. In many points, it focused so much on certain details, much longer than required, that you can't help but wonder when things will be moving on. A prime example is from the moment where Kirk was seeing the Starship Enterprise after so long from a small vehicle he was riding in. It also felt sluggish because it had little to no action, and despite the mystery the crew was trying to solve regarding what they were up against, there was little to no intrigue either.\n\nOne part I can't help but particularly call out is the part where the Enterprise is stuck in the wormhole. It was not only sluggish, but painfully disorienting because of the speed of the character voices and the light that was surrounding everyone.\n\nThe film's antagonist certainly didn't do the film any favors either, that's for sure. The villain as a whole being a machine largely lacked the memorability of the franchise's previous antagonists, even ones who were also machines. Its quest on \"searching for its creator\" seemed to be more ridiculous than intriguing, and that's not even considering the fact that it felt like it was making fun of humanity's need for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nThe acting from the film's ensemble was okay at the most. However, despite the film being able to retain the original cast and characters from the show, and having some impressive new characters and cast members, every performer featured seemed rather bored with the material they were given. They just didn't seem to be putting as much energy and commitment into their performances, and they seemed to be wanting to be somewhere else more than anything. Even though Kirk was obviously having development of character and conflict throughout, one can't help but even go on to wonder what purpose and use it would serve.\n\nThe only element of the cast and characters that was able to keep things interesting was Leonard Nimoy and the character of Spock. Just like in the original TV show, Nimoy was able to make any moment he was given count and be notable, and even amongst the film's special effects, Spock's presence is so grappling one could hardly want to look away.\n\nIn conclusion, the film's special effects, Goldsmith's music, and the presence of Nimoy were definitely great, but the film as a whole was a lot more dull than fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "The only way to watch and enjoy this movie is to first watch the episodes of the entire Original Series immediately before watching this movie, along with the production backstory featurettes. You must understand the era that the franchise was born out of, and what people had grown accustomed to, which was a decade, literally, of The Original Series re-runs as the only Star Trek franchise available to be seen anywhere, not including the Animated Series. You must fall in love with the Enterprise, which is the star of the show, and with the characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. And most importantly you must appreciate that ten years is a very long time in fandom time to wait for anything to be made of the franchise. What you see here in this movie is love, absolute unadulterated love, of the Enterprise, now having been revamped and updated. You must picture yourself being there as Spock walks onto the bridge and everyone in the theater is so tickled to see that old friend waltz right in amongst his friends. And you must genuinely empathize with Spock's backstory to understand and feel his anguish has he fights the emotions of love he feels for his friends. You must also watch this movie appreciating that the majority of the Star Trek episodes consisted of ridiculous god-like superpowers imposing themselves upon the Enterprise or else upon entire planets and solar systems, and the studios just didn't have the technology nor the money to properly demonstrate it, but now, finally, they do. You must imagine how it must have felt to be in the production executive staff, now having technology and money to be unleashed to pour out over the love and attention to every little thing they really wanted to portray that they couldn't with their tiny budget series. The whole sequence (or two) of just ogling over the Enterprise with the wonderful symphonic orchestra is intended to be a delightful ceremony of infatuation. If you can't build yourself up to love and appreciate what this family of producers were creating, you'll hate this movie. Otherwise, you'll cherish this movie as one of your favorites."

However, both these things are lacking in ST:TMP. One quickly gets the sense that most scenes drag on for so long for no other reason than to show off then state-of-the-art special effects. And while the special effects are lightyears ahead of the original series, viewers expect to watch a Star Trek movie and not what essentially amounts to a technical demo. Another small nitpick is the horribly atrocious uniforms literally everybody wears in this movie. Ugly unisex white or grey polyester looks ridiculous and manages to make the cheesey 60s uniforms look like designer workwear."

Took me a while to catch up with trekkies' most illogical thinking.\n\nSo, it's a little bit thin on the drama side, the dynamics between the characters aren't developed very much. Also the amount of scientific babble is a little bit low. But then again: this is the first time that Star Trek was brought on the big screen. And that meant an opportunity to make it more visual, something that wasn't possible for the tv show. See, guys? It's not Star Trek the long episode - it's the motion picture!\n\nI really like the visual effects. It has a \"vintage computer graphics\" kind of weird style but that only makes it more special, somehow more alien. The 70's vision of \"futuristic\" is something that doesn't exist anymore here in the 2010's future. When Enterprise dives into the mysterious cloud that hides a secret it creates an awe-inspiring feel of adventure. That's the main attraction. The story itself is good, yet a bit simple. But they manage to get the most out of it because the visual side gets imagination running wild.\n\nCalling this movie bad is being too harsh I think. It's a pretty good sci-fi space adventure and no less. Watch it on a screen as big as possible, with best possible dvd/blue-ray version you can find and good sound system. I really wish I came across a chance to see it in a movie theater sometime."

There were a fair number of well-done scenes. Even the somewhat over-long inspection of the new ship had a nice feel to it. It had a lot going for it.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't a television episode, it was a feature-length movie, and there just wasn't enough material for an entire movie. In place of material that added something, it was stretched out by filler. Some of the filler was competent special effects, but it was still filler. Worse, a lot of the filler didn't even have the special effects thrill to it. Some of the acting was wooden, some of the directing was shaky (particularly for a talent like Wise), and a lot of the script was dull or even stupid.\n\nStretching the campiness of the original television show (the world is going to end, and only the Enterprise can save it) to feature length just didn't work this way. What could have made this one better? Shorten it to the point where it's fast-paced. Find another of the over-long movies and trim it until it moves too. Then show the pair as a pair.\n\nIt's not really bad science fiction, or even bad Star Trek. But compared to the expectations it was produced to fulfill, it was a real failure."

It is about human interaction and the question is what would you do in the situation.\n\nThis movie makes a good basis for films to come.

Both films are far more clever than they're given credit for, but whereas Last Action Hero requires a knowledge of Action Movie tropes to fully appreciate, Star Trek TMP doesn't require a love of Star Trek. It is one of the most visually and audibly impressive sci-fi films ever made. It has a great plot, fantastic music, mind blowing special effects and cinematography, and scope. It in no way tries to imitate the space action of Star Wars, which released only a couple of years prior, instead opting for something more akin to 2001 or Close Encounters. It also has a budget more than three times larger than Star Wars, which really shows (not that Star Wars looks bad in anyway at all, just that it has overshadowed Star Trek, which I think is a shame).\n\nThis is a fantastic movie. It's been a long time since I've seen the other Star Trek films, and I'll need a rewatch before I can say so definitively, but off the top of my head I'd say this is the best Star Trek film, and arguably the most underrated movie of all time. Don't dismiss it, unless you're the type who prefers typical space action and generic good vs evil plots, a la Star Wars. If that's the case, you'll probably find it dull. You'd be wrong, though..."

        "review_detailed_main": "In late fall of 1979, I saw this long awaited epic with the intense anxiety of a kindergartner waiting for Christmas. I was so hyped about the possibility of seeing a film that was going to do for the television show, \"Star Trek,\" what \"Star Wars\" did for the entire genre two years previous. I even got to see it on opening weekend, thrilled to pieces.\n\nThe opening credit sequence seemed long. I mean, it seemed REALLY long. I sat there wondering if I needed to go back to the theatre concessionary for more soda or something because the music had been playing since before I sat and the lights dimmed. Oh, the music was magnificent, no mistake, but I hadn't been so perplexed by pretentiously long opening titles since \"Superman\" the year before.\n\nThe sequence with the Klingons was remarkable, and the opening sequence was really exciting. But it rapidly became a film of Roddenberry's greatest hits. Spock on Vulcan wrestling with his human identity, Kirk back on Earth longing for command, Bones ranting about being a doctor and not something else, and so on and so on. And if that was not distracting enough, the cameos were somewhat artificial and interrupting. (\"Look! Over there! Isn't that Grace Lee Whitney? Isn't that Koenig?\") I can almost hear Robert Wise saying, \"Let's let the camera linger on Majel a few seconds longer for the fans.\"\n\nBut who cares about cheese when you're getting to watch the Enterprise on the big screen? Well, after watching scenes that had the sole purpose in life of wasting time and slowing the pacing of the movie, *I* did. Even as a 14 year old, I could tell this film was really missing something. I learned later that it was more what the film was *not* missing that was wrong with it.\n\nWhen I was older, a fellow geek referred to this film grimly as \"Star Drek: The Motion Sickness\" and he nailed the film's problems in that epitaph. The five minute trip around the Enterprise (timed to this swelling and poignant score by Goldsmith) and the interminable journey through the Cloud gave me nausea precisely opposite to the way that *fast* rides do. It was so *slow* a ride that I felt really sick by the time Spock was trying to mind-meld with V'Ger. By the end of the film, I was really feeling my popcorn start to rise.\n\nWatch George Takei as he steers the ship through the Cloud. Sulu looks like he's watching a porn film, complete with Orion slave girls and Andorians, up there on the viewing screen. It's really both funny and surreal to realize you, the audience, are watching someone who is watching something and he looks like it's amazing when, after the first five minutes, the suspension of disbelief vanishes and it's just another wait for the \"It's a Small World\" ride to end.\n\nI did watch the film twice as a teenager (because after all, my girlfriend moved away to Grand Cayman and what else could I do?) and I watched the director's cut recently. It *is* a better film now, in its new incarnation, but not by very much. You cannot make stale food taste better just by reheating it and spicing it up a bit. Without a doubt, this is the least auspicious of the Star Trek films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture has always been a controversial film (among Trekkers, at least) because there is much argument over just how good (or bad) the film is.\n\nI believe that it is quite possibly the greatest of all the Star Trek films. It is an epic adventure, whereas most of the films, storywise at least, could be television episodes.\n\nThe story of ST: TMP is very intelligent and thought provoking. The plot is quite simple, but the questions it raises are anything but. When it comes down to it, ST: TMP is indeed about the human adventure: it is about seeing how far humanity could go, based on our limitless imaginations.\n\nMany have criticised the film's elaborate effects sequences, and many think these smother the story and the characters, but I do not think this is so. The effects, grand as they are, are indeed used only as a storytelling tool on this film. In the original theatrical version of the film, this may not have been the case, but the masterfully re-edited Director's Edition regains the balance between story, character and visuals that was lost as a result of the film's hectic production troubles close to the release date of the film.\n\nThe new Director's Edition has several amazing new effects shots that were created by Foundation Imaging for the film. They are amazing not because they are grand and spectacular, but because they are subtle. Anyone who didn't realize the film had been re-edited and augmented last year would be forgiven for thinking all the shots in the film were original 1979 material.\n\nThe DVD Transfer:\n\nPicture: 7/10.\n\nThe picture quality was disappointing. While it must be taken into account that most effects films of the era have very grainy pictures due to the large amount of optical compositing used to create effects shots, this DVD's image is still a lot dirtier than you would expect. There are numerous scratchy film elements used, and the actual DVD authoring is problematic, so on this front, the DVD was a bit of a let down. It's still far superior to any VHS or LaserDisc editions of the film, and many shots do look far sharper than in other editions of the film.\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nFor an old film, the soundtrack on the DVD was surprisingly sharp and well-defined. The only area of the audio that gives away the film's age is the dialogue. Due to noisy conditions on the set caused by lighting effects and projector-screens used to create display panels, most of the dialogue was re-recorded in ADR. This makes the dialogue stand apart from the newly mixed Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 tracks, but this is a minor flaw that one can't complain about given the limitations of filmmaking technology in 1979.\n\nExtras: 7/10\n\nThe Director's Edition DVD was one of the first double-disc editions produced by Paramount. So it is very refreshing to see a Star Trek DVD with extra materials included. The three documentaries are interesting, but do not go into much depth, but the 90 minutes or so covered by the documentaries are interesting and informative nontheless. There is an extensive library of deleted scenes and trims, and it is not surprising upon viewing these that they landed on the cutting room floor. The archive of TV spots and trailers is my favorite aspect of the DVD's features disc: it is fascinating to compare conventions of 70's movie advertising to those of today.\n\nThe commentaries on Disc 1 are also interesting, but are a little formal given the fact that the commentaries were recorded separately and edit into the one track. The DVD's novel subtitle Commentary by Trek Tech guru Mike Okuda was the highlight of disc one\u00e9s extras for me.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this DVD whole heartedly to Trekkers, and science-fiction collectors as well."

Although I heard this movie wasn't good, I still wanted to keep an open mind and see what I think. So, what did I think..? It was boring af. Other than the music and sometimes the special effects being good, everything else in this movie felt dull personally. Despite being 2 hours long, it felt like nothing was going on that was really interesting and felt like the movie was going on forever, especially during the beginning. The acting wasn't horrible but wasn't really good either. The characters in the movie weren't interesting and kind of jerks at times. The plot was also incredibly forgettable, I watched this movie 2 weeks ago and I can barely recall what happened other than the beginning. The music was probably the best part about the movie, it is pretty catchy and I think it fits most scenes well when they need to. The special effects were hit or miss. Sometimes it was good and sometimes it was really mediocre. Overall, I don't hate this movie but this is far from being a good movie imo. If you are planning on watching any Star Trek movies, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at all unless you are very interested."

There has been a passage of time and in that time Kirk has been promoted and the Enterprise has had an extensive refit.\n\nA massive cloud of energy is heading towards Earth, looking for the creator. Kirk takes command of the Enterprise and heads straight for the energy cloud.\n\nThere is a clever premise to the movie which was matched in Star Trek IV. It is pompous with a lack of humour. Space is given to the new characters. Both Persis Khambatta and Stephen Collins fare well as characters with a history.\n\nThis is a film that did not take an easy path. It was ambitious, it took risks. The money is there on the screen. It is a lot better than many of the subsequent Star Trek movies."

It owes its existence to Star Wars but Wise would rather fashion something that looks more like 2001, so its all beauty shots and existential pontification rather than old fashioned intergalactic fun and games. That said, the pluses are the visual effects, which are occasionally tremendous and the score, Jerry Goldsmith at the top of his game - in either respect it can't be faulted but its an unforgivably boring two hours - humourless, slow and characterless so that Shatner, Nimoy and co. look and sound awkward, like a bunch of workers trying to stay civil following a massive argument. The production design makes the new Enterprise look sterile and pallid while the script is too self-consciously straight faced for its own good - these look like the cast we know but they're lifeless shadows of their former selves. It must have been hard for the fans who waited 10 years but Star Trek 1 is a bit of a $40M clunker - money thrown at the screen with scant regard for that all important screenplay. The sequel cost less than half of this but its about 8 times as good, a meaty character driven adventure laced with wit and good humour - The fine wine that follows the overpriced, microscopic main course that didn't taste of anything but had a beautifully dressed side salad."

In my view this was a very classy, thought provoking and intelligent science fiction film. While suffering from some cuts of key scenes, some choppy editing (due to the rushed nature of the production), and some problematic optical compositing in places (again rushed circumstances), its overall content more than makes up for this. A clever plot, superb special effects ( Star Wars never tried to light the miniatures like the Enterprise), a truly stunning score by Jerry Goldsmith. The measured performances were not as bad as made out. After all, I got the feeling that the three main characters had not parted on the best of terms, and the frostiness they show towards each other at the beginning of the movie is understandable, and the way their relationship comes together by the end of the film is well judged by Robert Wise. In all, an intelligent movie that does not blow anything up and tries to get an audience thinking about what it means to be human"

With a refitted Enterprise and new sights such as San Francisco in the 23rd century not to mention the special effects. We had a chance to see our friends again after too long an absence and we had to catch up. I had nothing but pride and astonishment when we got to flyby the refitted Enterprise something we could never do before. She is a beautiful jewel, our ship and she deserved to be shown off. From beginning to end this film was Star Trek. But if you wanted a shootem up this wasnt it. This was much like the tale of Pinochio but on a cosmic scale. We humans are the \"creator\" that V'ger was searching for. I think Spock and Vger both grow here in their brief contact with each other. A few things to nitpick over. Some of the SFX were problematic but a lot of this will be fixed in the DVD edition coming out next year. The other thing is that the bridge is way too quiet. There is little background chatter. Again this may be fixed in the DVD either way that is minor. Take these simple things into account and you will enjoy this movie. If you want action in a star trek film check out Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan. You wont be disappointed either way."

I say nearly.. as thankfully we have some saving graces. The soundtrack is fantastic and visually this is one of the best films you will ever see. William Shatner gets all the best lines and overacts as only he can, putting in an entertaining performance trying to put some life into proceedings. Ultimately The Motion Picture is a let down, and best viewed on a rainy Sunday afternoon when nothing else is on."

Nagging children make parents nervous so no wonder why this particular title never got the ratings it deserved. Starting from the script, hands down that was the best I've ever seen on such movie. It was so well written and deep that I could imagine Stanley Kubrick behind it and also the slowness of the movie was a reminder of Kubrick's 2001 although the scenes were not as polished. The production was top of the line with attention to every detail. As of year 2015 that watched it again, almost nothing looked dated. Special effects were also marvelous although there was some scenes on the beginning of the film which could have been better. A true masterpiece. 8/10"

There is a distinct lack of blockbuster action - especially in comparison to later films in the series, which featured lots of cool stuff - and an ending that was...well, just \"meh\" for me. Lots of cinematic shots of space, little to no phaser or torpedo fire, some interpersonal confrontation between Kirk and, Decker, the officer who he shafted to get command of the Enterprise despite not having been in space for two years. Lots of talking. Even the mysterious cloud really wasn't that mysterious or exciting in the end. Would've preferred some maurauding Klingons, to be honest.

This is not my favorite Star Trek movie, in fact not even in my top 5, but there is something majestic about this movie. When I was younger I hated this movie, and claimed that the movie series started with the second movie as far as I am concerned. This movie moved at such a slow pace that I always would get bored with it and quit watching it. But, being that I love Star Trek more so than any other movie franchise, I would force myself to go back and still attempt to watch \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" again and again. Then finally one night at around 2am I finished it for the first time. And once I was finally able to finish it, I absolutely loved it. And I have watched it from start to finish several times since then.\n\nThe starship Enterprise has been rebuilt (refitted) and is a completely new starship from the ground up. There is long scene of nothing but footage of the Enterprise sitting in Space dock while Jerry Goldsmith's masterful Star Trek Theme song plays. I know that sound silly, but it isn't, for some reason you n ever get bored at that scene. The Enterprise is such a beautiful starship, that it looks so amazing that you never get bored of watch it sit in space dock while that majestic music is playing.\n\n::::::::::: SPOILER ALERTS;;;;;;;;;\n\nThe movie about a monster cloud moving through space and destroying everything in it's path, and it's headed strait for Earth. Admiral Kirk is assigned to take over the Enterprise from Captain Decker and intercept whatever it is that's inside the cloud, a very simple and strait forward plot. (Written by Sci-Fi novelist Alan Dean Foster \u2013 the only screen play he ever wrote). But things get a little more complicated when they arrive at the cloud and discover that it is far more powerful than anything they ever encountered before. It probes them and eventually abducts one of the crew. Only to send a mechanism back to the Enterprise in the image of that abducted crew member. Spock figures out that the vessel at the hart of the cloud is a giant living machine named Veeger. They eventually discover Veeger is really an old NASA Voyager 6 satellite that has traveled the entire galaxy and amassed so much knowledge that it achieved artificial intelligence and became alive.\n\nYes this movie moves at a very slow pace, it's not an action packed thrill ride. But its still a great movie. But I'd take this any day over J.J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek movie.\n\nI'm lucky enough to own a VHS Copy of the 1983 \"Special Longer Version\" that has everyone one of the deleted scenes re-edited back into the movie, something that the newer Blu-Ray \"Director's Cut\" doesn't have."

The first banks and insurances were erected, and a factory job suddenly became a way of life rather than desperate necessity. Star Trek I would have had to call that world out. Star Trek Into Darkness 35 years later in 2013 absolutely shines at battling its own Federation. Peter Weller in an outstanding and unmatched performance plays an who's-the-real-grownup-here, vile Starfleet Captain that Kirk and his crew can't rival. Absolute perfection. Star Trek I failed at taking a shot at this new world that began in the 1980s. As an example, Mr. T from the A-Team would have been needed to play a vile Starfleet representative. That foe would have given Captain Kirk's men the edge to shine. Instead, Star Trek just accepted this new world, and bemoans whale killings a little in Star Trek IV."

Here's an interesting fact: Several scenes were edited out to make it \"G\" rated for general release. It involved Kirk's ex-wife and a Vulcan in a two transporter tube malfunction. That made it necessary for \"Spock\" to join the crew. She was horribly disfigured and the audience gasped in horror; so they took out about 10 minutes and re-worked the entire story without her. All her scenes were \"cut\" from the later versions! I have never seen this again, not even on the extended or Director's \"cuts\" with extras! (It's also in the novel.) Model-maker Douglas Trumbull (2001) takes a real long time to \"tour\" the exterior of the newly-refitted Enterprise.This really slows down the action. Other scenes (inside Vi'ger's \"mind cloud\") are brilliant, but also challenged my attention span. Apparently everybody was in love with \"2001\" and edited it thus. Lack of humor? Well, in the movies'\"official novel\", there was quite a lot more going on between \"ILIA\" and Decker. They have a steamy past and she has \"hormonal\" tears. They can't help loving each other, as they are both \"imprinted for life\". (Also an idea borrowed from the TV series) This is all toned-down in the movie, so that her \"Oath of Celibacy\" makes no sense. Other gripes: Don't any space-women own underwear? Vi'ger is an overblown re-working of the \"Nomad\" entity from the TV series. The physical \"joining\" of man and cyborg at the \"climax\" of the film (sorry-couldn't resist) obviously creates \"The Borg\". Yet this is never mentioned in any Star Trek film? (Lots of serious sparks but still G-rated.) Most enjoyable on disc, as the viewer can create an \"intermission\". On disc, it is possible to \"edit\" overlong or tedious chapters. It is 145 minutes with extended scenes and music and the enhanced version is too \"talky\"."

Even the promotional material centered around this idea with the tag-line \"There is no comparison.\" ST-TMP is a movie that is meant to be experienced from a more intellectual perspective. I don't mean this in any negative way. it just cannot be experienced with the expectation that one is going to see heart-pumping action sequences and scenery chewing. It requires the audience to be contemplative.\n\nWhat ST-TMP gives us is a deeply metaphysical story that attempts to answer the greatest of all human questions \"Is this all that I am? Is there nothing more?\" ST-TMP is true SciFi. It is not space battles and action sequences, although these would become much more a part of the stories of the future films. (ed note: There is nothing wrong with action and battles in SciFi - I love SW as well. ST-TMP is just different and stands on its own.)\n\nSome particulars:\n\nThe special effects - Simply outstanding. Doug Trumbull's work in creating the visuals is wondrous and at times breathtaking. The fly-around the Enterprise in spacedock is worth the price of admission.\n\nThe music - Jerry Goldsmith's score should have won the Oscar. The theme itself is legendary, and Goldsmith's use of new sounds and instruments, atonalism, and aleatoric writing is, as always, a joy to experience.\n\nThe acting - has its moments, but is nothing great. When has a SCiFi movie ever had great acting.\n\nThis is a much better movie than it is often given credit for. As another reviewer said, it did what it was designed to do and that is bring Star Trek back.\n\nAs a Star Trek movie, I rank it near the middle from best to worst - 2,4,6,8,11,3,1,7,9,10,5.\n\nAs a SciFi movie, I would put it up there with Silent Running, Logan's Run, and other more thought-provoking 70's genre movies."

It started superbly with the various crew members assembling to take the new Enterprise (away from Cpt Decker) to investigate the mysterious cloud that was approaching Earth. Terrific stuff. They leave Earth with an ill prepared crew, Spock dramatically joins the ship in deep space and the journey recommences. By now I was on the edge of my seat. The Star Trek movie of my dreams. Then they entered the cloud . . . . .and the action , and the script, and the dialogue ended! To be replaced by endless boring pans through scenery so dark and meaningless as to make the green end-of-reel-umpteen interesting! That cloud penetration sequence seemed to go on FOR EVER! What was the editor thinking about. Eventually the Enterprise reaches the centre to be confronted by V-ger and the action,script and dialogue picks up again to conclude the film in a satisfactory way. Never before have I seen a film that so sorely needed severe editing. Even now when I watch the DVD (Yes it was good enough for me to buy) I usually fast forward through the cloud entry eternity. And I am still amazed at how long it is even on 20X speed. . . Watch it but you can have a long break in the middle without having to stop the film!"

Sorry, I know it was a triumph for Star Trek fans to see this hit the big screen, and lots of people just loved it.\n\nBut I'm reviewing this not as a fan, but from the standpoint of \"was this a good movie?\". The plot was a re-hashed Doomsday Device (couldn't they think of something new and vibrant?), the acting terrible (I know I know, heresy, right? Sorry, the acting was terrible)... and the ending was a yawner. It could have been more ingenious, original and inspiring. But it just kinda flopped.\n\nThis movie needed some far better writers. Compare it to other prominent good movies... and ask the ultimate question: \"If this wasn't Star Trek, would anyone have given this a good rating?\"\n\nThat's the telling point, isn't it?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture was heralded as the big resurrection of the franchise. The original series lasted three seasons. They managed a two season animated series that wasn't much remembered at the time. But it became a huge phenomenon in syndication. After the enormous success of Star Wars, studios looked to any science fiction franchise and Paramount had Star Trek. The genius Gene Roddenberry was at the time making a second live series and essentially reformatted some ideas into a feature and thus TMP was born.\n\nThe movie follows James T. Kirk after being promoted to admiral as he retakes control of the revamped Enterprise. His mission is to stop an unknown force that destroys everything in its path from reaching Earth. He butts heads with the Enterprise's new captain, William Decker, and reunites with Spock, who has been away on his own mission.\n\nV'Ger is the kind of story that the series did quite often. Unfortunately, the story as it is comes off as a single episode stretched to two hours. There's a lot of filler and sequences stretched out to overly long lengths. The warp sequence is one that is largely unnecessary except to show that Kirk doesn't know all about the new design, which they did in other ways. The shuttle trip around the Enterprise is nice to see the new ship, but goes on too long. And there's far too many long shots of going through V'Ger where nothing happens except the ship moving. They could have fleshed the story out, but instead they padded it. The ending is nice and thoughtful in the way the show was. However, it ultimately lacks that personal touch. Voyage Home would do the overpowering object attacking Earth story much better.\n\nThe entire main cast returns. That in itself was special considering that some had disliked their time on the show and they all had moved on to other things. The characters are a mixed bag. They don't have much of a story besides Kirk and Spock. Kirk is dealing with his \"desk job.\" Spock is searching for peace between his human and Vulcan sides. McCoy provides the same great humor but he, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov, and Sulu are just there. Decker seems to have the beginnings of a story, but he is only really interesting because his relationship with Ilia is the prototype for Riker and Troi in The Next Generation.\n\nThe special effects were considerably good for its time. The redesigned Enterprise is absolutely gorgeous, probably the best looking ship in the franchise. While going on too long, the scene of Scotty and Kirk flying around the ship is a beautiful scene to see. The look of V'Ger and the dissolving effects are top notch. It is still great to look at. Honestly, I would love to see this rereleased in theaters in 3D.\n\nPromoting Kirk to admiral was a great storytelling device that served the franchise well. Sure, the following movies would deal with it better. Stuff that paid off in Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home, and Generations started here. The fact that he's jealous of his subordinate Decker for commanding \"his ship\" really speaks to his character. The scene where the two argue following the comet incident was well written.\n\nThe music made for this movie became the iconic music of the franchise. The main theme here became the recurring theme of every following film through Nemesis and the main score for The Next Generation. Goldsmith's score is fantastic, and easily as iconic as Williams' Star Wars music. The soundtrack is worth buying, especially for the bonus disc with all the insightful interviews.\n\nThis was the movie that introduced the redesigned Klingon make-up that would be featured in the franchise to come. In the series, they came off as just recolored Oriental-looking humans. This made them look truly alien.\n\nIn retrospect, it's really only notable as the movie that brought the franchise back into public attention. I will say that the movie works in a slow, methodical 2001: A Space Odyssey way. There isn't any big action sequence, besides the Klingons and space station getting attacked. It's more contemplative, allowing you time to think. If you don't mind the slowness, it is enjoyable. It may not rank among the best of Star Trek, but it's a fine movie on its own. The movie helped revive Star Trek. Though it was Wrath of Khan that saved its life."

Persis Khambatta who plays \"Ilia\" - the conduit between the all powerful alien power and our gang of intrepid adventurers - is almost robotic and sterile; as is the general plot of the film. It seems lost between an adventure film and one with a deeper message to convey; as such it delivers well on neither front. Luckily, there were more, better, films to follow - but this one is best forgotten."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was the first Star Trek thing I saw, several years ago. It didn't blow me away, nor did it disappoint. But it left quite a good impression on me. I thought the story was interesting and I enjoyed it overall.\n\nNow I've seen a fair bit of TOS and TNG along with most of the other movies. And rewatching The Motion Picture, I feel about the same as I did initially. It's a good movie. Mysterious, ominous, intriguing. It doesn't require much knowledge of Star Trek to enjoy. But I think knowing the characters a bit gives it slightly more meaning.\n\nThe visuals are pretty incredible, and I'm not just talking about Ilia's legs. Many of the Star Trek films have good effects, but honestly, this might have the best effects of all of them, despite being the earliest. A few parts look fake, but most of it looks really good. They really put a lot of time into that aspect of the movie. And it's also very imaginative. All kinds of strange features, shapes, structures and most of it seems to be completely original in design.\n\nThere are many long shots of the mysterious giant spacecraft/cloud. That's what some people seem to complain about - that it's too slow. But I don't really understand since I liked a lot of those shots. In many ways, I prefer a movie which takes its time with an original and ominous concept rather than rushing through exposition and predictable dialogue and plot points.\n\nThe music is another major strength. Jerry Goldsmith was one of the most prolific film composers and this might be my favourite score of his. Certainly it's up there. His work varies in quality in my opinion, seemingly based on inspiration. Some movies just don't seem to have excited him much. But Star Trek: TMP must have really struck a chord with him (no pun intended). It brings the movie to life. It may be that \"nothing is happening\", but I was entranced. It took me to another world.\n\nThe music is often heavy (there's a weird clangy/metal guitar kind of sound at many points which is unique) and explores all kinds of interesting ideas. There's a reliance on the concept of mystery itself. A kind of faith which most movies are too afraid to go with. TMP takes the time to indulge in its vision, to let us fall into the visuals and music. If you go along for the ride, much of it is pretty incredible.\n\nIt's one of the more imaginative movies I've ever seen. I was reminded of 2001, except this movie is more engaging while 2001 feels somewhat pretentious, despite its reputation and breakthrough special effects. And at least TMP offers answers whereas 2001 doesn't.\n\nThe twist at the end is a satisfying one. However, the overall concept doesn't quite hold together perfectly. It's very interesting, but still ultimately dated in terms of the hokey sci-fi jargon and some random things which happen at various points. It's not a masterpiece, just a good Star Trek film with above average music and visuals.\n\nI think this is a solid sci-fi movie for fans of that genre, even if they don't know Star Trek. Although, in some ways, it's not even a Star Trek movie since it has relatively little of the other things Star Trek usually has - the characters could be swapped without much needing to change. Still, I enjoyed Kirk and Spock quite a lot."

A story is a story is a story. But emotions and there responses are something different. This was repeated superbly in The Wrath of Khan, with the exception of Chekov's character, but Star Trek II did not carry the TOS vibe. Likely due to the fact that Gene didn't have control of anything after TMP. Don't get me wrong; II is number 1, and for a good reason, but The Motion Picture deserves highest ratings. Referring to the Directors Cut, the effects, and especially the live shots of the Enterprise were never duplicated. To date. With any Star Trek film. It's just... a perfect Star Trek film.

If this \"demon cloud\" had achieved such an astronomical fund of knowledge why did it not also achieve moral consciousness? ... on it's own? Or at least appreciate the real difference between itself and other forms of life? Couldn't VGER figure out that it's \"core\", a 20th century satellite, was a very crude device that wasn't worth much effort and certainly didn't justify laying waste to significant chunks of real estate? Anyway, the science of Star Trek was basically nonexistent but at the least the original from the sixties had a little bit of character and humour ... sometimes.

We were in middle seats with lots of people on either side. Her new sweater was covered in vomit.\n\nA few decades have passed, and since then I had become a fan of the original series. I avoided watching the film again until this year. My revisiting this movie was rewarding in that it lived up to the style and themes of the series, and the once difficult feelings I had associated with it as a child were gone. I remembered what had happened with my brother and smiled."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ahhh, a true science fiction tale told through a fantastic film. Again, I had to convince myself it was 1979, and ignore the special effects that have been achieved since then. But I really don't need to ignore those cgi advancements to enjoy a film such as this one. It was told during what I like to consider the golden age of sci fi. Where thanks to 'star wars' stories/scripts once deemed unfilmable were now possible. You don't see today's sci fi films having such a fascinating story like this. Foster and Livingston did a fine job. It was great to see the original cast together again. By 79's standards this film is top notch, and still should be considered in that way today. I'd like to also add that I thought Persis Khambatta was amazing in her role. It's too bad I didn't see her in anything else too relevant. And I was sorry to hear about her passing in the late nineties.\n\nOh and the blu ray edition of this film is fantastic!! The picture/audio quality were so superb that I could not believe my eyes and ears. If you're a fan of the 2009's 'Star Trek' prequel/reboot/remake(?) I think you should definitely check out where it all began."

The script does however spend a lot of time re-introducing all of our favourite characters (and some new ones) and forgets about the antagonist until about halfway through. The plot only really kicks off when one of the new characters is abducted by this strange alien entity which until now has only been defined by its size. In true Star Trek style we only start to learn about it when it appears in a human form and the story teaches us about tried and true Star Trek concepts such as the human vs the machine and emotion vs logic. It's not anything new to viewers of the original show but is presented in an epic style that the show always deserved but could never attain on a TV budget."

        "review_detailed_main": "In its transition from beloved TV series to the big screen, \"Star Trek - The Movie\" (1979) presented a promising opportunity to elevate the space saga to epic proportions. However, the writer's unchecked ambition resulted in a complex narrative that, unfortunately, strayed from the simplicity and charm that endeared fans to the original series.\n\nThe film suffers from a lack of exploration of the iconic relationships that defined the original series, such as the conflicts between Spock and Dr. McCoy or the deep friendship between Spock and Captain Kirk, now promoted to admiral. Instead, the plot becomes entangled in characters lacking charisma, such as Decker (portrayed by Stephen Collins) and Ilia (played by Persis Khambatta), who fail to capture the audience's interest.\n\nWeak Points:\n\nThe screenplay, while ambitious, becomes confusing and overly intricate. In attempting to encompass a myriad of elements, it loses the simplicity and charm that characterized the episodes of the television series.\n\nThe central protagonists, Decker and Ilia, lack the charisma and depth that defined the characters of the original series, failing to engage the audience.\n\nThe narrative fails to adequately focus on the iconic relationships between Spock, McCoy, and Kirk, which were beloved by fans of the franchise. This represents a missed opportunity to explore the complexity of these bonds and their impact on the storyline.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe visual effects, for the time, were truly impressive, contributing to the creation of a grand and immersive space universe.\n\nNostalgia is a strong point of the film, especially for ardent fans of the original series. The opportunity to reunite with their favorite characters in a new and thrilling adventure represents an irresistible invitation to immerse oneself in this beloved fictional universe.\n\nIn summary, \"Star Trek - The Movie\" (1979) can be considered an ambitious work that, despite its flaws, still manages to captivate audiences with its visual heritage and the power of nostalgia it evokes."

While I was and still am a big fan of Star Trek TNG (The Next Generation), I never really had gotten into the original show. Or this movie for that matter. I knew of it - and Shatner and all the others laid quite the groundwork.\n\nOf course it is also the makers (Gene Roddenberry on top of that list) who have to be credited. But if I start name checking ... I would bore some of you and would not finish for another 2 hours. So even though there are many people to name, from sound/music, to actors and effect people, I will refrain from going there - not because no man has gone there - but because too many already have. No pun or innuendo intended.\n\nThe movie was not a sure thing. While Star Trek is a household name now, back then they did not know what they had in their hands. The original show was not as successful as the cult following nowadays may suggest. So much so (or so little so), that the movie went from being green lit to being canceled to being made into a tv movie ... and on and on.\n\nThe story they ended up with did surprise me (first time watch for my newly invented Sci-Fi-tember). I thought this was going to be more camp - this ended up being quite philosophical! It is not 2001, but it also is not just some silly story either! Something I did expect remembering the tv show.\n\nWhat I did watch was the newly remastered Directors edition and the longer cut. Both look incredible! I think this looked way better than what people got to see in cinemas. We linger for a few minutes outside the USS Enterprise before we enter it ... the models, the effects ... just amazing. And the soundtrack - I knew I ... knew it ... and yet I couldn't put my finger on it! Same was used for TNG show ... ah they know a good thing when they hear it.\n\nHaving a bald woman in one of the main roles is quite ... bold! But the show always stood for being inclusive. Even when Shatner was known to be quite the womanizer. Also funny seeing George Takei being quite smitten by our bald lady - considering his taste in real life. But that is why it is called acting.\n\nThis may be slow, this may not really be everyones taste (especially those who have issues with the pace), but if you let yourself delve into it ... well the movie is inspiring and really something to behold! Humanity is not lost ... not yet! We have a lot to learn though - and can never stop from evolving ... yes this has some lessons for you ... it may be Science Fiction ... but it also is educational! In a good sense .... follow the rainbow ... do not dissolve ... never rest ... always adapt! And above all ... keep an open mind (so new things can enter it)! Clearly a beginning ..."

It showed.\n\nThe movie is really slow, kind of eerie, and almost no character work. Way too many slow, lonely scenes of outer space or the ship. The uniforms were dull and not flattering. I liked the overall plot concept from a cerebral point of view, though not very exciting. Most of the TV episodes were much better than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" is for fans only. Only fans will tolerate the unbelievably slow pace and forgive the excesses this film has an abundance of. Even several of the key filmmakers dislike this film.\n\nWilliam Shatner describes the film as \"molasses slow and yawn inducing\" in his book \"Star Trek: Movie Memories (which I highly recommend) Robert Wise, the director, has always felt that the film was ruined by rushed editing and poor special effects. Judging by the fact that Wise is preparing director's cut for theatrical release and DVD only confirms that viewpoint. Leonard Nimoy did not think much of the picture until the expanded version was released a year later on tape.(which is mentioned in the Shatner book and Nimoy's autobiography \"I Am Spock\" which I also highly recommend) Hell, even the president of Gulf and Western (which owned Paramount in these days)hated it.\n\nAs for myself, I look at it this way: it looks fabulous and for about 25 minutes in the beginning, it feels as if it's going to be great. Then it all falls apart in the middle before (finally) getting better in the final 45 minutes. This movie had me bored beyond belief in that whole middle section. In the longer version, some footage of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (improvised by Shatner, Nimoy and the late DeForest Kelley) was added back. In a way, it helps because it remembers what makes Star Trek so good: the human relationships take top priority on the effects. In another way, it only makes an already slow film even slower.\n\nThe technical credits are tops. Wise is an extremely competent director who has made many great films (The Day The Earth Stood Still is a sci-fi masterpiece)and he does the best he can with the weak, cerebral script. Richard H. Kline's Panavision photography is great to look at as are the effects (the bulk of which is handled by Douglas Trumbull, who did \"2001\" and \"Blade Runner\")are often stunning, although they are weak by the standards set by later entries.\n\nThe acting is variable. Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley and the regulars are all fine as usual. But Stephen Collins' Decker doesn't give him much to do and Persis Khambatta sets new standards for awful in all of her scenes (20 takes for just saying NO)The script by Harold Livingston and Gene Roddenberry is too cerebral and slow for its own good.\n\nDespite being a disappointment, \"Star Trek\" is worth seeing. But you have to be a Trekkie/Trekker (like I am) to forgive its excesses and look at the good things in it. Ordinary viewers will hate this.\n\n*** out of 4 stars (with reservations)"

What would the impact be? These are just some of the aspects of the film that make it so apt for today.\n\nOh how I long for another trek on TV thank you for 50 years of Star Trek"

This movie, however, is the only movie featuring the original TV cast where they at least LOOK of a believable age...from ST II on, they are all too old to realistically be still stuck in the same positions they were 20 years ago.\n\nAnyway, regarding this movie, there are a number of definite plusses. Firstly, the score is a Jerry Goldsmith masterpiece - small wonder the main theme has lived on into TNG. Secondly the visual effects are marvelous; even now they stand up well to today's offerings; for 1979 they are beyond belief! You really get a sense of the size and power of the Enterprise more than in any other Trek incarnation to date....in fact, my brother and I still like to jokingly claim they actually built the Enterprise in orbit to film the effects. Thirdly; although the movie has been criticised for a lack of pace (Star Trek : The Slow Motion Picture) it is also the only one that I believe really LOOKS and feels like a big budget movie instead of a TV movie on the big screen.\n\nIn a world where the effects budget is bigger for a movie like Galaxy Quest (which I also enjoyed, btw) than for the new Trek movies (seems incredible, but it's true) ST:TMP is a gloriously visual and emotional extravaganza."

There are many, and I mean a huge amount, of redundant and profoundly useless scenes, such as when Scotty and Kirk circle the Enterprise for what seems like ten minutes, while apparently looking for a parking space.\n\nAlthough the climax is fairly good, it is not nearly good enough to make up for the rest of the movie.\n\nOverall, I rate this movie 3 of 10."

But as I have seen it long ago, i can't really notice the differences between the two versions. The most evident is the exit on the hull because it's true that the original perspective was really bizarre.\n\nBut then, I felt that the return of the franchise was refreshing: the colored suits are gone for bright uniforms that aren't filled with any military spirit unlike all the others sequels. The Goldsmith's score is exceptional and the long, never-ending trip to the Enterprise is perfectly tied with the characters. On board, Ylia was an outstanding newcomer that confirms science fiction can speak with less.\n\nAbove all, this mission is a success: I can't find any other science fiction movies that illustrate the unknown territory. For 2 hours, you go to a wonderful, mysterious trip with unseen and artistic environment. In addition, it's also a philosophical quest wondering about knowledge, humanity and religion.\n\nThe movie is so rich that its visuals have set the standard for all the sequels, and that the probe element has been used again in ST4 and the quest for god in ST5!\n\nMaybe the characters are a bit tensed and melodramatic but what about the failure of ST3? Here, it fits with the subject and as good franchises, the core of characters allows multiple mood in each movie. Just pick the one you are looking for!\n\nWell, for me, the 12 years / 6 movies mission has been completed backwards: so I left them as a young crew and thank them for all those good times!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw this the first week it came out. I can't remember exactly which theater in New York City it was but this was before the infestation of multiplexes. Few people ever get to see a film on an immense screen anymore. That's how I saw this film and it really helped. The Slow ponderous special effects were magnificent on the big screen. The V'ger cloud and the vast interior looked incredible. The long shots of the Enterprise were great looking too. The effects had a jewel like sparkle to them.\n\nThe film had a long and troubled history before it came to the screen. I remember interviews with Roddenberry where he's complained about Paramount interference with the story and script. He claimed that one executive wanted to somehow insert the Easter Island statues into the story because he was reading Erich Von Daniken's ancient astronaut theory books. An early example of marketing department interference in movie making. Unfortunately what was new then is apparently the only factor making fantasy films these days. At some point Paramount came to the conclusion that Star Wars was successful only because of the special effects and they had the director emphasize the effects over the acting. Perhaps this is why Robert Wise didn't direct another film for a decade.\n\nThe whole cast seems uncomfortable, especially Shatner. I read that the cast had problems with some of the things the script had them say and apparent disregard to the Star Trek mythos.\n\nAnother problem came with special effect team hired. They had never created effects of the magnitude needed for the film and it became apparent that they could never do the job. By the time the decision to remove them was made there was very little time to finish the effect shots. Trumbell and Dykstra went into overdrive and their shop ran 24 hours for at least a month. It was publicized that the final negative was delivered only a day before the premier screenings around the country. I can attest that some of the print I saw had extensive watermarks from rushed drying during developing.\n\nThe first network showing of the film a few years later (ABC, I believe) included several scenes that were removed before the theatrical release. Most of them were character scenes that gave the production more of a Star Trek feel. One scene needed effects to complete the setting (an exterior of the Enterprise) but was shown anyway. There were scaffolding and movie lights visible!\n\nOne last thing, I didn't really notice the amount of time the actors spent starring at the view screen in the theater (I went back a second time). When you watch the film on a small TV, it's really annoying."

I think that often this movie is overlooked but I think it captures the essence of the Trek saga in a very powerful way - too many of the other movies broke down into a us against them plot structure; us vs. the Borg or us vs. Klingons. This film hits the original series theme of an unknown to explore not a known to battle. I know the costumes and set dressing are cheesy today but if you can get past that this is a GREAT film. I believe that the attraction of the original series was its willingness to confront social issues in inovative ways - be it social justice, inclusion, etc. The Motion Picture fulfills that role by asking us just what are the risks we take when we reach out, explore, and seek to understand."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek The Motion Picture is one of the all time greatest Sci-Fi Adventure movies. I make no apologies, this is the film that introduced me Captain Kirk, Spock and Co. Whilst not a Trekie as such, I am more of a Casual Star Trek fan. Such is the impact of this film that even had I not been, I think I would have enjoyed this as a movie in its own right. Perhaps the only thing working against the movie is that it doesn't manage to generate the fun of the original series. Instead it lays the blueprints for Star Trek-The Next Generation, and the next 20 odd years or so of Trek Episodes.\n\nRobert Wise's Direction is Epic to say the least. Wise is not the most obvious name you would ascociate with a Star Trek movie, but he and Star Trek fit like a glove. He does for Star Trek what Richard Donner did for Superman the previous year. He has taken material that from the outset would only appeal to fans, yet he makes it acceptable for a general audience as well. And Star Tek The Motion Picture has many elements for the casual Viewer/Trek fan to feast their eyes on.\n\nThere is the Solid Cast. William Shatner is for Star Trek what Christopher Reeve was for Superman, and Sean Connery was for Bond. He is the ultimate Captain of the Enterprise, and this shows. It took an excellent actor like Patrick Stewart to lay the ghost of Kirk to rest. Shatner carries the weight of the movie on his shoulders, and does so well. Leonard Nimoy as Spock evokes similar echoes of the kind of performances he gave on the T.V. Shows. Yet with age Nimoy looks more the alien and somehow his performance seems all the more real, like a good wine, with age. Once Spock comes aboard the Enterprise you know its going to be fun all the way. There are also the familiar faces of James Doohan,George Takai, Deforest Kelly and Walter Koening. Then there is the wonderfully designed Sets, of the Enterprise etc, which perfectly compliment the excellent special effects By John Dykstra. In truth Star Trek The Motion Picture was eye candy before the word was even invented. And also, there is Jerry Goldsmiths beautifull score wich blends the T.V series themes with a new energetic score for the 80's.\n\nIn truth, for the casual viewer the plot may be alittle strained. Basiacally the Enterprise engages in a sluggish battle with a malignent force field headed earthwards. Who could be responsible. [The Klingons?] But even if the script doesn't appeal, with everything else on offer, you should be satisfied enough."

Unfortunately, \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" is the weakest of those movies. It spends way too much time trying to impress us with it's visual effects. The effects are hit and miss (mostly miss). There are moments of good storytelling but they're pushed aside for the \"great\" visuals. I do the same thing with \"Star Trek:The Motion Picture\" that I do with \"Rocky\" parts 3,4, and 5 (and Creed and Creed 2). I pretend they don't exist."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was a decade after the original television series Star Trek had been canceled when Star Trek: The Motion Picture was released onto the anticipating world. I'm not exactly sure how the film was received in 1979, but 31 years later, after multiple new Star Trek TV series and movies, plus the 2009 reboot which hearkened back to the characters of the original series, Star Trek: The Motion Picture pales in comparison. I was not impressed at all by this film and was very bored by its lack of true Trek spirit and style. I love Star Trek but this film was lame. It takes place probably about ten years after Kirk, Spock, and McCoy traveled through space together, but now they are reuniting on the USS Enterprise to intercept a strange biosignal heading towards Earth. All of the original characters are back together to once again boldly go where no man has gone before. There are even some new characters specifically there for the film's plot. Sadly, at the end of the day this film's plot is about 45 minutes worth stretched out to a little over two hours making it very dull and boring. If the original Star Trek series had been like this it would have never made the impression that it did on the sci-fi world.\n\nWhat is so unfortunate about Star Trek: The Motion Picture is that it removes everything that was so great about the original series and we are left with only the issues the original series had. This movie is very cheesy and ridiculously melodramatic. In the original series we were treated to some hilariously cheesy special effects and we got our fair share of William Shatner's overacting. Yet it was all covered up by the incredible stories that were so far ahead of their time, and yet so relevant to the time period. Each episode treated the viewer to a fascinating science fiction adventure story that had a very relevant undertone of social commentary.\n\nThe plot of Star Trek: The Motion Picture could have possibly worked very well as one episode of the series, but when it is elongated to a feature film it loses so much in the process. The film took forever to get anywhere. The first half hour is the reintroduction of Kirk and then the slow sweeping shots of the Enterprise that last forever and pan over every single nook and cranny of that ship. Now, this I can understand because for people of the time period Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. It was the first new image of the Enterprise anyone had seen for ten years, so I can't blame the filmmakers for quenching any and all thirsts for new images of the glamorous ship. But after we are reintroduced to all our beloved characters and the movie really gets going, it loses all its momentum and only shuffles along.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture is what it is. I can respect it in relation to its time period as the grand return of the beloved Star Trek, but when so many other Star Trek films and TV series exist today that are wildly superior to this one, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is not really worth the watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Leonard Nimoy once noted what looks obvious with this movie. They were trying to make something more akin to 2001: A Space Odyssey than Star Trek. Looking back and being able to view all these movies out of the context of time, this movie is easy to pass over in favor of something else. However, what was going on in 1979? A non stop onslaught of Sci Fantasy born because of the massive success of Star Wars. New Sci Fi and Science Fantasy was suddenly everywhere. Logan's Run, Buck Rogers, Blake's 7, Battlestar Galactica, and these are just the new TV shows produced with a bend toward space. Even James Bond ended up floating around up there in Moonraker. Star Trek: The Motion Picture went in a direction sci fi movies were going 10 years earlier with 2001 A Space Odyssey. Ive read that a Star Trek movie was in the works for years before it happened so maybe that's why it seems out of step with the times when it was released. Yes, if you are looking for action in thpse early 70s movies, you simply were not going to find it because the goal was to be more philosophical. The early 70s original version of Solaris is more akin to this Star Trek movie. This sci fi carried over to the first season of Space:1999 too. There were some fighting scenes that season but that action took a back seat to some profound stories and concepts. There was even a story similar to this one in the first season of that show called Voyager's Return though the probe had a profoundly different impact on the alien lifeforms it encountered. This type of Sci Fi on screen was all thrown out by 1978 when Star Wars and Alien started the trend away fro thought provoking ideas.\n\nI do enjoy this movie more now since I don't expect it to be traditional Star Trek. It doesnt having much to do with the original series except for the cast and the type of ending. The cast do not have many good scenes together. The pacing is not so slow to me. It isn't nearly as jarring in that regard as Star Trek V The Final Frontier was. The Enterprise sets out to make contact, does and then there is the conclusion. The twists are blended in and the special effects carry them over.\n\nI wouldn't recommend a casual fan of Star Trek to watch this over most of the movies made but if you like the 2001ish Sci Fi I mentioned above, then this movie might be something you would enjoy alot."

Despite not piloting a space mission for a number of years, Captain James T Kirk and his crew are tasked with intercepting and investigating the alien spacecraft before it reaches its target.\n\nGiven the premise surrounding this film I had a reasonable belief that the film would have some sense of urgency about it (after all the crux of the plot focuses on Kirk and his crew preventing an alien spacecraft reaching Earth). However, what I actually saw here was something vastly different to what I was expecting...\n\nInstead of this I was taken on a very long, slow and dull journey in which very little actually happened; there's practically no action or incidents and we only really learn anything about the alien spacecraft until right at the end (by which point I was almost comatosed from boredom). The only time the picture really got my attention was when the alien spacecraft attacks the USS Enterprise and we witness a lengthy slow-motion montage of the spacecraft attacking the ship and its crew; however to me this was more hilarious than scary based on how over-staged it felt. Director Robert Wise has to take the brunt of the blame however for directing at a glacial pace and in an overly serious manner.\n\nAnother issue I took with this film lay with the characters and some of their performances; I'll confess that I haven't watched the TV Series, but if this is an example of how they engage with each other in the series then it most definitely gives me no incentive to what the original series. There's not much dynamism or camaraderie between a lot of the characters and some of the acting is a little wooden as well.\n\nI must confess that I watched the 2009 version of Star Trek and thought that was a fantastic film and had I watched this film first I may have rated it a little higher, but compared to JJ Abrams re-imagining which was fun. energetic, well-developed and exciting The Motion Picture comes across as slow, uninvolving and boring."

        "review_detailed_main": "A colossal, mysterious space cloud called V'ger travels across the galaxy and threatens Earth, annihilating interlopers along the way ; the origins of V'ger are revealed at the end.\n\n\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979) addresses some of the deepest questions of life: Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those found the film boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.\n\nLike the Star Trek episodes \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" \"The Motion Picture\" (TMP) is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic; or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: \"As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at some time in our lives turns to someone - a father, a brother, a God - and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.\"\n\nAnother powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).\n\nMy conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: \"My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did.\" In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained ; put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and relish the movie magic.\n\nLet me add that TMP was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit, a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\" (1986), TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films with the whole original cast (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films \"Alien\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" both released the same year.\n\nI should add that, although this film is an \"Grade A\" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of \"The Cage\" than \"The Doomsday Machine.\"\n\nTMP is the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Actually, TMP is leagues better IMHO. \"2001\" lacks characters to care about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences. TMP, by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.\n\nSay what you will, but \"The Motion Picture\" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series - a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.\n\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A"

On the plus side, the film did get off to a rousing start both visually and sonically (Jerry Goldsmith's score is stellar) and the special effects were good for their time. The acting is competent. All of the original beloved cast knew their characters and the newcomers were good as well. But like I said the film just drags too much. More than several of the vignettes could've been shortened. I should also mention the production value and the special features on the Director's Cut DVD are of very high quality. It's too bad the main feature isn't worthy of them. 5.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "8 September 2010. Thirty one years later, this movie seems dated with inferior special effects, particularly in the beginning, on Vulcan and other superimposed features that seem to be artificially moving on the screen. There is the prolonged musical and lengthy introduction the Starship Enterprise following 2001: A Space Odyssey's (1968) in their prolonged musical approach to the Space Station in orbit around earth. There is a lot of set up, introductions, shake downs (going into warp drive scene) that in contemporary terms would be boring and listlessly inactive as non-action and unnecessary. In 1979, this was a director with a new toy, experimenting and showing off a new vision of the elements of the Star Trek with a larger budget. But understanding the nature of the movie and the times it was released, the built up anticipation of Trek fans, the focus on detail is somewhat understandable. Unfortunately, outside of that context, the movie has aged and rust spots have appeared. Even so the unknown menace in this movie remains one of the most intriguing in sci fi movie history in appearance and overall immensity of the threat. Like Forbidden Planet (1956), this original Star Trek has as its core a solid, inspiring sci fi revelation of the mysterious unknown and established like Alien (1979) released the same year, a fascinating and involving movie experience in the sci fi genre though the latter has held up better. Some of the images and the eerie immersion into the visual and ominous or brilliant submersion into the sci fi experience has been rarely exceeded since.\n\nBone's entrance scene is both wooden and authentic and mature, a mixed presentation. The set design especially of the Enterprise is both simple, modern, elegant, yet also almost artificial and makeshift in its presentation. The color scheme as on earth are at times almost comic-book crass, yet sharp and clear. As a plus, this movie version has seat restraints available for bridge crew, something even most sci fi movies even today fail to incorporate, also a nice display of computer graphical sequences that rival any sci fi portrayal in existence today.\n\nAs Star Trek (2009) was heavily dependent or respective of the music of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), so does the original movie use and reflect back on the original television series (1966) theme music and voice over narration used in the series. Spock's little personal voyage outside of the Enterprise will be replicated in a different fashion in A Mission To Mars (2000) climatic reveal scene. Spock's own personal trek of self-discovery is also a subplot of interest in this movie, the would find a parallel experience with Lt. Commander Data's own personal struggles that occurred in the Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987).\n\nWhether the purportedly emotional divisions scenes are compelling or simply tokenism can be debated (that between Stephen Collins and Williams Shatner and Shatner's exposure to weakness or the romance angle and the distinctly different form of its resolution). Does Captain's Kirk's personality and character become more than two-dimensional television figure in this larger than life feature film version? Are the attempts at challenging Kirk's seeming invincibility and inward introspection really believable or just a superficial attempt? And what about Spock's interaction with the Enterprise crew with long pregnant pauses, in some ways are as awkward as the seeming artificiality as when Spock is first seen in the episode the Menagerie Part II (1966) and yet there is a sense of authenticity to it at the same time.\n\nBut the primary focus, the experience of first contact is intense and riveting as any in sci fi movie history. Yet the eventual Lost in Translation (2003) approach to immersing into the alien landscape can be both plodding or meditatively pure depending on one's perspective. Like First Spaceship on Venus (1960), there is a new level of sensory experience, perhaps even more thrilling than 2001: A Space Odyssey's psychedelic stargate sequence. As for the particular facial cuts are both haughty use of superficial expressions and long sequences of pretty Christmas-like lights or a running sequence of the actual glimpses of travel into the unknown of eerie, wonderful and bewildering sights. The music by Jerry Goldsmith (nominated for an Oscar for best original musical score) is haunting and majestic at the same time.\n\nThe alien probe scene is at once seemingly photographically amateur in appearance and stilted and yet also quite authentic and genuine in the old fashioned film hand-held canister camera fashion like today's hand held videos of The Blair Witch Project (1999) today. But rarely has the immense scale of an experience been filmed or portrayed in any sci fi movie as seen Wavelength (1983) ending scene using a much more simplistic object or the sense of immensity as with Alien (1979) and the Nostromo and the context of the alien planet itself or even 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) when the space ship Discovery is in proximity to Jupiter and the strange alien monolith.\n\nIn the end, the movie's underlying premise is one of emotions, the search for meaning and self-identity, in the face of loneliness and the need for love. The movie contains the universal call for tenderness and connectivity - like an intelligent, lost puppy. The path to a solution comes from the sense of enlightened and humorous tender firmness that has underlain the original television version itself (of Dr. Bones' astute dry humor, Spock's fusion of logic rationality with feelings, and Kirk's instinctiveness perception of the nature of things). The end for some can be considered as a man's ultimate dream fantasy, for other's it may come as a overly fancy, simplistic answer covered over with the sound effects reminiscent of the earlier sci fi movie classic, Forbidden Planet (1956). Overall, this movie still retains its powerful serious hardcore sci fi integrity in both plot and visual and auditory intensity regardless of its aging and outdated, sometimes wooden appearance."

I paid the then ridiculous sum of 6$. While waiting outside (it was a warm December) the theater gave us glazed donuts and a small slip of paper (Long Lost) that said we were seeing the first showing in North America. This was what, as a Star Trek fan, a proud TREKKIE who'd been watching since 1966, waited for. Star Trek on the big screen!\n\nWhat a disappointment. Dull, contrived story which ripped off two better TV episodes, The Changeling and the Doomsday Machine. Some wooden acting in parts. Yes, the SFX were great, but, Star Trek 2, which reused some of these SFX and had about half the budget, is a far better, far more memorable film. So what went wrong? Roddenberry. He wrote a bad movie and an unfinished script and dumped it on Robert Wise. The SFX in some scenes (since repaired) are rushed, and the ending is quite lame. Yes, one of the lesser entries."

Lenoard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley were excellent as the foil friends from the original series. Shatner was good as the late 70s all-American that we all know he is. The focus is on him for the first half of the film, but by the time V'ger appears, the film has shifted focus to the characters around him (notably, Spock, Decker, and V'ger) I won't give away the ending, although the chances are that if you're reading this, you probably know it already, but it is basically what happens in 2001, except the shoe is on the other foot, or perhaps both feet.\n\nBut there goes my \"pedilection for irrelevancy\" again.

Linkara: Yeah, Why? JWB: Just asking.\n\nI would talk about the cast here but that would only make my Review to long but you and always check out my full version on my Review Page on facebook (JWB's Reviews)\n\nAfter watching this from my Stardate collection on Blu-Ray as a 50th Annaversary, This was my response after watching it... WHAT THE GARBAGE WAS THIS MOVIE?! This was a mess and even though the cast where great at there roles like in the 1966 series, But sure the costumes didn't match what was shown in the show and the story was really convoluted but what really let's it down was its lack of action and over-reliance on special effects. no wonder it got mixed reviews from critics, But it was fortunate enough to get $139 million at the box office worldwide, But falling short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to propose a cheaper sequel. So yeah Not the best way to start off a Movie series, but they got better later on as we face the Wrath of Khan!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with the criticism of so many viewers to STTMP is that they were fans of the original series and had trouble with seeing their pet universe altered and expanded from the familiar. What makes this film so great is that for the first time, the starship Enterprise and her crew, all having moved on from the first five year mission, have evolved. You knew when you heard the overture with the haunting Ilea's Theme that something special was about to happen, and then suddenly, the Jerry Goldsmith Fanfare and Theme breaks onto the Screen. I remember sitting and watching this film by myself the night before it opened to the public (I was a movie projectionist at the time) and just broke into tears, the emotion of having these beloved characters back in action.\n\nAdded to that the film was helmed by one of the great directors of all time Robert Wise, who had given the world such great films as \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"The Haunting\" among so many others. A lot of people ran this film down because we were not killing off the bad aliens or some such, but that had never been the intention of Gene Roddenberry, who's hopes was that Star Trek would help people to see that we could have a better world.\n\nWHile some people claim that the film was too slow, or too boring, I look at it like this. Without this film, we might never have had four more Star Trek Series and the other movies. It was one of Paramount Studio's greatest assets (Thanks to of all people Lucille Ball) and yet had to struggle to escape the constant muddling of incompetent studio executives and fight for life. That is the true triumph of \"Star Trek the Motion Picture.\""

The fact it's the first film means it must be given leniency as well, and for a first effort it's not a total disaster by any means.

The story is solid, the visual effects are stunning, the score is incredible, and all the elements that made Star Trek a hit are there.

Imagine if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman had walked into the Paramount offices and slammed THIS script on the table: A slow, solemn, philosophically dense adventure into a cloud of gas, with barely an action scene in sight and no conventional enemy.\n\nAlmost a decade previously, Robert Wise directed The Andromeda Strain, the quintessential \"hard\" sci-fi of the 1970s, where the emphasis was on the science, and the action took place on computer readouts. And two decades before that he made The Day the Earth Stood Still, a 1950s monster movie without a monster, standing out at the time for its seriousness.\n\nStar Trek The Motion Picture could be seen as Wise's homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are lengthy sequences (I'm talking 10 minutes at a time) basically constituted of extended fly-bys of Douglas Trumbull's still-extraordinary special effects. Throughout, there's an admirable dedication to awe, something often missing from modern sci-fi, where a black hole is no more than a flying mouth and spacetime is traversed in a shrug.\n\nIf only there'd been equivalent care shown to the characters. Unfortunately, they are reduced to mere tour guides on this fantastic adventure, showing us when to gaze agape in wonderment, and verbalising what is frankly apparent from the images. The ending is like the birth of the Starchild with a director's commentary rambling over the top.\n\nKirk (William Shatner, subtle in portraying the humility of his out-of-practice captain) and Spock (the monolithic Leonard Nimoy) are present, and the friendship is as tender and fraught as ever - but they have only one really good scene together. Instead, the focus is on the star-cross'd relationship between the Deltan Ilia (a chilling Persis Khambatta) and acting-captain Decker (Stephen Collins), which is sadly rather drab and unconvincing.\n\nThe Motion Picture may not be the finest film in the original Star Trek series, but it's certainly the most distinctive and the strangest - a far, far cry from Star Trek IV's terrestrial comedy. What it lacks in humour and emotional resonance, The Motion Picture makes up for with its grand scope and vision, sometimes sparking the senses and stirring the imagination."

I wasn't around to witness the theatrical release of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (it was seven years before I was born), but from what I've read, it didn't get very positive feedback, which I can now fully understand. After watching it for the first time not long ago, I sure hope it was the last time as well, and I know many others could say the same about the time they watched it.\n\nIn this movie, the five-year mission on the U.S.S. Enterprise is now over. The ship has since been redesigned, and now has a new captain, Willard Decker. However, when a strange, destructive cloud is discovered as it travels through space, and is reported to be headed for Earth, Admiral James T. Kirk is sent to reclaim command of the Enterprise. With the other original crew members from the five-year mission (such as Mr. Spock, Lt. Cmdr. Uhura, Lt. Cmdr. Hikaru Sulu, Cmdr. Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, and Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy), along with new crew members, the U.S.S. Enterprise is now on a mission into space to stop this cloud and save the Earth!\n\n\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" is very slow-paced, which isn't always a bad thing. However, in addition to the slowness in this film, not much really happens in it at all. Throughout the film, crew members very rarely ever leave the ship, and even when one or more of them does, they don't go anywhere interesting. To make it worse, this first installment in the \"Star Trek\" movie franchise is rather long (over two hours in length), so this dullness goes on for a very long time! While watching the film, I had trouble keeping up with what was happening, but didn't care! Basically, the only positive thing I can say about \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" is that one quote from McCoy (\"Spock, this 'child' is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth. Now, what do you suggest we do? Spank it?\") put a very slight and brief smile on my face, but one mildly amusing quote obviously can't save the film. I get the feeling I'm even being too generous giving this movie a 4/10!\n\n\"Star Trek\" was a groundbreaking TV series in the sci-fi genre, and got itself many die-hard fans. Fans had to wait a while for the first movie to finally be made, but when it finally happened, they were in for a huge disappointment! Fortunately, a handful of movies followed \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" in the franchise, and there are definitely much better ones than this! No matter how big a Trekkie you may be, there's likely no guarantee that you will enjoy this movie! In fact, I suggest you avoid it unless you want over two hours of what isn't really that far from staring at a blank screen for that long! No wonder this movie has often been referred to as \"Star Trek: The Motionless Picture\"!"

My eyes were glued to the screen! Absolute hypnotism. It persuades the audience to its own sense of wonder. Truly fantastic. However, the first half of this movie is very misguided. Lots of nothing. People staring, having pointless conversation. Basically feels like a lot of stalling. I must admit that this first half sets a foundation to the movie, introducing plot points that are (nearly) crucial to the latter half.

All of this does not add to what could have been a suspenseful movie, but Wise seems to have forgotten what the appeal of the Star Trek TV show was and it was not the special effects. The sets were simple, but the relationships were well constructed which helped overcome the campiness that was present in a lot of the episodes. Despite the huge amount of money used to create this movie, there was enough interest from the fans to have many sequels(this actually was a good thing because everyone of them have been better than this one.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "In case you didn't know, this movie was rushed together in response to the overwhelming success of 'Star Wars' (1978). I'm sure that hardcore Trekies can tell you why it took everyone so long to make a film version of the cult classic television show... Also, someone probably knows why the show was canceled if everyone thought it was so great. I was never a fan. I had low expectations for this film.\n\nAs a film, this kinda sucks. Most of the dialog is laughable. Most of the effects are cheesy and bad. Kirk and Spock seem really old. Most of the acting is cartoonishly stiff. The story was pretty good, and I enjoyed the ending. Persis Khambatta was surprisingly sexy as Ilia, and she kept me somewhat interested. Jerry Goldsmith orchestrated a great musical score. However, I need a little more than good music and a sexy bald chick to devote 140 minutes to a film.\n\nFor Star Trek fans, I'm sure this was the greatest thing since peanut butter. For a normal person that lives in reality, there is better science fiction out there. This film is way too dated for me to ever watch again.\n\nRealReview Posting Scoring Criteria: Acting - 0.5/1; Casting - 1/1; Directing - 0.5/1; Story - 1/1; Writing/Screenplay - 0.5/1;\n\nTotal Base Score = 3.5\n\nModifiers (+ or -): Music Score/Soundtrack: +1 ( Jerry Goldsmith );\n\nTechnical Effects/Make Up: -0.5 (There were some good effects in the last 20 minutes, but most of the effects in this movie were embarrassing. For a reference of available effects capabilities at the time, see 'Star Wars' (1978). );\n\nEditing-Too Long: -0.5 (The first 40 seconds are orchestra with no picture. There are about 5 minutes of Kirk in a pod, examining the changes to The Enterprise.);\n\nCultural Significance: +1 (Star Trek is a cultural phenomenon.);\n\nTotal RealReview Rating: 4.5 (rounded up to 5 for IMDB)"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, no \"Star Trek Movie\" is great science fiction, when compared to the likes of \"Things to Come,\" \"Forbidden Planet\" or \"2001 a Space Odyssey\". However, it sure is fun stuff to watch. Read my review of \"Forbidden Planet,\" and you will see how I judge sci-fi. The best science fiction is pure science fiction, and \"Star Trek, the Motion Picture\" is the purest of all the ST sci-fi stories. The rest, be they \"Wrath of Khan\" or \"The Voyage Home\" (aka Save the Whales), are just Space Cowboys.\n\nSTTMP, as is proper to science fiction, projects how human beings of the future cope with physical paradigms which are completely unknown to us. In this case, it's a knowledge acquisition machine which is doing its job so well that it is acquiring anything and everything in its path, including whole galaxies. This is mind blowing stuff! There are both physical and metaphysical questions here, as well as the obvious question of how the hell to stop the thing. Even the inevitable love interest is resolved in a sci-fi way.\n\nI don't know what audiences and critics were expecting with STTMP - obviously not story - but the low ratings and review pans are, in my book, totally undeserved. Maybe with time there will be a re-appraisal."

        "review_detailed_main": "Written by two experienced TV writers and a science fiction novelist, you would expect this movie to have more, well... character.\n\nThe only real story here is Spock discovering the value of his humanity, which is paralleled by V'ger's own identity crisis. Excellent grist for the mill. But the guys forget to turn the crank.\n\nThe reason many find it boring is because Star Trek TMP does not develop the core story nearly to the depth it deserves. Instead, we get very long sequences of spectacle which absolve Disney of all guilt for committing the crime of Spectacle First. And the spectacle does not age well. A lot of symmetrical optical camera work with some noticeable matte lines that ILM had figured out how to eliminate by then. But Dykstra was not part of ILM anymore and so he didn't get the memo. But I digress. Cool spectacle, but not a story.\n\nThe reason some fans defend this film is because there IS a kernel of a story which suits the Star Trek thematic aesthetic to a T. Who am I? Why am I here? Excellent thematic questions for a Star Trek movie. Explored by less than fifteen minutes of film. The rest is a long setup of two parties to a love interest clumsily attached to what little story there is, Kirk arguing with his younger XO, lots of Enterprise hero shots and Wormhole Follies. Yes, the end is climactic. But it is curiously uninteresting because they forgot to set up the story to its full potential. And it actually doesn't make sense in relation to the all-too-quiet story buried in all that celluloid.\n\nI can almost hear one of these guys saying, \"Hey fellas, we need to come up with 120 minutes of something for them to shoot. And we're running out of time.\" And what they came up was a bunch of filler that could have stuffed the memory of Lucas's EditDroid.\n\nThe reason it's lambasted: You had something here. Why didn't you do something with it?\n\nThe reason it's defended: You had something here. We'll just ignore the fact you didn't do anything with it.\n\nFor this Trekkie, it's a sad disappointment because I can see how grand this movie could have been. If only it hadn't missed its own point. Instead, we get a movie left in the shadow of Wrath of Khan, an archetype-driven western we all love but should have paled in comparison to what we could have seen here."

        "review_detailed_main": "Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) with crew (Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelly, Majel Barret, Walter Koenig, George Takei, James Doohan, and Nichelle Nichols) joined with two new members Decker (Stephen Collins) and bald female alien Illea (Persis Khambatta) as they take a new mission on their newly reinvented U.S.S. Enterprise. Their mission to find a mysterious alien spaceship that has wiped out a few Klingon ships before it heads towards Earth to destroy it.\n\nA very good but somewhat slow start to a uber-cool Star Trek film series which is based on the classic sci-fi TV show. The original cast is reunited 10 years later in this film event of 1979 that made audiences believe that Star Trek could live again but on film. Director Robert Wise and creator/producer Gene Roddenberry did a nice job bringing the show to the big screen and Jerry Goldsmith's main score for this movie became the theme score to \"Star Trek The Generation\". The special effects were good for it's time even the production design even though it doesn't have any action like this movie's sequels. The brand new cut that came out in 2001 really improved the movie with scenes that make sense, better pacing and enhanced special effects.\n\nIt's a good beginning but the sequel is better."

This is punctuated only by incessant changes of uniform. The cast, are all present as is their ship what they lack is a worthy mission.\n\nTo be fair the engagement with Klingons means something actually does happen, all be it briefly, early in the film. With that aside all that follows are images of what can only be described as fake natural beauty spots in outer space. (Well maybe Im exaggerating)\n\nThe interplay between Kirk, Spock and Bones makes a welcome return and there may be something for die-hard trekkies in this film. After 2 hours of viewing however my feeling was just let the damn thing hit earth and have done with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it a couple of times since but have never viewed the director's cut DVD. I liked this movie. Veteran director Robert Wise had worked in the sci-fi genre before directing a couple of my favorite sci-fi flicks in The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Andromeda Strain so I expected this would be good and I wasn't disappointed. This has been widely criticized as slow and awkward and lacking cowboys-in-space shoot-em-up-thrill ride style of Star Wars but that didn't affect me at all. The story by Alan Dean Foster could have been a little better worked through by screenwriter Harold Livingstone and whoever else had a hand in it but the end result is a good film. Robert Wise, toward the end of his long career may not have been the best choice to tackle this project and probably should have went to a younger director who could have more firmly handled all the inevitable problems this film would face. Dealing with Paramount studio executives and the egos of the reunited original Star Trek cast while balancing an inflated working budget and a huge technical cast and at the same time delivering a product on time and in competition with a revival in sci-fi space epics to please a cult base audience and appeal to a wider general audience and be true to the original series and it's creator Gene Roddenberry. Wow! Impossible after a 10 year hiatus of Star Trek. Elements that would doom a picture to failure but Wise delivered, admittedly a flawed film, but a good film nonetheless. Nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Effects for the team lead by Douglas Trumball, John Dykstra and Richard Yurich. I liked how it unfolded after a decade since we saw the Enterprise and her crew last. kirk is now an Admiral in the star fleet and is eager to get back at the helm of his former and now revamped ship. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, James Dohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nicols and Walter Koenig are all back from the original TV series along with Stephen Collins and Persis Khambata. Bones McCoy is reluctant to give up his comfortable occupation on Earth and return to space and is paranoid about the transporter because of all the problems he's seen with the people it transports not being reassembled correctly with hideous results. We also see how big the detentions of the Enterprize really is as it hovers in dry dock above earth and shuttles and repair crews fly around it. Kirk treats it like a hot rod to the discernment of Scottie and wants to blast out into hyperspace instead of breaking it in. We get to see in perspective how fast the ship really is as it goes into it's warp speeds blasting from earth's orbit past the planets of the solar system and into deep space in less than a minute. Great music score from Jerry Goldsmith and great special effects and the Voyager spacecraft that had been launched by NASA three years before this films release shows up here too. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have a confession to make: I had never watched a Star Trek Movie with the exceptions of the 2009 movie and Into Darkness (2012), so I am brand new to this media franchise. I have decided to binge through all the movie in anticipation of Star Trek: Section 31 (2025) and that journey begins with Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Well after watching it, I understand why people call this Star Trek: The Slow-Motion Picture because it's boring.\n\nPositives for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979): For me, it's always going to be a delight to watch older movies of older media franchises and I will appreciate that aspect of these first time watches no matter what. I certainly liked the cast of characters and actors here with William Shatner as James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy, James Doohan as Montgomery Scott, Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, Persis Khambatta as Ilia and Stephen Collins as Willard Decker. There is some good interactions between these characters throughout the movie. The movie's score by Jerry Goldsmith is phenomenal And finally, the special effects and practical effects are amazing.\n\nNegatives for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979): This was not the best introduction I've had with a media franchise in a very long time. It's worth noting that the script for this movie was originally supposed to be a pilot episode for a new Star Trek show, but they scrapped that idea and instead made a movie with a lot of filler. While, I did like all of the practical and visual effects here, you can tell that the filmmakers stretched out scenes with people being amazed by these great effects for the sole purpose of making this movie over 2-hours long. I also struggled to figure out what the story of this movie was supposed to be because nothing was happening at all. And finally, I was appalled by how dickish Kirk was being to Decker when he took away Decker's position as the captain of the USS Enterprise and this is coming from someone who's heard about the jackass William Shatner was towards the other Star Trek cast members.\n\nOverall, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) is a boring slug of a movie with nothing to offer fans of the original TV show, but thankfully it's all uphill from here mostly."

What makes a great sci-fi movie is the STORY, and this movie has one of the best plots I saw. Contrarily to its sequels, the heart of the story is sci-fi. And that's the point. It goes into deep subjects and the final is truly amazing. And, added to this, it has the mystics of characters like Kirk and Spock.\n\nThe sequels have nice stories and all that, but they're not good Science Fiction. For example, the story behind The Wrath Of Khan has lots in common with Mobby Dick (!), which is hardly science fiction. They have some interesting science fiction elements (like the Genesis experiment) but those elements are not in the heart of the story.\n\nThis movie appeals more to fans of movies like Blade Runner and 2001, not movies like Star Wars, which are completely different. I'm sure most people who criticized this movie also consider Blade Runner and 2001 boring."

A powerful alien cloud has destroyed three powerful Klingon vessels in one swipe and is headed for Earth. Kirk and co. return to face the entity in the USS Enterprise, refitted after it's legendary five year mission.\n\nThe first thing that hit me when I first saw this on beta-max twelve years ago (I still had the machine and the tape of the TV version then and still have it now!) was the music. It was hauntingly beautiful. It felt as though it BELONGED in the movie. Although the theme was used throughout in many altered versions, the main theme used at the end was the best version. Not only was it graceful, but it stuck in your mind long after the movie had finished. Many a time I found myself whistling the tune without knowing it. The special effects were mind blowing when I first saw it and, I suppose, still are (The little kid in me still thrills when he sees them!) even though I am now twenty-two. The video version is a good film. A bit difficult to follow (considering that they only had a few months to film the movie AND do the special effects!) but still a good movie. Now the DVD version comes along and the movie gets a rebuff. Recut, re-scored and new effects, Robert Wise's vision finally got the version it deserved Twenty-six years after it was released. Side by side, the Directors edition wins because it's more understandable, the effects are better than before, it moves along at a cracking pace and is all the more better for it. On the other hand, the video version also wins because it is a testament of human endeavour to get something done on time and that the effects were the best at the time (and I suppose still are!). If you can, get hold of the 1979 video version and the 2003 DVD version and compare them for yourself. I just think both versions are cracking pieces of entertainment in their own right."

Thankfully, the producers and directors learned from the mistakes and would next give us the best of the Star trek film series, Wrath of Kahn. Pretentous, overwrought, and simply way too long considering the story, this was not the way to start off, and even many trekkies lament that this was without a doubt the worst of the Star Trek movies, an as time goes on, the movie has almost become unwatchable. Granted, they did well with what had to be a small budget, and tried to invoke some imagination into the rather implausible story. however, the rather dry, bland uniforms, slow pace, and even some of the cast seemed embarrassed to be there. By the time the story is over, you're left with several questions, and one of which is what the hell did i Just see? The only was that this film should be in anyone collection is if the one a trekkie, and simply want to have the whole series of films. Other then that, this is the weakest of the Star Trek films, and overall should be avoided. For those new to Trek, watch 2-6 before you watch the first one. SInce the first story has no bearing on future films, like all other stories would, you won't be missing anything."

However, the more I see of Star Trek (the five series, the nine films), as well as the more sci-fi I read, I've come to feel that this film is by far the best of all of them. It truly captures the Trek mantra: \"to seek out new life forms\". It is majestic and gives a good sense of our place in the universe. Not the center, but a small part. Anyone who thinks that TMP is too slow really expects that all science-fiction is Star Wars with lasers blasting and WWII-style dogfights. Although that type of science-fiction has its place and can be very enjoyable, if well done, an important part of science-fiction is to instill a sense of wonder about the universe. Yes, character development is important, but without the \"sci-fi\" setting, it might as well be a plain-vanilla story."

But for God sake, why didn't they include a script that sounded like it had been done BEFORE production began, or wasn't improvised as they filmed. Even though this movies has several short comings, dullness and boredom are the main ones. It is nice to see everyone back on the bridge of the Enterprise.

However, most of the time it actually succeeds in being profound, a rare achievement for Hollywood. Combine this with an entertaining script and you have a blockbuster formula.\n\nThe changes made for the Director's Cut are all worthwhile, most of them enormously improving what was already a very good film. A great job was done with this, and if you haven't seen the new cut it's well worth a rental.\n\nApparently this movie did very well at the theater. Why it's so maligned now, I have no clue. They really don't make movies like this anymore, particularly Star Trek movies. In other reviews I've heard this compared to Star Trek 5 (the worst of the series) and my jaw dropped nearly to the floor. Did certain other reviewers see the same film than I did? Maybe it's because the film plays best on the big screen, and not as well on small television sets. I was lucky enough to see it at the theater, and thoroughly enjoyed it. 4/5 stars, or 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies you sit down to watch, and expect it to be really good. But the truth is, it isn't. It's drawn out, and I felt that a lot of the scenes could have been cut down to about half their length, and they still would have gotten their points across.\n\nAnd all the characters are so serious in this movie! They never act as seriously in the series as they do here in this movie--in fact, in some cases, I think they were acting quite out of character. Surely, one of them would have had the script changed or simply refuse to portray their character like that?\n\nI think that unless you like to watch the camera linger on the Starship Enterprise for a long time at the start of the movie, or you quite like seeing characters acting in a way that's completely out of character for what's already established as normal behavior for them, you'll find this movie to be a bit boring."

        "review_detailed_main": "When a second Star Trek series got canned in the late seventies, Paramount and Roddenberry searched for a vehicle that could reignite the so so TV show that had developed legions of followers. The end result is this long, operatic and effect laden film directed by Robert Wise of West Side Story fame.\n\nThis film has ups and downs. The new Enterprise looks great, along with the still unexplained new look of the klingons. The deep and existential exploration recalls classic Kubrick in 2001.\n\nHowever it is these great things about the film that tear it down to casual viewers. It's slow, often painful pace will drive most viewers to go refill drinks during takes. Of particular note is what I call \"The Enterprise Parade.\" An extremely long take as Kirk makes his way to his old ship. It takes forever and the orchestral music will drive modern fans to tears, and not of beauty. Shatner's usual non acting as well as the complete lack of any comedy, make this a hard film to sit through.\n\nBut despite all that, this film still contains one of the best twists in sci-fi history and will please the more hardcore fans of trek. Still though, if your looking for action and fast pace, avoid this film like the plague, and go see Wrath of Khan."

        "review_title": "Don't bother with the theatrical cut, the extended versions are better",
        "review_detailed_main": "After a 10-year absence and a wildly successful syndication run, it was inevitable that STAR TREK would make a comeback. And what a rocky comeback it was. Several scripts were pitched for a movie and rejected, a planned TV revival fell apart (although the revival's pilot script was recycled into the final film), the project became a film whose budget was bloated by the costs of all the failed prior attempts (the film itself cost $25 million; the $20 million spent on all the other attempts boosted the budget to $45 million), the FX house hired to do the film ripped the studio off and forced Paramount to hire two other FX outfits to do the film under super-tight conditions, and ego clashes between Gene Roddenberry and screenwriter Harold Livingston resulted in the script being written as it as was filmed. And as a final insult, director Robert Wise was denied the chance to properly edit the film, and critical plot points were cut in order to emphasize the FX. The end result was STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, an unfinished film that left the cast feeling so betrayed that they almost didn't reunite for the sequel.\n\nI first saw this film when I was three years old, when it ran on ABC in its extended version. This is the version I grew up with, and it's the one that cemented my love for Classic TREK. The great scenes of Spock affirming his friendship for Kirk in the sickbay, Spock crying on the bridge out of the realization that he and V'ger are kindred spirits, the spectacular flyover where we saw the Enterprise in drydock (never before or since in any other incarnation of TREK has the Enterprise looked more gorgeous than it did in the first six movies), the hilarious scene where Sulu makes a fool of himself in front of Ilia, Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score\u0085all of that stuff enthralled me as a kid. Then I saw the theatrical version, which LACKED all of the good stuff in the ABC broadcast\u0085and man, did it suck. Watching that version made me see why the film was so savaged upon its release. Then along comes Robert Wise, deciding to do a final re-edit of the movie (which he didn't get to do back in 1979) and complete the film as he intended. The end result is an amalgam of the lifeless theatrical version and the character-rich ABC broadcast, complete with new CGI FX sequences that were planned for the original release but weren't completed in time.\n\nSo how does the new, \"finished\" cut stack up? Well, I'm disappointed that the Sulu-Ilia exchange was left out, as was the \"sexually immature species\" joke that ended the scene, and I really wish Wise had used the Kirk-McCoy argument from the ABC version instead of the theatrical version. (The theatrical version makes Kirk look like a arrogant creep, the ABC version shows him tormented over his feuding with Decker and shamefully agreeing with McCoy's criticism). Thankfully, the cut scenes are included as supplements on the DVD. But overall, Wise's final edit of the film is very good. The subplot of Spock's bond with V'ger is restored to its rightful prominence, the pacing is tighter and sharper (it moves a tad faster than in the other versions), and all but one of the new FX scenes are excellent (the asteroid explosion in the wormhole is greatly improved on, we actually get to see what the V'ger exterior looks like, Vulcan actually looks like Vulcan now, etc.). But the scene where the points of light form a bridge from V'ger to the Enterprise looks like something out of a video game. (Oh, well, you gotta try, right?) The film still has the same old flaws: the acting and direction are both unsteady at times, largely because Gene Roddenberry interfered with Livingston so badly that script revisions were constantly delayed and because the film is largely confined to the bridge crew reacting to what's on the viewscreen. That, and the Starfleet uniforms suck. Not only do they look like skintight pajamas, but there's no color to them at all. In fact, the whole Enterprise is so gray and beige that in the rare moments when you see orange cushions or blue and purple lights, they burst out like beacons. The ship and costumes are too dull and lifeless, especially compared to the colorful uniforms and ship decor of the follow-ups. And while the late Persis Khambatta is serviceable as Ilia, she looks awful without hair. Even the Paramount execs realized it was a stupid idea to shave her head. Would it really have been so hard to let her keep her hair and give her some body markings like the Trills in other TREK incarnations? It certainly would have looked less ridiculous. And the storyboards on the DVD are pathetic; they look like they were drawn by a 5-year old.\n\nBut for all that, the director's cut still casts an enchanting spell, because it retains the character-rich feel of the ABC broadcast and avoids the plodding emptiness of the theatrical cut. That said, the film is not for everyone. I fully understand why this film is a love-hate deal. But for those who like the film, the DVD is highly recommended, if for no other reason than for the three documentaries covering the making of the film and Wise's re-edit. The interviews with script doctor Jon Povill, Livingston, Stephen Collins (who played Will Decker), and others are fascinating. William Shatner is especially insightful and thoughtful in his interview for the DVD, which makes for a marked contrast with his silliness on the STAR TREK II DVD. If you disliked the theatrical version of ST: TMP, maybe Wise's re-edit will be more palatable to you. The best way to describe this film is that it deals with the mind of STAR TREK, while the sequels are more about the heart."

Someone who is use to the close knit friendships that appear in the original series might not see this as much in the film; accept for McCoy's occasional wry humor. For someone who knows nothing about Star Trek and its characters this movie might have more appeal. I do enjoy this film. It is a refreshing new look at the Star Trek universe, and has some great special effects. I give this film an 8 out of 10. The second movie Star Trek II the Wrath of Kahn would prove better and bring back some of the friendships that existed from the series."

The studio even went to the lengths of hiring Robert Wise, the director of one of the greatest sci-fi pictures of all time, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" to take charge here, to no avail. It no doubt occurred to Wise to wonder why 136 minutes of Trek didn't equal 92 minutes of Day."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a mess; the acting is uniformly stiff, the effects work is shoddy, the lighting is flat, the photography is poor, the costuming is dated...BUT...there are many things that work well. This film has one of the best scores ever written (Jerry Goldsmith really should have won the Oscar that year) and there were some great concepts thrown around. What is the nature of life itself? What defines intelligence? What is a soul? In other words, this movie was classic \"Star Trek\" but with a much larger budget. Like the original series, it had some great moments but it also had some clunkers. To the credit of the film makers, there are some memorable sequences. It was brave to spend five minutes giving Kirk (and us) a fly-around of the \"Enterprise\" in space dock. Also unusual were the voyage through the V'ger cloud and the fly-over of V'ger itself. Again, these are long sequences where nothing really happens in terms of story. Audiences are so conditioned to see plot mechanics in motion that their butts twitch when \"nothing happens\", but this movie asks you sit back and see the wonder of things. Also, the scenes involving the \"Enterprise\" being caught in a wormhole and the probe from V'ger terrorizing the bridge are intense assaults of light and sound that, when over, cause sighs of relief. When they end, it's akin to waking up from a dream. The biggest problem may have been with the plot itself. The \"Enterprise\" crew are not pro-active; they are reactive throughout this film. They simply sit around and have things done to them. They figure out how to solve one problem and the next arises. This is not good storytelling. While the feeling of being overwhelmed by something that cannot be understood is well executed, the crew seem to be passengers in this movie. Frankly, who wants to see a bunch of people sit around and hope things turn out for the best? A bit of judicious editing, less rushed opticals, longer rehearsals, and a re-written script would have produced a far better film, but the production was plagued with problems and it shows onscreen. All in all, it may not be a great film but it had its moments and paved the way for far more \"Trek\" to come."

Considering this was 1979, the special effects are mediocre by 2020 standards. One can only imagine what this film would be like if it were made today. Once you get past the reintroduction of the original series characters (and some new ones), the updated Enterprise, and the plot premise, this film is hella boring. While the plot premise relies on philosophical matters that made for interesting television, it doesn't translate well on the big screen with a run time exceeding 2hours. It also establishes and confirms the opinion that odd number Star Trek films suck!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed this film in both the original form and in the director's cut. I saw absolutely nothing wrong with it. I don't understand why some Trekkies & Trekkers were so disappointed. Robert Wise did a terrific job of keeping the film on track (or Trek). It had terrific special effects, a terrific cast including newcomers to Trek, Persis Khambatta and Stephen Collins, great sets, new costumes, (replacing the cheesy velour shirts and tights with sharp looking uniforms was a great move), excellent props and a magnificent new music score by Jerry Goldsmith which is still in use on the franchise today as well as Alexander Courage's original theme. I thought the storyline was most involving with its surprise ending and the scope of the film on a large screen deftly illustrated the immensity of the Trek universe. The story begins with a couple of Klingon 'Bird of Prey' ships encountering an enormous, cloud-like anomaly moving through space. When it ignores their attempt at communication, they fire upon it and are annihilated. Meanwhile Spock, who is retired from Starfleet, senses its existence while on his home planet of Vulcan. The UFC (United Federation of Planets) also tracks it and learns it's heading straight on a path to Earth. The UFC decides to send its best crew to investigate. Naturally that would be the USS Enterprise crew, some of whom have retired, others who still tend to the ship. Eventually the whole cast is reunited and sets out on this desperate mission to save the Earth. The Genesis-like story has an interesting premise and some neat surprises. I am not a Trekkie or Trekker; I'm just a guy who likes Star Trek. I found this the perfect way to initiate the new Star Trek Movie franchise. I think many people had expectations that could not be fulfilled without disappointment. The film is a fine entry into a hopefully unending series."

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the most under-rated of all the Star Trek films. Visually its the most stunning (of the Star Trek series any many others). Many people are put off by the long visual scenes such as the long shots of the Enterprise as Kirk goes to board. This is the new revamped Enterprise for the movies! Scotty is showing not only Kirk in his fly-by but also the fans who have waited 10 years to see it return in its glory. Yes, it is supposed to be eye candy. The long shots of VGER are also great eye candy. It creates a menacing mood that cannot be obtained by simply getting glimpses of it. The shots remain long because the Enterprise is tip-toeing ever deeper into the unknown monster that is the biggest threat that would ever be to the Earth.\n\nThe character development is beautiful. Spock is perfectly paralleled to VGER in their search for completion of personal spirit. Spock begins troubled and doesn't know why he is pulled towards VGER until he finds his answers deep within it. Kirk struggles to regain his place on the Enterprise and recreate how things were when he was in charge.. He goes to the extent of drafting his friend McCoy (who really didn't need to be there since Nurse Chapel was the ship's doctor) and pursuing only a Vulcan to be science officer. McCoy was reluctant until Kirk made it clear that he was there because Kirk was incomplete in his mission without his old friend at his side.\n\nDecker (a captain whose father sacrificed himself to save the Earth in the old series) is introduced as a strong willed character who knows the re-fitted Enterprise well enough even to show Scotty where a transporter was broken. This character fit into the chemistry of McCoy, Spock, and Kirk without seeming out of place. It is solely through his interaction with the other character's that by the end the viewer really feels they've known Decker for longer. That is great character development!\n\nThe plot is pure philosophical and takes on the most challenging question ever posed... \"What is my purpose?\" The story is paced extremely well and is an example of Sci-Fi at it's best. If you're looking for fast-edited action, go rent ALIENS (a masterpiece in its own right) but if you want a film that'll tickle your intellect and overwhelm your senses, then try (or retry) The Motion Picture."

The so called special affects in this film are so poor it is amazing how they ever got the permission to make any more Star Trek movies (and i'm glad they did). It looked like the director got a new kalidascope lens for christmas for his camera and decided to use it fot most of the shots ,thinking it looked good! it does not , all it does is iritate the viewer. I wont go into the storyline , all i will say is that it as poor a story as you will ever have seen in any Star Trek film or episode and the acting is as just as bad.i will put that down to being rusty as i know they have done a lot better in the latter films.

But I have recently found a new appreciation for Star Trek the original series (thanks to it being on netflix). After watching the original show and then watching this I was transported back to what it must have felt like to watch this in the theatre for the first time!\n\nThe sound production is familiar as it is where STTNG get's it's theme. It's so grandiose that alone is worth watching. The sets are all very \"modernized\" compared to the old show. Seeing all the favourite characters transformed from the tv series onto the big screen is heavy, it feels serious and a bit dark. There is some real weight to them being out there doing their thing.\n\nA colossal entity is introduced to threaten all life in the solar system and it's up to the crew to figure out whats what. Everyone puts int a pretty good performance. There are a few \"deaths\" the only part that bugs me in the whole movie is a transporter \"accident\" scene. Its not terribly gross but the sound effects I find are disturbing. I would not let my little one watch this movie just because of that scene (it's mostly a lot of screaming for about 10 seconds).\n\nI can see why some people don't like this movie as it does have a lot of very long shots of the entity to try and give it some scale as the thing seems to go on forever, again reminds me of Space Odyssey but I didn't mind it.\n\nI would rank this up there with my top Star Trek movies - see hollywood you can make a sci fi movie WITHOUT the need for some lame time travel plot!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979); Directed by: Robert Wise; Starring: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Persis Khambatta et al.\n\nThis film marked the transition from television to the silver screen for \"Star Trek\" and is part of the reason why \"Star Trek\" is still such phenomenon today. Sadly though, this film is regarded as one of the lesser entries in the series today and in my opinion this is unrightfully so, because I regard this as the best Star Trek film and a great film in general.\n\nLet me start with a short plot outline. We first witness the approach of a giant cloud, which will be the main character. From there on, we move to the crew of the refitted Enterprise. We see how Admiral Kirk takes command of the Enterprise from Captain Decker (Stephen Collins) and how Spock joins the crew later on, after having rejected pure logic as the way of life. There's also a new bridge officer onboard: Lt. Ilia (Khambatta). The ship's crew is now complete and together they're about to intercept the mysterious cloud which they must stop before it reaches Earth. A journey of understanding begins, because for the crew to stop the entity, it's necessary to uncover its motivations. They learn parts from Ilia, who has been taken by the invader and has returned in the form of a probe to observe the crew and she tells them that V'Ger (the invader) wishes to speak with The Creator. Spock also plays a role in uncovering more of the mystery, as he takes a space suit and journeys to the inner chambers of V'Ger, where he mindmelds with it and learns a great deal about how it thinks. In the end, the crew finds out who The Creator is and an explanation to V'Ger's behavior.\n\nThe film is very slow moving, but that's part of what makes this film as great as it is. The film takes a philosophical approach to \"Star Trek\", making a slow furthering of the plot appropriate, since it gives you time to reflect on the information you're given. Besides the philosophical aspect, the film dares to take time for showing us how beautiful and elegant space travel actually is. Call it an epic approach, which already becomes apparent by means of an overture. Furthermore, it features a six minute scene in which Admiral Kirk and Scotty take a tour around the refitted Enterprise. The model is truly breathtaking, as is the set design. The bridge looks like it could really be used in a space ship and Engineering never looked better. The film features more extensive modeling work, which is all extremely well-crafted. Once we have reached the outskirts of the cloud, we journey to its center, to where the actual entity is located and this costs us about fifteen minutes. Once again we see great special effects, as we first move through the cloud, followed by the fly-over of an enormous space ship. We then move inside, to reveal an even more astounding interior. These scenes could have been done in two minutes, but luckily the film takes the epic approach and shows us all. Through this approach we really feel the mystery of space and the threat the invader poses. This approach calls for a good musical score and Jerry Goldsmith more than delivers that, he actually delivers an almost divine score. It matches the film exactly and it enhances the film greatly, taking it to another level. The score embodies the romance in \"Ilia's Theme\", the excitement in the \"Main Title\", the elegance in the Starfleet music (especially in \"The Enterprise\") and the mystery and danger in the V'Ger cues, which sound really otherworldly thanks to the use of the 'Blaster Beam'. Never before have I heard a score which melts as perfectly with what's on screen as this one.\n\nI already mentioned the philosophical approach which is at the heart of the film. To me, this film embodies what \"Star Trek\" is about. It's about humanity in the broadest way; it's about what humans have to offer, about what makes us a good species. In the end, it's perhaps hopelessly optimistic about humanity, but the concept is brought in such a believable manner that you believe in it and it's a concept I want to believe in. That it's so believable has to do with the fact that it's science fiction, which gives the opportunity to put down an evolved human race, without the context of the present. Besides the human theme, the film also poses big questions, like: why are we here, where do we come from? Such questions are seldom in a major motion picture, but they are worthy of exploration in a film.\n\nOne last aspect: acting. This is not one of the film's better aspects, but it's by no means bad acting. Opinions on William Shatner's acting talents differ, but I don't mind him. The other original crewmembers deliver good performances and Leonard Nimoy excels as Spock, in search for answers to life. Persis Khambatta looks gorgeous as the bald Ilia and delivers a nice performance. My only quibble is the subplot about the tension between Kirk and Decker, which feels somewhat out of place in the overall film, but that's not the actors' fault, but that lies with the script.\n\nWhat makes this film so great is that it doesn't shy away from being a real science fiction film, in the Gene Roddenberry style. There are universal human values to be learned in the context of the future and space, without shying away from real science fiction and the exploration aspect. This film balances these aspects really well and thus becomes really involving and challenging. Combine this with great modeling and special effects work, a score which is divine and a lovely slow pacing and you've got a philosophical, exciting, adventurous and above all, a true \"Star Trek\" film.\n\n9/10."

The humour is there, it is just not as deliberate as the next 5 reunions where they play more upon that as well as them getting older.\n\nTo all who mentioned that this is a slow movie has missed the full scope of this film. The musical score alone is hypnotic and powerful and when combined with the visual effects and the on par acting of \"Her crew\" results, in my opinion, in a sci-fi classic.\n\n...not to mention the ground breaking special effects and techniques developed for this film. Watch the text commentary and/or the audio commentary and special features (disc 2) of the director's cut to learn more. I was impressed."

And finally it happened--after several false starts and mishaps, we were to get a Star Trek movie!\n\nAfter the rumors, I couldn't believe it until I saw it. Event when I was standing in line, I somehow knew that something would prevent me from seeing the movie.\n\nAs I was sitting in my seat, \"Ilya's theme\" played! Where was the original theme music from the show? Had I been had, was this really Star Trek? And then Pow! there was \"Star Trek\" on he credits. My, and millions of others, dreams had come true!.\n\nThen the Klingon vessels appeared and I was expecting Star Wars, but no, the Klingons were attacking an \"Energy field of immense proportions\". Where were my favorite characters? Had I been had? Then they all began to appear one by one--trickling, teasing their way into the screen and then all was whole--Star Trek was back with only a slightly changed Enterprise.\n\nStar Trek was revived and that sustained me through the entire movie.\n\nThis is the feeling I have that I have not received from any other Star Trek Movie or TV series.

        "review_detailed_main": "As a fan of Star Trek, it is hard to dislike this film. But also as a fan of Star Trek, it is hard to give this film a 10 rating. First of all, there is way too much special effects footage, most of which is drawn out and boring. Secondly, unlike the following three films, there isn't much emphasis placed on character interaction and development, which, for my money, is the reason Classic Star Trek has endured for so long. I mean, the series has many now dated elements, along with terrible, dated special effects. But it is the characters that we love, and they are the reason that we watch them over and over again. The creators of this film, on the other hand, seem to have neglected this aspect of Star Trek, for the most part. So, ultimately, Star Trek-The Motion Picture isn't a bad film (and it's a masterpiece compared to Star Trek 5), but it's not the best of the series. Check out 2 and 3 instead, and see how good Star Trek can be."

And who dares to say that the FX are bad is terribly wrong, (ST5: The Final Frontier, those are BAD FX!) they are almost excellent. This film is superior, it matches with The Wrath of Kahn, of course not in action scenes but in movie quality. I recommend it to everyone that do not think that action is the only thing worth in a movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "After twenty years of silence, director Robert Wise answers his critics and fans alike with the completion of StarTrek: The Motion Picture. Perhaps the closest any sci-fi film has come to approaching the sheer visual spectacle and audience-intelligence-interraction quotient of 2001: A Space Odyssey, \"ST:TMP DE\" should at long last close the books of even the harshest detractors who have over the years claimed the original studio version to be slow, overly-drawn-out and long winded. Even for this fan of the original release, the new (old?) cut is quick-tempoed, clean and free of hands-on studio involvement. The folks who spliced this version together were obviously honored to be involved, and more importantly, respectful of the film's history and original aspirations. Let's face it...if not for the overwhelming success of this movie...in its' original, incomplete form, Star Trek would be considered a syndication success that ran its' course and no more. Mr. Wise has, upon being given the OK to COMPLETE his film, delivered what was previously a good sci-fi movie and transformed it into the genuine genre masterwork those of us believers who have held on for all of these years knew was lurking just beneath. Though not perfect, the new Director's Edition is a terrific achievement, and just the sort of item we've been begging Paramount for since the advent of DVDs. Yes, the sound is not up to \"The Phantom Menace\" standards and yes the abundance of film grain is more than a bit unnerving. The new Vulcan skyline, San Francisco Starfleet terminal, and V'ger \"island\" sequence more than make up for those shortcomings. The music is as beautiful and serene as its' ever been and honestly, you'll never see a more moving and profound crippling of an asteroid as what takes place in a (decidedly 1970's) wormhole with deep, room-shattering Dolby bass...with visuals to match. Photon torpedoes second to none. Bravo Paramount, and bravo, Robert Wise, for taking the time and effort finishing what is now a truly great science fiction film."

I would definitely recommend watching this film if you haven't seen it already. If you're a sci-fi fan like myself then hopefully you'll like the film.

The plot is still the same: Mysterious cloud heads toward earth. We humans don't know why. Only that it decimates three klingon ships and has a powerfield bigger than Uncle Festers gob! So, Kirk takes over the new Enterprise from a clearly cheesed off Deckard to go greet its new visitor. Now, I've seen the two versions back to back. And I have to say, Robert Wise really redeemed himself on this. While I thought the original version was good, this version is SOOOOOO much better. Its a shame that the commentary seems to have been wrote down and recorded separately instead of together as it seemed informative but was a tad boring. But if you get the chance to watch the new version, don't pass it by thinking \"Huh, the original was rubbish\". Give it a go. Go on, you know you want to!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first Star Trek movie was produced at a time when the only other Trek were seventy-nine NBC episodes shot ten years earlier and endlessly syndicated. The initial and enduring reaction to the film was and is that it was cobbled together from a half-written script bolstered by nostalgia and the special effects technology bonanza propagated by Star Wars and Close Encounters. The fact is, those effects are pretty special -- from the Klingon battle to the vision of Vulcan to the Enterprise hanging in dry dock and its magnificent launch to the starship's penetration of all those bizarre layers of the V'Ger cloud -- and they all fold in quite effectively on the film's double-braced story: now-Admiral Kirk's obsessive struggle for control over his destiny and Spock's search for knowledge he can never possess without first understanding himself. Though it may lack the punchiness of some of its sequels (notably Nick Meyer's stellar The Wrath of Khan), the film has a vision and scope that made it then and makes it now a movie event in a way that very few of today's blockbusters can match. With imagery as much Kubrick as Lucas, a magnificent Jerry Goldsmith score, a still-friendly story dynamic that brings together old friends, an impact on every Trek incarnation to follow (particulatly, The Next Generation) and a sense of being a genuinely good and noble experience, Star Trek truly is a human adventure."

Directed by the legendary Robert Wise (\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\"), this mind-blowing motion picture event has great special effects, a great story, great music, and even great performances (from everybody except Shatner).\n\nThe only real problem with this movie is a small one that people seem to fixate on so often. Like Steven Spielberg's \"1941,\" this movie is infamous as a rushed mess with big special effects and no real heart. However, I honestly believe that people who say that about either of these movies have never really paid that close attention to them. \"TMP\" has plenty of heart-- from amazing romantic scenes between Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta to the jaw-dropping finale.\n\nAnd while this film can be considered nearly identical in story to the original series episode \"The Changeling,\" that's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, we face similar challenges every day in our average lives. Why is it so unusual for it to happen to famous people?\n\nI love the original series, but I'll take this first any day."

I thought I wouldn't like it because of the bad reviews by critics and fans but boy were the critics and especially the fans wrong. This is a truly beautiful film that is in such heights as 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a wonderful film that captured my attention from the first scene, from the first minute. This is a truly magnificent film adaption of the TV series. Star Trek doesn't need action scenes to be entertaining, I don't mind a film whether it has action scenes or not, just an entertaining story. I love the latest sequel, prequel and reboot Star Trek because that is what Gene Roddenberry would have loved to have done and if he was alive would have loved the film deeply. The film may rely heavily on special effects but at least it didn't rely on effects much as films do today. The effects are breath taking and throughout the whole film I cannot imagine the film even being made in 1979. 1979!!! It's like this film stole all the other 70s film special effects budgets to create the most awsomest and ageless effects ever.\n\nThe story is great and is very Star Trek: The Original Series. The film is over-long but with the effects, story and acting I really don't care. The film is scary, mysterious and just Goddamn beautiful and every Star Trek fan who pans this film really needs to reconsider whether they are a true \"Trekkie\" or not.\n\nThis film is just awesome, I cannot say how brilliant this is. When watching it it's like I'm on drugs, I've never been on drugs and never will but at least this \"drug\" that I'm high on won't shorten my life, just give me a high excited level and make my heart beat double the usual beat.\n\nOther reviews have praised the film for it's score and I will not disagree. Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams are two of my favourite composers but thank God Jerry did it because otherwise it would have felt like Star Wars if John did it. Every music piece in the film sounds like an overture at the beginning of a musical that consists of snippets of music from the show. Fast beats, slow beats, high beats, low beats. It's just beautiful and makes me want to scream out \"Star Trek\" a thousand times on top of my roof because of how beautiful it is.\n\nI give it a 9 out of 10 because I felt the film ended a bit abruptly with some unanswered questions but if I forgot that then it would have got 10/10. A brilliant film that is so super"
