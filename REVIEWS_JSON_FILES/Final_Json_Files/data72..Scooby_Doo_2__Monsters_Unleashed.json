        "review_detailed_main": "So much of the plot and script of this film is absolute trash, but shaggy and scoob are so perfect it cancels all the other rubbish out. Even aged 25 I got so many belly laughs out of the CGI Scooby's antics. I also thought the monsters were pretty cool and the CGI is an improvement on the first film. I also really respect how directly out of the cartoon the characters and outfits are. With that being said, if you aren't ready to turn your brain off and watch a CGI dog in a fake afro do a choreographed dance. This may not be the film for you. I am surprised there was never a third film or a reboot of this franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the disappointing effort of the first Scooby-Doo film I wasn't much enthusiastic about this \"Monsters Unleashed\". But to tell the truth this film handled the characters better and the climax more interesting, at least in terms of the identity of the villain. It remained true to the original cartoon storyline in the sense that the character of the villain appeared earlier in the film. The dialogues also got better, though abandoning thick sense of humor was impossible. It failed to develop enough chemistry between the members of the gang, which is in fact faithful to the cartoon where in my opinion the characters are quite one-dimensional.\n\nThe CGI of Scooby himself has improved only slightly. The monsters could have been designed better, although there are touches of nice imagination e.g. the candy floss monster. The most irritating parts were unnecessary hip-hop dance sequences. Besides such points, Scooby Doo 2 deserves more praise than its prequel."

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they actually did. The story is better and more interesting and the monsters and CGI-effects in general are more convincing looking. The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it.\n\nNot only the story itself has been improved but also the storytelling. The pace is good and the characters work better for this movie. Also the actors seemed more at ease in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar certainly improved their acting compared to the first movie. Still best parts are played by Matthew Lillard and the perfectly cast Linda Cardellini. Plus of the movie is that it also has actors Alicia Silverstone, Tim Blake Nelson and Seth Green in it.\n\nThe monsters are enjoyable and are good looking. There still are some 'fake' moments but on the other hand there also are some truly spectacular looking sequences involving monsters. The character of Scooby-Doo himself is also looking more convincingly this time.\n\nIt's not really a memorable or great movie but it is simple good entertainment to watch.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Live action update of Hanna-Barbara's early 70s animated TV series with lots of entertainment and amusement . The film concerns about our friends \u00a8the Mystery Inc.\u00a8 group with Scooby Doo , Shaggy ( Matthew Lillard ) and the remaining group (Sara Michelle Gellar , Freddie Prince Jr, Linda Cardellini )and takes place an eerie museum of criminology where are robbed some stuffed monsters for nefarious purposes . Meanwhile , Daphne falls in love with the museum curator (Seth Greene). The equipment members are going out to investigate with its van towards a dark mansion , whose owner is a suspect old man (Peter Boyle) . A reporter(Alicia Silverstone) accuses them as responsible a robbery . The Mystery Inc soon realize that they cannot resolve this case without help from each other .\n\nIn the picture there are comedy, tongue-in-cheek , slapstick , humorous moments , mild diversion and is pretty amusing . All are given a preteen treatment which means no gore and no bad language just some old-fashioned sympathetic scares ; being funny watching humans meld into the CG characters . However , it contains bad taste when takes place a contest about fart jokes between Shaggy and Scooby . Of course , coward Scooby steals the spectacle as food-obsessed canine anti-hero with its grimace , faces and gesture . Many gags are good however the tale sometimes drags . Special mention to gags as the tournament between Fredd ( Freddie Prince) and the monsters , besides those intervening Shaggy-Scooby , they make a likable and superb comic couple . There appears even an electrifying monster similar to \u00a8Forbidden planet\u00a8 film monster . Movie combines live action with computer generator animation on Scooby Doo creation , special effects are well done . The motion picture is regularly directed by Raja Gosnell who also realized the original . Kiddies may find the corny , flat humor as bemusing , but most adults will be disappointed , exception the fans the classic cartoon series created by Hanna Barbera . It is clearly aimed at the junior audience . Protagonists' antics might provide the silly smiles , but this cartoonist physical comedy is mostly ineffective . Rating : average but entertaining with lots of fun and as amused as the first , and it will be best appreciated by preteen enthusiasts of the cartoon movies .\n\n."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original live action SCOOBY DOO was rather like the cotton candy you buy at the fair: pretty to look at and fun to scarf down. But a little goes a long way, particularly when all the air has been beaten out and it emerges as overworked taffy.\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini repeat the roles of Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Velma. Once again, Prinze and Gellar are hardly inspired but at least they play with tremendous energy; once again Lillard and Cardellini are so dead on target that the effect is almost spooky. They are supported by Seth Green, a truly talented actor who gives a very nice performance indeed; unfortunately, Peter Boyle is largely wasted and Alicia Silverstone is, well, Alicia Silverstone.\n\nSilverstone aside, the cast might have recreated the lightness of the first film--but once you mix in a story about stolen costumes that come to life, huge sets, wild outfits, a dance number, and a ton of CGI effects they pretty much get lost in the shuffle. It's all about as much fun as a carnival after the crowd has gone and you're left alone with gum on the bottom of your shoe.\n\nKids probably won't notice the shortcomings, and older fans will be glad to see numerous references to the original cartoon series--and to be fair the film does have its moments, largely thanks to Lillard, Cardellini, and Green. The film is available to the homemarket via DVD... But by and large this is the sort of thing you watch once and then let gather dust on the shelf.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

        "review_detailed_main": "28 March 2004. What makes this movie delightful is the ability of the direction and live actors to capture the essence of the animated action found in the original cartoon series. A number of the scenes appear to be lifted straight out of the cartoon series like where Scooby Doo and Shaggy are prowling around in a house and you find them carrying each other just as in the cartoon version. There are a number of such scenes that really hit the animated button and is a treat to actually see it transferred onto the large screen with real actors. Though not perfect, this movie has its obvious flaws where some scenes are so overboard that it detracts from the flow of the movie and in some places it drags abit. But overall, the tone, flavor of the movie, even the flairs of emotional drama and simple moral and juvenile dilemmas that the cast face about being a nerd, being cool, being loved add an enhanced quality to this movie targeted towards children (except for the obnoxious product placement at the beginning of the movie). Seven out of ten stars."

I was a first generation Scooby fan, watching it every Saturday morning year in and year out in the early 1970s, until Scrappy Doo drove me away. We got to know and care for those characters. Amazingly, they're not here. Who are these people, this redhead, blond and brunette? They're certainly not Daphne, Fred and Velma. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was simply channeling Owen Wilson. Helium-voiced Sarah Michelle Gellar is all wrong for stunning Daphne. And Linda Cardinelli was too whiny to be calm, collected Velma. I'm not even going to ask about all the sudden techno-wizardry and the fighting skills. Not to mention the original Mystery Machine gang NEVER went up against actual ghosts, not even once. They always exposed the ghosts to be a fraud. This wasn't Scooby Doo. It was Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The only good thing about this movie was Matthew Lillard, who was the only cast member to truly capture the spirit (and voice) of the cartoon character.\n\nIf you want to see a good kids' monster movie this Halloween, I would suggest \"The Monster Squad\" from 1987 instead. It was a much better and sadly overlooked film."

And they are watching both the old and new iterations of the cartoons. This captures the spirit of the show and will keep the kids entertained. In my case, over and over again. I am glad Netflix has allowed us to rekindle the flame for some of these movies that were released with old school family entertainement flair in a time where the nostalgia effect didn't line up with the dark movie trend at release.\n\nShaggy and Scooby easily still the show.

Freddy Prinze Jr. is pretty good as Fred while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne doesn't quite fit the role, although she's likable and serviceable. I'm sure she got the part because of her popularity at the time. Seth Green and Peter Boyle have significant peripheral roles, as does Alicia Silverstone, who's a highlight but unfortunately underused.\n\nWhereas the first movie was shot on the east coast of Australia this sequel changes the locale to the Vancouver area of British Columbia. Of course, it's location is Coolsville in the story, wherever that's supposed to be. In any case, the extreme switch in locale changes the dynamics a bit.\n\nThere also seems to be more emphasis on action and paying homage to the cartoon, which makes it marginally better than the first movie, for me anyway. Plus it emphasizes the obvious \u2013 that Velma is sexier than Daphne, at least with Cardellini as Velma and Gellar as Daphne. There are some worthwhile morals as well, like simply being yourself and not trying to be someone else.\n\nThe film runs 93 minutes.\n\nGRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10)"

If this had been the first film, I think that many would have thought it was much better, but, when you weigh it against the original 'Scooby Doo' movie, it pales....\n\nWe still have the cast of \"Mysteries Inc\" running around in the Mystery Machine van - with Scooby Doo (created in CGI), Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), Velma (Linda Cardinelli) and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). This time, they're joined by some old favorites: Seth Green (as a love interest for Velma), Peter Boyle (as the classic 'Old Man Wickles'), Alicia Silverstone (as a great foil for Daphne), 'Inside Edition' host Pat O'Brien shows up and even 'American Idol' alum Ruben Studdard gets a turn to show us his acting chops.\n\nThe story line revolves around a reappearance of some of Mystery Inc.'s old school monsters coming back around in town. Alicia Silverstone plays a hard charging, up and coming news caster, trying to get the next big story - and she doesn't care who she crushes in her way up. Seth Green shows up as a curator of a museum to the greatness of Mystery Inc., and cares for all of the monsters that they've caught. It's HIS museum that gets robbed and the monsters come back to life!\n\nThe CGI here is just as good as the first time - but there seems to be a bit more of it.... Sure, the story isn't as flashy as the first one, but it's still pretty good on its own merits. There's a lot of flash and sizzle to this film, but it's more like a diet version of the first... still not bad, but sometimes leaving you wanting for just another bite!"

Personally, i've always enjoyed this one more than the previous film. It has tons of characters, and somehow is able to actually execute the bigger=better formula unlike so many other sequels. My main problem with the film lies with the tone, that can be all over the place at times, towards the end losing a bit of its rhythm, but thankfully by its conclusion it finds itself again and manages to still be quite fun. The CGI is also much better this time around compared to the previous film, although most audiences will still notice it is a bit dated. There are tons of good jokes and humorous moments in this one too that work way better than they should- and the references to characters and other things in the cartoon feel so cool to see on the big screen. All the performances were also fun and campy as before this time around, although the supporting cast is thankfully a lot better, even if they can be a bit overdone at times. In the end, Scooby-Doo 2 is far from perfect- but it is a very enjoyable little flick. It somehow approves upon the original to be an uneven, but quite fun little ride.\n\nMy Rating: 7.2/10."

Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddie Pinze Jnr were very good too, there are some decent jokes and there were some very good action sequences. Out of the supporting cast, Seth Green was a standout as Patrick, and Alicia Silverstone is likable too.

        "review_detailed_main": "The original Scooby Doo was bad. It couldn't decide if it was a straight live action version or a parody of Scooby Doo. That movie had an obnoxious tone to it. The sequel, however, is better. The action seems to be moving faster than the original. There are no fewer than three of the famous foot chases that Scooby Doo is famous for. The movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is going too fast for anybody to notice. The actors seem more comfortable in their roles this time around, especially Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred. Prinze was incredibly smug in the first movie. This time he seems to have dialed it down more. The actors are performing more as a team this time. These are people who like each other in this movie and not as five individuals. This is not a great movie, with unnecessary amounts of grotesque humor. Alicia Silverstone is wasted in a minor role. Overall, get a free ticket if you can to see in a theatre or rent it on video. 6/10"

I don't have a problem with others enjoying it, and I can see the logic in making these flicks for those who loved it. The main problem is just that it really doesn't have anything to offer for anyone else. It does, in both of them, try to offer it up, and were it further developed, perhaps coupled with less thin, stereotypical characters to work with, I think they could really have something interesting. The acting tends to be over the top, which is not to say that there are no good performances, or at least moments of such. Green is a nice addition. There are more monsters than in the first one. The CGI is at the same level of quality, that being quite good. This has fairly well-done cinematography and editing. The jokes and gags are almost exclusively silly, and if you're watching this, hopefully you enjoy bodily function jokes. This has a pretty decent plot, and throws some genuine surprises your way. The twist is reasonable. Designs are imaginative and fun. The music is cool. So is it better than its predecessor? I guess it averages out to them being about equal. I recommend this to fans of Scooby-Doo and co. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\" is even more vapid and boring than the original \"Scooby Doo\" from 2002. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby return as the unlikely quintet who used to do their crime fighting in the two-dimensional world of cel animation but who now enjoy the advantages - or disadvantages - of three-dimensional real life sleuthing (albeit abetted by a bevy of high tech special effects). In this outing, they are attempting to uncover the villain responsible for turning monster costumes into actual monsters.\n\nApart from some first rate art direction and costuming, both of which employ a pleasing primary-colored palette, this misbegotten and utterly unnecessary sequel offers virtually nothing of value for either fans of the original cartoon or newcomers to the scene dragged to the experience by well-intentioned but misguided youngsters. It's a shame that Hollywood feels compelled to foist dopey, lame brained movies such as this one onto innocent, unsuspecting children, and one shudders to think what the future movie going audience will be like having been nurtured in their formative years on cinematic dreck like the \"Scooby Doo\" franchise. Even Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, who was the one bright element in the original film, becomes simply annoying in this installment. And Scooby himself has to rank as one of the least beguiling and charming figures in the history of movie animation - CGI-spawned or otherwise.\n\nBeware \"Scooby Doo 3...4...5...6...\""

Save your money, avoid this movie. Summary of movie: Mystery Inc is living the high lift basking in their new fame as super detectives, when a villain they put behind bars shows up. He has created a recipe for creating ghosts, takes their fake ghosts they defeated from the past and turns them real. Mystery Inc now has to fight the fight of their lives, too bad they could not act as well."

It ain't high are but it's loads of fun, and there are plenty of in-jokes for the wiser viewers. The movie is fairly mindless, otherwise it would lose its kid audience. but that doesn't mean there's no good humor or plot to it.\n\nGranted, the plot is dumb (the gang go up against all the monsters from the first season of the TV show, only this time they're real). The manic set-pieces just bombard us, one after the other. Once again, there's not a moment of boredom, but there are enough quieter scenes with the Mystery Inc. gang. The main stars are, as usual, Shaggy and Scooby. Matthew Lillard is dead-on as Shaggy, so much so that he actually replaced Casey Kasem as his animated voice.\n\nOne moment that requires major suspension of disbelief is not any scene featuring sludge monsters or a cotton candy ghosts but a scene in which Velma utters 'I'm not hot'.\n\nNOT HOT!!!???? WHAT??? She's a total babe, more so than Daphne. Every frame of her is a work of art as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe CGI effects this time round are thankfully superior to the trashy effects of the first film. It's a much better movie all round and will not fail to amuse anyone of any age."

Freddie prnz is gd, he has appeal, he should stick to not being able to act in proper films. Buffy is buffy no more said. Velma should marry me because shes hot, and she also carries a lot of the action, she didn't get that much air time in the cartoon. shaggy? the guy was annoying before he was shaggy, hes good as shaggy, but should try and up his game, itll be good for the world. the films are just far more colourful than the cartoon, there's no more pastels and muted colours, its all bizarre acid trippy colours, which kids even feel unsettled by. if they take the next film seriously, which i hope they don't even consider, they should approach it from the film point of view, not the franchise point of view, and film outside of nickelodeons facility range. this film should be shot. xx"

The story is perhaps a tad hard to follow at times (for small kids), but the plethora of great creatures and continuous supply of (admittedly unsophisticated) laughs mean that the film is still enjoyable fluff for the whole family.\n\nReprising their roles from the first film, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini look like they are having a blast. Gellar looks great and gets to perform more of her Buffy-style high kicking moves; Cardellini gets to act sexy, as she attempts to romance nerdy museum curator Patrick; and Lillard is, once again, brilliant as Shaggy. Scooby hasn't improved any in the CGI department, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film.\n\nIf you enjoyed Mystery Inc.'s first live-action cinematic foray, then the chances are that you'll like this one too."

It's like with my review on ' The Country Bears' movie. Do people seem to hate fun movies? Im starting to believe that is the case. While I do love the first Scooby Doo movie, I've come to believe Monster Unleashed is not only better than the first movie but is underrated\n\nThe CGI and special effects for the costumed monsters brought to life as their own entities has aged pretty darn well in my opinion. The story sort of de constructs ours heroes, pulling back the curtain and getting to why the characters of Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby are the way they are and why we as the audience love them for who they are\n\nFor Fred he doesnt need to always be the macho cool sophisticated man who isnt afraid of anything or anyone. For Velma it's about following her heart instead of always relying on logic and facts for her beliefs and decisions instead of taking actual risks and doing what she wants. For Shaggy and Scooby they come to realize they arent screw ups or a joke, they are valuable to Mystery Inc as the rest of the gang. For Daphne she doesnt always have to be tough and reserved or not to fit herself as the so called damsel in distress\n\nThis great movie and the story is complimented with the editions of Seth Green, Peter Boyle and Alicia Silverstone who all help make the movie great and fun just like with our main cast. The music is great, humor is still spot on and man who doesn't love that clubhouse in the middle portion of the movie Mystery Inc made years ago."

I don't think there's anything particularly interesting about this film, it is just not really my thing. Actually, I think the fact that Scooby and Shaggy try to be like the rest of the gang is pretty good, but it just isn't QUITE enough to grab my interest. So there.\n\nWho I recommend this to: People who liked the original A LOT and people who like slapstick or are completely and utterly addictive eat-sleep-drink to Scooby Doo.\n\nWhat happens: The gang have their own museum just for them \u0096 WOW YAAY.

Shaggy and Scooby were of course you're regular brainless heroes who somehow end up saving the day. Mathew Lillard was exceptionally well in playing his role, and didn't overact. Velma,(Linda Cardellini) was still the same old Velma. Linda Cardellini fit the role expected of her and made the movie well rounded. Freddie Prinze Jr.(Fred) made his character less Narcesistic as he was before. Fred is still the committed leader who loves his admirers and especially Daphne.\n\nMy rating on this movie is a 10 because it was like watching a cartoon episode of Scooby-doo, only being a motion picture.

First they start out as popular and famous when they are always Those Damn Meddling Kids. The second is that the monsters are actually real. This is more Ghostbusters than Scooby-Doo. While change is often good, these are pretty big changes.\n\nI've never like this incarnation of Scooby-Doo and Shaggy. They are too outrageous. For all the crazy hijinx they get into, the funniest thing in this movie happens when Fred calls Daphne fat. I still like the group chemistry. Velma actually has a good storyline. Their friendship remains the best thing about the franchise. As for the mystery, Randomonium says it all. It's very random but that's what you get from Scooby-Doo. Most of the CGI are cheesy although it's expensive cheese. There is a couple of good moments in an overall weak effort."

Now i watch the DVD and i realized that i lost a good time.\n\nUnlike other franchises that equate sequels with changes, here the same ingredients apply and remain unchanged: ideal cast, bright colors and \"cliches\" from the classic show.\n\nFollowing the previous movie, the story has (a bit of) reflexion about the team and the cement that makes friendship. Here, Sammy and Scooby (much better looking in CGI) think they are leftover because they are (a bit) dumb! Morever, the writer pays homage to the original show because i think the monsters came from it.\n\nI think this movie is thus made for the fans by the fans and maybe doesn't reach to grasp the modern audience. However, I had laughs all along (above all with the table tools on Scooby's head and the door barricade) and i thought I was back into the 80's with \"Ghosbusters\" floating around.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't have as much movies as cartoons and actually this franchise seems really ... dead .... Will Mystery Inc. be come back from the grave this time ?"

The original Cast is back which includes Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mattew Lillard, and Freddie Prinze Jr, but the chemistry is gone, and the wow factor is gone as well. The movie tries to incorporate a lot of the bad guys from the earlier cartoons but it does not handle it successfully, and becomes sensory overload after the first twenty minutes of the film. I give some respect to those who tries to bring a sense of fun to story but its about time they shook up the formula before it gets tired, and its getting tired rather quickly."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: A mediocre sequel to a similarly lackluster original.\n\nPerhaps the only thing I'm glad about in SCOOBY DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED, perhaps one of the most inexplicable sequel of 2004, is that it isn't much of the total fiasco the original SCOOBY-DOO was. 2002's SCOOBY-DOO, might I say, was a total mess. Everything, inside and out, is a total disaster, a typical example of what's wrong about commercial film-making. Even under the presence of a delightful Matthew Lilard as Shaggy can't save a movie that pisses on your childhood. Although I never was a fan, I remembered how much I used on tuning in on the original Hanna/Barbara series as kid. And SCOOBY-DOO, in that movie, wasn't anything my childhood was.\n\nSCOOBY-DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED does a much better job, I'm afraid. Everything the original fails, this sequel manages to refill into much better. Still, whilst better than sub-par predecessor, It still ain't much of a good film, per se. While it can be said that our kids got much better, adults will still wonder why anyone still got work in doing these below-average family entertainment excuses. While Lilard still shines as Shaggy, the laughs are dry, there's not much of a plot and everything else is just... blah! The new \"story\" is much faithful to their source however. The original monsters in costumes are back, only they're real this time. Made real by a machine that transforms the costumes into the real thing. Once again, the Mystery Inc. gang of Freddy (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini), Shaggy (Lilard) and that mumbling and bumbling CGI Scooby are back in the game trying to solve the case, even after becoming a total embarrassment at the press. Shaggy and Scooby finds themselves responsible for the gang's credibility downfall and decide they change their goofy ways and act as real mystery busters. Whilst Lilard is a delight in doing so, it hardly accounts for much of the things about this film that's bad. Alicia Silverstone co-stars as a sleazy lying reporter while Peter Boyle and Tim Blake Nelson play the ex-men with masks.\n\nThe premise sticks much closer to home than the bland predecessor, but even so, this film rarely is a decent effort. Tired jokes and forgettable antics doesn't a good movie make. Worthy rental for kids though.\n\nRating: ** out of 5."

The visual effects are mixed, with some creative creature designs but some dated CGI. The film's strength lies in the chemistry of the cast, with Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, and Neil Fanning delivering lively performances. While it offers nostalgia for fans, it may leave others seeking a more substantial plot and fewer over-the-top antics."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sequels mainly fall into two categories: those who surpass the original, and those who fall flat on their faces. To me, Scooby-Doo 2 was neither - it wasn't as good as the first one, but in no way was it a failure. As a fan of the cartoon series since childhood, I felt that the movie achieved its purpose - to entertain.\n\nIt *was* a funny movie - maybe not hilarious, but I certainly got a few laughs out of it. Some of the gags were predictable, and some collapsed before they even began, but I felt that the good outweighed the bad.\n\nPerhaps the plot was a bit thin (most viewers with any common sense will have sussed out the bad guy long before the end), but it is, after all, a movie based on a children's TV show. It was never going to be the next Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, nor was there going to be some totally unexpected twist. If you're willing to let your inner child loose in the cinema, you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise, go see something else.\n\nPersonally, I loved Linda Cardellini's Velma. Let's face it, the roles in this movie weren't exactly Oscar-worthy performances, but I felt that the characters were better developed, especially Velma. We saw a bit more to Daphne and Shaggy too, but Fred was left pretty much alone. If there is to be a 3rd Scooby-Doo movie, I'd like to see the writers tap into him a bit more. Most of the actors seem to capture the cartoon series characters, but Freddie Prinze Jr. has to go a little further to recreate the Fred I remember.\n\nIt was nice to see some of the monsters I remembered from the TV series transferred to the big screen. OK, so they weren't even remotely scary, but hey - neither were their cartoon incarnations.\n\nOverall, I'd have to give 'Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed' 6/10 - not a bad movie, but not the best I've ever seen. However, if all you want is children's movie that's not too taxing, then this is for you."

The silly moments are fun for the kids, and the the suspects are all amusing characters. Like the first movie, Linda Cardinelli and Matt Lillard bring Velma and Shaggy to life amazingly well, while Buffy and her hubby are just in tow. Scooby's animation is not bad, and the monsters, taken from the original series, were all designed and utilized extremely well. The story rolls right along, with a pretty decent conclusion for a kid's movie.\n\nSilly fluff, but entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "With the success of the inevitable success of the first Scooby-Doo, it was predictable a sequel would follow. Unpredictably, however, the sequel is better than the original.\n\nThe film begins with the gang attending the opening of a museum featuring the costumes of Mystery Inc.'s old enemies. The opening is soon shattered when one of the costumes comes to life and begins destroying the exhibit. To add to the ruination of the museum opening, the Gang's reputation soon begins spiraling downwards. It's up to frustrated Fed, doubtful Daphne, love-filled Velma and disheartened Shaggy and Scooby to save the day - and Mystery Inc.! I myself had seen low ratings for the film, and therefor hadn't much interest in seeing it. The family went, though, and so did I. As the film began, I was expecting a film pretty much like the first, possibly slightly worse. As it turns out, Scooby-Doo 2 is the opposite of that.\n\nThe part of the film I enjoyed the most was Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy (he also stole my attention in the original movie). Lillard is perfect and frequently funny. The animated Scooby-Doo is particularly enjoyable as well; bite me if you will, but I found the \"Conclusion: Bunny\" sequence pretty funny.\n\nThe rest of the cast is fine, although SD2 is probably not the highest point in their careers. I found Sarah Michelle Gellar's rendition of Daphne boring - and I'm a SMG fan! The humor was pretty low, and generally unfunny, although the film does have its moments. The direction is fine, and the special effects are pleasing. The creatures will be enjoyed by the younger audience.\n\nSpeaking of younger audience, SD2 is clearly aimed at a younger age range than the first film. The soundtrack was fine, and David Newman's score was very nice. It created a mysterious and kookily fun mood for the film.\n\nIs Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed better than the original film? In some ways, yes. It has more entertainment value, that's for sure. Will kids like it? Yes, they'll definitely like more than the first. But will you like it? That's something only you can answer."

So when I saw this movie I was totally pleased with this sequels outcome. There was so much more in this one then the original. Especially the whole dancing Scooby in the whole soul getup. Thought I was going to pee my pants from laughing so hard. So for all those who don't know what a good movie then you need to really get yourself a reality check. This movie is for kids, and for the adults who have the little kid in their hearts."

You should probably ignore Scooby for this entire movie as it is bad CGI and the 3D avatar far froms shows as convincing. However, there are some decent performances by the guy who plays Shaggy very impressively and some others. By far the most impressive thing about this movie are the monsters which have been very very very well done and are sheer fun to experience. Don't go expecting any great story or anything great and just go see it for mindless fun. There's nothing wrong with mindless fun is there?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed this weekend at an advanced screening. I never saw the first one because of the bad reviews it received, but given the opportunity at hand, I was willing to give this one a shot.\n\nThe storyline itself proved to be rather unimaginative. The movie's plot lines have been used so many times before that they have become boring and meaningless, and the viewer is left in a dull slump, only occasionally coming out of it to chuckle at the movie's more humorous points.\n\nI will give Scooby Doo 2 that much; there were some funny moments. I won't mention them specifically, but some of the jokes got the whole theater laughing. They seemed to generally be done in the same style as the cartoon, although I admit I have never actually laughed at a Scooby Doo episode.\n\nHowever, this was exactly the problem with the movie. If it had maintained a consistently light-hearted mood throughout, it would have been much more effective and entertaining. However, because of it's bad transitioning between humor, romance, and drama, it failed to work. The humor made the movie's attempts at drama and romance fall flat and come off as seeming desperate and stupid. I remember cringing a lot; especially during the final scenes of the movie.\n\nThe special effects were less than stunning. The monsters were not very scary, which is disappointing considering that, you know, they're monsters. Additionally, most everything looked very fake and rushed. Of course, it's not reasonable to expect fantastic CGI and other effects in a movie of this type, but there was quite a lot to be desired.\n\nOverall, I give Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed one and a half stars. My advice is that if you've got nothing to do one day and a few extra bucks on hand, go ahead and see it. Otherwise, don't waste your time."

So far, the 2002 live-action adaptation and its sequel \"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\" (2004), both directed by Raja Gosnell, have been pretty mediocre.\n\nBut one thing has remained consistent: they retain the camp humor and self-referential attitude of the original cartoons from the '70s. How's that for animation loyalty? While remaining more praised for its camp much rather than any industriousness, the films, like the cartoons themselves, are still watchable - somewhat.\n\nDoo himself looks just how he did in the cartoon, and has the junk-food and Scooby Snack appetite down pat. This time the gang - Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardelleni), and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) - are back in form again, somewhat. In this sequel, they are investigating strange things going on at a newly opened museum. With the aid of a geek (Seth Green) and a reporter (Alicia Silverstone), they go about solving another ghostly mystery.\n\nActing and good script writing were never admirable qualities of the original \"Scooby-Doo\" cartoons and here it's no different. It's painfully mediocre and the jokes are so-so. But Lillard, as the ambiguously stoner Shaggy, seems perfectly cast, as well as Cardellini as Velma.\n\nBottom line, watch only if you are a die-hard for this sort of stuff.\n\n6/10"

This movie has the same actors playing the same characters as last time, and like last time, they fit their roles perfectly, and do a good job portraying them. I enjoyed the movie's plot and action, both were great fun to watch. This movie explores the characters a little more, especially shaggy and Scooby, so that was nice to see. The effects were pretty good, not incredible, but not cheep. This movie did give Velma a love interest which is good, I kinda wish it would've been a different actor to play his character, but he wasn't awful. Alicia Silverstone does well with her material as well, I liked seeing her in the movie, I enjoyed her performance. So overall, not as good as the first one, but not bad, and for the most part, family friendly. 6/10 for Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed."

Like the first one this film is just a lite ball of fluff made to put grins on people's faces adults and children alike. The film isn't overly intelligent or even clever and the spfx look very cartoonish and anti scary at best but the group's workable friendly chemistry and tehf ilm's underrated ability to have infinite fun gives it a pulse unlikely to be enjoyed by stuck up people in the mood for a much more serious take on scooby doo. This one picks up as Mystery inc. popularity has skyrocketed and they find themselves ina n upheaval. As all of the ghouls they have arrested in the past come back to hunt themd owna nd destroy the city. In addition to all the hi jinx and supposedly hidden drug references Velma is given a nerdy new love interest in Seth Green and tries to play it sexy. New dimensions are raised in Daphne and Fred's relationship and their is arch evil reporter played by alicia silverstone and a cameo performance from Ruben Studdard. All in all not a great flick by any means but this Scobby definatly delivers on Scooby terms."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Scooby-Doo 2: Monster's Unleashed (2004)' isn't as good as the first film. It doesn't feel like a sequel or even an adaptation of its source material, really. In some ways, it seems 'straight to DVD', with only the returning cast and comparable CGI signalling it to be anything else. Perhaps it's the now somewhat garish set-design and costuming, the odd story structure and lax character development or maybe just the over abundance of young-skewing, child-pandering and plainly unfunny humour. The biggest cause, I think, is probably the fact that it isn't really a satire anymore, aside from one or two brief moments (mainly concerning the show's long-running 'unmasking' trope). Whatever the reason, this piece feels decidedly cheap - or low-effort, perhaps - and decidedly less interesting because of it. I guess Gunn got onboard with the neutered final result of his first go (or, he just didn't care) because, here, things are definitely aiming for a broader audience. There's no real subversion, it's filled with bland and basic character-work and the fan-focused deep-cuts are far and few between. In a way, this makes the experience more consistent. It feels far less two-minded, probably because the original script wasn't R-rated, and there are less 'inappropriate', faux-'edgy' moments (though there are still some here and there). It makes the affair less charming, though, because it feels like it was engineered as the most basic version of a live-action 'Scooby-Doo' film. It isn't devoid of entertainment and there are a couple of chuckles, to boot (mainly surrounding Peter Boyle and Tim Blake Nelson's new characters), but I'm sad to say that Shaggy isn't quite as good as he was last time around, either. Lillard turns in a perfectly fine performance and acts well off the more dog-like yet far too focused-on Scooby Doo, but something's ever-so-slightly off (I think it's the writing) and he isn't necessarily the highlight of the piece. It's difficult to say what is, however (perhaps Boyle's 'Old Man Wickles'). Most of the flick is generic and, quality-wise, average, at best. It doesn't really feel like anything at all, good or bad. Still, a bit of 'Scooby Dooby Doo' never did anybody any harm. 5/10"

Why aren't there any farting dogs? These were just some of the questions going through my head whilst watching this movie. Scooby Doo The Movie (the first one) worked on a couple levels, namely the farting dog & the excellent Matthew Lillard (he is Shaggy). However in the second film these fun elements are mainly overlooked for cheesy dance scenes, Freddy Prinze Jnr & plot (sorry just kidding about the plot). The afore mentioned plot involves someone bringing to life all of Mystery Inc's most famous foe's & the gang trying to solve the mystery (well there's a suprise). The unmasking of the villain at the end is so obvious that even my 7 year old daughter knew what was coming, and the so called adult nudge nudge wink wink jokes rarely hit the spot. There are however a couple of plus points. Matthew Lillard is again excellent (& under-used) as Shaggy & the gorgeous Linda Cardellini is also very good. The CGI effects are also very impressive & there are a couple of good action set-pieces, the Pteradactyl Ghost chasing the Mystery Machine standing out a mile. Overall this is a movie that only appeals to under 12's. My 3 daughters enjoyed it for the most part, but even my youngest commented that \"Scooby Doo didn't fart very much\". So you see the farting dog did appeal at some level, even if it was at a 32 year old man's & a 3 year old girl's."

I especially enjoyed Daphne, as Gellar portrayed her as a typical blonde, but also being clever and witty. It was nice seeing Alicia Silverstone make an appearance in the movie; it is too bad her role was only confined to a TV reporter role, which didn't contribute much to the story.\n\nLike the first film, the special and visual effects were colorful and and flashy, and I thought the ghost action was executed pretty well. The story was, though, a little whimsical and the dialog and jokes were somewhat off-the-wall. The plot was a little slow, and wasn't as exciting and lacks the charm and spirit as the first movie.\n\nIt is still great to see one of my favorite cartoons come to life in this sequel, which I think is a serviceable movie, but falls short of entertainment as in the first one.\n\nGrade C+"

It worked, and was so hilarious I was waiting for the second one to come out for sure.\n\nWith Scooby Doo things are different. I have kids and wasn't all that pleased with the first one. As time moves along and I watch SD1, it is tolerable and campy enough that it reminds me of my days watching the cartoon.\n\nSD2 fails miserably for me however.\n\nThe negatives are: Daphne: Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, and Daphne has been ruined. Sure she was the \"hot chick\" and internet jokes have always pitted her and Fred together, but in the show she was also intelligent and a believable mystery solver. In the movie, we don't know if she's a pin up doll or wanna be scholar who gets lucky from time to time. I also never knew she was Jackie Chan!\n\nFred: Sorry Freddie Prinz, you can't act either (see paper bag reference to Daphne). Like Daphne Fred is lost. Again, he was the ascot wearing good looking fella, but remember this was the 70s. So to make him more modern and hip is just wrong. The whole be yourself theme is just plain goofy, and he and SMG have ZERO chemistry.\n\nOverall story was not true to the cartoon. Underneath the ghosts and chases was a totally horrific \"be yourself\" message. If I wanted that I'd rent a John Hughes movie. For Scooby Doo, I want goofy chases and gaffes, and lots of food consumption.\n\nThe good:\n\nMatthew Lillard, again. He IS Shaggy, and shockingly has a real place in Hollywood as a decent character actor in films. He's rarely going to steal a scene but he always seems to pull off his characters exactly as he should.\n\nPeter Boyle was fabulous, the monsters were totally cool and Seth Green was excellent. You never quite knew if you could trust him, and that is a credit to how he played his character.\n\nAll in all, it was not true to the Scooby Doo feel and theme, so it was disappointing. One note though. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old. They both really enjoyed the movie. The ghosts can be scary for some kids who aren't very aware of what is fake and what is real. I'm lucky in that regard. They got a real kick out of the movie and yes, the fart jokes.\n\nFor the kids, I say , yes. Go see it. If you are looking to relive some old time fun, watch cartoon network or something.\n\nThe final thing that makes this movie livable, is no Scrappy Doo. He had his place and we poked fun, but thank you for not bringing him back!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I took the kids to see the first Scooby Doo movie 2 years ago. We all liked it okay, but I was very disappointed with the ending. And I HATED Scrappy Doo!\n\nNow on to Scooby Doo 2:\n\nBeing a huge fan of the animated series, I wish they had stuck a bit closer to the character appearances (Fred's hair and voice, Velma's attempt at femininity, Scooby's whole body). In addition I didn't like the \"Mystery Machine Limo\" that cameo'd in the opening scene, or their ultra cool hipster clubhouse-hideout loaded with expensive gadgets. I haven't seen every single episode of the cartoon, but I don't remember them having a \"clubhouse\" at all. Didn't they just cruise around in their van all the time?\n\nBut these complaints are small things that I can accept and overlook in view of the \"bigger picture\" which is: the story; the effects; and the delivery (acting and directing) of the presentation.\n\nOn these merits, the movie scored very well! Director Raja did an especially decent job sticking to the visual and storytelling style of the animated series: There were at least three of the infamous Scooby-trademarked chase-scenes; two scenes where Shaggy and Scooby royally screw things up; Shag and Scoob eating ten times their weight in junkfood; the typical \"bait and switch\" technique in finding out who the baddie was; and NO Scrappy Doo! (Yes!!)\n\nThe monsters were all taken directly from episodes of the cartoon. Their realization on the \"big screen\" was exceptional in every case.\n\nThe special effects - while not \"Oscar-worthy\" - were very well done. The opening-credits scene alone (where you follow a pterodactyl flying it's way through a maze of alleys and back-streets to the museum where we meet the \"gang\") is worth the admission price!\n\nGo see it if you like the cartoon series AND are open minded enough to accept some lewd humor (fart jokes, puking, and the like) and some slight character differences from the cartoon.\n\nMy 7 year-old son loved it too and was quoting some of the funnier lines as we walked to the car after it ended.\n\nI gave it 7 out of 10 which is about the most a movie like this could possibly expect for a rating. (I believe I gave the first Scooby Doo movie a rating of 4 or 5 out of 10.)\n\nCan't wait for another sequel! :)"

Seeing the various ghosts given a CGI makeover is rather fun....that being said...\n\nThere was no need for either the \"Scooby and Shaggy must redeem themselves\" or the \"Fred and Daphne have inferiority complexes\" plot lines. Very little screen time was spent on the actual mystery solving. There were a few good points, mostly related to creating visual pieces that remind you of the cartoon (exaggerated sneaking, Scooby/Shaggy carrying each other). For the guys, there's the sight of Velma/Linda Cardellini in a red leather catsuit, though not much for Sarah Michelle Gellar fans. Her one fight scene looks like it was lifted from a Buffy episode.\n\nUnless your child or inner-child are clamoring to see the movie (or you want to see the Harry Potter trailer), then you can wait for the video release."

        "review_title": "A highly polished, highly developed sequel",
        "review_detailed_main": "As sequels go Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is a good film. It's plot is a highly contrived, and tightly interwoven blend of modern day American youth struggling to combat the pressures and stresses forced upon them by outside influences. In this cinematic production, a great deal of that pressure is forced upon them by the cunning media moguls that closely follow their every move. I believe that this successfully conveys the pressures we can all feel from time to time from ones close to us, like our parents, for example. Teen angst is also explored thoroughly in this film when Velma (the intellectual one of the group) begins to doubt her sexual appeal to the males present in her life, in particular Patrick whom she meets during an exhibition being held at the city's museum.\n\nThrough adversity Velma battles to forge her place on the plain of existence within the very real world in which she dwells.\n\nShaggy and Scooby are the real centrepieces of the performance. They are ideally placed for illustrating to us all how each of us tries to 'fit in' with society, even though society itself can sometimes not be what we're looking for and can appear both bland and boring. Through these 2 characters alone the director, Raja Gosnell, takes his viewers on a roller-coaster of emotions, including self-doubt, lack of confidence, a wanting to please others and ultimately a triumphant return to form and the adoration and respect of those closest to us in our lives. Something I believe we are all striving for.\n\nScooby Doo 2 justifies the use of modern day cinema as a medium for conveying to us, the public, the difficulties of living and coping in today's world. But, it also shows us that with a little bit of self-belief and the support of others, we can achieve our ultimate goals and be accepted as an individual within society as whole.\n\nThe special effects rocked too."

This time the group that has a greater challenge when a mysterious masked man shakes the group that ends up in a disaster at a city exhibition becoming the target of criticism from the media and the population, it is up to the group to solve the mystery. Again scripted by James Gunn and directed by Raja Gosnell who evolve in history that manages to be superior to the first in practically everything including the villains who are very good different from the questionable choice of the first film, here we see several references of the animated series with famous monsters like Black Knight, Monster of 10 thousand Wolts, Bubble of Cotton, Frankenstein and Miner of 49. The cast in general is very good and the script manages to be funny and again provides a fun plot with the duo Sausage and Scooby very funny. The special effects are still weak, although they are better than the first.\n\nFilm seen on October 10, 2020."

There were music scenes, masked villains, an actual mystery, secret passages, a spooky mansion, humor and some of the lore of the multiple Scooby Doo series.\n\nThe CGI was better, and the character of Scooby seemed \"more realistic\" when compared to the rest of the cast. Matthew Lilliard and Linda Cardellini were still the best cast as Shaggy and Velma, however Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar greatly improved upon their original performance as Fred and Daphne.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed Scooby Doo 2, and if you enjoyed the original Scooby Doo cartoons, but felt cheated by the original Scooby Doo live movie, I highly recommend this one."

And the Villains, pretty much every single one of them turn up to seek it's revenge on the gang. Which, is very exciting. And the Villains design still holds up to this day. The best part about the film is how entertaining it is, and the pacing is very good. The story doesn't hold back and Scares, humour and some nice work between the cast who share some good chemistry and evoke on there childhood.

        "review_title": "Surprisingly good family fun.",
        "review_detailed_main": "When it comes to deciding what movies to see, critics are the last ones you should listen too. Why? Because they are all so concerned about the construction of a film, that they no longer know how to have fun with them. This is especially true when it comes to family movies. Not every movie can be The Lion King or Finding Nemo. Nor should they be expected to be. Family movies should be one thing, and one thing alone...fun. Scooby Doo 2 delivers this and then some. I thought the first film was barely mediocre, so I had very low expectations walking in to this one. I went only because my children loved the original and were excited to see this one, and I wanted to see them have a good time. What I didn't expect was to actually like the movie myself. The sequel far outdoes the original. There are several reasons for this. First off, the cast has become comfortable with their roles. In the first movie, only Matthew Lillard appeared to be having any fun, and his dead-on performance as Shaggy proved it. Here all the remaining cast has lightened up and joined in. So the performances are good all around. Secondly, the special effects are much improved. Scooby blends in more seamlessly even though you know he's CGI. There is an incredible shot of a ghostly pirate ship emerging from behind the buildings of the dowtown city that is amazing, and very reminicent of the Stay-Puft marshmallow man from Ghostbusters. Third, as a fan of the cartoons growing up, this one looks more like true Scooby Doo. In the first movie, the monsters were not very interesting. But here, to see so many of the classic animated monsters brought to life, was a thrill. Critics have made the complaint that it's too \"cartoonish\". Um, hello? It's based on a cartoon! What were you expecting? The movie is also very funny, although it does rely on fart jokes one too many times. Plus anyone over the age of 5 will figure out the villian's secret identity 10 minutes into the movie. But all in all, this is exciting family fun. Family movies exist soley for families to have a good time at the movies. This is definately a good time for kids of all ages. *** out of ****."

What i loved was the bad guys they brought into it - Miner 49er, Tar Monster, Black Knight, yes i did like that. A few more would have been good too. Again liked Velma, liked when Shaggy and Scooby drank potions. It was a good movie, long overdue in watching, now that its what 20 years old. But yes, good one."

Yes, its cartoony, but thats the way its supposed to be. And if Matthew Lilliard isn't Shaggy, I don't know who is. The characters seem pretty dead on, and it was awesome to see the black knight ghost come to life. Seems like I've seen that old episode at least 100 times. I don't understand the anger.

But, I eventually gave in.\n\nThe gang is facing trouble in their town. The town is about to be taken over and they have been getting hit hard with criticism especially by this good looking TV reporter. The gang have to save their town before it's overwhelmed by evil.\n\nThe acting is okay maybe on par with the first film. Matthew Lillard as Shaggy annoyed me more in this film than he did in the first. The others I think brought up their game. Alicia Silverstone and Seth Green are welcome additions to the cast.\n\nOverall, this is a better movie than the first. Too bad they are not making Scooby Doo 3. I rate this film 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, that's what it felt like to me. Seems like Scoob went down to Deadwood and picked himself up a couple of logs. A couple of logs by the name of Prinz and Gellar (aka Fred and Daphne). Talk about useless characters! This pair did nothing of any consequence in the entire film. Perhaps for Scooby Doo 3 the writers will recall that, in the end, the Scooby Doo cartoon was just Shaggy and Scooby and not all the pointless hangers on. Of course, there was Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb, but we won't go there.\n\nBut as for the cast, once again Matthew Lillard excelled as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini was a decent Velma. Scooby was, well Scooby, and pretty well done. In fact, the CGI for once was reasonable.\n\nBut as for the rest.....\n\nIt's a shame that the writers didn't have more imagination when they decided to \"re-imagine\" the Daphne character. Because all they've done is re-imagine her as Buffy and it's just retarded. So much is she that, in the future, when you're channel surfing and come across this movie you might not realize its Scooby Doo at all but think you're catching Buffy on a re-run.\n\nAs for the movie itself I guess its OK if you're a kid. But the charm of the cartoon was that the gang never faced real monsters. It was always someone in a mask. Whilst it was nice to see some of the old characters from the show being given the CGI treatment, the fact that they were now supposed to be real was a little boring.\n\nThere is some good humour fairly early on but it doesn't last long and the whole thing becomes a somewhat tedious slog to the finish which is made even more dire by the awful attempts to introduce a love interest for Velma and the whole character \"development\" thing pitifully attempted (and failed) for Fred and Daphne. At least the series was over in thirty minutes or so.\n\nThis sequel is neither worse nor better than the original, just more of the same. Only Shaggy and Scooby keep the film going for adult viewers and as for Gellar and Prinz......well, lets hope the writers remember why its called Scooby Doo next time."

First, I would like to say that whoever did the casting for Scooby Doo deserves a huge raise. He found the perfect people to play the different roles. The best fit will have to be Shaggy. This guy was born to play Shaggy. Something I still don't understand is where did Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) learn how to fight with the martial arts and learn to fight with weapons. She never had that power in the cartoons, but that's Hollywood for you. Anyway, I thought this sequel was better than the first one, mostly because they didn't have a good guy (Scrappy) playing the villian and the plot was pretty good and it still had its humor. Anyway, thats about all i have to say about this movie. Overall, this was an entertaining movie."

Our 7 year old was hysterical throughout most of the movie. We liked that it contained the monsters from the cartoons, especially one of my favorites the Black Knight. The plot was cheesy, but let's face it, aren't the cartoons the same?! Our 3 year old sat through the entire film without squirming around and this says that it truly can hold its own as far as a family film is concerned. I hate to say that one thing that disappointed me was that there was no sign of a Scooby Snack that I could tell. (I might have missed it, since I was shushing the kids.) I like the new updated looks and the fact that they are not playing Velma as being a lesbian. In fact, most will see a truly new Velma. Matt Lillard is an excellent Shaggy! All in all I will say that we were glad that we went."

This movie deserves more credit, and James Gunn should have made more family movies because this really shows his potential which he demonstrated again with Gaurdians of the galaxy. This movie wasn't really a 10/10, realistically I'd give it an 8 or so, but these unfair reviews are not a good reflection of the quality of the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see \"Scooby Doo 2\" today with my 26 year-old sister, 60 year-old father, and a theater full of kids ranging from 6 to 13 years of age. And guess what? We ALL enjoyed it. This movie isn't \"Hamlet,\" but it's not meant to be. Remember that it's based on a CHILDREN'S cartoon, so much of the humor is geared towards children, and the little boys sitting in front of me were having a ball!\n\nBut parent's needn't fear! The humor might be geared towards the kiddies, but with the exception of some crude toiler humor, there's nothing offensive or unpalatable to your average adult. I was laughing hysterically more than once! Everyone really kicked up their funny bones a notch for this one: Freddie Prinze, Jr was hilarious as the shaggily-coifed Freddy, and Sarah Michelle Gellar turned in another great performance as debutante Daphne. Linda Cardellini (Velma) had a very sweet romantic subplot with Seth Green's character, and Seth Green ALWAYS makes a movie ten times better than it would have been without him. Alicia Silverstone turns in a delighfully hateful performance as a spiteful entertainment reporter out to take down Mystery, Inc. And the best small part in the film comes from Peter Boyle (of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\"), who plays a bitter ex-rival of the Scooby gang.\n\nI love Matthew Lillard, but I thought he overplayed Shaggy in this one, letting the character's eccentric ticks and speech patterns get in the way of many of his scenes. But when he wasn't trying to be deliberately goofy, Lillard turned in a touching performance as Shaggy and Scooby begin to doubt whether they - the perennial \"screw-ups\" of the team - qualify as \"heroes,\" like the rest of the gang. And he had what was by far the best line in the entire film; it STILL has me laughing!\n\nSHAGGY: This ties as the most terrifying day of my life!\n\nVELMA: Ties with what?\n\nSHAGGY: Every other freaking day of my life!\n\nThe movie was a great day out, and I wish they'd released it during the summer, because it's perfect summer fare. They gave it enough of the cartoon elements without making it unbelievable, and each of the actors were perfectly in character. And beyond all that, the movie puts across a tastefully done message that it's important to embrace who you are and love yourself for what makes you YOU. This is something that kids should NEVER stop hearing, and if they have a good time while hearing it, than all the better. I give this one a thumbs up!\n\nPS - The second funniest scene in the entire film involves Freddy, the Black Knight Ghost, a mock-joust, and Bon Jovi's \"Wanted: Dead or Alive.\" I won't go into detail. You've got to see it to understand. ;) LOL!"

The storyline involves the gang attending a crime museum opening when a villain appears and releases several of the gang historical nemesis'. Meanwhile an evil scientist has created formulas that create monsters. How does all of this tie together? This movie is directed by Raja Gosnell (Big Moma's House) and stars Freddie Prinze Jr (I Know What You Did Last Summer), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Cruel Intentions), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Linda Cardellini (Broke Back Mountain), Seth Green (Robot Chicken), Peter Boyle (Red Heat) and Alicia Silverstone (Clueless). The special effects, CGI and atmosphere of this film is absolutely perfect for the content. The storyline is okay, and the writing for the characters other than Scooby and Shaggy is pretty mediocre; however, Scooby and Shaggy are hilarious and well written and delivered. The casting is well selected and fit the characters to perfection and the attire remains well selected. Overall this is a step down from the first film in terms of storyline and overall film but a huge step up in terms of special effects and monsters. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend it as a fun family film."

        "review_detailed_main": "While checking director Raja Gosnell's (`Scooby-Doo 1 and 2') resume I learned he had been editor of the little known comedy-horror classic, Troma's 1987 `Monster in the Closet.' So before I go on, forget what you think you know about Troma films to find and rent `Monster in the Closet.'. Meanwhile, in this second `Scooby Gang' installment we find our five heroes (Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Linda Cardellini as Velma, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Scooby Do) getting back to their cartoon roots when a mysterious masked madman brings a collection of monster costumes (worn by previous Scooby-Doo cartoon bad-guys) to life to terrorize the town of Coolville, home of the Mystery Machine. Someone on the last film's production team must have read the reviews of `Scooby-Doo 1' and listened because `Scooby-Doo 2' follows the cartoon formula that gave the television series it's signature style. Back are the locations we've come to expect: an abandoned, condemned mining camp; a desolate, decaying, haunted mansion, and a spooky, foggy swamp. And, as in the cartoons, our gang needs to unmask-unmask (if you're a fan of the cartoon you understand otherwise wait to see the film) the madman behind this who-can-it-be mystery, while Shaggy and Scooby try to prove to themselves that they too are heroes. Don't expect a work of art, but do expect lots of cartoon comedy, fart jokes, whacky chase scenes, and a few lines and scenes thrown in for the adults. One of my favorites was at the opening of the museum exhibit when the Scoobys walk the red carpet. Various groupies attached to each of the heroes greets them and, of course, the group that greets Shaggy is definitely stoned. The monsters unleashed are more funny than scary, which makes this a good intro to horror for little ones. (We need to start raising the next generation of horror fans.) They even added some depth to this cast with Seth Green (Austin Powers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as the museum curator; Alicia Silverstone (Batman and Robin, The Baby Sitter) as the Reporter; and the great character actor, Peter Boyle as Old Man Wickles. Fans of the Scooby-Doo cartoon series will certainly enjoy this film while others will get some cheap belly laughs."

James Gunn did a really good job with the script and Raja Gosnell directed this movie brilliantly.\n\nThe visual effects, costume and production designs are really great, especially the way they created the monsters and it was really amazing and the CGI on the monsters and Scooby-Doo is just freaking awesome.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Daphne fights the Black Knight. That was really cool, especially for Sarah Michelle Gellar, who was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer during the filming of this movie.\n\nThe acting is just incredible. The returning cast are really amazing this time around, I just wish they kept the deleted scenes in this movie and the film is just really amazing and fantastic. The music by David Newman is once again amazing. The newcomers are Seth Green, the late Peter Boyle, Tim Blake Nelson and Alicia Silverstone and they done really great performances.\n\nThe special features is really amazing in this film. You have the deleted scenes, again with and without commentary, two music videos, how the visual effects creators made Scooby-Doo dance, an insider's tool of the making of this movie and the movie-making process with Scooby-Doo, a True Ghoul Hollywood Story, two games on this film and trailers for the other movies released by Warner Bros. include THE POLAR EXPRESS and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and I will review those.\n\nOverall, I give SCOOBY-DOO 2 a 9 out of 10, while the DVD's special features gets a 9 out of 10 as well."

It was a bit of a creepy film but it is very funny. I Love the Scooby Doo cartoons and I think this movie was great. The first Scooby movie was great to but this one is more like the cartoons. The Voice of Scooby Doo was fantastic because it went with the image of Scooby Doo. I love the part at the end when Shaggy is wearing a mask of a monster and Scooby Doo thinks it is a real monster. I also like the bit when the gang fights with the monsters and Scooby Doo saves everyone.I loved the film and if Scooby Doo 3 will come out it will make it even more awesome."

In this one, the gang must stop a villain from bringing monsters they have captured back to real life. And Shaggy and Scooby decide they will be real detectives. I found myself laughing several times. One scene that comes to mind is when Fred is facing off against the knight and says bring it on. The knight beats him silly, and Fred says \"you brought it\" and falls down. Or Fred's interviews on TV. And the gang busts up Old Man Winkles meeting and come to the wrong conclusion. I even laughed at Seth Green's introduction. Velma even tries to dress sexy but ends up making some \"weird\" noises. Scooby searches for clues but just picks up a lot of stuff he wants. Shaggy says \"those aren't clues\". Funny. And I could go on and on.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: I recommend it for anyone looking for a fun film."

        "review_detailed_main": "On the very short list of movie sequels that are better than the original, you will find this movie. It is funny, sweet, and charming all at the same time. As a live action cartoon, it hits the mark perfectly. Not only was it fun to see the cartoon monsters brought to life, it was also fun to see how much the animators enjoyed giving them life. The morality tale of \"always be yourself\" was prevalent throughout, making for a wonderful message. Many people are overly critical of a movie like this, expecting things movies like this aren't meant to deliver. It is pure silly fun and not much more. For those unaware, the kids are blamed as things seem to go wrong in Coolsville. Determined to make things right, they track down the person behind the reappearances of old villains. Shag and Scoob trek out on their own determined to prove they can be good detectives. Down the road the gang meets up learning more about themselves along the way. Through teamwork and perseverence they (of course) get to the bottom of the mystery, unmasking the villain in classic Scooby Doo fashion. I am happy to say I had a completely enjoyable time at this movie, and was pleasantly surprised, as I hadn't expected much going in. In the wide world of moviedom, if you go in expecting Batman <The original with Adam West> instead of The Matrix, you should be in for a treat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scooby-doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is a good time of a movie & one super superior sequel. This funky film is full of stars we grew up watching in the 90's & early 2000's!!!\n\nI have alot of love for this particular Scooby-doo movie because me & one of my daughters watched this film constantly when she was little & i loved it just as much. Scooby-doo 2 is a kids film but it's also a joy for any adult that watched Scooby-doo as a kid. I've always loved Scooby-doo the cartoon & so my middle daughter got into it & loved it.\n\nThere's some great Scooby-doo films that we love, such as Camp Scare & Zombie Island & The Witches Ghost to name a few but it's Monsters Unleashed that is the best of the live-action movies.\n\nThe cast is perfect with the great Sarah Michelle Geller (Scream 2, The Grudge, I Know What You Did Last Summer) she was a big star during the 90's that i grew up watching in Buffy the Vampire Slayer & those films mentioned above. Sarah is a great actress & brought Daphne to life perfectly. Also Freddie Prinze Jr was a 90's star i grew up watching as he starred with Sarah Michelle Geller (his real life Wife) in the classic slasher \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" & it's sequel, he made a decently fun Fred. Also another 90's star was Mathew Lillard from Scream &13 Ghost's & many more things & really went all out & brought the crazy Shaggy to colourful life. Lillards performance as Shaggy is excellent & the greatest performance from the whole cast!!! The girl as Velma was new to me as an actress but she was great.\n\nThe legendary Scooby-doo is brought to life with CGI & he looked great for its time in 2004. Of course CGI has advanced massively but his look is Nostalgic for me now. Great memories watching this super sequel over & over again.\n\nThere's also a little role for another 90's star, Alicia Silverstone (Clueless, Batman & Robin) as a Coolsville Reporter, this movie really now is a time capsule of its era with its then popular stars.\n\nI love the story here about a masked villain that brings to life some of the most famous Scooby-doo monsters & how Coolsville turns against Mystery Inc.\n\nI love the big expensive & beautifully designed sets such as Mystery Inc's HQ & the big old spooky house & the villainous bar & the museum of Mystery Inc's captured monsters. The film looks fantastic as expected for its big lavish budget. The movie is colourful & full of fun. The CGI monster are fun with some also brought to life with rubbery costumes that gave it an old school 80's feel. There's lots of silly humour that is harmless & there's a real sense of friendship fun & fantasy adventure.\n\nAlso amongst the cast is another star of the time, Seth Green (Knockaround guys, Austin Powers) as Velma's love interest.\n\nAlso the great veteran actor Peter Boyle has a small fun role.\n\nThe Mystery Machine looks beautiful.\n\nEverything this about this film is fun & full of heart, yes it's often very cheesy because it's aimed at kids & some of the gags are abit too silly but you can't help but enjoy it all.\n\nI have many fond memories of watching this film with my daughter & i will always have a soft spot for Scooby-doo 2 in my movie loving heart."

        "review_title": "Enjoyable But Fair Sequel",
        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie as much as I enjoyed the first one. The dizzying opening is enough to provoke headaches, but its worst criticism is that its inspired from the worst end of the Scooby spectrum - the ridiculous cartoon parody Scooby became rather than the Gothic masterpiece it was meant to be. Lillard is again excellent although Shaggy now has an identity crisis as well as selective amnesia. Thinking he's not worth anything to the team, he's forgotten he has found important clues in the past. Cardelini's presence still shines through her Velma disguise and Sara is also a gracious presence, but Prinze still falls short playing Fred as a stuck up and short-sighted playboy. Alicia Silverstone is a welcome presence even playing a \"rhymes with witch\" although I had would have preferred a different and much more grand end to her character. Seth Green, however, just sorts of wanders through his scenes though. I big complaint I have as I did with the first movie is that since the Scooby Gang started in the Late Sixties/Early Seventies that they would be in their Forties today. Scooby would be 259 years old (37 in people years). The plot has a lot of fake science and far-fetched magic goes into creating the ghouls from the TV series, but there's not enough images of the classic creatures. I would have preferred to see The Headless Specter, the Giggling Green Ghosts, Ebenezer Crabbe and the No-Face Zombie among others. Continuity and established facts are now out the window as the movie makes up its own history as Aggie Wilkins is now a brunette and C.L. Magnus is missing his fortune. The Miner '49 can now spew fire, but then it doesn't look the guy from the cartoon. I'm not sure if the bald thing was supposed to be the Creeper or not, and where the heck did Chickenstein and the Cotton Candy Ghost come from? Worst among the plot points is that the Pteradactyl was actually John the Caterer from \"Hang In There, Scooby Doo.\" Who the heck is Jacobo? Well, that's creative license for you. The writers can screw up everything they want to make their movie. I just hope Scooby Doo III can live up more to the cartoon series than the first movie did."

Why can't we take this movie at face value - just enjoy it for it's campy humor and be happy in the knowledge that they have remained true to their characters and plot lines.\n\nIf you are looking for substance, you shouldn't watch a movie based on a cartoon.

The scene at 'The Faux Ghost' is great too, Scooby dancing is something I never thought I would see! It is a well known fact that the first film in a series is always the best, but in this case I think this one is better, as it contains more humour and brilliant cast members, including obsure ones. If you enjoyed the first film there is no doubt you will like this one too, if not more. The unmasking actually surprised me unlike the cartoons which may as well begin with 'WARNING!!! CONTAINS PREDICTABLE CONTENT!!!' Great for all ages."

The CGI did not improve from the first movie, but it didn't get any worse at least. The negative reviews really make me wonder if any of them are a true fan of the original cartoon. The episodes were silly but extremely enjoyable and I always looked forward to choosing which episode to watch after school. This brings nostalgia and everything I need in a live action film. Don't take it so seriously and you might actually enjoy it. It's a fun film and hits the nail on the head."

They are the ones that make us laugh. They are the ones that take our minds off the real world for a couple hours. And they did their job.\n\nMatthew Lillard becomes Shaggy for the second time. What he is able to do in this film is incredible. You forget he is Mr. Lillard because he fully becomes the character he portrays. That is the highest compliment you can give an actor (minus a 20 million dollar check).\n\nScooby again is a riot. The writing allows him to remain the lovable character we grew up with as kids. He alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nThe story? Well, I have eaten swiss cheese with less holes in it than the plot. But, who really cares? I can watch The Godfather whenever I want a flawless film. But, The Godfather does not leave me in a better mood after I finish watching it, no matter how great it is. I saw this movie relax and have a good old time.\n\nI am not ashamed to say that my wife and I went to see this together. We have no children...WE wanted to see it. And we both enjoyed it very much. It was a pleasant way to spend the evening. But don't take it from me. Take it from the dozens of small children that were in there, laughing and shrieking through the whole film. You could hear how much they were enjoying themselves. Come to think of it, that was worth the admission price in itself."

Characters and plot are greatly developed. This movie was especially brilliant in that the characters and story were able to be more complex all the while it stuck to it's basic roots. Monster/see the gang (exposition) - Masked figure Problem/who's to blame (rising action) - more thefts/ find monster source (climax) - destroy the source/unmask the masked figure (conclusion). The comedy (though dry on a couple jokes) was much better and unexpected at times than the first. My conclusion: Bunny."

And when I heard that Cooby was coming to the big screen. I was so for this project. The first film was freaking hilarious, and new that the second was going to topple that one, and boy did it. More laughs, more scares, and more Doo. The whole plot was unique, and was totally fabulous to watch. I was laughing so bad that I was in tears. The whole 70's Dancing Scooby, I thought I was going to pee my pants from laughing so hard. This movie is the one to watch. It kept true to the old cartoon. I wished they added some more Ghosts from the original series. Oh well there is always Scooby Doo 3."

It had the look and feel of the old cartoon. The characters seemed more cartoonish, the plot, the sets, etc.\n\nThis could very well have been the first film, if not tweaked slightly. This one blows the first out of the water."

Mysteries are on par with original episodes with a nice spice of originality. Movie is well filmed using bright colors and appealing personalities. All actors and actresses do a wonderful job of playing the characters, emulating voices and overall presence. The two that really stand out are Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, they are outstanding! The others are good too, but Matthew and Linda really bring it home!"

Very slapstick.\n\nFrom an adult perspective, I appreciate the slapstick as well. While the story may be formulaic, I still like the results. I am still amazed at the match the studio was able to get between the live action actors and the cartoons/voices from the originals cartoons. I also appreciated the Buffy links through Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Michelle Geller, and Seth Green. 7 stars from my view."

Since this is based on a cartoon, don't over-analyze the plot holes, just willingly suspend your disbelief. It made $83 million in the box office. A moderate success, IMO. Lillard saying the box office was disappointing and that's why there will be no Scooby 3 doesn't seem true to me."

Next, the characters were funny and cheerful just like in the cartoon shows especially Scooby Doo and Shaggy. Third, Vilma,Fred and Daphne were interesting and very serious about their investigations on each case they faced. Overall Scooby Doo 2 was fantastic and surprising since you'll never know who the real monster/bad guy is until the conclusion of the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, I gave Scooby Doo 2 a 10/10. Thanks to the actors,directors and performers who helped this movie to become possible.Plus, the Mystery Machine vehicle looks authentic and pretty much the same as the ones in the animated shows of Scooby Doo.\n\nIn addition,it was fun to watch over and over again and without a doubt you wouldn't get bored while watching it."

And the use of villains from previous \"Scooby-Doo\" cartoon episodes, such as the Black Knight and Captain Cutlass, shows great potential. I admire that the movie adheres to the spirit of the cartoon this way. To true Scooby-Doo fans, \"Monsters Unleashed\" might be a disappointment, but not a complete one!"

I liked the first one but it lacked alot of the Scooby elements, with this sequel, I felt like I was watching an actual Scooby Doo cartoon episode with them running around creepy mansions and a town with monsters on the loose. It was also wonderful getting to see some of their old villains come back and I really liked how they played that up. I agree with what was said in an early user's comment about it getting bad reviews because of the people who are reviewing it, they're basically looking for Oscar nominations not the fun side of things. I usually tend to enjoy the movies thatget bad reviews the most. I was proud of Sarah Michelle Gellar, she wasnt as annoying as she was in the first. One problem I would have to say I had with them film was there were too many sappy moments where they had to give each other pep talks and tell each other that they are worth something or they'll mope around feeling sorry for themselves, some if it is good to have but it seems they broke off from the action to include one of these scenes. As a whole, I really liked this movie and I was laughing more then I did in the first one."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have just returned from having seen Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed in a packed theatre, not a single seat left empty. Families with kids from toddler to teen populated the dark interior. There were some moments during the movie when I cringed, expecting to hear the frightened shrieks of the younger, more sensitive members of the audience but was relieved to hear not one single cry, not even when the sound effects got loud, not even when I jumped a couple of times at the unexpected.\n\nThe quick (and correct) plot summary is: Mystery, Inc. has donated costumes to the Coolsonian Criminology Museum. These costumes were worn by the various schemers and crooks over the years that Mystery, Inc. has unmasked when solving assorted mysteries. Someone has devised a way of creating real monsters by using these costumes and a substance called randomonium and that same someone is determined to completely destroy Mystery, Inc. and Coolsville with these new monsters.\n\nThere were some really cool moments in this movie, the Pterodactyl ghost flying away with the Evil Masked Figure was pretty awesome, Shaggy and Scooby playing with chemical potions was very funny, Seth Green is very funny as the museum curator. There are the pre-requisite fart jokes but they are funnier than what was in the first Scooby Doo movie, the theatre laughed hard at one scene involving Miner 49er during his unfortunate encounter with Shaggy and a nervously gassy Scooby. In fact, most everything about Scooby Doo 2 is better, funnier, cleaner and smarter than the first one. There were a few scenes that felt a little clumsy, Fred being masculine, Daphne being Buffy-ish and Scooby dancing makes three. For some reason the Black Knight Ghost was given a lot of dialogue, unfortunately you can't understand a single word except his last sentence, which happens to be a bad pun. The other ghosts are mostly, and appropriately, monosyllabic, as were their cartoon forerunners.\n\nThe special effects are seamless right from the beginning, the Pterodactyl-eye view of Vancouver, BC as Coolsville is stunning. The shimmer effects with the ghosts is very cool, the bright and vibrant colors lend to the completely fantastical vision of this fantastically fictional place inhabited by the most normal looking oddballs one could imagine. This time around, Matthew Lillard, (there is no better Shaggy), gets to play more with Scooby. Linda Cardellini still has the Velma vibe going and Neil Fanning is the Scooby voice master. Sadly, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar still do not understand who Fred and Daphne are or what they are about. It's distracting to see preppie Fred turned into a valley/skaterboy and I do not remember Daphne being so vapid and self-involved. Peter Boyle makes a perfect Old Man Wickles, cranky and completely bothered by the very existence of Mystery, Inc., Tim Blake Nelson in his brief appearances as Jacobo looks completely crazed. Alicia Silverstone was adept as a TV reporter who apparently has a bit of a grudge against Daphne. That leaves the stars of this movie, the monsters, most of which are CGI and voiced by experienced voice actors in the usual cartoon manner, but four of the ghosts are actually humans inside elaborate costumes. They did an excellent job of acting through the layers of prosthetic makeup, costuming and physical absence of their CGI screen mates. The added effects of glowing randomonium and varying degrees of transparency combined with complete obedience to their leader, the Evil Masked Figure, made the danger to the inhabitants of Coolsville apparent.\n\nThe sets, costumes, music, sound effects, visual effects, it all works to transfer the small-screen cartoon to the big screen in live action. For Game Boy Advance players, stay until after the very last name in the credits has rolled to see what Scooby Doo has just for you."

Box office numbers be damned I say!\n\nOnce again all of the lead actors give performances that are true to character and I love the interactions that they have with the supporting cast too.\n\nThis time they face a whole host of spooks and have to prove themselves to be the cool dudes that they are as their reputation is put on the line.\n\nIt's got the same silly humour and camaraderie as the first and it would probably score as high as that one if it wasn't repeating some of the jokes (They still work though) and didn't cheapen it by bringing in Big Brovaz, a band that disappeared as quickly as they came.\n\nI'm sure I'll get stick from the 22 year old uber-fan nephew, but I'm not saying that it's bad at all.

And Scooby Doo is a classic funny cartoon from the 90's.\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini , Matthew Lillard are great actors. I think if they ever make a Scooby Doo 3 they should be included. Freddie Prinze Jr {as Fred} makes a great Fred, although he was too acty. [rating on Freddie as Fred is 8.5] Sarah Michelle Gellar {as Daphne} acted great, except she pretty much acted the same as Buffy. [rating on Sarah as Daphne is 9.5] Linda Cardellini{as Velma} acted great![rating on Linda as Velma is 10]Matthew Lillard{as Shaggy} acted well, but I am sure the director could of found somebody much better.[rating on Matthew as Shaggy is 7.5]\n\nThe movies {Scooby Doo 1 and 2} were awesome. But Scooby Doo the movie didn't relate to the cartoon series but it was better than the second one. I rate it a 10. Scooby doo 2 pretty much was like the series and I liked it.But I think the perfect title should be Scooby Doo 2: Monsters United. I rate it a 9.5.

        "review_detailed_main": "Although Shaggy(Matthew Lillard), and Scooby hogged all the attention, this movie haven't lost its touch. Fred and Daphne(Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar) were closer than the first. Velma(Linda Cardellini) was still the brains behind the group, yet the most insecure of the group as well. She seems to work well with Shag and Scoob rather than Fred and Daph. Shaggy and Scooby are always the cowardly of the group, yet they never realize how well they're good at finding clues that the others don't.\n\nThis movie is also more musical than it was in the first one. It was sure a howl when Scooby had on that afro. He was really FUNNY! Unfortunately, he really gave out that term \"wigging out\". Velma didn't lose her glasses that much in this movie. I think she is hot, with and without her glasses, and when i saw her with those leather pants and heels. She made a real stiff out of herself. I mean she was completely awkward.\n\nBattling most of the creatures past made a big difference in this sequel. And seeing the past criminals was also interesting as well. And all this time, the gang were tailing the wrong man throughout the movie, and Heather(Alicia Silverstone) was a shady character as well, trying to smear the Mystery Inc. gang. Shame on you! Although she was fake.\n\nThe music number was flawless, Ruben Studdard of \"American Idol\" do the old Earth, Wind,& Fire's \"Shining Star\" which everyone really put on a show. And I think it what makes this movie better than the first. I think its time to start bashing the critics about the movie, it's one of my favorite cartoons, and I'll enjoy it from time to time. But I hope there's no chance for a third one. If there is one, make sure no one hogs the screen light like Lillard did! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!"

James Gunn did a really good job with the script and Raja Gosnell directed this movie brilliantly.\n\nThe visual effects, costume and production designs are really great, especially the way they created the monsters and it was really amazing and the CGI on the monsters and Scooby-Doo is just freaking awesome.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Daphne fights the Black Knight. That was really cool, especially for Sarah Michelle Gellar, who was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer during the filming of this movie.\n\nThe acting is just incredible. The returning cast are really amazing this time around, I just wish they kept the deleted scenes in this movie and the film is just really amazing and fantastic. The music by David Newman is once again amazing. The newcomers are Seth Green, the late Peter Boyle, Tim Blake Nelson and Alicia Silverstone and they done really great performances.\n\nThe special features is really amazing in this film. You have the deleted scenes, again with and without commentary, two music videos, how the visual effects creators made Scooby-Doo dance, an insider's tool of the making of this movie and the movie-making process with Scooby-Doo, a True Ghoul Hollywood Story, two games on this film and trailers for the other movies released by Warner Bros. include THE POLAR EXPRESS and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and I will review those.\n\nOverall, I give SCOOBY-DOO 2 a 9 out of 10, while the DVD's special features gets a 9 out of 10 as well."

Daphne can kick some major monster butt! I just love her!\n\nFred was okay. I like his new hair cut. Velma is hilarious! I Love the scenes with her and Patrick.\n\nAs for Shaggy, well where to start? This guy was also freaking hilarious. Matthew Lillard brings Shaggy into real life! His the most believable Scooby Doo character in the movie. His so gosh darn cute, and I swear I love that Shaggy voice. Oh and the part where Scooby and Shaggy ate some dangerous chemicals! Well I won't spoil you, but it was funny as heck.\n\nOverall this movie was fantastic! If you have a kid it's a must see! If you don't it's still a must see movie!"

I mean, what do you expect? It's a live action cartoon, keep that in mind. This isn't suppose to be social commentary or a \"change the world for the better\" movie. It's about a group of Ghost busters and their dog. If you have kids and find the cartoon entertaining, then this is a great movie to see. If your looking for something other that just good entertainment then go watch something else. I was very disappointed in reviews that blasted the movie. This will be one movie I look forward to seeing again on DVD."

This is one of those movies that keep the views on thier feet. It was a great movie to bring my nephew too, he really enjoyed it as a kid. But I found myself enjoying something a little different, fun and entertaining. I didn't remember seeing Alicia Silverstone in the first one, but that could just be me. I think the cast was great too, they are all the uprising stars you see in movies here and there. Good show, something different and very fun! I'd recommend taking all the little ones or even for something different. Two thumbs up, nice work!"

To a degree that may be true (hey, nothing wrong with making a buck!).\n\nThat said, this film still contains some items of interest. For the kids, great show, very funny and enjoyable. For those who grew up with the animated series, you will love it. Very true to the original cartoon series with a lot of the same type features and plot devices. For those who are a fan of the \"animated actor\" (I think we can start to use that phrase now to differentiate a character from just a special effect, I mean, what would the LOTR films be without the input of Golum) there are some great scenes of interaction.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this film is not simply a remake of the first film (as a lot of sequels are), this very much stands on it's own feet. However, I do think that this really should be the last feature film we see of the Scooby characters, I honestly don't think a third one will sustain the momentum that well.\n\nOverall - **1/2 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a \"Scooby Doo\" fanatic!! No one was more excited about the live action version back in 2002 than me (although I was looking forward to a Scarborough-esque retelling when Mike Myers was still attached to the project (complete with a Barenaked Ladies cover of the second greatest theme song in television history!!)). I, a 30+ year-old woman, much to the chagrin and delight of my friends/work colleagues, even had a \"Scooby Doo\" countdown. I bought my nieces and friends (forced to accompany me to what was sure to be the film event of a generation) Scooby-Doo merchandise. Nothing could ruin this moment for me, until I actually saw the film! Needless to say that my utter disappointment in their first attempt (Shaggy is a vegetarian...hello what about all of those salami sandwiches he and Scooby ate in the cartoons!!) didn't put me in a state of readiness for the second offering but my love of that wacky Great Dane and the promise of the superb Seth Green did make me want to see Number 2...a little bit. Well, this time I was not disappointed! They actually got it right this time!! A tribute rather than a joke at the expensive of long time (and yes over 30!) fans and only one fart joke (and not a bad one at that!)! It was great to see all the old monsters creatively redone in CGI! The cast was excellent (ok, it's not Shakespeare but they did a great job with the fantastic, pure camp that they had and it was good, old-fashioned fun camp this time too!). And yes, Seth Green was amazing as ever (psycho, cute, and lovable all wrapped up in one neat little package!) So, go and see SD2, especially if you didn't like the first one. If you're anything like me (and heaven help you if you are!) you'll like it...a lot!!!"
