        "review_detailed_main": "In my perverse desire to see every film in the bottom 100, I thought I could not go far wrong with a rental of this classic POS. Mariah Carey's first and so far only feature film is an example of how the combined MPAA and RIAA attempts to shovel garbage at us are starting to backfire. Sales of Mariah's recordings, once one of the highlights of an otherwise dreary RIAA mainstream catalogue, have slumped. It's all because of this film. Don't let the blind Mariah fans fool you - it is just as bad as critics say, and deserving of its bottom 100 status.\n\nWhere to begin when pulling apart this cinematic abortion? For me, the first major problem was the cinematography. If the viewer is not clued in on the fact that Vondie Curtis-Hall has only directed television before this film as it starts, the flat, Days-Of-Our-Lives-style shots will soon make it clear enough. Directors who put one or two actors, three tops, in a 2.35:1 frame are a dime a dozen. On the other hand, directors who cannot even differentiate these actors' spacing from the camera truly stand out, and not in a good way.\n\nThe story has been described as being syrupy enough to kill anyone who suffers from diabetes (or doesn't), and I am not going to contest that. It's a variation upon the classic rags to riches theme, specifically tailored towards Mariah. Mariah essentially plays herself in the guise of a young vocalist who starts singing backup for a considerably less talented vocalist. As she crosses the paths of more people, eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. One DJ eventually picks her up, manages her through a record deal, and promises her that one day she *will* play in Madison Square Garden, or something along those lines.\n\nThis kind of story has been done before, with such real-life examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme. The problem here is that we've heard this story a million times before. Another significant problem is that while Mariah has a voice many would kill for, there is absolutely nothing that stands out, even slightly about her material. As an old girlfriend of mine once said, the longer it takes the RIAA to twig to the fact that being female doesn't mandate wanting to hear this formulaic ballad crap, the more business they are going to lose to independents who support bands like Opera IX. I think the fact that Mariah's last album disappeared without trace in spite of having millions of dollars spent on its promotion proves her right.\n\nMariah's story is also incredibly bland, to say the least. So her junkie mother gave her up when she was young. Oh boo hoo. It happens, and you're probably better off for it, get over it already. The previously-mentioned Jacksons could run rings around the likes of Mariah Carey for sob stories, and their reluctance to deal with the media at large is a telling thing. So in the end, we are simply left with another example of the mainstream trying to seem alternative, and failing.\n\nI gave Glitter a one out of ten. I don't think I am being too harsh. I think it is so amazingly bad that it becomes comedic, at least on the first viewing. I suspect that repeated viewings will simply become boring."

I kid you not this is a really awful movie... only the most inept movie fan or an insanely die hard Mariah Carey fan could ignore the gaping holes in plot, directions, style, and acting that Glitter presents.

        "review_detailed_main": "Seeing 'Glitter' with an open mind, despite its notoriously awful reputation, it is not quite as horrendous to be down there with the worst films of all time, but the problems 'Glitter' has are plentiful and are significant enough to consider it a very bad film still.\n\nThe good news is that Mariah Carey does sound absolutely incredible, always have loved her voice with its beautiful tone, emotional connection and uniquely wide range. Also Terrence Howard is quite good and steals scenes.\n\nHowever, Carey's enviable skills as a singer does not translate in her skills as an actress, it was really strange that an artist with such a huge vocal range (five octaves!) is the complete antithesis in her very one-note and often expressionless acting here, which is devoid of any joy, surprise, sincerity or emotion. The ability to connect emotionally with her songs also doesn't translate in the acting, she looks stiff and bored throughout here.\n\nUnfortunately, the songs here do nothing for her vocal talents either. She sings them very well indeed, but there are far more memorable and emotionally powerful songs from her out there that also display her unique vocal gifts much more. They're not awful, just bland. The rest of the acting is also poor, with Max Beesley being equally lousy and not sounding sure what accent to pull off, while with the characters Carey's is shallow, one-dimensional and very difficult to relate to (which is a huge dividend considering the type of story it is) and the rest are annoying caricatures, a couple even irrelevant to the story.\n\nEven for a film set in the 80s, 'Glitter' does much less than glitter and looks firmly stuck in the 80s. It looks gaudy and too much of the camera work is too gimmicky and amateurish. The structurally wafer-thin script, with clumsy attempts at being hip, embarrassingly unfunny humour and \"poignant\" moments that come over as emotionally manipulative, sounds even older than that and like an awkwardly written soap-opera rejected at first draft (and should have stayed there).\n\n'Glitter' has very little story, it's very thin and aimless, and padded by the bland and uninspiredly choreographed songs shot like a series of out of date music videos and subplots that come out of nowhere and go very little further than that (i.e. the reappearance of the cat or the reunion with her mother). It starts tedious and loses even more drive as it plods on, and throughout like Carey's performance there's no joy, no emotion and no substance. The direction is decidedly inept.\n\nOverall, not that horrendous but it is no wonder that Carey herself regrets being involved in this. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

That would explain the presence of Ann Magnusona as a press agent for the record company. Mariah is sincerely likable and sings beautifully. The same cannot be said for poor Padma Lakshima. Sort of an R&B version of \"A Star Is Born\", you will find yourself laughing in all the wrong places. Every clich\u00e9 in the book and then some. There is a fashion photo shoot with silver body paint, and an evening dress that goes from stage to farm in one day.

Carey's funky/erotic music is driving (and her performance as blazing new talent Billie Frank is adequate), but the script for \"Glitter\" seems left over from the 1950s. Didn't the writers realize that times have changed and that Billie didn't have to be such a diva-doormat? Actresses of a lot higher caliber than Mariah Carey have fallen into this trap--they just don't want to see themselves on the screen acting bitchy and tough, so they end up playing the simp. \"Glitter\" features some rich cinematography (nice shots of the Big Apple), but it is too soft to make an impression--even as an unintended comedy. *1/2 from ****"

And though Mariah is plenty vacuous in the starring role, she doesn't reach the heights of strenuously bad acting that Elizabeth Berkeley does in Showgirls. The only element of this movie that satisfies my so-bad-it's-good criteria is the character of Mariah's boyfriend. Here you have the whitest man on Earth, saying 'hip' things like \"I'm a'ight\" and \"when you got no food in yo crib\". If only the movie had contained more cringe-worthy gems like those!"

I truly can't say how bad it was on this post without resorting to, and making up new, swear words.\n\nThat said, I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon some show on MTV about celebrities' homes during a segment about Pariah Careless herself. Let's just say that I used to think she was the Devil. Now I know that there are worse, more pretentious, and just all-around truly more terrible and terrifying things than the Devil.

I pray to unknown benevolent gods that I never hear the wet, poison tentacle-claws scratching their way in through my door.

        "review_detailed_main": "Some bad movies, such as Showgirls or Mommie Dearest, become camp classics over time as people come to forgive their shortcomings, and just groove on their excesses. That a movie as famously bad as Glitter has not entered this realm of camp, even after fifteen years, is telling. It tells us that Glitter commits a higher sin than being bad. It is boring. And derivative. And staggeringly incompetent. It was assembled by c-list writers and a TV director, none of whom had much idea how to gain a viewer's attention, and less idea how to hold it. Scene composition is flat and dull, evoking memories of bad holiday TV movies, while failing to establish intimacy with the characters or goings on, even in close up. Early scenes feature a hazy or gauzy look, no doubt to recall Hollywood's golden age, but that simply succeeds in making the movie look trite and derivative, rather than classic. It also makes it look as if the set decorator forgot to dust. The club scenes feature a color palette straight out of Blade Runner, just not as cheery. Every creative element in Glitter has the look of something borrowed from another (better) movie. And the less said about the bizarre, almost random editing choices the better. Every scene transition is another wtf moment.\n\nStory and script construction are uniformly terrible. Scenes begin, stuff happens, scenes end... and NOTHING carries over. There is no continuing thread here of any kind - no overall character arc, no central theme, no ongoing visual motifs outside of the movie's hilariously inaccurate 80's fashion sense. Everything that happens seems utterly pointless, just a string of clich\u00e9s recycled from old movies in which the chorus girl gets her big break. Glitter's brain-dead script gives none of its performers, not even once by accident, anything original or clever to say, nor any awareness of the storyline's utter inanity, making it increasingly difficult for the viewer to connect with the drama. And then we come to the Razzie-winning central 'performance'. La Carey could have been replaced by a Miss Piggy doll and the central role would have had more animation. Mariah's singular expression of vague incomprehension never changes, not even when gangster Terrence Howard grabs her face! To be fair she is not Glitter's only zombie marionette. Outside of Ann Magnusson's over-the-top pr woman, no actor in Glitter's 100 minute running time seems committed to being in any way memorable. A cynical person might suggest that they did this so that they could keep Glitter off their resumes without fear of contradiction. The result is a movie that defies any viewer to keep paying attention to it. You find yourself wanting to make a salad or do your taxes while the movie is playing, anything so that the time spent watching it is not a total waste.\n\nThis brings us to the music. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that the most important element in any musical is music, despite the fact that the word is right there in the name of the genre. Grease turns into a pretty bad movie whenever the singing stops and The Bodyguard is only marginally better. Both were huge hits however, and the fact that their soundtracks went multi-platinum was not a coincidence. Purple Rain features some downright cringe inducing 'acting' by Prince and Appolonia, but redeems itself time and time again with great musical performances. Viewers will put up with so-so filler in a musical as long as the songs entertain and remain in the mind after the credits roll. Glitter, unfortunately, features Mariah's worst ever (and worst selling) album at its core. Not only are the musical sequences not entertaining on their own, but they also make it hard for the viewer to swallow the idea that fictional Mariah would become a superstar on the strength of them, since actual established star Mariah could not manage to peddle them in real life. Thus, the fictional Mariah fails to engage as a performer, the actual Mariah fails to cross over into Hollywood despite having great singing talent and only having to play a person with singing talent, and even the spectacle of these failures fails to entertain on the basic level of a train wreck.\n\nGlitter simply cannot provide an adequate reason to exist. Mariah's musical ability has already been showcased in a long succession of music videos, to better effect, and so we don't need Glitter for that. Rags to riches musical biographies have been done to death, so we hardly need another. The Girl in the Gold Boots told substantially the same story to drive-in goers fifty years ago! Heck, 42nd Street wore out this clich\u00e9d genre in 1933. If Glitter's only purpose was to act as a 100 minute commercial for its own soundtrack, as the Pokemon cartoons are simply ads for Pokemon toys, it fails there too, since it makes these crummy songs even less palatable in context than they would be standing on their own. So why does Glitter still exist? Was it financed by someone with a grudge against Mariah Carey, and she never caught on that she was being pranked until after its release? As a practical joke played on a gullible and vain pop diva, Glitter is pure malevolent genius. If, however, we were meant to have taken it seriously, then it's just a really, thoroughly worthless movie.\n\nPoll question: Which pop diva embarrassed herself worst? JLo in Gigli, Jessica in The Dukes of Hazzard, Britney in Crossroads, Clarkson in From Justin to Kelly or Mariah in this piece of drek? I vote Mariah in a close race."

It's a penalty where the opposing team stops the runner and after the play is blown dead, opposing players keep jumping on the guy with ball--a definite no-no. Well, to me, this film conjures up this term, as when the film came out, reviewers seemed to come out of the woodwork to say how terrible the film was. In fact, they took great delight in talking about how bad the film was--shortly after release it was already legendary--perhaps made more so by Mariah Carey's nervous breakdown. Many speculated that this film led to this. Well, while I'd never say this is a good film, it certainly wasn't as bad as they said and it seemed that people were just piling on poor Mariah. Now I am NOT a fan of her music--up until this film, I barely ever heard any of it, but I felt bad for her because of all the hubbub.\n\nAs I said, the film isn't good but it isn't terrible. The biggest problems were with the script--which was essentially A STAR IS BORN. The film had already been made too many times by the time Barbra Streisand did it a few decades ago--now, the story is so old and has been done so many times that it just seemed like a giant clich\u00e9. In many ways, also, Mariah's character seemed a bit like a battered woman and it felt frustrating that she kept holding on to a guy who was an obvious jerk--making her character seem a bit pathetic. Additionally, the film suffered, at least for me, with a severe case of \"music video-itis\". In other words, there were so many musical numbers, at times it seemed more like a bunch of music videos strung together with a bare plot--not a real film. Of course, there have been much worse examples of this type of film--such as Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET--which had significantly less plot than GLITTER (yes, it is possible).\n\nBut, on the positive side, Ms. Carey sure can sing and was absolutely beautiful--in fact, stunning. Also, her acting (which took a lot of abuse) wasn't that bad, either. In fact, had this film gone over a bit better, I could have seen her going on to other acting projects and improving her craft. Now, however, I don't think there's a chance in a billion! So, my overall verdict is that this is an okay film at best. However, it did not deserve all the attention the Razzies gave it--it's not really a movie that is enjoyably bad...just a bit dull and very predictable. However, if you adore her music, you could do a lot worse than see this film.\n\nPoor Mariah. After this film tanked, all she had was her immense fortune and jet-set life."

Her performance is something that deserves to be commented. In the past, Mariah Carey had a beautiful face. Get the VHS 'The First Vision', and you will see a gorgeous woman with brunet curled hair, natural eyebrows, nose and cheeks. Now, this female version of Michael Jackson is pathetic, with blond straight hair, thin nose and eyebrows and cheeks with silicone. Her acting is ridiculous, blinking all the time. When she is happy, she blinks. When she is sad, she blinks. When she is in love, she blinks. The number of times she blinks along this flick could be a reason for a funny game: 'Guess how many times she will blink in such a period of the movie?' And even singing, she exaggerates with her 'uhs... uhs..' (as usual). The DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) looks like a clone of Mark Wahlberg. Maybe fans of Mariah Carey may like this movie, but I am not his fan. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Glitter, o Brilho de uma Estrela\" (\"Glitter, the Bright of a Star\")"

For 13 years I avoided it for that reason, but when I finally watched it, I was surprised to find myself in the very small camp that found the movie entertaining, although certainly not wonderful. The script is rather dull, and it keeps interfering with the songs. I found myself saying out loud to the director, \"Will you let her finish a song before you cut to more insipid dialog!\" There is some really nice music going on during the movie--not just Carey, but Stevie Wonder and Luther Vandross and others thrown in for good measure. And Terrence Howard steals every scene he is in as the villain."

How anyone had the audacity to commission this crock of pap is beyond me. Carey simply can't act, she is truly awful in this film as are most of the rest of the cast. The 'story' is a semi autobiographical account of the leading lady's life, which is always a sign of a weak plot but this just takes the biscuit! After forty-five minutes I started reading the newspaper, after fifty I couldn't care less if the video chewed itself up! My best friends' girlfriend a confirmed Carey fanatic confessed that even she thought this film was utterly dire and I can't repeat what she said about it for fear of inducing and multi-million pound libel case! Anyone who says this film is even vaguely watchable is either a blind Carey fanatic or just plain stupid. 0 out of 10, and believe me if I could give a minus rating I would."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes it's not enough to read about cinematic infamy, and you just have to see it for yourself. Take for example 'Ishtar,' 'North,' 2019's 'Cats' - or 2001's 'Glitter.' It's been well established that this came at a bad time in Mariah Carey's life, and she has rather distanced herself from it. The feature and the accompanying soundtrack album were also released at an unfortunate moment that all but ensured it would go unseen and unheard by just about anyone; did this ever really have a chance? Could it really be that bad? After all, the premise quite recalls any of a long, long list of other films about young protagonists trying to make it big in one region of show business or another; what happened here to earn such significant derision? Now that I've watched this for myself, I'm not sure I can rightly say. I think the picture struggles with various issues over the course of these 105 minutes, matters that distinctly hold it back. I'm also genuinely surprised, however, to find myself thinking that the reevaluation it's had in recent years is actually much closer to the full truth than the common description in the past 22 years as \"one of the worst movies ever made.\" It is not, after all, \"that bad.\"\n\nThe opening sequence is a little heavy-handed as it tugs on the heartstrings with exposition, but I can forgive this; mind you, I could forgive it more easily if that heavy-handedness weren't echoed later on. More concerning are early embellishments of unnecessary visual effects, and snappy editing, that quickly raise a skeptical eyebrow. The pacing of scenes and plot development is just ever so slightly too zesty (by, let's say, fifteen percent), coming across as peculiarly unnatural - rendering no few and possibly too many moments with a sense of inauthenticity, not least of all the first solidification of the romantic element at about the one-third mark. Sometimes it feels as though this is trying too hard to be extra \"hip\" and \"street,\" especially when it comes to select instances of costume design and Vondie Curtis Hall's direction; this is especially strange since, in the more mindful examples that grow more prominent as the length draws on, it all looks fantastic (and likewise for the lovely hair and makeup). This feeds into another, larger problem: the feature actually has plenty of substance, including not just the core premise but also themes of creative control, shady deals, management machinations, the business side of the music industry, mixing business and pleasure, and more. That substance is treated unevenly, ranging from right on target, to so-so, to insufficient, and this goes double for whenever 'Glitter' tries to be flashy and stylish (and excessively so). This is so unfortunate, because I see the beating heart that the project possesses. I just don't always feel it, and sometimes it has a hard time shining through.\n\nI know the acting was a source of considerable disdain upon release, but very honestly, I don't see anything wrong with the cast's contributions; above all, I'm rather inclined to think that Carey actually handles the lead role quite well, with commendable controlled range and poise. Her performance is hardly revelatory, but by no means do I think it's deserving of all the disparagement it's received, and I'd quite like to see more of what she's capable of as an actor. Some of the songs herein are better than others, or used more judiciously than others, but there are some classic songs on the soundtrack, and above all there's no disputing what an incredible voice Carey has. The production design and art direction are swell, and even if I don't agree with all the decisions made in terms of cinematography, direction, or especially editing, I think this is well made from a technical standpoint.\n\nI think what it comes down to is that 'Glitter' has difficulty finding focus, or striking the appropriate tone, as it shifts from one story beat or mood to another. I don't see any singular flaw so critical as to severely dampen the viewing experience; rather, there's a regrettable accumulation of imperfections over time, almost from the start and nearly to the end. It's not Wholly Wrong, but it's also never Quite Right. Among other things, I'm inclined to think that if Kate Lanier had left out one or two elements from the screenplay then the end result would have been tightened, and the drama and weight of the story would have subsequently landed with more success. With all this having been said, no one is more astonished than I am that I earnestly enjoy this. I think it's a good movie. It's a movie with definite faults, and I readily recognize where improvements could have been made, but I also recognize the sincerity and care with which it was crafted. There are other pictures in this same niche genre that are more noteworthy and admirable, but whether you're a big fan of Mariah Carey or someone else involved, or just an avid cinephile, I actually believe this is worth watching.\n\nSometimes popular opinion is exactly on point. 'From Justin to Kelly' is abominable; 'Showgirls' is tawdry and flummoxing; Baz Luhrmann's 'Moulin Rouge!' is spectacular. Sometimes popular opinion is wrong-headed - and I think 'Glitter' is an example of the latter. It's nothing for which one needs to go out of their way, and as a matter of personal preference I won't begrudge anyone who engages honestly and ends up more emphatically critical. But if one has the opportunity to watch this, and to give it a real chance, then I'm glad to say that as far as I'm concerned it is much better than most anyone has given it credit for in the past two decades. Watch with both mindful expectations and an open mind, but do watch."

However, we didn't bank on the fact that Glitter has no plot, completely anachronistic costuming, and a really terrible lead. The viewer can actually see when Mariah is thinking \"Okay, I have to act sad in this scene\" and so on. I was thoroughly disappointed that although it was supposedly set in the 80s, there was not one single mullet in the entire film - the \"love interest\" had a hair style that was more late 90s than anything - and Mariah is clothed in the most unflattering attire throughout the movie. They kept making her wear her hair in a side pony tail, which gave her a pained expression, and she had this weird silver streak of make up that moved from her left shoulder to her decolletage to her right arm, and even onto her lower back. What's with that? Maybe it's some pop culture reference that I completely missed, I don't know.\n\nBut all these flaws could be forgiven if there was a semblance of a plot. But there wasn't. Even though I'd been watching the clock after the first fifteen minutes, when the film actually ended, it was completely abrupt. I think that the producers (including Mariah herself) thought that if they assembled the cast and crew on the day, then the plot would look after itself.\n\nThe best thing about Glitter was that I rented it free from a friend who works at Blockbuster."

        "review_detailed_main": "Move over, Meryl Streep and Dame Judy Densch...the next wave of young thespian geniuses is storming the screen, and the path is being blazed by stunning Mariah Carey. Given nothing but a bare-boned outline of a plot to work with, Ms. Carey explodes across the screen with a depth and complexity of character unseen since Vivian Leigh's multi-faceted Scarlet O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" back in 1939. Every colour of the rainbow, and some even out of the range of the known colour scheme, are clearly and sharply delineated by Mariah in every frame of this masterpiece; every subtle shade and nuance of Billie Frank is drawn with precision sharpness and crystal clarity. It is said that the ultimate sign of true artistry in film is when one can look at any single frame of a motion picture and instantly know what is going on just from the facial expressions and body language of the actors within. \"Glitter\" certainly exemplifies this theory. At any given moment, one can look at Mariah's Billie Frank and instantly see every idiosyncrasy of the woman inside. The relationships she has with, and her feelings towards, every character she interacts with in the film is beautifully fleshed-out and drawn with a broad brush. Each and every word Mariah speaks in \"Glitter\" was meticulously delivered by her, and obviously carefully studied during perusal of the script.\n\nMariah delivers infinitely more than the one-dimensional Billie other reviews have led us to expect. Her transitions from despondency, to loneliness, to anger, to triumph...all brought forth with a crispness and clarity unknown to this age of the cinematic experience. And the ease with which she presents all these ranges of emotion draws you into the character of Billie, to the point where you hang breathlessly on Mariah's next word. She has such a natural talent, such an incredible comfort in front of the camera, that you instantly forget you are watching an actress playing Billie; you believe she really is Billie.\n\nThis can only be the smallest taste of what is to come from this future screen legend. Mariah has made her mark on the film industry, and now can, and must, move on to deeper, more complex roles...she must rightfully stake her claim as one of the greatest screen presences in cinema history. How marvelous it would be to see her take on some of the great female characters of literary classics, so in vogue today. A \"Jane Eyre\", for example, or Lizzy in \"Pride and Prejudice\". Many of Shakespeare's greatest works have remained uncommitted to celluloid; what greater compliment to the works of the master himself than to have them graced by Mariah Carey?\n\nPlease, do yourself a favour; you must see this movie, and see it with an open mind. Those who scoff are simply those who had already decided that Mariah would be a failure in the cross-over from music to film. They cannot admit they were wrong; for, unlike Barbra Streisand and Madonna before her, embarrassments both, Mariah Carey is a fabulous, fantastic, brilliant actress. Again, look at everything she was able to do with this meagre script!!!\n\nMariah Carey is the most stunningly beautiful, breathtaking, sexy, sensuous, heart-stopping woman ever to appear on the stage or screen. So many times during this movie, I realized that I was so captivated by her beauty that I wasn't even breathing; my heart was pounding so fiercely at the sight of her, I though it would burst.\n\nBelieve me, Mariah...keep acting...keep singing...you will always be remembered as a priceless legend."

None of it helps.\n\nNor is Mariah the only miscreant. The screenplay omits certain key data, such as showing us how she gets to be a star. Once she is a star, she still seems to exist in the same world -- there are no handlers, no bodyguards, and she freely walks the streets of Manhattan with no one asking her for an autograph. Vondie Curtis-Hall's direction is full of silly transitions, and leading man Max Beesley, sporting a fake-beard of a New York accent, has the appeal of a boll weevil. The only fun performance (in the right way) comes from Ann Magnusson, as a voracious talent manager. The role's a cliche, but at least she has energy.\n\nI had a good time giggling at this movie's multitude of ineptitudes, but I won't need to see it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, Don't ask me why but I just witnessed possibly the worst film of not only this year but at least the last decade. That movie is called \"Glitter\". By the looks of the poster, you could tell this movie was only aimed at 11 year old girls, which it succeeded in. I don't even think that die-hard Mariah fans can call this a good film or her a good actress, that is if they're not totally brainwashed. Mariah plays \"Billie\" (basically herself in this story which is supposed to be somewhat autobiographical and rips off \"A Star is Born\". Billie wants to be a singer, so next thing you know it she meets a DJ, sings at a club, and shes a superstar, if only getting into the business was that easy. The sad thing here is not only is is sad to watch Mariah try to \"act\", which she clearly without any question can't, but that she's supposed to be playing HERSELF. i guess that says not only what Mariah is as an actress, but as a human being."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I just had to see it, I don't know why, but you know how when you see a movie on the bottom 100, you're just so curious if the movie really is that bad? I remember back in 2001 how Mariah Carey was trying to so hard to be on top of the world, have a record and movie reach number 1 in one year, but everyone knew this was a typical movie where a pop star should just really stick to their day job. I don't know why Mariah thought this was a good idea, it's just so typical. Now granted, I do believe this was a bad movie, but as far as bottom 100 goes... I don't think it was that extremely bad, it's better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like In the Cut. Glitter is just poorly written and has bad actors in it, that's what makes it so unbearable to watch and makes Mariah look incredibly desperate for everyone's approval.\n\nBillie Frank was put into a foster home as a child when her mother lost the house to a fire, Billie grows up and becomes a back up singer in a group. But when a local DJ, Dice, hears Billie's voice, he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world. They engage in a romance together and everything seems to go well when she is finally exposed and then gets exploited. But of course it starts to get into the way of her and Dice's relationship and she begins to realize the pain and sacrifices she must make in order to make it big.\n\nGlitter is just a cheesy movie, it doesn't do any harm, that's the reason for the merciful rating I'm giving it. But I'm just really surprised by Terrence Howard who is an incredible actor and he did this crummy movie. But then again we have Al Pacino in Gigli, it's one of those scary stories of life where if the money is good, what the heck, let's get the big star in it. Mariah looked so uncomfortable on camera and did a horrible job of acting. I feel bad because I'm just complaining so much about this movie, but if you're looking for a cheesy movie, I'd recommend Glitter, but it's torture on the brain, it made mine hurt that's for sure when I thought of all the money that was wasted on this box office flop.\n\n2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I rented this film hoping that it would be as ridiculous, over-the-top, and unintentionally hilarious as Vanilla Ice's \"Cool as Ice,\" the standard that I hold all movie stinkers against.\n\nI came away disappointed. \"Glitter\" is certainly not a GOOD film, but it doesn't plumb the depths of awfulness to the extent I'd hoped for. I was hoping for a movie that would have my jaw dropping in utter disbelief and get me wondering, \"how much drugs did these people take to think this was actually a good idea?\" What I got instead was a banal, unremarkable movie with a trite, clich\u00e9d storyline that's been done a zillion times already: poor girl goes through bad childhood, but she's gifted with a beautiful voice that helps her become a big star. Yawn. It had the feel of an after-school special on TV, and as another reviewer already pointed out, it's probably not a coincidence that its director had only done TV shows prior to making this movie.\n\nThe one uniquely bad thing about the movie was the character of Dice. The actor who plays him, Max Beesley, is British, and at times his real accent would slip out underneath his inept attempt to talk like a Noo Yawker.\n\nI'm rating \"Glitter\" a 2 because I only reserve a \"1\" rating for sublimely horrible and unintentionally hilarious films like \"Cool as Ice,\" or utterly incoherent and ineptly done messes like \"Can't Stop the Music.\"\n\nTruly, sublimely bad films are worth your time and money for the perverse entertainment value, the same kind that you get from gawking at freaks on the Jerry Springer show. \"Glitter\" isn't in that category. It's simply tedious and trite, and for that reason it's a waste of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, let me start by confessing something I freely admit. I am 100% a fan of Mariah Carey....as a singer. It's almost like what the girls in the '60s probably had when they looked at the Beatles. Whenever she's on TV or I listen to her music,I just naturally feel good.\n\nHowever, when it comes to \"Glitter\", yes I, like most,was really let down. I wont even go into the plot since it's a moot point at this time. Not even 100 years will change or make this film any better. Even though I'm a fan, I'm not so one sided in thought that I'd just accept it.\n\nThis film was a mistake from the beginning. Although the soundtrack is good and it's 2 singles \"Never Too Far\" & \"Loverboy\" were great choices. Whe a movie fails, so goes it's soundtrack.\n\nI heard about this film going into production back in 1998.\n\nNow, when a film this simple, takes nearly 4 years to make, that's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about.\n\nTo clear up one muisconception by the way, the film's release date was Septemeber 21st, 2001...not 9/11. Althogh some feel that would have been fitting.\n\nMariah herself stated on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying \"no\" during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's. I'm sure this was just something she contractually said \"yes\" too and moved on.\n\nThen,as happens with all \"super-stars\" (I hate that term) the low came after 11 years of riding high. There wasn't anything wrong with her music, she'd just been working too hard, too long and that's what led to this embarrassing moment and the one in 2002 on Total Request Live aka TRL.\n\nShe has of course rebounded from all this,her song,\"We Belong Together\" spent 14 weeks at #1 in 2005 and given her 2 otrher hit singles. The CD \"Emancipation of Mimi\", sold millions. She now does what \"she\" wants at her own pace and certainly has the market cornered on Christmas,\n\nAs far as I'm concerned you at least deservea review that isn't filled with venom. Loved you in \"Tennessee\" and \"Precious\" though.\n\nBut ... Keep on singing. (END)"

Mariah's acting here isn't going to win her any awards but for someone who wasn't a professionally trained actress she didn't do bad. The movie also gets a bad rep since her career was mess at the time but it's aged better than Crossroads. The timing was just horrible when it came out. I would recommend this movie if you're looking for something to watch in the background or if there's nothing else on tv that interests you."

I've seen movies that were way worse that never got taken to task. I can't help but feel that Mariah's breakdown, the untimely release of Glitter near 9/11 and the bad luck of singers turned actresses all played a part in making Glitter one of the most derided movie of all time. I mean, in the bottom 250? No way is it that bad."

There were star vehicles before, depending for their drawing power mostly on the big name on the poster. But at least there was something else in them. Anything. \"Glitter\" is hollow on the inside, and on its surface it got nothing but Mariah Carey. Which is next to nothing considering the complete absence of acting skills this amazing singer presents here. Anything in this movie, from plot to script to setting to characters, is the product of one lame session of five-second brainstorming. Picking up every first line that came to their heads, the writers put together dialogue without any depth or meaning whatsoever, leaving some cardboard figures of characters behind even good actors couldn't have done anything with (not that there are any good actors in this one). Blaming \"Glitter\" for its formality is almost an insult to all decently unimaginative movies, whose makers just couldn't think of anything better. With \"Glitter\", no one even bothered to think."

Its a wah wah story with too many story lines: Billie wants to sing, Billie wants to find her mom, her boyfriend picks on her, she owes people money, her friends hate her success blah blah. Its set in the 80s despite not having anything to do with a period. Mariah overacts and underacts and basically looks like a moron on screen. The DP for some reason every once in awhile uses jump cuts which look ridiculous and arent done with true style. He also uses really awful eyeline matches.

This type vehicle is not for \"actors\" nor discovering \"acting ability\" - its more a stand, pose in an outfit, smile and lip sync your way through the horrible script. It's wrong. It's a crime. And it should be banned.\n\nAnd eventually Mariah Carey ended up not with Glitter in her eyes, but with tears. Thankfully for her she's managed to resurrect her career with that We Belong Together song but the scars are still there.\n\nOverall, \"Glitter\" is a pathetic piece of cinema and a very meaningful failure for Mariah Carey. Shallow, narcissistic, clich\u00e9, stupidly dramatic, badly acted, with average directing, \"Glitter\" is, in the purest meaning of the word, a WASTE of time.\n\nDon't watch this film."

Her face is attractive, her body is desirable, her smile is blinding and her voice is annoying, loud and reminds me of sonar, or dog whistles. She's made a name for herself, in music, making plenty of money and gaining popularity. That's fine. As long as she doesn't force the music down our throats(or rather, into our ears), I'm fine with that. Then she had to go and make a movie... now, I'm one who believes very much in tolerating everyone. We all have to be here, and we can't all do or like the same things. But when you make such a bad movie... I'm speechless. Seriously. Whoever thought up the idea for this Mariah Carey-vehicle should be issued a restraining order; stay at least five hundred yards away from movie-making at all times. The director(who's apparently only done forgettable projects in the past, as well) should be fined for putting such a thing on film. The editor, or whoever else was behind the fast \"stylish\" cuts... should be forced to take a film class(which, I suspect, would be the person's first ever). The plot is ridiculous and uninteresting(but, then again, this is based on Mariah Carey's life, so what should one expect?). The pacing is bad. The acting is really, really bad. Carey acts worse than she sings, and anyone who's heard her voice knows exactly what that means. The characters are poorly written and one-dimensional. The dialog is so bad that it's almost painful to listen to... it's almost as bad as Carey's singing. The film is just so poorly done in every thinkable, conceivable way. Only die-hard Mariah Carey fans should spend time and/or money on this mess. Oh, and in case you hadn't noticed or were wondering; yes, I hate Mariah Carey. So I may or may not be biased against this movie... but I hate Ja Rule and Leslie Nielsen as well, and they had semi-big parts in Scary Movie 3, and that I enjoyed immensely. This one just had nothing to offer at all. I recommend it exclusively to big fans of Mariah Carey. Everyone else should avoid this like the plague. 1/10"

The movie got bad critics even before its release, and that's just how it is but you have to give it to her: when she opens her mouth, chills up and down your spine because my God... What a voice!

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first rented this film, I was not expecting much. I should not have been expecting anything at all, because that is exactly what I got from this film: nothing (other than extreme confusion).I was well aware that the movie had been panned by every respectable critic on the planet and that it was a rent-at-your-own-risk endeavor. But I thought perhaps the magnitude of its stupidity had been exaggerated, and with the same impulse that leads many people to stop and watch a car crash, I rented this movie. What I found was perhaps the most annoying piece of fluff ever created by the media industry. This film has no solid plot or premise. The holes in the story are big enough to swallow the Grand Canyon. I found myself waiting for some kind of purpose to emerge as the movie progressed. I was monumentally disappointed. The movie is either so complex that I as a normal person cannot grasp the symbolism or so horribly shallow that only the feeblest of minds could see any point to this drivel disguised as a movie. I believe unfortunately it is the latter rather than the former. There are many aspects that make this film weak. Let us be honest. To say Mariah Carey is not the greatest actor in the world would be the understatement of the century, but this film's lack of substance does not solely rest on her slender shoulders. A cast of B-list actors who could not act their way through a wet paper bag also add to this failure. In addition are bad writing and plot. There was not one piece of original, inventive material in the whole movie. The whole film seems to revolve around Mariah Carey's appearance. Every other second she is gyrating around in some skimpy ensemble. The success of the film was largely tied to Mariah Carey's cleavage. This approach might have worked if it were a concert special or if the character weren't so two-dimensional and aggravating. The movie is reminiscent of Elvis films of the 50's and 60's in which the music is based around the charisma of a popular performer, but honestly Mariah Carey is no Elvis. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad everything. Don't waste a hour and a half of your life on this movie. WARNING! Rent at your own risk! You have been warned. .0000000000000001 of 10 (because you can't vote a zero)"

Mariah Carry didn't have much to do with the failure of this movie, it was dead and buried long before she signed on. There were enormous leaps of inconsistency and a storyline about as interesting econ professor recounting his decision to enter the field. Which is appropriate because it seemed the only purpose to this movie was the use of Carry's name to make a buck. It was a painting by numbers style of movie-making, they may as well have substituted Lance Armstrong and switch the mushy 90's R&B with bicycle racing, or better yet, some child actor like Elizabeth Berkley playing a character motivated by dreams of stripping in Las Vegas - wait, didn't they do that already?"

The producers of course knew Carey knew nothing about acting; her previous experience was limited to running up and down guys' legs in her videos. So naturally, they replaced any remnant of a script with her drawn out, ear-piercing \"music.\" Neil Diamond did a better job in \"The Jazz Singer,\" though he was stuck in the same scenario--a pop star praised for his music, crammed in a movie by greedy execs, only leaving an unforgettable ugly stain on his career. Fortunately for Mr.Diamond, his failed movie didn't result in a mental breakdown. \"Glitter\" is only for Carey's teen fans who will automatically praise the film and blame everyone as being \"jealous.\" Well, personally, I sure wouldn't be jealous of being in a disaster like this."

Michael Jackson in 'Miss Cast Away' or Elvis Prestley in all of his (how many?) films.\n\nBritney Spears did okay in 'Crossroads' and Mariah Carey does a decent job as the hard working girl trying to reach the stars.\n\nI've seen worse movies than 'Glitter', maybe because of all the bad reviews I've read. Though I would not recommend people to watch it, I would not tell them to avoid it either \u0096 But you have to be a Mariah fan to enjoy it."

The plot, in and of itself, isn't terrible and could've been more credible, but when you hand over the project with someone like Carey, it doesn't work because we think the story is like her life, but it isn't. I didn't like the movie, it had scenes that were present, but they sometimes don't go anywhere. Not much insight, not much to consider good moviemaking, and basically an excuse for Carey to strut her body (not a bad excuse, to be sure, but it's destracting as well). Plus the songs DO sound the same a lot of the time, as it is pointed out at one point in the movie by a character. D-"

Of course, the fact that I had quite a few drinks before I watched this stinker made the ride more bearable.\n\nFirst, I'd like to say sorry to all those Mariah Carey fans out there. At least she'll have her recording career to fall back (maybe). Second, I have nothing personal against Mariah. I'm sure she's a great person once you get to know her, but Glitter has got to be the most f**king ridiculous movie I've ever seen.\n\nCome on!!! Who at 20th Century Fox green-lighted this turd? This flick sets new standards for film incompetence. The acting (what little of it there is) falls to capture any genuine emotion, and the script offers us nothing in the way of believable characters or dialogue (not to mention the occasional plot absurdity - you'll know them when you see them) Director Vondie Curtis-Hall tries to give the movie some glossy production value, perhaps to take your mind off the fact that Mariah can't act, but he fails, allowing editor Jeff Freeman to go insane in his use of aerial shots of NY (including a shot of the WTC towers, which will probably be the only thing in this flick that will generate any honest reaction from the audience) and some bizarre editing in certain scenes that I suppose was done to give the movie some \"style\". Oops! That didn't work!\n\nWhat else is there to say about this flick? I knew walking in that this was going to be a bad movie. That's why I got a couple of drinks before the movie to enhance my \"Mariah experience\", but this movie pulled the rug out from under me. It was actually worse than I thought it would be. I actually started feeling sorry for Mariah that she was in this! She's a talented singer, but for God's sake, can somebody please talk some sense into her when, and if, she decides to do another film!\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Get some friends together, get sloshed, and catch this little \"gem\" while you still can. I'm guessing it won't be around for long!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's incredibly hard to view 'Glitter' objectively given the facts that it was a huge Box Office bomb and that also the leading lady who was supposed to prove she was not only a singer but a an actor too, despite being mentally ill at it's release. Now I'm not saying that this review is completely un-biased, after all, I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey, but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago (it being not released to cinema) due to pure curiosity.\n\nThe multi-octave song-bird's film vehicle (originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think) opens with in the early 1960's, in an all-black bar with a woman (Valarie Pettiford) singing a jazz/blues number before introducing her young daughter, Billie Frank (Isobel Gomes), to the semi-interested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd. Cut to the next few shots where Billie's mother tries to get money from Billie's father, before giving her up to an adoption agency.\n\nFast-foward to the bright and bouncy 1980's where all-grown-up Billie (the aforementioned Carey) is dancing in a club with her two best friends Louise and Roxy (Da Brat and Tia Texada), who are soon offered as back-up singing gig for no-talent, good-looking up-and-comer Sylk. Needing the money, the 3 take the job, and the producer finds Mariah's... er... Billie's voice completely spellbinding - and chooses to use her voice instead of the God-awful voice that the main singer is belting out.\n\nA recording of a song entitled \"All My Life\" is handed to a Club DJ - DJ Dice to be exact (British actor Max Beesley who puts on a 'wigga' accent - sometimes really good, other times really bad) who plays it and instantly falls in love with the vocals. Upon discovering that the vocal used is in fact Billie's he instantly wants to be her producer (of course her beautiful looks have nothing to do with it!). So, makes a deal with her old producer Timothy (Terrence Howard) to take the gorgeous Billie and her back-up singing, loud-mouthed friends and take them under his wing - for the reasonable (!) price of ONLY $100,000! So the Dice & Billie end up becoming good friends and record a song, \"I Didn't Mean To Turn You On\", and it is played for music executives, and before you can change the butt groove in your seat, Billie is signed to a major record label.\n\nOf course, the road to musical superstardom is not an easy one and Billie has several troubles - the video director for her first single \"Loverboy\" wants her to parade around in nothing but a piece of string (Billie minds, Mariah wouldn't) and there's also the little problem of her undeniable attraction to Dice. The two become an item and she even moves into Dice's modern, typically New York apartment. Billie's first single unsurprisingly tops the U.S. chart - for ten weeks, at which point the record company are eager to release her first album which they want full control over - p***ing off both Billie and Dice.\n\nOur star-crossed 80's lovers start fighting as her career begins to blossom. She's invited to all the right parties and invited to guest on all the right talk shows - a dream she's had for many years, but amist all of the amazing goings-on, her two best friends are seeing less and less of her and Dice is becoming a drag - she even has to bail him out of jail before an appearance on a show. The two have a massive fight, leading Billie to move out (and Girl Power-ly slap his face). Her attempts at tracking down her addicted biological mother fail as the adoption agency have lost contact with her. Also during this time, she records a single with pop singer Rafael (Halle Berry's musician hubby Eric Ben\u00e9t). The duet, titled \"Want You\" is another number one for Billie, and her biggest dream is about to come true - she's about to play at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe day of the concert arrives and Billie returns to Dice's apartment to find him not there. Unfortunately Billie's day won't exactly go as planned - it seems, achieving your dreams sometimes means that you'll lose the ones you love. And with that, I won't go into the final minutes' in detail, but I'll just say that is very emotional.\n\nSo that's the story, but were the performances any good? Well yes and no. Mariah Carey (although despite what you've no doubt heard) is a promising actress. Her acting isn't brilliant (yet) - there are times when you feel she goes overboard (especially in the emotional bits). I've found that her most convincing scenes (and therefore best ones) are where she gets angry. Her stereotypical best friends are good too and add a needed comical element. Beesley as DJ Dice is good, although he sometimes seems very fake. Anyone else worth noticing is probably OK.\n\nThe soundtrack is brilliant. Carey's 9th studio album is a pop/r&b LP with great recordings. From the pumping 80's tracks (Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, All My Life) to the gorgeous Mariah-like ballads (Lead The Way, Reflections and especially Never Too Far) plus the Eric duet 'Want You' and the Ja Rule infected 'If We' - it's just as good as her previous efforts.\n\nOverall, 'Glitter' IS a film that the troubled songbird should be proud of. It is a drama, though - and watch that, don't think it'll be laugh-a-minute. It's emotional, passionate and with Carey in the lead - it's one rollercoaster ride you'll like at the time and will leave you wanting more. Recommended definetely... Go Mariah!"

Sure it won't win any Oscar or anything. This isn't an instant movie classic, but then it surely ain't as bad as the majority of critics want you to believe either.\n\nOne thing that probably should be mentioned is that Glitter is not a film to watch if you want something so bad you can laugh at it. It just isn't that bad. Instead one should relax and enjoy the film for what it is. A feel-good romantic drama from the 80's music world. Mariah Carey as an actress is believable too. But then she's almost playing herself so why shouldn't she be:-) a 7 out of 10!"

Even the sex scene looks like something out of a soap opera.\n\nAs to the direction, the less said, the better. I've seen home movies where more care and thought was given to the composition. When artsiness intrudes, it is annoying and distracting (such as in the transitions. Not standard dissolves or fades, but intrusive helicopter shots of Manhattan. Other annoying tricks of cinematography: a few bits of slow motion for key moments; the digital distortion of the background in one shot).\n\nFinally, a bit about the music. Other than the closing credits, I don't think there was one full-length song by Ms Carey. Plenty of snippets, of course, but no actual songs. In other words, you can't even call this a musical."

It isn't his fault he was co-starring with Mariah Carey, who seemed to possess all the charisma of a doorknob. She wasn't as bad as I expected, but it was still rather painful.\n\nHopefully she won't make anymore movies. Hopefully Max will begin to get the recognition he deserves."

Everything else is crap. Director Vondie Curtis Hall should get back to acting. He can't even make the club scenes go smooth. Face it, you would probably be better off buying a poster of Ms. Carey (heck, you can probably get that and one of her CDs used for less than the $10 you'd have to plunk down in Manhattan to see this debacle).

I first viewed \"Glitter\" a few months after it hit the theatre and I must say that it truly lured me in. Mariah played the character Billy Frank who not only wanted to make it big in the music industry, but who also was looking for someone to lean on. She never gave up hope that she would see her mother again, whom she was separated from as a child and she didn't give up hope in her music. If you enjoy inspiration, then you'll love \"Glitter\""

And regardless of what the so-called critics (Hey, I wonder how anyone even becomes a critic???) said about it, I believe Mariah Carey did very good in Glitter. Her acting came across very believable, I mean when you think about it here we have a singer acting in a movie about not just a singer, but one in the time line in which she lived....duhhh???,at least she stuck to what she knew unlike some actors I know. Now maybe parts of the script weren't that great, but then many movies with good actors are not going to be billed that good, and the first ones people want to blame is the actors, because they are the ones who have to carry the vehicle. Anyway I never passed judgement on the movie before I saw it. Great minds don't think alike, truly great minds think for themselves! I never usually pay any attention to critics.....or anybody else for that matter. (Not to say critics are great minds...lol, Not in the least.) And I have to also say DaBrat was also very good in Glitter. She didn't seem phony just natural, I mean not a singer trying to act like a singer, just being herself. I base what I think on how I feel about it personally, not what someone has told me to think. And Max Beesley was great, very sexy, and had me fooled I thought he was from the U.S. and was shocked to find out he was a Brit! None the less I think he is also an up and coming talent here :-) Glitter is a 10 in my book, and hey if you don't like it, to each his own."

Even if you thought a film was poorly made, disturbing, graphic, horrible, or whatever, then at least the film made you care. \"Glitter\" pours out boredom in lethal doses. Director Vondie Curtis-Hall and cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson pull out a few visual tricks to add some punch to the lackluster affair, but the effort is not enough. The script can easily be seen as a reflection of Mariah Carey and her life. Carey, though, has no range (as an actress) at all. The scenes of romance with co-star Max Beesley fall totally flat. Plus, her moments of anger play like an actress trying to be mad, rather than a person who's actually angry. Carey, if she wanted to act, probably should have either taken a tiny role around veteran actors in another film. She's just not a great actress. The one bright spot though is her voice, which gets some use in a few songs, none of which are all that memorable. Acting problems aside, the film is one painfully boring movie. A 2 out of 10."

Even some of the best acting skills could not salvage this film. Terrence Howard is an amazing actor (The Best Man, Dead Presidents, et al.), but he seemed to be wasted on a one dimensional thug role.\n\nI think somewhere along the way, Glitter got caught up in its own superstar flashiness. The story was never fully supported from the begining. Billy's black momma gives her up after their home burns down and she loses her job. Oh yeah, and her white father wants nothing to do with either of them. I think that was an interesting storyline that could have been developed further to make Billy a deeper character. I kept asking myself the question what role did her biracial roots, her single-parent home and her socially paranoid father play in making her who she became? Was it just a weak explaination of why Billy wanted her mother's approval or why a very fair pop star can blow like the queens of Soul. I wanted to see some turmoil from Miss Billy Frank, some reserve being romantically involved with a white man after the trauma of being abandoned by her white father (fathers play a huge role in who a woman chooses in a mate), perhaps some lack of acceptance from other black children, etc. I didn't even understand exactly what role her upbringing played upon her desire to become a star. Did she want money? Did she want fame? Did she want her mother's acceptance? It didn't even seem like she thought of her mother except for a few hokey instances and I just could not feel the truth in them. Her romance with Dice seemed equally lukewarm. I did not feel any chemistry between them. In fact for most of the movie (that I could watch without gasping in fits of frustration)I wanted Billy to be a stronger, more proactive character rather than simply being an object to all characters including herself.\n\nI could go on and on, but I digress. I would like to think that Vondie Curtis Hall did the best with what he was given: a weak script. I think that Glitter may have been an interesting concept (without biting off Mahogany). It succeeded in only scratching the surface of the industry and the rise of a pop star. In a sense, Glitter fell prey to the superficiality that the industry is itself notorious for. Ironic? Maybe."

The mere fact that Tom Cruise was going to star in this and Wolfgang Peterson was going to direct tickles me with sadness. It would've been a beautiful picture. Mariah Carey is a breath of fresh air and exudes emotional talent as well as a natural ability to capture our attention. She is a true actress and should be cast in a martin scorsese picture with leonardo dicaprio. I love her so much, I even bought all of her cds twice. The scope of this film reminds me of Casablanca and Vertigo. Hitchcock would've been impressed with the texture and subtext of this picture. This film reminds me of Jean-Claude Van Damme's \"Nowhere to Run\" with its talent and beautiful direction."

Billie's story was multi-layered, the story about her missing mother and the love story meshed together well, and I was surprised by the ending. It wasn't a cliche'd ending and was very well-acted. Beyond that, the musical performances were outstanding. It was like watching a movie length Mariah Carey video with a wonderfully touching story in between the songs."

I figured I'd get at least an hour and a half of laughs at Mariah Carey's expense if nothing else. After actually viewing it, I found it wasn't as funny as I had expected. I have definitely, DEFINITELY seen many worse films than Glitter, but this is surely not a \"good\" movie. Probably the worse thing about it, from an adult point of view,is that it was rather trite. The \"trials and tribulations\" of Billie Frank just ain't much to write (or sing) home about. I suppose it is human nature to want to see suffering and pain, but whatever. There isn't much of it in this movie, and what little there was is portrayed in a very benign and mundane way. Apart from that, the dialog is lame (\"Wow, that is so fresh!\"), the characters are fairly one-dimensional, and the film does a poor job of recreating 1983. I'm not sure why I felt the need to review this movie, but I guess in a way I feel sorry for Mariah Carey. It isn't the worst movie in the world, and it looks like she did the best she could. I don't recommend it, though, unless you are a pre-teen girl or a big fan of Carey's. Yes, Mariah can sing, but if you want to hear that you might as well buy one of her albums. If you want to see a good movie about the life of a singer, try The Rose instead. :)"

That was Cher when she did Moonstruck.\n\nI believe that actors should stick to acting, and singers should stick to singing, and they should not crossover, unless their intention is to act by singing in a musical or opera.\n\nBottom line is, Mariah Carey re-enforces my theory that the two worlds should stay separate.

That's true for a lot of movies. Sure, this is no Hard Day's Night. But it's got one of the best singers of all time singing some nice material. That ALONE makes Glitter worth watching. If you don't understand that, what the hell do you understand about movies? Three quarters of making a good movie is just putting a great performer in front of the camera. If you do that, you already have a watchable film, and Glitter has that, for sure. Mariah Carey's acting is amateurish, but it is genuine and emotional, and that's enough to hold the film's center. Carey's costars are all good, putting in performances that go well beyond perfunctory. They take poor material, in terms of writing, and they breath life into it. In particular, Max Beesley is a fine actor, sortof the poor man's Ewan McGregor, and there is a good chemistry between him and Carey. The themes of this movie are serious and the performers, if not the writers and producers, are serious about them; trying to find yourself and yet not lose yourself in the artistic struggle.\n\nGlitter's sin is that it could have been a much better movie. The production values are cheap and not in a good way. Writing and direction deflect Glitter's focus at key points in the development of characters and of the story. Carey herself has put her finger on the problem: it was apparently decided to shoot for a younger audience, as in a 12 year old audience, and the result was half-baked. It's a shame and a disappointment, but Glitter is still a movie with considerable promise that delivers enough to be worth watching, worth having. The amount of hate this movie gets is just grotesque. I'm sorry, but there are lots and lots of worse movies."

This is a career ending movie.\n\nFor instance, the scene where 'Dice' and the Bad Guy Music Producer get up to go talk about freeing Billie (Mariah) from her contract - Obviously, they had too far to walk to get to a quiet place in the same shot, it took too much time, so they just picked a couple of places during that walk to edit out 3 or 4 steps. Jump jump jump. Nowhere else in the movie is the action stylized in such a way. I laughed out loud! What a poorly planned shot and what an incredibly inept way to cover it up! Pathetically amateurish.\n\nFor an extra treat, you should watch the DVD with the Director's Commentary on.

They figured that if they put Carey in the film, no matter how bad it was, that fans would go to see it.

Stop assuming and accusing! So many people carry that thought with them, and were automatically disgusted (before they even watched the film) with the so-called 'woah is me' concept they THOUGHT Mariah was trying to present.\n\nMs. Carey definitely has potential to become a greater actress - in the no time she would be much better than most of the actresses in TV series. Don't incorporate your own bias against her, just because she's Mariah. Everyone, once upon a time, had a soft spot for Mariah. I don't know how people can just push their spots aside so quickly since the bad press. C'mon, the lady can only take so much - she's only human. She showed that she was strong.

If you're a true fan of Carey, I truly would recommend this movie - even if it doesn't meet up all expectations.\n\nThe only problem with this movie and the reason as to why it failed was releasing it after the 9/11 attacks happened (the Twin Towers make an appearance in this movie); they should've stuck with the original release date and the movie could've been a hit.\n\nAll-in-all, not bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, I would have absolutely no interest in ever, ever, ever, ever watching this movie. When I saw a photo of Carey teeing off while wearing hot pants and porn-star high heels, I thought, 'This is a girl with not a lepton of virtue or admirability.' Well, okay, she can hit impressively high notes, but that's the only thing. So, when I started a Rifftrax membership and saw that this movie was among those riffed, I thought, 'Well, maybe.' I could only watch the first 20 minutes when I suddenly remembered that the drain in the garage needed mucking and decided that would be more fun and rewarding than watching this piece of schlock.\n\nI'm going to jump genres and compare this movie with 'Rock Star', a film similar in its rags-to-riches theme. At least 'Rock Star' had a comedic slant to it and didn't try to pass itself off as high drama. Those involved in making this film took it so seriously that it becomes a mockery in an attempt at gravity. They go to pains to show that Carey had a drunk mom, when to an orphanage but never expanded on those formative events or years. It may have been interesting to have seen the character pass through her formative years and how she became the person she is, how her values and beliefs were established, how the foundation for her adult life was laid. Nah! That's not important in a pseudo-biographical film. Let's jump right to the bootie-shaking. The songs even draw from a well of sophomoric offerings that Carey has penned.\n\nThis is a long way to a short point. This movie just sucked."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so this title was truly panned in 2001. A number of (valid) reasons: (i) woefully underdeveloped characters (not least Mariah's Billie Frank); (ii) Max Beesley (the accent was bleak); (iii) strange glitter bursts at the end of scenes.\n\nHowever watching it back, in light of A Star is Born and now that the 80's (when this film is set) are sufficiently behind us, I can't help but feel it was rather harshly judged.\n\nNot to suggest it's good. It's not. At all. But the film does have some redeeming qualities. In particular the soundtrack has, I find, aged rather well. Mariah Carey is, if not a natural actress, a powerhouse vocalist. The scenes where she just bursts into song (I'm thinking in particular of the backstage scene where her character first meets Max Beesley) remind you that there was a reason this film got funding in the first place.\n\nMy overall feeling, though, is that all involved, not least Mariah, had hoped for a different movie altogether. A more adult movie, with adult themes. But when your fanbase in the 90's included a large number of young girls, that wasn't the movie the studio wanted to make. The result means the movie falls between two stools. One the one hand you're meant to believe in an underground/mob story line, and in the emotionally damaged orphan on her rise to stardom (from the dark clubs of NYC). But everything is portrayed in a pink and fluffy way, with no curse words or actual violence. They really took that 'Glitter' title a bit too seriously.\n\nThere is some talent in the movie though, Padma Lakshmi and Terrance Howard. And even Mariah went on to be excellent in Precious. If Lee Daniels had been in charge of this project - like he was for Precious - it might even have turned out okay!"

Wandering through the film with one expression (eyes wide, mouth slightly agape -- one recalls Kathy Ireland's \"dull surprise\" during the MST3K screening of \"Alien from L.A.\"), Carey has zero screen presence. At times, she looks like a Muppet version of Kathie Lee Gifford, and her performance never indicates that her character is anything more than a straw being carried by the winds of the contrived plot.\n\nThe one bright spot in this tacky mess: Ann Magnuson as a hyped-up record label P.R. person. The movie is ostensibly set in 1983 New York nightclub circles (although there's not a single grain of cocaine in the movie), but the only person who looks like they're in the right decade is Magnuson, whose hair, clunky jewelry, and shoulder pads are absolutely right-on. (As a survivor of that era, she probably dug that stuff out of her own closet.) She's also very funny and a real live wire, and easily walks away with the movie while everyone else is sleepwalking.\n\nCarey's high-pitched musical career will no doubt continue apace (after all, the dreadful \"Sincerely Yours\" didn't sink Liberace's stellar career), but I can only hope that she one day develops a sense of humor about this movie, since camp aficionados will no doubt be hosting midnight screenings of this doozy until the apocalypse. Just look for the drag queens with the inexplicable stripe of silver makeup on their biceps. (See the movie, and you'll know what I mean.)"

She not only uses it well in this film, but has a supporting cast of performers that are musically impressive as well. She gives us lots of eye candy and the story is entertaining enough. The film is well made technically. Her acting skills are not of the same fine tuned precision that her voice is, but she gave it a good go. Heck I can name some academy award winners that were no better. The ending wasn't as powerful as I thought it could have been, but that is really all I can say disappointed me. I was thoroughly entertained. And if you appreciate Mariah's music and her lovely body, then I think you will enjoy how it's packaged in this film. For Pete's sake I was surprised that Nicole Kidman could sing, but she wasn't that great. Her character was cold and hard to love. Mariah projected a sense of a genuine, caring girl that you could feel for. Why is Nicole getting so much praise and Mariah so much flack? Give me a break. Mariah - hang in there, you are incredible.

        "review_detailed_main": "great movie , i enjoyed it a lot. i was interested in the story how an artist becomes a superstar , and this movies shows it all . it is the perfect example as well , Mariah Carey and her life story. this is how it was in the days,\n\nand this movie shows it exactly how the life was in that time.\n\nit shows how the people were and how they lived.\n\nif the people or the artist seems fake in the movie , it probably has been done like that for a reason, people were fake in that time in that kind of club scene , and they actually still are.\n\nanybody that came up with a negative review here ,probably totally missed the point of this movie. it is not about how great the actors are and how great the cinematography is - actually at that point i thought that was great as well-but it is all about the story . it shows you where an unknown artist got recognized for talent and makes it up all the way to the top. very interesting to see , specially because we all know Mariah Carey. i understand people don't like her guts and quality , but let's be honest , she is an amazing artist like nobody else , she is famous and has millions of fans for a reason . she is beautiful and talented.\n\nthis movie is not so much about Mariah herself , but more about the story in general of an artist who had the chance to climb up in the jungle that is called music business.\n\nif you are interested in such a story , than you will see a jewel of a movie here. but if you are more interested in Oscar winning material with amazing plot and special effects and amazing written stories , OK this is not the movie for you , and you probably will write a review this is the worst movie you ever saw, just like anybody else here. that is so unfair , glitter is a great movie for what it wants to show, very well done . and best of all : very realistic.\n\ni saw Oscar winning movies , and i thought they were complete boring . so it is all a matter of taste\n\nglitter is a great movie in my opinion, i would recommend it to anyone because it shows the real life of how musicians live and their dreams to become recognized and how they reach the top with ups and downs.\n\ni think the movie was not accepted so well , because Mariah played herself , and people were expecting world wonders . but they got just plain reality to see . a true story. if somebody else would have played the main actress roll , it would have been maybe better for the movie .\n\nMariah has such a strong personality , it overwhelms the whole picture, it was no problem for me . i was looking for the story anyway. but my point is , if another actress would have done this job , the movie could have been accepted much better and maybe get an Oscar. not that there is something wrong with Mariah as an actress, but the fact that she is playing actually herself might look a bit self crowning. maybe that is the reason why so much people disliked this movie .\n\nyou are a great singer , and you play yourself in a movie to show how great you are. that was plus and plus and too much plus for yourself , and will end up in negative.\n\nif you are so cool and so great it just looks better if someone else will do that acting roll , instead of when you will do it yourself.\n\nthat didn't matter for me , i loved the story . i will watch it again and enjoy sometime soon. if you love the 80s and the life around that time , this movie is a MUST SEE."

It surely wasn't Mariah, since she knows quality. Was it her then new record company, maybe? I love Mariah and I feel that she was blinded by the opportunity to star in her own movie, but nobody else really cared about making a good movie. They just had to make one and they did.\n\nThis said, the movie is best described as a standard tv movie. You won't hate it, but you won't remember it either. It's just plain drama with some bits of lovely Mariahs singing thrown in."

        "review_detailed_main": "So this is certainly no Oscar worthy film, or even a great film. It's decent. Though I've been a long-time IMDb user, I was prompted to write this as my first review because I felt like the score is unfair. Glitter certainly doesn't deserve a 2.2 rating as I've seen worse; some of it's \"connection\" films, for example. Truthfully, I'd give it a 5 or 6 out of 10-- my 8 stars above is only in hopes that it will raise the current rating. Mariah Carey gives a consistent performance, especially considering her personal struggles at the time. I'm no super fan either but just thought I'd contribute some positivity here and respectfully disagree with the numerous disparaging comments. If anything, I would blame the writing rather than the acting, but again, I can think of other films that are much more overtly awkward due to a poor script. I typically don't list credentials but for context, I have a PhD (and all former degrees) in Theatre so I can be pretty critical and think myself capable of identifying a horrible movie and this isn't it, in my opinion. It's on par with many other romance movies and dramas about singing careers. If you have realistic expectations, it's a okay film."

The movie was great but most people don't know that because it was not given much publicity.I didn't even see a commercial on the television for it until the day that it went into theatres. Mariah performed much better than I had expected that she would and she has definately given her fans a memento that they will treasure for years to come. Truthfully, there are many good one liners in the movie and the drama that you will go through watching it is also great. It's comedy, romance, and it will have you rolling on the floor laughing or balling. If I had to pick a movie that it makes me think of, I would have to say Beaches, starring Bette Midler. The critics that reviewed this movie must have thought that Mariah was going to come out of this movie like Whitney Houston did in the Bodyguard. However I guess that you can't do it all at the same time. The movie was 100% GOLD, but it wasn't given enough time to GLITTER."

I think everyone doesn't realize the plot of the story and that it was taking place in the 80's. The tracks that were used for the movie were incredible. Some of those original songs you cannot find now and days. As far as the story line is concerned the opening was great!(honestly) and the middle was at times a little sidetracked from the reality of what the music industry is really like, but the ending was a success! It gave true meaning and a good positive message. Mariah Carey can obviousley sing and as far as her acting is concerned. Im sure she will grow and become just as good. The film was good and so is the soundtrack. Check it out for yourself."

Boy, those opinions about who can act and who can't act, huh? :-( Well, I think different about those movies! Usually the only way you get to know stars are through a radio, a CD player, or an MP3 player. You hardly get to see them! You can see them on an album cover, at a concert, etc. But why do people don't like seeing stars on the silver screen? That answer remains a mystery. I think different with \"Glitter.\" It has all things you can ask for in a biographical movie of a pop star. Enjoy the ride."

I thought critics knew how to think--maturely that is...and evidently that is not true! Hollywood has a lot to learn...A LOT to learn.

        "review_detailed_main": "I listened to the critics about this movie and passed it by a number of times. I finally watched it on HBO and was very surprised. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD. The story is about a girl who separates from her mother at a young age and struggles to hang on to her self-esteem and dreams of redeveloping the relationship she lost with her mother. In the process of surviving, she finds stardom. This movie is not based on a dream of stardom but a dream of finding love and maintaining relationships. I felt Mariah Carey did a great job for a novice actor. I think the critics were caught up in her real life problems (which is sad for them) and trashed the movie on those bases. There is some superb acting by Terrence Howard, Da Brat, and Tia Texada. The musical score is excellent and Mariah's voice is superb. This was a movie about young people, their hopes, dreams and their never ending search to find themselves and where they fit into society. Stop looking at this movie as a dramatic episode. That is not what it is. I found it entertaining and realistic for it's intended purpose. I plan to add this movie to my collection. I have already brought the musical score. If you like movies such as: Sparkle, The Body Guard, The Temptations, and the Five Heartbeats you will enjoy this movie. It's worth seeing."

The acting isn't stellar, nor is the plot (which, by the way, is VERY loosely based on Mariah's life, not nearly as autobiographical as the public would like to believe), but the music is quite interesting and the whole vibe of the movie is positive and energetic. Da Brat also turns in a nice performance as one of Mariah's back-up singers/dancers. I'd recommend \"Glitter\" to anyone, particularly those interested in the music industry and in Mariah. Hopefully, it will someday achieve the cult classic status that it deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a proud Mariah Carey FAN, I LOVE he soooo MUCH. So out of curiosity I decided the watch this movie since the general things i heard about is what people were saying about the movie such as: \"IT IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE\" \"SHE IS A TERRIBLE ACTRESS\" \"THIS MOVIE ALMOST KILLED HER\", and I was like \"oh is it really the bad\"...The answer is NO.\n\nIn this movie Mariah plays Billie Frank. She is an orphan who grew without a mother and the became a dancer at a club...\"OK cool\".\n\nMariah's act isn't terrible but it's not terrific. The many scenes that to her credit are A+ acting but there are many that need improvement.\n\nIf you don't know why this movie is like this let me tell you.\n\nMariah was leaving her ex-husband Tommy Mattola who was the executive of Sony at the time, he was really made at her. Her still being signed to Sony Mattola decided to mess with her entire career including the movie. Scripts were being changed everyday, the story line was being repeatedly, and the movie went from what was supposed to be a PG 16-18+ movie went to a PG-13 because of Mattola.\n\nThis stress caused Mariah to have a mental breakdown due to how much work and sleepless nights she was enduring but that is all gone into further detail in her book \"The Meaning Of Mariah Carey\" which is an excellent read if you want to know more about this period in her life and other aspect of her life.\n\nSo basically the movie was messed with too much and ended up looking sloppy. This movie is not as bad as people make it out to be. People over-exaggerated the whole thing because they were jealous. Mariah is Beautiful when she is skinny and she is beautiful when she is fat, she can sing, she is smart, and she is funny. People were just preying on her downfall because SHE IS JUST PERFECT.\n\nIn conclusion: The movie is not terrible nor is it the best thing since bread...It is just an average movie that is very watchable and it can be enjoyed. There is a lot more that could have been done with this movie but hey, what can we do.\n\nI tried to factor in all aspects of the movie in and give an honest review and not just one-sided reviews like everyone else.\n\nI hope this helped Thank you :)"

No offense to Julia Roberts because I really like her, but she better move over & make room for Mariah!\n\nI hope we all see more of Mariah on the big screen in the future. I can't even say enough about how much I loved this movie! I would go again & again & again to see it. I can't wait for video. Mariah is so beautiful. Every angle the camera got Mariah at turned out perfect. She truly radiated a glittery glow. I think Mariah is the camera's best friend. She is truly the most photogenic person I've ever seen. Forgive me you guys, I am just Mariah's biggest fan. I think she is as close to perfect as anyone could be. I think Miss Mariah Carey is one of the most underrated artists out there & she deserves some recognition.\n\nI would also like to say that the other actors in this film were great as well. Max Beesley for instance. Great acting & great looking, this guy really had my eye. Where has he been all of our lives? Also Da Brat & Tia Texada did a wonderful job as well. Did I mention I can't wait for the video? Ok, all silliness aside. This movie was full of heart. It makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you laugh, makes you cry. It is full of inspiration & life lessons.Wakes you up a bit. Don't ask me how but they throw in a love story as well. I am amazed that they could give equally to each aspect of the film, but they did. Please see this film & get the soundtrack. You will truly be impressed by both. I love you Mariah!!!!!!\n\n\"Glitter\" GLITTERS & SPARKLES!!!!!!\n\nPEACE! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!"

The first time that I saw it I was expecting to see 1.5 hours of trash...I was WRONG.\n\nFrom start to finish I couldn't stop crying because it was such a touching story. Mariah Carey played that girl with so much sympathy that anyone who couldn't feel for her must not have too much heart or compassion. I thought that it was a good acting debut for Mariah and I watch Glitter whenever it's on HBO. It's a very heartfelt story.\n\nBesides Mariah's amazing voice the thing that drew me to this movie was the fact that it seemed to be an autobiography. I was a puddle of mush at the end when she reunited with her mother. The only big flaw in the movie was how she was able to go on after learning that her lovah was killed."

Like when her and dice get in a fight that reminds me of me and my boyfriend getting in a fight. Well and her getting to see her mom at the end see i don't get to see my mom anymore so um...when i saw that part my mom came to my house and i just started to cry. And Mariah just needs to keep doning more and more movies. And she needs to make more cd's cause all of them are so good. So um...to everybody that reads this this is coming from a huge fan go buy her cd's and go buy Glitter it a cute movie don't go but what anybody say's."

Expect a fun peice of frothy delight, and you'll be pleased with what you see. Yes, the script is a little weak and the story is just unbelievable, but let yourself get swept away by the magic of the film! Mariah is surprisingly good in the lead role. Alot of the bad reveiws were thinly veiled personal attacks on her, which doesn't tell you much about the film does it now? Give it a chance - you might just love it as much as I do. 8/10."

And also because of Mariah's physical Breakdown in the summer of 2001. This whole thing has rolled into one mess of a deal when people horribly misjudged this movie and Mariah because of shallow reasons...Give this movie a chance! even this website's review of it ended making positive remarks about the Movie and Mariah's acting!"

And there's one thing about the movie that is absolutely 100% authentic: she has an astounding voice and a musical talent that most of her critics can only dream of.\n\nLove the disco music, too, by the way - brings back great memories.\n\nOK, I donned my asbestos suit - now go ahead and flame me. ;-)"

It's well-written for a movie entitled 'Glitter'. The poster's a little to 'festive' as Mariah would call it for me because there are some somber moments. Eric Benet's good too. The one problem I have with the music is that she rarely hits a high note. The songs are well-written but still the high notes are why we all like her, right? Also at times, her hair is really weird, which is good because it does supposedly take place in the eighties. I have to admit, as cheesy as it sounds, I cried at the end. I know I'm a dude, but 'never too far' is like my favorite song by her. I wasn't surprised by the fact that Dice you-know-whats (i won't give it away if you haven't seen the movie)in the end cause i had already accidentally read about it. She even finds her mom! All in all, a great movie that was ruined for most by the \"nervous breakdown\". Once again, way underrated.\n\nP.S. You'll get annoyed by Billie's publicist.\n\nP.P.S. Billie, what a masculine name!"

This also proves that dreams do come true if you only believe in yourself. Having Mariah Carey play the role of Billie Frank was a wonder idea, because Mariah is a very talented and well known singer, so it kind of fits in with her life, just as Billie frank, comes from a broken down home, and dreams of becoming a wonderful and famous singer, and she finds her fate, and doesn't give up in what she believes in. this is a good role model for kids, to show them that dreams do come true, if you only don't give up"

Google your facts before commenting on something you think you know about. Still have a problem with the \"silver strip\"? (I can't capitalize the term aids without it being flagged by amazon for 'shouting' which I'm not sure how that has gone without being red flagged in itself)\n\nLiterally, this one of the best campy movies ever made which is why it continues to re-run on hbo along with other media outlets. Do you see 'Gigli' anywhere (at all) on TV? No. Give it a chance. Many of my non-Mariah fans have even agreed it's worth the watch.\n\nMaybe I'll continue this review when I can stomach the rest of yours."

Revisiting it on its 20th anniversary, you manage to connect with the emotion and nostalgia of a movie made with sincerity in an adverse context for the singer.\n\nThe refusal that surrounded the film is not enough to overshadow certain aspects that shine like the name of the legendary star. The eighties setting is one of the best achieved highs in Glitter: the wardrobe, the hairstyles and even the vibe transports you directly to one of the most inspiring and revealing decades in the music industry and of our society (Just like Pose did recently).\n\nFilmed before the 9/11 attacks, New York is another of the guest stars that stand out in the film, and seeing the Twin Towers is exciting. Then there's the music, ooh the music. Mariah Carey definitely leaves it all in her role as an aspiring singer on her way to the top. The final scene is one of the most moving and shows a vulnerable diva who they tried to erase, but always finds her way back home.\n\nI just can say #JusticeForGlitter."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed this film. Mariah did a great job and shows promise. Mariah was very connected and believable which is more than we can say about some other \"Diva's\" first movies. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Mariah's deep inner life that we hear in her \"non-released/commercial\" songs shines through on the big screen...intriguing. The story gets a bit slow in the middle...but not by fault of Mariah. If the writing was supposed to be \"stereotypically 80's\" it missed...it seemed just stereotypical at times...amongst other things. The music was awesome and the club scenes a lot of fun...very alive! The styling and costumes were perfect. The actress playing `young Mariah' was a dreamy little doll. Terrence Dashon Howard was excellent as always in his `bad guy' roles. Da Brat was also surprisingly fun to watch. I'm not so sure about some of the other supporting cast...may have been a missed opportunity or two. All and all a very enjoyable film with a lot of glitter, fierce music and dare I say camp! I look forward to seeing more of Mariah on the big screen."

People like that are retarded, and now all of a sudden now that Mariah has climbed back on the social ladder with The Emancipation Of Mimi, you guys all want a piece of her and now support that she is going to be in a new movie later on this year. Well be honest and if you haven't really seen the movie and you have commented on it then rent it, buy it or whatever and take the time to actually see it.\n\nCurtis"

As regards the movie, it may be a bit cheesy but the acting is not bad, the costumes and the shots of New York are fun and the music is enjoyable. I give it a 10 to counterbalance the prevailing unreasonably low score."

Mariah Carey is a very talented Artist and i have been a fan since i was 5. She has a voice, that although isnt what it used to be, is beautiful. Thus she should stick to singing but since it has become the trendy thing to do, She did make a movie and it flopped big whoop! I saw the movie and was saticfied and I didnt eagerly await the critical slams. Seems like everyone just cant wait to see her fail. Mariah I feel sooo sorry for yo right now and i really do appreciate what you do."

        "review_detailed_main": "A wide-eyed caramel skin girl sits quietly on a bar stool watching her mother beautifully sing on stage while her audience are lost in their own lives. To encourage some kind of reaction the mother calls upon her daughter to sing with her. The bashful girl wanders to the stage, takes the mike, and sing. This is the opening to \"Glitter\", a movie that simply sparkles.\n\nFrom a very promising opening scene, you somewhat get the feeling that \"Glitter\" is on its way to becoming a new type of film. The opening scene is tinted, and grim, but still comes off as beautiful and refreshing.\n\n\n\nSinger/songwriter Mariah Carey helms this film and insists that this is not an autobiography. Thank God. The life of Billie Frank is sad and disillusioned. After being abandon by her jazz singer mother (Valerie Pettiford), the adult Billie (Carey) is unsure of herself. Everyone she knows, from her two best friends (Tia Texada and rapper DaBrat) to a pimplike producer (Terrance Howard) knows she can sing, but Bille doesn't really know her true potential.\n\nEnters DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) who not only tells Billie that she can sing, but guides her on her path to securing a record deal.\n\nBut the path is unsteady.\n\nBeesley's character is the shakespearian tragic hero with the most problems and most lines. Carey's character seems restraint, as if screenwriter was unsure of Carey's true potential.\n\nCarey is a fine actress, with a remarkable screen presence that sparkles from beginning to end. Her problem is the few lines she is given to spat out that ranges from bland to Hallmarkish (\"You were the only one to believe in me,\" exclaims Billie is one scene). But the cliched script is overshadowed with a great supporting cast and beautiful scenery.\n\nThe movie's best moments involves Carey main talent - her vocal prowless and passionate songwriting amidst a triumphant soundtrack. The opening song (\"Lillian Blue\" sung by Pettiford and newcomer Isabel Gomes who portrays the younger Billie) is simply beautiful and watching Carey unabashedly singing \"Reflections\" in one scene, is truly worth the admission itself.\n\nDirector Vondie Curtis Hall does an admiral job with his direction; some scenes are close to ground breaking, and the shots of the world Trade Center is a somber and poignant reminder of its lost beauty.\n\n\"Glitter\" sparkles with a supporting cast, superb soundtrack, and a star that can now add actress to her ever-growing resume."

At least Mariah pulled a double on this project and got the well deserved rest she needed to come back with her best album ever! The emancipation of Mimi of course. Now if only she can turn some of her songs into another movie and maybe this time she'll get herself an nomination for something other than a Razzie.

For all these reasons I do not understand why this film has been so slated since its release.\n\nThe multi-talented Mariah Carey plays Billie, who as a child watched her alcoholic Mother perform - now as she enters her adulthood she yearns the fame her Mother's addiction stood in the way of. At the bottom of it, she just wants to be loved... and don't we all? Billie finds love with club DJ and music producer Dice, who helps her find her feet on the path to her career goals, but of course there are obstacles. There always are.\n\nAlso a highlight of this film regardless of her limited screen time is Padma Lakshmi's portrayal of Sylk... absolute entertainment, just not a great vocalist (but she does try, oooh how she tries!)\n\nBuy this film... watch this film... rate this film. Its great! (And no, I am not Mariah before any of you go and say it!)"

I think that was hash and unnecessary. I mean her mom isn't even black her dad is so you don't even know what you are talking about cause the movie was not about her. I think for her first movie she did good and someone said that the songs weren't good but I am a singer my self and those songs were phenomenal if you listen to the words but as usual someone always got something to say just like they did Whitney Houston in the body guard but that was the stuff to."

        "review_title": "A Great Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "I know that some people think that Glitter is a bad movie, but I watched and thought it was a great movie. It's about a biracial girl, Billie Frank (Mariah Carey) who was born to a African-American mother and a white father. Her mom was a singer but she had some kind of drug or alcohol addiction which interfered with her career. Then Billie's life starts to change: her mom carelessly set the apartment on fire nearly endangering the life of her daughter. Then the next scene, Billie is taken away from her mother and into foster care. She meets her friends, Roxanne (Tia Texada) and Louise (rapper Da Brat) who stay with her for the rest of her life. Then we go to 1983 where Billie and her friends are dancers. They then get signed to sing backup to a horrible singer named Sylk and the producer decides to have Sylk lip-sync Billie's part. One night at a nightclub, a DJ by the name of Dice (Max Beesley) finds out that Billie actually sang Sylk's part. He instantly falls for her and wants to produce her. Billie agrees to, she becomes a superstar, but realizes the life of a singer isn't as glamorous as she thought it would be. Dice turns obsessive, her friends hate her fame, and all the drama goes downhill after that. In the end, Dice ends up getting shot before Billie's concert and killed. I loved the last part where Billie meets up with her mom again. It was beautiful.\n\nI think it's a great movie and all Mariah Carey fans should see this movie. And for the other people who hate this movie: If you don't like it, don't watch it! This movie is a million times better than \"Crossroads\" or \"From Justin to Kelly.\"\n\nI give this movie a ten because it's a great movie."

I saw this film almost everyday during it's brief 2 week theatrical run in 2001,and multiple times on video/ DVD (i own it ). I just want to say that Mariah Carey and Hall created a beautiful, personal, artistic masterpiece of cinema, a soulful meditation on time, memory, love, and loss. Great artsy camera-work, lighting, and editing framing a deeply personal story. In other words a poetic art-house film. Mariah Carey is excellent in the lead, as is Max Beesley. Great emotionally gripping scenes. Beautiful poetic music. Great visuals. I could never pick one all time favorite film until I saw 'GLITTER\". WOW!"
