Stand by Me is a great film, you can say it is a drama with some thriller elements.\n\nFour boys hear the location of the dead body of a boy from their small town. The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack. It seems to be a simple story but it is told perfect.\n\nThe performances the boys give, one of them is the late River Phoenix, are all extraordinary. I liked the way their friendship was shown. Just a great movie, see this. 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant.\"\n\nStand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.\n\nBased on Stephen King's short story, \"The Body,\" the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.\n\nThe strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."

        "review_title": "One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.\n\nStand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'\n\nStephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories \u0096 `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'\n\nStand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film \u0096 `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.\n\nStand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story \u0096 things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all."

The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.\n\nThere were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.\n\nThe story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.\n\nThe four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell\n\nCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.\n\nWhat Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.\n\nThe last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.\n\nIt's also a cracking \"gang of kids\" drama, stylistically similar to the likes of THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD and even sharing some of the same cast members, albeit with a much more realistic theme. The film is set in 1950s Maine on a hot summer day, where a gang of lads decide to track down the body of a boy hit by a train in return for a reward.\n\nIn reality it's an excuse for lots of adventures with trains, leeches, and junkyard owners, as well as a nasty antagonist played with gleeful relish by Kiefer Sutherland. There's plenty of crudity here alongside that infamous gross-out pie eating contest, but it's surprisingly mature too with deep characters and genuine performances. River Phoenix is the one who really shines (RIP), but Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell really nail it too. Perhaps the wraparound scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are a little too sentimental, but it's not enough to detract from STAND BY ME being a minor classic of the decade. Great soundtrack too."

        "review_detailed_main": "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.\n\nStand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.\n\nThese are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.\n\nTeddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.\n\nThe acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, \"The Body\" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.\n\nFirst of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. \"Stand By Me\" fits what the characters in the story are facing. I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to. All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a \"bad kid.\" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.\n\nTo me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.\n\nThis film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future."

It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.\n\nIt is a quintessential Stephen King story in that the basic premise isn't all that complicated, a couple of lads walking down the tracks, but is filled with insight, purpose and life by the smallest of details given to his characters. I've rarely encountered more interesting, yet so believable characters than I have in his books. He's the one author that has made me realize that every single man or woman alive is interesting beyond belief if you only get to know him or her well enough.\n\nUnfortunately the novella is so bountiful and full of details that the movie seems pale by comparison. Most of the important plot points are referenced and acted out, but they don't reach the same emotional impact because details are missing and/or not given enough time to sink in. In addition the film suffers somewhat from the fact that all the main actors are children. They're very good child actors, Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix especially, but you can definitely see through their acting in most scenes.\n\nNevertheless, it's an excellent movie to check out, even if you've read the original novella. It speaks about childhood through very unconventional means, but it rings no less true because of it. Quite the opposite. We really never have friends like the ones we had when we were twelve."

I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.\n\nThis movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend.\n\nThis movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.\n\nThe newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee."

I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.\n\nStand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.\n\nThe script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.\n\nA beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the \"real world\". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner."

        "review_detailed_main": "In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.\n\nSo what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?\n\nFirst of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.\n\nAnd it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!\n\nBut it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. \"I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess.\" In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!\n\nAnd thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.\n\nWell, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'\n\n10 out of 10, no doubt about it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand By Me, the 1986 coming-of-age film, directed by Rob Reiner, and based on the Stephen King short story The Body, is one of my so called 'Perfect Films.' A perfect film to me has all of the elements of a good story: comedy, adventure, horror, suspense, and romance. Yes, this movie does not have romance, but in a way it does: in the sense of being in love with your youth during an adventurous summer.\n\nThe film Stand By Me is a timeless one. It's the kind of film that when you see it for the first time, or the 50th time, it gives you that nostalgic feeling of familiarity, that safe feeling of pre-pubescent adventure and care-free outlook.\n\nThe actors are great, perfectly cast, and deliver fine performances across the board. Arguably it is an all-star cast: Richard Dreyfuss (narrator), River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, Will Wheaton, Kiefer Sutherland, and John Cusack to name a few. They all respectively show great range, and are all perfectly cast.\n\nThe film takes place in Oregon, during Labor Day weekend of 1959. Like I said before, it is based on Stephen King's The Body, which is in his short story collections Different Seasons (which also has Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil so it's awesome). The adult Gordie Lachance (Dreyfuss) narrates the story via flashback while writing a novel. The flashback tells the story about him and his friends embarking on a quest to find the body of a local, missing boy near the town of Castle Rock. Speaking of Castle Rock, the antagonist here is Sutherland's younger Ace Merrill.\n\nWhile the story unfolds, it is revealed that all of the boys are dealing with their own personal issues, all while helping each other in their own way. Gordie (Wheaton) is still grieving and guilt-ridden over the death of his older brother, Teddy (Feldman) is an abused child desperately in denial of his father's malice, Chris (Phoenix) comes from a broken home, and Vern (O'Connell) is shy and timid, while trying to make his way.\n\nWe learn more and more about each individual as they trek on through the Oregon wilderness in order to find the body, but what they are really searching for are themselves. We start to care more about the characters, and one-by-one we begin to relate to them. The 1950's contemporary rock and roll soundtrack really plays into the story too.\n\nThe film and story age very well, which can be very tough to do when using a period piece that takes place from another decade. They don't need to rely on special effects and technology, and the dialogue from King's work is carefully chose and respective to that time. The set decorations (see the general store), and costumes, are perfectly chosen.\n\nStand By Me is brilliantly woven using comedy (watch for the pie-eating contest scene), horror (the boys' imaginations in the forest), drama, suspense, and adventure. It's reportedly one of the few film adaptations of his works that Stephen King likes, and I think they got it right too."

They decide to find the body to become local heroes and along their journey, they disclose secrets and learn the importance of their friendship.\n\n\"Stand by Me\" is another nostalgic little gem from the 80's with a coming-of-age drama, with funny and heartbreaking moments. The plot is simple but realistic and supported by a group of promising young actors. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Conta Comigo\" (\"Count on Me\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, \"Stand By Me\" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives."

The premise of the story (based on a King novella) is stupid and generally uninteresting and the execution is clich\u00e9d.

The characters are either stereotypes (the teens) or cartoon-like (the parents and other adults). The big emotional scenes are corny and forced. The framing device, where the story is related in flashbacks, is meant to be poignant but it just falls flat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interesting that in Stand By Me the four kids who were our protagonists in the film all went on to have successful careers. One of them, River Phoenix has passed on to legend as a result of his early demise.\n\nThis was quite a novel film in the sense that it had no box office names at the time it was released. That probably aided director Rob Reiner because all of these future celebrities come off as real kids.\n\nReiner got all kinds of good results with his location shooting finding some of the woodsiest areas he could for effect. This film is shot 95% out doors and real out doors at that.\n\nWil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and Corey Feldman are our 12 somethings who hear of a rumor that a kid they knew was hit by a train and his body is some miles away in the woods. It's summer and they decide to mount an expedition to find the body. The film is their odyssey into the woods.\n\nStand By Me got one Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. The writing is superb with the dialog that is given with these 12 year olds with hormones kicking in. The story takes place in the 50s. Richard Dreyfuss plays the adult Wil Wheaton and narrates the film and also makes an appearance at the end.\n\nKiefer Sutherland who is a bit older gets his first notice as the town bully in the small Oregon town this all takes place in.\n\nThis film is a legend because it is an eternally true story and will be popular centuries from now. Superb film making."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was little, I was sheltered. I couldn't watch movies with witchcraft or rude humor, and my movie diet was mostly VeggieTales videos and Disney movies. And I DEFINITELY couldn't watch anything Rated R.\n\nWhen I was about 7 years old, my now deceased father once took me to Wal-Mart and we looked through the $5 DVD bin. My Dad found Stand By Me in there and said it was a good movie, but I looked at the back and said: \"Dad, this is Rated R!\" He was shocked, but we still ended up picking a different movie.\n\nFor 8 years though, my interest peaked and I had an obsession with seeing it, and months after living with my Grandma, she let me watch it. It became my favorite movie, and it's still one of my favorites to this day, another decade later.\n\nStand By Me, based on a Stephen King story called The Body, is a coming of age story centered on Gordie LaChance, a 12 year old who hangs out with his 3 friends- Chris, Teddy, and Vern. They're bad boys too, shown by their smoking cigarettes and foul language.\n\nOne day, near the end of Summer 1959, Vern tells his friends that he overheard that the corpse of a kid about their age was spotted by his brother, but he was afraid to do anything about it. The kids then decide to fake a sleepover and go find the body themselves in order to get rich and famous.\n\nThe kid actors- Wil Wheaton, River Pheonix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell, all have excellent chemistry together. Although they bonded in a few weeks and filmed the movie over a summer, it really seems as if they actually were childhood friends.\n\nThere are other good actors in the movie- such as Keifer Sutherland as the bully Ace, and John Cusack as Gordie's deceased brother Denny.\n\nBy genre, Stand By Me is a comedy and drama, and it highly succeeds as both.\n\nIt's a serious movie, with many tear-jerking moments. For example, there is a scene where Chris confides with Gordie about stealing lunch money, only for a teacher to take it back to buy a dress.\n\nIn another scene, Gordie cries about how his father hates him- which stems from his father's disapproval and a statement at Denny's funeral that he should have died instead.\n\nDespite such sad moments, there are many funny moments as well. Gordie is a writer, and he tells his friends a story about a teased fat kid who gets his revenge by vomiting at a pie eating contest.\n\nIn another scene, the kids swim in a swamp and get leeches stuck to them. There are many other funny lines and moments as well, all of which balance perfectly.\n\nI do have one nit-pick with Stand By Me, but I don't hold it against the movie. The movie is clearly low budget- to be exact it cost about $8 million. Compare that to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, another movie from the same year that actually cost $3 million LESS, and the camera work slightly disappoints.\n\nHowever, Rob Reiner was in the early stages of filmmaking, and the movie isn't horrible to look at, so it's worth a pass.\n\nSpeaking of Rob Reiner, he is now one of my favorite directors, and I have a space on my favorites list just for movies of his that I adore- among them are A Few Good Men, The American President, The Princess Bride, and When Harry Met Sally. However, I think that this is his best work out of all of them.\n\nEven though Stand By Me is no longer my favorite movie- now it's The Gospel According To St. Matthew, it is still very high on my list and it holds a special place in my heart. I have actually seen it well over 15 times, and I will be seeing it many more times in the future. Stand By Me is undoubtedly the best coming of age movie ever made.\n\nParental Note: Despite the R Rating, the movie is actually pretty tame. There's lots of cursing, but the F word is only used about a dozen times. There is no violence, apart from violent threats and fired guns- no one gets injured or killed from it.\n\nThere is also no nudity or sex, but some suggestive jokes are made. Considering that the movie centers around 12 year olds, this is highly recommended to kids 11-12 and up."

OK, granted, Stand by Me is nothing like the others, but it stars kids nonetheless.\n\nStand by Me was a good ol' fashioned drama and I can see why I liked it and still like it. I got to see four foul-mouth pals take an adventure that I only dreamed of taking when I was that age. To have the freedom to just roam the woods with three of my best friends on a mission; that's little boy heaven.\n\nThese four youth all had their problems but they were a band of brothers together. They laughed, cried, fought, played, roughhoused and everything else together; exactly what all regular boys do. There were no heroics, no real highs and no real lows just life.

It's a memorable story (adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King) about four 12-year-old boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable: the script, the acting, and most of all, the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers, who was not only cute but a \"bad boy\" with a heart of gold (also the breakout role for River Phoenix). This is a must-see for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12-year-old boys in the movies cussed every two words, smoked cigarettes regularly, and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once, and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed, never smoked anything, and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However, these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King."

It gets some things right: for example, it has the courage to tell a tale of four decidedly pre-pubescent children, and while they do not necessarily make pleasant company, its a relief to see a \"rights of passage\" film not entirely shaped by a story of first love. But the characters are disappointly archetypal: the sensitive writer, the wise gang leader, the stupid fat kid and the wild one; and the dialogue and story are at times weighed down by the burden of implied significance. Also hard to understand is why the older boys who also appear should be quite so wound up by the film's (much younger) heroes. The low key ending is also undermined by the sentimental wrapping provided by the narrator. Read Roddy Doyle's novel 'Paddy Clarke Ha-ha-ha' for a less heavy handed story of children growing up by stealth."

How they handle it will affect them their whole lives. But the story is as much about their pasts and their connection to one another. I just wrote comments on \"The Breakfast Club.\" I felt that movie lacked chemistry. While every type was represented, it just didn't cook the way this one does. Part of it is that these boys, while in some ways disenfranchised, are not open books. As they interact, their dreams and hopes are drawn from them. Some seem quite settled, but when push comes to shove, they have vulnerabilities. The stories they tell give us insight into their souls. From what has happened to some of the actors, it makes one wonder if some of that suffering came from within them. There are intense scenes. There is bragging and one- upsmanship along the way. And nothing is simple or trite. On of the best movies of our time."

However, Stand By Me is just so pretentious and unpleasant to me, I can't find much in it to like. For child actors, the cast isn't actually too annoying, but that being said I didn't find any of the characters very likable and couldn't really get attached to them. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's mean spirited. For a film about childhood, it seems to just be interested in countless instances of people hurting, destructing, bullying, etc, other people. Yes, I understand what it's going for/trying to say, but just can't get in to this overdone, pretentious movie that's not evenvery entertaining. This film annoys me, and the more I think about it the less I like it. Many people rave about Stand By Me, but I say it's not worth your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.\n\nThis is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.\n\nStand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.\n\nIt seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.\n\nDespite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.\n\n8 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound."

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."

        "review_detailed_main": "This has to rank as among the best American treatments of the theme of childhood innocence versus adult (and teen) corruption since \"Catcher\". Plus, the four twelve year old protagionists are a helluva lot more likable than Holden! In other words, a damn fine film and kudos to the quartet of Phoenix, Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell. You're lucky if you get just one fine kid actor let alone four, as is the case here. So kudos to director Rob Reiner, as well, whose best film this is and who must have had something to do with coaxing the talent from his four young leads.\n\nAlso credit Reiner for deft pacing (at no point does this film drag even a little) and defter (is that a word?) handling of the numerous great set pieces like the confrontation with the abusive junkyard proprietor, the Great Locomotive Chase across the bridge and, of course, the discovery of the poor Brower boy's dead body. Reiner, in these scenes and others, seems to have an innate feel for tone, never veering into caricature, hysteria or sentimentality so that they achieve maximum impact on the viewer.\n\nHowever, this is not a perfect work. So let's quickly dispense with the problems:\n\n1) Richard Dreyfuss' narration starts out charming but wears out its welcome after about twenty minutes.\n\n2) Really coulda done without the 1959 jukebox score. We're not doing \"American Graffitti\" here, guys, (Dreyfuss' presence notwithstanding).\n\n3) In a generally well written movie scenarists Rey Gideon and Bruce Evans err in not resolving the Keifer Sutherland/Will Wheaton conflict, deciding instead just to drop it. And speaking of bad decisions the telegraphing of Phoenix's death at the start of the film completely vitiates the power of that last shot of him at the end.\n\nBottom line: Comes tantalizingly close to a classic. A minus."

It's one of those rare movies that connects with you personally, giving the viewer a nostalgic look back on one's childhood and gives them a chance of discovery to find their place in the world, plus feel pains. That's what the four boys in this story come to grips with. Each of them has an insecurity/weakness that connects them together. One is unloved by his family, one has a mentally ill parent, one is shy and overweight, the last feels like a complete outcast. They say the journey is more important then the destination and it shows here, the boys have many adventures on their way to find the body of a kid, as they joke around, share pains, and experience many things, they bond better than ever and what will happen when they do meet their destination (which I won't reveal here) they will have to return changed and move on in life. Some will make it, some won't, and as for the viewer, you will leave the movie changed reflecting on the friends you had in your life, the ones that had your back all along, and cherish them even more. This is a good movie to watch on Labor Day, the three day weekend of self-discovery."

I predict this story will increase in ratings as the years go by and people watch it again to realize just what a rich story it is."

Along the way, they encounter the junk yard owner and his legendary dog Chopper, a speeding train on a bridge they are walking on which they jump from, camp fire chats (including the hilarious Larass barfing story), crossing the lake of leeches, and ultimately, they become closer than they did before, if only it lasted. They are also being followed by older boys, trying to get their first, including hateful leader Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). Also starring Casey Siemaszko as Billy Tessio, Gary Riley as Charlie Hogan, Bradley Gregg as Eyeball Chambers, Jason Oliver as Vince Desjardins and then quite unknown John Cusack as Denny Lachance.

        "review_detailed_main": "To give this film as high praise at it deserves is near impossible. There is nothing that, given the power, a true movie fan would not change. Stand By Me has bag's full of entertainment, comedy elements and thought provoking scenes with plenty to spare.\n\nTo brand this a \"kids\" movie would be so wrong. Simply having children as the lead actors does not take anything away from the movie, it actually makes it the greatest coming of age movie ever, and one of the greatest EVER movies. AND WHAT ACTORS THEY ARE!\n\nThis story, like so many King novel's, use's character substance to carry it instead of seen-them-a-mile-off constant \"twists\", trying to hard to be clever plots or poor action. Only actor's of the highest calibre could pull this off (and that includes adults). The actors perfect their parts so much that you feel you personally know each one of them, that you are friends with these people, that you have been on this journey with these people and that is why it saddens come the end of the film. Never before has an audience laughed and cried with movie characters.\n\nA portion of this acting praise must go to director Rob Reiner. Only perfect directing could show the boy's talents in their true glorious light, and thank god he did not patronise and treat them as children with how it was shot. Many times the boy's were contained in a group and while this meant them all being on top of their game throughout it brought the film to life and really gave a sense of a close group of friends.\n\nThe main character here is Gordie LaChance, a boy practically dis-owned by his parents as their favourite, perfect child, Gordie's older brother, has died. This leaves Gordie with no identity and no life purpose, something he will pick up from his journey, as will the others...scaredy-cat Vern, flamboyant army fanatic Teddy and tough-guy with a hard surface Chris.\n\nThough maybe not intended i did not see Gordie as the hero in this pic. It was the tragic story of Chris (River Phoenix), who had been severely mis-judged and given the reputation of a \"bad kid\". This is due to his family reputation, one that Chris cannot shake off. Always the strongest with the most life set-backs Chris is the light of the movie, and River Phoenix the star.\n\nOne excellent scene in particular, the real gem in this crown, is where Chris (River Phoenix) tells Geordie (Wil Wheaton) about his milk-money experience. It was the strongest point of the film, by far the most emotional and River Phoenix acted well beyond his years, more believable than most adult actors.\n\nI cannot rave about the performance's enough. To carry a film that, while already stunningly shot with an excellent 50's soundtrack, needed so much substance to work each actor had to be perfect...and they were. Ace (Kiefer Sutherland) was so realistic, a character representing the boy's problems, Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is that kid we all no from our childhood, Teddy (Corey Feldman) was such an elaborate, original yet realistic character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton) witnessed all of this and listened to his friends problems while suppressing his own, while River Phoenix, as Chris, is all of the above and more. It is Chris who make's you laugh, make's you cry, makes you sympathise with while envy at the same time. He has the most problems in the group yet still put's his friends (particulary Gordie) first, keeps the piece, and keeps the group, and the movie, together.\n\nThis is beautifully crafted, intensely directed, has an amazing soundtrack, gives a story that has it all and acting performances that make you wonder...where were the Academy? I do not think I build up his performance enough by claiming that River Phoenix deserved an Oscar nomination AND win for his portrayal of Chris. I have not seen that many better performances by an actor, not a child actor, but by actor's in general....EVER! (Only Jack Nicholson in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" & Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\" can boast better performances)\n\nThis film deserves the praise it gets x100. Everything you could want from a movie is here, in Stand By Me, one of the greatest movie's of all time.....\n\nSuperb 11/10!"

We used to hang around and roam the forests of MCC, our father's college since we were all staff kids.\n\nWe've done everything - from playing cricket in the college grounds to going around cycling across the whole college(more of a forest). We tried building a tent in the middle of the forest, roasted chicken sausage held by sticks on dry leaves that we burned to create fire. Tried fishing in the college lake with mosquito nets , hit stones through beehives and fled to escape those bees, walked through bushes and dangerous fauna exploring the forest.\n\nAnd this went on for five full summers and all the weekends throughout the years in between, including other holidays. At one point, it seemed like life was going to be this way forever!\n\nSo when i watched these four kids go through almost similar experiences and experience life's joys in its raw form, I was instantly connected. And its a coming of age story for those kids, who go through the adventure and come out as mature mini adults. They confront their fears and vulnerabilities and discover what lies ahead for each of them.\n\nI always missed my teenage years and those friends I spent those beautiful moments with...I always felt like I wasn't living life the right way now that I am not in touch with them and don't get to spend time together. But the movie answers it for me - we are meant to be separated at some point and it never lasts forever. \"Friends are like busboys in a restaurant who come in and out of your life\"...that line from the movie will stay with me, because whether we like it or not, that's the harsh truth of relationships in real life.\n\nI will keep coming back to this movie, whenever I miss my friends and those carefree beautiful years."

Really?\n\nBased on a novella by Stephen King titled \"The Body\" (hmmm, can't imagine why they changed the title for the movie), \"Stand by Me\" is one of those coming-of-age movies drenched in nostalgia for a more innocent time, set to period rock 'n roll tunes that makes for a better soundtrack than it does a movie. It's ably acted by a cast of young actors (the late River Phoenix among them), and it's a solid effort overall, but it's not a movie that really spoke to me in any way or which I even really remember much all these years later.\n\nThis movie did, however, trigger my repulsion for Kiefer Sutherland, which I nurture to this day.\n\nGrade: B+"

It's an incredible, sentimental tale of four boys, Chris, Gordie, Teddy, and Vern and their quest to find the body of Ray Brower. This movie had me right when I saw the charm of it. During the movie you get to see into the lives of the boys, and you find that this movie is really about friendship, and needing your friends through hard times. Stand By Me also has a few funny wise cracks, and times that will pull at your heartstrings. I think the ability to include so many different aspects in one movie is fantastic, and definitely a worthwhile film. I recommend Stand By Me to anybody and everybody- I can't think of many people who wouldn't enjoy this \"coming of age story\" that will grab you and catch your attention just like it has mine, over and over again, not matter how many times i watch it."

There were also some tearful moments in it too especially towards the end but i think that just made the movie seem even more special to me. This film has everything, its funny, its adventurous, its tearful and it has a friendship based plot. every time someone asks me what my favourite movie is i always say this one.

        "review_title": "The Time of Their Lives",
        "review_detailed_main": "The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), and his three friends, Chris (River Pheonix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame, attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper, almost getting run down by a train, and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey, but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner, director of the film, was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this, Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body, they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke, shoot handguns in town, and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow, the times sure have changed since I was a young child."

        "review_title": "When a Theme Song Outperforms a Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is another instance where I must diverge from the consensus that the film deserves an 8.2 rating out of a possible 10. That is very high for the average rating of a movie, especially one from the 20th century and 36 years old at the time of this writing.\n\nI was 10 in 1959 when the movie was supposed to occur, but I was 12 when Ben E. King's hit, which serves as the film's theme, soared to the top of the charts in 1961. That places me at the same age of the boys when the critical song was most popular, so I should be able to relate to the story on that basis, but I don't. The theme song and the soundtrack were the most positive aspects of the film. I loved the song in 1961 and still love it today, over 60 years later. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not get involved with the story, the somewhat lethargic, if not banal, screenplay, or the characters. Even the location in the Eugene, Oregon area couldn't inspire me very much. I lived in Eugene for a short time a decade before the film was made, and I don't believe the beauty of the region was captured as it could have been.\n\nI remember the age of 12 as being one of the most difficult eras of my life, but my best friends came along when I was around 17, so I couldn't relate to Richard Dreyfuss's final words either. The age of 12 was nothing more than a total nightmare for me even without the sight of a deceased classmate. Life was bad enough without that, thank you.\n\nI wish that I could rate this film higher, but I just can't. No apologies either."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all I would like to say I'm not the best of film critics out there and what I wanted to say about this film has already been said through the other fantastic posts on here. I just want to repeat it myself, echo my borrowed thoughts through the tool of writing. Let people know how great this film is from my own view.\n\nThe film is about four friends who share the emotions, trials and tribulations of growing up, through a decision to go on a trek and find the body of a missing child of a similar age to them. This film makes you so feel so much (without giving too much away).\n\nAlthough I have seen a few films on TV, I usually change the channel half way through. On one particular day last year I was flicking through like I do, half blankly staring at the screen, when I came across this film. I sat and down and watched it to the end, a rare accomplishment for me.\n\nFrom my own opinion, films can never really evoke real life. Some films can, fair enough, but what hit me most about this film was how the ending could fit into real life. The ending was so ordinary. There was no fairytale element to this film whatsoever. Thats what made this film so feel-good for me.\n\nI have seen the films My girl, Casablanca, Titanic and The Shawshank Redemption (all brilliant films which I have also taken the care to watch). They have never even brought a lump to my throat. The ending to Stand By Me was so personally heart-felt, however, I was not ready for the emotion that would overwhelm me. A personal experience that has changed who I am.\n\nDefinitely one of my top 3 films for life."

The strengths and weaknesses of the script are often a direct reflection of its source (a Stephen King novella), with dialogue keenly tuned to the period (who was stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse?), but overloaded with a superabundance of barf jokes, fart jokes, jerking off jokes, and so forth. It's too bad, because the film is miles above its competition, even with the totally unnecessary voice-over narration (read by Richard Dreyfuss) used to frame the central story."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the death of his friend, a grown-up Gordie, now a writer, recounts a childhood journey. Gordie and three friends travel a long way to see the body of dead boy, and have several adventures on the way.\n\nI thought this movie was excellent. I thought it was a really nice, simple, unpretentious movie with themes that were really great, and really relevant. The characters, and some of the actors playing them, were amazing. River Phoenix stood out especially, he was a fantastic actor for his age, but the same applies to the other child actors; they brought the characters to life so well. I felt like I knew them all so well, and I suppose I do have friends, or know someone just like each of the characters. Although the characters were great, the one criticism I have about them is that they were a bit clich\u00e9 and stereotyped. For example, the quiet artistic child whose brother died and whose father hates him. Or the fat, loser, woosey boy. But I suppose the characters are like that so we do relate and feel like we know each one of the characters. Apart from that, everything else was great. It wasn't too long or too short, and the story never seemed to lag. It's funny, hilarious even at times, but it's still touching, and sweet. The filmmakers and the actors manage to capture every aspect of childhood without being one of those awful, lovely, candy-coated, happy, Hollywood movies. The movie makes me feel lucky that I'm still young, and that I still can make the most of my life, but at the same time, it made me wish I was 12 again, that I was still innocent, and had friends like Vern and Gordie and Chris."

        "review_title": "Affectionate enough tale of four youngsters discovering all kinds of strife and truths, under a canopy of highly delicate comedy and enjoyable characterisation.",
        "review_detailed_main": "There's a point in Rob Reiner's pleasing 1985 film Stand by Me in which the primary characters themselves, in the form of four young boys of around about double figures in age, identify the trip they're all going on as anything but \"just a load of fun\" or an excuse to \"have fun\" or that they 'ought' to be having fun. Where the allure of doing something a little rebellious and sneaking off with three friends for a few days so as to visit a yet undiscovered crime scene sounded like a great time prior to taking off, it is only half way through the journeying that the real world out and away from your home does not necessarily adhere to your initial vision. In a certain sense, we feel the same way about the film: an unobtrusive and light hearted comedy about a bunch of boys breaking all the rules and having fun in the process on the surface but something much more beneath that. There is nothing funny about what the four primary child characters go through in Stand by Me, nothing funny about the realities they face nor what it is they both experience and learn as a result of what they do. Like the boys at the soul of the film itself going through what they're going through, the audience themselves are invited to take a step back and really mediate on what it is we truly think about what's transpiring before our eyes.\n\nThe story of the four boys is narrated to us by a certain Gordie Lachance, the later incarnation of whom is portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss in the then present day 1980s with Wil Wheaton playing the younger version from some thirty years previously. His friends, with whom he lives in a close knit Oregon community in the latter stages of the 1950s, are Chris Chambers (Phoenix); Teddy Duchamp (Feldman) and Vern Tessio (O'Connell), together forming a quartet of really well rounded, engaging characters whom end up in a flurry of situations both before and during the venturing out to a rural zone on the outskirts of town that it has been heard harbours the dead body of another young boy. LaChance sits idly in his vehicle to the side of a country road in the immediate opening, sighing with a tone of regret at a newspaper story detailing the death of someone. A group of kids cycle past him, they garner his attention and ours in that the following track-in on LaChance results in a flashing back to his own childhood which, like the physical manifestation of the boys whom just went by, has indeed passed him by.\n\nThe set up sees a somewhat bubbled existence within the Oregon town of Castle Rock established to be life's norm. The kids spend most of their spare time in a secluded tree house away from everybody else laughing and joking at each other's expense in-between humbling information usually linked to troubles at home provided by the narrator on each of the other three involved. The sense of the community being closely knitted feels prominent, a scene showing one of the boys in Chris receiving a harmless enough lift from a truck driver to meet up with one of the other boys establishing a worry-free sense of togetherness in this small, enclosed world of your bog-standard adolescent living through crude humour; practical jokes; the coming to terms with home truths which itself comes with an odd sense of alienation from one's parents as well as the threats posed from local bullies.\n\nThe few or so days they spend out of this enclosed circle of a functioning world that is their home town does not dictate precisely where it is they will all end up in life, but Stand by Me is not a film aiming for expansive frills revolving around somebody's entire life story. Instead, effort has been inserted into detailing what goes on in and around the local area of forestry located on the outskirts of said town and how more immediate attitudes can shift. An amusing short-story to do with Vern's inability to find a jar of money he secretly buried in the dirt under his house's porch acts as the catalyst for the film to revolve around these four kids and their venturing out yonder across train tracks and through the countryside in an attempt to find the dead body of a boy whom was supposedly struck down by a train. His brother Billy (Siemaszko), one of a number of gang dwelling bullies headed by Kiefer Sutherland's Ace Merrill, informs a friend of his of said body with Verne underneath eavesdropping.\n\nWith win of the info; barely enough supplies to see out the journey; a charming script which allows time for these four to bond and share small talk with each other as well as a young, abundance of energy in tow: the boys set off on a trip which they will remember for as long as they are alive. Reiner has them predominantly stick to some train tracks; their doing so in a bid to eventually guide them to their prize a somewhat iconographic deployed. The tracks below them are representative of the firm, formulated, entrenched arc they're on in both a literal and metaphorical sense in that they can lead only to what they discover in the form of the dead body as well as inside of themselves in relation to the journey itself. There are no deviations, not on the permanently fixed road upon which they tread nor the metaphorical road the four of them have landed themselves on: all paths lead to what discoveries must occur up ahead. Under Reiner's careful, watchful and astute direction combined with a worthy screenplay; Stand by Me stands as a wonderful documenting of four young characters undergoing a rounded process of realisation and hardship."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is such a great movie. It is a very brave, and entertaining comedy/drama, that actually has the courage to show 12-year-olds as they really are, and doesn't clean it up for the whole family like most movies of this kind do. It's a hilarious comedy at times, but is also very heartwarming and tragic.\n\nMost of you know the story. The set up for the adventure is when four pre-teen boys learn about the whereabouts of a missing local kid's dead body. They end up going on a twenty mile quest to find the body, and hope to become heroes.\n\nGordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is a sensitive, and intellectual kid who lives in the shadow of his dead older brother Dennis (John Cusack), who was the only one in his family who actually understood him. Everybody acknowledges to him about how well his brother played football, which makes Gordie's pain even worse. His parents don't seem to care about him anymore, and he feels that his dad hates him. He is a great storyteller, and his best friend Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), gives him hope and encouragement.\n\nChris Chambers is an abused kid who comes from a family of lowlife thugs, including his cruel older brother Eyeball (Bradley Gregg). Chris is a good kid, and although he has made some bad choices, he still remains a very positive character. His family's bad reputation alienates him from society, and he doesn't have much of a chance in life because of it. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, he tells Gordie about how a teacher cold-heartedly took advantage of his bad reputation, when he tried to return some money he stole.\n\nTeddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is a somewhat crazy and disturbed kid, who loves his dad (only because he was a WW2 veteran), who nearly burned off his ear on a stove. Teddy is sarcastic, and rude, but in a rather nice way, and would still be a good friend.\n\nVern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) is the main source of the movie's humor. He is a squeamish, cry-baby, scaredy-cat. He insists that Gordie doesn't tell any horror stories, and is worried about the dumbest things (a coyote, a dog, the results of a coincidental coin flip). He is really just a tag along, who is always being picked on by the rest of the gang, particularly Teddy (who frequently punches him, and gives him two more for flinching). He is the one who learns about the body's whereabouts, and gives the others the idea for the quest.\n\nThe dead body is really just a set up for a series of adventures that the boys have on their journey. They nearly get run over by a train on a bridge in one scene, and in another they face a mythical junkyard dog. And when they find the body, they have to face a ruthless gang of older kids led by Ace (Keifer Sutherland), who are also after the body. They have campfires, and share a bond that is very touching. Any guy who has ever had a group of friends can relate to the antics of these four boys. They cuss like sailors, smoke, and do other things that they wouldn't do with their parents around. The way these boys talk, and act is very accurate to the way kids their age are (though their insults are very old and 50's). I was their age not long ago, and was exactly like that. The ultimate example of the phrase \"boys will be boys\" is depicted in hilarious detail in this film. There is a sequence of gross- out humor when Gordie tells a story he wrote about a massively obese kid nicknamed \"Lardass,\" who takes revenge on his tormentors by entering a pie-eating contest with funny, but gross intentions. That scene is very, very disgusting, but is a silly, lighthearted way, and when you see it, you'll understand what I mean. Boys really love that stuff.\n\nThe movie has a very tragic ending, that is still heartwarming. It really makes you cherish your friends more, and brings you closer to them. Every pre-teen should see this, but unfortunately, few kids I know actually enjoyed it. They usually thought it was corny and boring. This movie may be slightly sappy at times, but it is all for good purpose, and makes you feel great. Also, it is the complete opposite of boring. Every scene is interesting in some way. The scenes are either hilarious, heart-wrenching, or heartwarming. Sometimes even suspenseful. I cherish this movie, and recommend it to EVERYONE. Watch it now, and love it. 9/10.\n\nStand By Me is rated R for Language Including Sexual References, and Some Crude Humor. Sex: 4/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 7/10 Drugs: 5/10"

They do such a genuine and believable job here at such a young age and their charisma and characters immediately suck you in and give you a nostalgic feeling that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe supporting cast is also terrific. The cobras are hysterical with some of their one-liners, Kiefer Sutherland is amazingly believable as the stereotypical bully, and even John Cusack's small, yet memorable scenes add to this wonderful film.\n\nStand By Me is a funny and nostalgic movie, with some of the best one-liners and memorable scenes that will leave an impression on the viewer. I couldn't help but want to call up my childhood friends and discuss one of the best movies I've seen in years.\n\n10/10"

Maybe a lot of this comes down to its kind of unrelatable core conceit and some of the stranger twists and turns of its narrative, though the overall experience is by no means a negative one and essentially represents an easy-to-watch, well-acted meander through a distant memory. 7/10"

The way the film's narrator, who is played by legendary film actor Richard Dryffus (apologize for any misspelled words and erroneous grammar)who plays one of the young boys grown up as a writer, and how he sees in the beginning of the film those two boys on the bike allows him to reflect on his childhood and how friendship is eternal. The last ten minutes of the film, for me, are the most memorable and emotional when Chris Chanmbers, played by the late River Phoenix, is described by Richard Dryfus as being killed to try to settle a dispute, which reflects Mr. Chambers kind and conciliatory character, which was greatly accentuated by Mr. Phoenix understanding and passionate role. Thank you to Rob Reiner, Stephen King and the entire cast and filmmakers working on the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand by Me was a movie that truly blew me out of my socks. I saw it first when I was very young and I thought it was great, but completely forgot about it. Over the years, I thought less and less about it until I came across it again one day. I popped it in to see what I had forgotten about, and I found myself crying more than once. It sent a message that children should be receiving very early on. It's a movie about friendship and loyalty. I think my favorite scene was the 'Milk Money' scene. I found myself crying with Christopher Chambers about his dramatic loss and how everyone thought nothing of the 'low-life Chambers kid.'\n\nThis movie is essentially about four boys looking towards one goal. To be a hero by finding the missing body of Ray Brower and to be redeemed in their town's eyes. And when they set out on their 2-day trek, they learn things about each other that they never knew before. They learn that in each other's eyes they're all equal, and that's all that matters. They learn that they don't need to be redeemed in each other's eyes, because all of them have enough issues with themselves to be able to worry about the issues they have with their friends. But when the rival gang sets out with the same goal and they meet in that last scene, the whole movie pulls together to its ultimate climax. And this group of boys makes for a fun, dramatic and hilarious movie. Teddy Duchamp and Chris Chambers, both doomed to a life of misery by their deranged or angry fathers. Vern Tessio, the sacredly cat with a brother in their rival gang, and Gordie Lachance, perhaps one of my favorite characters in this movie, and the narrator. Gordie is the sensitive writer who just wants a little love from his parents after his brother died in a jeep accident. He was one of the characters that made me cry most, along with Chris.\n\nChris and Gordie are the best of friends, which is something that I think sends out a good message as well. Having a best friend whose shoulder you can cry on and who will always try to be there with you if you ever, in slightly dramatic terms, have a mental breakdown.\n\nThis movie is highly recommended. Definitely worth seeing, as it has turned into one of my favorites. Especially that one last line:\n\n'I never had friends later on in life like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anybody?'"

When a junk yard owner insults a boy and his friends drag him away he calls for them to come back. For what? This would not and does not happen in real life. The mean old man should laugh. That's how it happens in life and how it should have be written but since the \"author\" had to present us with the bonding of the boys (saving one from suicide wasn't enough) he couldn't leave \"the plan,\" the plan he no doubt read in his copy of \"Screen Writing For Dummies.\" The author seems to know exactly nothing about people except this: he wants to be a writer. In one pathetic scene (author's massage!) one of the boys suggest he might write about their pathetic little souls if he grows up to write.\n\nWhy not? There was quite an important event they were witnesses to and, if you can't write about that, what can you write about?... assuming one can write.\n\nBut this author can't.

The characters are rich and still feel fairly un-stereotypical and the performances are engaging and natural. It's rock solid basically - here the well-observed King gang-of-lads dynamic gets centre stage without any of the creepy stuff. Certain sequences still have a wild tension to them and the 50's jukebox soundtrack gives it a magically vivid sort of life that's hard to define, one of those rare period films which have an uncanny accuracy about them."

This scene just makes you want to cry, but it also show's you the emotional maturity that these kids had at such a young age.\n\nThe idea of fleeting friendship is what I think about when I watch this film. The way you can be so close with a certain group of people and in a moment that can change. This film does a good job at presenting this idea through the eyes of younger children."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was very rare. I used to sit down with my nephew and watched goldies from the 80s, which he found dull and boring. I finally hit jackpot with Stand By Me. It seems the best Stephen King movies is about life, not the supernatural. Based on the short story \"The Body\", it tells the simple story of 4 friends going on a road trip to find the body of a dead kid. It's all about friendship, and loosing innocence, with a menacing Kiefer Sutherland luring with his croonies in the background. Starring some young, up and coming actors, you can't stop to think what happened to they're own future, when you watch it. The ending, were River Phoenix walks away and slowly dissapears, always make me shiver. Almost a foreboding for his tragic future. But beyond all, this is a story about the last tour for 4 friends, before they eventually split up. Just like life, you have childhood friends you share unforgettable memories with, but you just loose touch, and life goes on."

Through this adventure, they make deep friendship and develop as an adult.\n\nThis film develops by Gordie's flashback. I think the flashback style tell something that we can get in only our childhood. I sometimes felt bore because they just go to adventure. However, I could find innocence, curiosity, invincibility, and mutability peculiar to children.\n\nMy favorite point of this film is music, for example Lollipop\", \"Yakety Yak\" and \"Stand by Me\". These soundtracks make film lively. I think nice choice of music.\n\nThough this work was made in 1986, it is famous even now. I could understand this film is called a masterpiece. I think it has great ambition and nostalgia."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand by Me is a timeless portrayal of childhood, weaving together friendship and nostalgia in a deeply resonant way. It's a coming-of-age drama that's earned its spot among the best in its genre. What makes it special is the genuine performances of its young cast and how it nails every aspect of filmmaking to capture those unforgettable moments.\n\nBased on Stephen King's novella and narrated by a writer reminiscing about his youth after a friend's passing, the story follows four boys on a journey to find the body of a missing child, hoping for local fame. But it becomes much more-a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and moral courage.\n\nRob Reiner's direction is top-notch, giving the film a seamless structure and a warm atmosphere. The screenplay keeps the characters innocent while delving into deeper themes. The cinematography adds emotional depth, and the editing keeps you engaged. The music choices fit perfectly with the storytelling.\n\nThe young ensemble, including Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell, deliver standout performances. Wheaton and Phoenix especially shine in their roles. Even Richard Dreyfuss, in a brief appearance as the older version of Wheaton's character, adds a poignant touch.\n\nDecades after its release, Stand by Me still hits home, celebrating childhood innocence, friendship, and youthful curiosity. It's a heartfelt tribute to those years when friendships were pure and selfless. A journey worth taking for audiences of any age."

Although the dialog is corny at times (i.e. \"Stop it!\"...if you've seen the film, you know what I mean. And who thought up that horrible last line to Lachance's book at the end of the movie?), on the whole, \"Stand By Me\" is a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone, especially those who were children at the time that the story takes place."

Too easy and no big surprises when finally the kids found the body. In the whole film there were one or two funny scenes but believe me that\u00b4s all. I noted this movie from imdb critics and i have to say that they are partly too overrated. Rent it before you decide to buy it. Fortunately I only rent it but you won\u00b4t miss anything and it\u00b4s better you save the money for another good DVD. For these reasons we gave for the second time a 1/10. The other one was for \"Memento\"."

All 4 boys are good in it and the older kids especially Kiefer Sutherland play their parts well. There are many memorable scenes like the train and the leeches and the lard ass story is a good one. I like how it ends with the classic song and it's true that friendships around 12 can be the strongest of your life."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a brilliant and touching story , although sometimes results to be slow-moving and tiring , but resulting to be developed with real intelligence and extreme sensibility . In the picture is treated ethic and moral themes narrated with great sense of fairness and ductility . After the death of one of his friends, a writer (Richard Dreyfuss) recounts a childhood journey with his intimate friends (Wil Wheaton , Corey Feldman, River Phoenix , Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell , all of them ready as future stars) to find the body of a missing boy. As a group of friends search for the body of a missing teenager after one of them overhears his oldest brother ,who claims to have seen it . Unusually , the story is narrated by one of the boys , now in middle age . For some, it's the last real taste of innocence, and the first real taste of life . But for everyone, it's the time that memories are made of !.\n\nA simple and plain plot but there's a lot more to the movie in the basic script. The search for the missing body becomes something of an odyssey for the boys and more an adventure than even they expected . It turns out to be an enjoyable and really perceptible tale which heightened by the late Fifties used in the musical score . Interpretations are pretty good , as protagonists play agreeable kiddies who will have to face off traumatic truths . Performances from the young kids as sensitive and agreeable boys are nice , they're newcomers and would have much success years later , some of them becoming into first-class world stars . Based on the novella \"The Body\" by Stephen King who delivers some self-biographic remarks and interesting storyline from Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon. Stephen King collaborated with director Rob Reiner who named his production company \"Castle Rock\" after a fictional town created by Stephen King and the two have worked as a team on several movies together. Under Castle Rock Entertainment, Reiner went to direct Oscar-nominated films When Harry Met Sally, Misery, and A Few Good Men . In \u00a8Stand by me\u00a8not always the sad device works, but it succeeds enough here , as it doesn't interfere with the slow down story. While filming the scene in Stand By Me (1986) in which Gordie and Vern are being chased by a train, Rob couldn't get Wil Wheaton and Jerry O'Connell to look frightened enough, so after a take, Reiner proceeded to yell at them until they began to cry , he then filmed the scene over again.\n\nIt contains excellent and stirring soundtrack by Jack Nitzsche , accompanied by emotive and classy 50s' songs. Besides , exceptional and awesome cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth, being stunningly shown on the marvelous outdoors in the country from Veneta, Eugene, Franklin, Brownsville, Oregon, Row River Trail, Gooseline Railroad, Cottage Grove, Oregon, Eagle Mountain , Burney, McCloud River Railroad, McCloud, California, USA . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Rob Reiner. Of all the films he has directed, he considers Stand By Me (1986) as his masterpiece and his favorite film. Reiner as best friends in high school with Richard Dreyfuss, whom he later directed in this stunning Stand By Me . Reiner directed three of the movies ranked in American Film Institute's list of top 100 U. S. love stories in 2002: When Harry met Sally... (1989) , The president y Miss Wade (1995) and The Princess Bride (1987) . And Rob directed 3 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Kathy Bates, Jack Nicholson, and James Woods ; Bates won for her performance in Misery (1990). Rob Reiner has directed two films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: This Is Spinal Tap (1984) and The Princess Bride (1987). Rating Stand By Me : 7/10 . Better than average , well wort watching ."

Expect a simple story that is well executed in the traditional Hollywood mold but it is far away from being a truly powerful film and a realistic portrayal of childhood. In fact, the kids in the film look more like adults or kids playing adults in a movie, than actual kids. That is a general problem with films portraying children since adults write the script and therefore they make all the characters act and talk like adults.\n\nTry watching Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service for a coming of age film featuring 12-13 year old kids in a much more realistic fashion and also in a much more artistically sophisticated fashion as well."

Evans, ensure that the first half of the film is not quite as electrifying as one might have hoped, as it is clear that some sequences are ultimately far better off than others.With the boys ' attempts to cross the railway bridge securely within the opening hour of the film, surely standing as a highlight. The palpable chemistry among the four children, in particular the rock-solid friendship between the respective personalities of Wheaton and Phoenix, plays an instrumental part in maintaining things interesting even through the rocker parts of the narrative.It plays an instrumental part in maintaining stuff interesting even through the rocker parts of the narrative, and it should be noted that the film boasts an increasingly fascinating feeling as it passes into its tense and amazingly touching third act - which efficiently cement Stand By Me's location as a timeless coming-of-age drama."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my favorite movies ever. Rob Reiner does a great job as director. It seems like most kid actors don't have a true connection with the other actors and aren't really being the character. In this movie the kids seem to genuinely feel like good friends that are acting as themselves and really feeling their emotions. I give a great deal of credit to Rob Reiner for that because he really had to help them learn how to act at that age.I was most impressed, however, with River Phoenix who was a fantastic actor, even as a kid. All of the kids are so true to their characters and do an excellent job. I love coming-of-age stories, and this is the best I've ever seen. Not only is it hilarious, but also has a great theme and story. Kiefer Sutherland plays the bully and really does an amazing job at making you hate him. The American 1950's was so well presented and everything that is in the movie really puts the audience in that setting."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those films that becomes adorable not only because of what it shows and tells us, but also because of the affective memories it awakens in us, or even because of the messages it brings and which it explains in its narrative. The value of friendships is a more than common theme in cinema, but perhaps this is one of the most paradigmatic and memorable films when the subject is precisely that.\n\nVery consistently based on a book by Stephen King, the plot is simple: four young friends get together to find the corpse of a boy who disappeared, and set off on a long journey on foot that will take them through a series of obstacles and difficulties, and that will test the friendship and unity of the group. The matter itself ends up being quite irrelevant, no one cares about the dead boy. What matters is the journey of the four boys and the way they overcome difficulties, forgetting their differences and what eventually separates them. Each of them has their own sad story: broken homes, families with little structure, domestic violence, dramatic family losses (a father, an older brother...). In short, none of them is a boy born with a silver spoon or into a well-positioned family. And the film explores this very well, with inspired dialogue and absolutely believable and well-conceived situations.\n\nRob Reiner is a very effective director who knows very well what he wants. One of the points in which he shined most was in choosing the filming locations, designing the sets and reconstituting the period (the film takes place in the late 1950s, at the height of the post-war \"American dream\"): the director It really manages to transport us to the past and to magnificently designed and credible places. Another point he valued was the choice of actors for the four main characters. In addition to being a perfect fit in terms of age and physique, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton are very talented and do their best with their characters and their material. Without the effort of these four young people, the film would not have the strength it has.\n\nOn a technical level, the film stands out for its good cinematography, the sets, costumes and props that I mentioned above, the choice of period cars and an excellent soundtrack, featuring some iconic melodies of the time."

        "review_title": "Lacks The Character Development Of King's Novella",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the novella \"The Body\" written by Stephen King that this film is based upon, a group of boys set out to find a local dead body, and end up finding more out about themselves than anything. Along the way, master wordsmith King is able to develop each and every character to a point where readers can really care for or sympathize with their problems or successes.\n\nIn this film version, \"Stand By Me\", though, that incredible character development is lacking. I realize I am a bit \"tainted\", as I know what I was missing, but suffice it to say that after the novella experience, the film just seemed to lack that extra \"oomph\" to turn it into any sort of classic.\n\nOf course, I probably am expecting the impossible in this situation, as director Rob Reiner likely did everything he could to develop four very different young men in the span of only 88 minutes, but just that limitation alone drags the story down a bit. Whereas King (as he is known to do) can, in a very in-depth fashion, probe the personal lives of each of his characters, Reiner is restricted to a series of flashbacks that just don't have the same emotional connection with the viewer as King does with the reader.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong...I don't think that this is a bad film by any stretch of the word. If you have not read the novella, I think you might be inclined to give it another star in the rating column (don't expect \"classic\" status, though). However, if you (like I was) are looking for faces to be put to King's classic characters, locations, and themes, then you will likely be a bit disappointed, as \"Stand By Me\" fails to carry that mantra like some others have (including \"The Shawshank Redemption\", a classic movie based on a story in the same collection as \"The Body\")."

It makes me long for what could have been. The rest of the perfectly selected actors craft the enthralling tale completely nailing each of their unique characters. They should all get accolades. You feel for each one's story and where they came from. Something that Stephen King was a true master of. Incredible character development.\n\nI'm amazed this adaption of one King's most famous short stories throws me right into the 1960's and I'm ready for the tumultuous ride. Perfect and well done! Kudos to Rob Reiner for bringing King's vision to the screen so we can all see the beautifuly complex story that King wanted to tell."

This movie makes you remember your youth and it's purity and the gift of close friends.\n\nthis quote from the movie just about sums it up: \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve.

And it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time! The first thing that shocks you and leaves you speechless is the maturity of the main actors. Their acting seems to be so real, so down-to-earth and yet fascinating. I am not much of an emotional person and I do not often cry over movies, because there is always an inner voice telling me: This is not real, this is art, it is supposed to be entertainment. But this... It just hit me as hard as it could, I found myself with tears filling my eyes even the day after watching it. I am only 17, and I know that life is ahead of me, but for some reason it just made me feel nostalgic and old. It made me somehow regret watching it, but at the same time I want to watch it over and over again. I am not a movie expert, but for me - this was not a movie. This was my childhood, my memories, my desperate wish to turn back time. And maybe some more competent people criticize particular parts of this movie (for example, the main actors smiled in some scenes even though they were supposed to be serious), but for me these \"flaws\" made this movie perfect and real. They reminded me of me and my squad when we were that age, our pointless conversations, fights, joking, crying... For me, this movie is by far the best picture of that innocent stage in our lives. And a raw reminder that you'll never be that young and free again. But there are memories that help us. Memories - and things like this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "It had been many years since I had watched \"Stand by Me\" and after just seeing it again I realized it had been one of my favorites growing up as a kid. Really it's just fabulous a good coming of age story about growing up as when everyone sees they can relate to their childhood of growing up and being with friends and having fun in the summer all along while dealing with acceptance, uncertainty, and just dealing with the journey of life. Rob Reiner who directed does a fine job adapting from Stephen King's novel that's told by a grown adult who's all grown up played by Richard Dreyfuss who tells about the summer of 1959. And when the film flashes back his youth character is played by Wil Wheaton and it tells of his summer journey with his three friends(River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O' Connell)who set across the Oregon landscape of wilderness and timber to search for a dead body of a boy who's been missing. A good turn is given by Kiefer Sutherland who's tough as the local bully. Overall a film of friendship and most important it's about the coming of age and learning thru the experience and journey of life."

        "review_title": "\"Stand by Me\" is a classic of 80s, addressing perfectly themes such as friendship, loyalty, personal growth and sense of loss, among others",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"It can't possibly be a Stephen King work! \". The exclamation is almost certainly coming from those who watch the movie \"Stand by Me, 1986\". Adapted from a short story by the author, who through his literary works became known as the master of suspense and the supernatural, The film can cause such astonishment for being classified by the film industry as a drama that addresses themes such as friendship, loyalty, personal growth and sense of loss, among others.\n\nThe script adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans is very efficient, managing to flawlessly convey all the main life lessons of King's book. While the direction of Rob Reiner (from \"Question of Honor\") is firm, and manages to maintain an electrifying atmosphere, and at the same time, always light and fun, filled with good doses of humor, even in the tense moments that the film provides. The film manages to be touching from its opening scene, when an adult Gordie reads the news in his car about the death of the \"famous lawyer\" Chris Chambers, his great childhood friend, and gets emotional when he sees two boys riding a bicycle, making a scene. May all your memories of youth come back to you in a stream of consciousness. Does this not happen to us? Sometimes our lives are so full that we forget how good it is to remember the good times of our lives. From then on, we are thrown into the memory of Gordie in his troubled childhood. Even with the almost general lack of perspectives in relation to Gordie and his friends, together, they were happy as no adult is. The film efficiently shows how pure the friendship between the young people is, marked by innocence and sincerity, which everyone knows will one day become extinct. In the same way that childhood friendships are marked, but they are very difficult to cultivate until adulthood. Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern, even with completely different personalities, they were souls that complemented each other.\n\nThe adventure of going in search of a body not found by the police and the possibility of finding it and becoming heroes, is the representation of any young person's dream of wanting to appear, of being able to do everything. Something like a student with a reputation for being an ass answering a difficult question in the classroom, in front of everyone. Young people feel the need to live each moment of life with emotion, before it's too late. Acting in the way that suits them and thinking that this way they acquire superiority and independence, they feel all the power when invading a forbidden place or simply smoking a cigarette. The film delicately shows all these sensations of being young.\n\nAt a certain point in the film, when they are bathing in a river, Teddy begins to play drowning his colleagues. Chris tells him, \"Come on Teddy, act your age.\" Teddy doesn't think twice when he replies, \"I'm acting my age. I'm young, and youth only comes once in our lives. We have to take advantage of it\". Analyzing this dialogue, we see how much we humans have that \"hurry to grow up\" and we fail to enjoy great and rare moments in our lives. Looking through today's eyes, we can remember how good youth was, without major responsibilities, and regret that we didn't make better use of those golden years. It is no exaggeration to say that the best moments in each of our lives are when that \"child spirit\" hits us, making us tell jokes, laugh at our own nonsense or play with that bosom friend of yours.\n\nThe film leads us almost like a fifth member of the group, which we get to know more and more along the way. As the plot unfolds, we will realize that life has not been easy for any of them, that they cling as best they can to the final moments of a childhood that seems to no longer want them, at the same time that they begin to perceive the arrival of a world feared adult. It is the strongest metaphor that King presents us with about the fear that comes with the end of childhood. In any film, or literary production that has the purpose of provoking fear, such a feeling is transmitted by external stimuli, such as a murderer, a monster or some supernatural event. In Stand By Me, which I remember again, has a story focused on drama, there is the fear of something inevitable and from which one cannot escape: growing up and accepting life as it is.\n\nBoys perceive this empirically and even if they try to appear strong, they are actually weak and do not know how to deal with such events. The film has moments that exemplify this through each of the characters and their inner fears. Chris is the rebellious young man in the plot, but during a nocturnal conversation with his friend Gordie, he takes off all his masks and cries compulsively, angry at adults and how weak he is in front of one. The same Gordie lives with the weight of his brother's death, who for the family was the favorite son. Claiming that the fear shown by the characters in Stand By Me is the main support pillar of the work would be completely false. It is just one of the elements of the plot, but because it is worked and presented in a poetic, almost playful way, it ends up going unnoticed, diluting itself within the narrative. Mainly because the film masterfully works with noble elements such as the loss of innocence itself, the value of friendship and the importance of moments that mark people.\n\n\"Stand By Me\" is certainly not an easy movie to watch. Not because we don't feel engaged by the story, but because of the weight of its atmosphere. Although we are dealing with children, their problems mirror those of our unforgiving world and little by little we see how the actions of adults profoundly affect these kids, even molding them into what they can be when they mature. From Gordie's (Wil Wheaton) parents' treatment of him (both before and after his brother's death), to society's prejudice against Chris (River Phoenix), we see boys deeply wounded emotionally, causing not only in tears, as in some behavior not befitting that of a child (although these, too, are certainly present).\n\nHere the title demonstrates all its relevance within the context presented. In this cruel world, these four boys escape reality through their friends - they are the ones they can really count on, as is already made clear in the song by Ben E. King, played both at the beginning and at the end of the projection. This experience is still essential and we see it clearly in the final minutes, when we discover that Chris escaped his \"sealed fate\" and became a lawyer. You can go wherever you want; Gordie tells him and those words reverberate in the young man's future, leaving us with an outcome that mixes the nostalgia, optimism and sadness of naturalism all at once. Interestingly, the script still works its protagonist, Gordie, as if he were on a true road to overcoming the death of his brother, the only figure who, in fact, knew him within the family. The relationship between the boy and his best friend shows how he leaned on Chris, who genuinely helps him get through this difficult phase. The chemistry between the two is palpable and the melancholy of the author, years later, who writes about his childhood, manages to be perfectly conveyed to us viewers.\n\nNaturally, the choice of casting and, of course, the direction of actors played an essential role here. Rarely do we watch an audiovisual work, with a main cast made up solely of children, that works in such an organic way. We see in them aspects of our own childhoods and the most disconcerting thing is to recognize that many of the problems we face in adult life, they have to face here, evidently in a less mature way and with all that young look at the world - even if the naivety of they have all been shaken countless times. In fact, what we see here is the journey of each one of them towards adulthood.\n\nRob Reiner's direction still builds the suspense of the script in a suffocating way. A perfect example of this is when they are crossing the bridge on the train tracks. The camera makes a point of showing the altitude they are at and how any slip could lead them to death or a very serious accident, as they need to go over the gaps between the wooden boards. At the same time, we don't know when the train will arrive and whether they will be able to cross in time. The perspective sometimes alternates between large open shots, showing how small they are in relation to the world, sometimes it shows us the look of the protagonist, who constantly checks to see if the smoke from the locomotive appears in the distance, creating in us an anguish that becomes palpable. A similar strategy is used through the parallel montage, which shows us Ace's group (Kiefer Sutherland) approaching the place where the boys are going, showing that we will see a conflict soon, but we don't know what, in fact, will happen . The tension only increases as we witness the madness and even evil of the character, who clearly won't take it easy just because he'll be dealing with twelve-year-olds. This build up slowly leads us to the climax, which is resolved in a way that is both simple and organic yet manages to leave us breathless until its resolution.\n\nIn the last scene of \"Stand by Me\", an adult Gordie concludes his book with a beautiful sentence that sums up the entire essence of the feature: \"I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, but who had?!\" As the credits roll to the sound of \"Stand By Me\" by Ben E. King (John Lennon's version is also beautiful), it's impossible not to feel lighter, and with that desire to be a kid again. When \"Stand By Me\" ends its flashback, which started in the prologue of the feature, we are truly exhausted, as if we had accompanied these boys on their adventure and in the same way that the protagonist, now older, finds himself thinking about his past, we are left in introspection, our friendships left behind and the extent to which we believe in our ability to go where we want."

The plot itself is simple; four friends early in their adolescence set out on a journey to find a dead body. However, along the way they discover more about themselves than they could have imagined. Or rather, the two main friends discover things about themselves, mainly through reinforcement from those around them.\n\nIt's touching to see the strong friendships, but the revelations of their hopes and fears aren't too surprising. It does create greater context, giving a deep background for each of them, which is impressive for a short film, but if any theme is too subtle, or the bond created between the four not apparent enough, the narrator is there to ensure the entire audience understands what the film is driving home.\n\nEvery character has a reason for being included, even if they don't generate too much excitement. The acting is good for such young actors, however there is more than a healthy dose of over-acting from Feldman. The basis for the film's popularity is due to it's relatability - everyone has friends or circumstances they can see in the film - yet it's unlikely that later generations will feel such a connection with a world so alien to them."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's just the best film. The very best.\n\nI watched it first when I was 11, in 1989 or 1990, and I thought it was pretty good. I then became 12, and experienced the most profoundly wonderful time of my life, with my 12 year old friends.\n\nI saw Stand By Me again when I was 13 or 14, and it all made sense to me. Ever since, the film has brought out every possible emotion in me, many times over.\n\nWhen River Phoenix died, I couldn't face watching it for a couple of years. The scene at the end where Chris/River 'disappears' - the thought of it killed me. I returned to it after that, but haven't watched it now for at least 3 years, probably more.\n\nI know virtually every word, but each time I watch it, something new occurs to me. Whoever put the soundtrack together deserves immense credit, it is beyond poignant, beyond beautiful, beyond words.\n\nI often wonder if girls and women are able to appreciate this movie in the same way that boys and men are. I'd be interested in feedback. I have supposed that my intense emotional connection to the characters in this film come from having once been a boy.\n\nI have it on DVD and VHS, but so profound is the effect this film has upon me, I am waiting for the right moment. It is always with me though, and for that I dearly thank the writer (and yes, I've read 'The Body' many times over, but this is a very rare case of film being better than book), the director and the actors, and everyone else involved in making 'Stand By Me' the incredible experience it has been for me, over the course of the last 19 years."

When Gordie is typing on his computer he types \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus Does anyone?\" that really hit home for me and i really related to that. The movie shows the four boys (Gordie Lachance, Chris Chambers, Vern Tessio, and Teddy Duchamp) with strong friendships and how important it is to have friendships like the ones shown in this movie. All the boys are going through something in their families, as well as personal lives and when all four of them are together their problems seem to disappear and they are all happier."

        "review_title": "Epic beyond belief for what it is.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Stand By Me\" truly is epic beyond belief for what it is. This is due to various reasons. 1). Its cast is mainly children. Quite often films with casts children dominated lack quality acting as the youngsters simply have just not been in the business long enough to be able to deliver impressive performances. However \"Stand By Me\"'s young cast all are believable and show great chemistry. River Phoenix in particular is amazing as the brave , yet troubled \"Chris\". 2). The film is very very short. Quite often the best films are around 2 hours in length. Often this duration is necessary for a film to drum up enough depth for it to stay with the viewer long after the credits. \"Stand By Me\" has no trouble going into decent amounts of depth and staying with the viewer in only 85 minutes. Its nice to watch a film which doesn't drag on. There is too many of that these days. 3).The focus of this film is on children so you would think it would probably only appeal to a childish audience.Yet it doesn't. It deals with some heavier material than initially expected but this is welcomed by more mature viewers. Plus most of us value our childhoods so its childhood friendship content is refreshing to view as it encourages us to reminisce on our good times of our younger days. In saying that it is epic for what it is I guess it was always going to be in some ways as its written by arguably the most successful writer of the 20th century Stephen King. Richard Dreyfus (Jaws) plays a satisfying side role as the older \"Gordie\" who narrates the story.\n\n\"Stand By Me\" is an excellent film. i recommend it to anyone who values childhood, friendship or just wants to witness a fine and ultimately moving piece of cinema. \"Suck my fat one you cheap dimestore hood\" haha \"Sincerly\""

        "review_detailed_main": "'STAND BY ME' - 1986\n\nDirected by Rob Reiner\n\nStarring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell\n\nPlot Overview: After learning that a stranger has been accidentally killed near their rural homes, four Oregon boys decide to go see the body. On the way, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches, as they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives. Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in their lives.\n\nIt's become apparent of late that I've been watching movies based on Stephen King novellas. I've watched Misery, The Green Mile, 2017 It and now I've got to 'Stand By Me'. With the exception of perhaps 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Stand By Me' is King's most celebrated film and has received plentiful amounts of critical praise. And after seeing it, I think it's okay. 'Stand By Me' is now means a bad movie and by Coming-Of-Age standards, it is pretty great. But I don't think it deserves the mass praise it receives. I still recommend that you see it because it's still a good film but I certainly don't think that it deserves the massive praise that it receives.\n\nAs far as pros go, I could name a few. I liked the performances, for a start. Wil Wheaton does a pretty good job as Gordie Lachance, as does his older counterpart Richard Dreyfuss, in narrating the story. Wheaton's peers, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell also do great jobs in bloating out the cast and making the characters come alive.\n\nAll the cast who played the bullies in the film also did excellent jobs.\n\nI also really liked the fact that the story was character driven opposed to story driven. This made each of the character's arcs mean something more and elevated the characters from good to great. The actual story itself was pretty basic and could have used some more adjustments but the overall narrative was strong and engaging, thanks to the characters.\n\nHonestly, I have no major flaws with this movie. Everything is at least semi decent but I just didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else did. It's fine but I can't see myself ever watching it again. It was entertaining while it lasted but even now as I am writing this, I am struggling to remember what exactly happened in any logical order. It's an unfortunately forgettable movie and, while I do recommend you see it, I don't really see the critical praise it has received. I'll rate 'Stand By Me' 7 'Dead Bodies' out of 10."

This movie also shows something that most movies under this genre lack and fail.

Another things is that I liked about I was that the main characters are kids because most movies are full of adults. It was their own adventure. I like that it Stephen King made it, as he normally make horror, like IT or Pet Cemetery. The film almost makes you want to go on an adventure. It also kind of makes you want to be a kid again.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a coming-of-age road movie set in rural Oregon in the summer of 1959 and 1986. Richard Dreyfuss narrates the story as \"The Writer\" in 1986. The film follows four 12-year-old friends just before they are about to enter grade seven. Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) is the natural leader, but comes from a nasty family with a poor reputation. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is skinny and unathletic but creative and imaginative. His beloved older brother, Dennis (John Cusack), has recently died in an automobile accident, and his parents (Marshall Bell & Frances Lee McCain) have not recovered. Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is impetuous and has been abused by his father, who is now in a mental institution. Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) is chubby and somewhat clueless.\n\nVern has heard that his older brother, Billy (Casey Siemaszko), and a friend (Gary Riley), have discovered the body of a missing boy their age some distance away near a railroad track. Billy is part of a group of juvenile delinquents led by Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland).\n\nThe film follows the trek of the four boys overnight and into the next day. They have several adventures, a close call with a train on a trestle over a river, and a scary night in the woods. We also see illustrated a story told that night by Gordie about a boy named Lardass (Andy Lindberg). In parallel, we see Ace's gang decide to return to the body and the final confrontation between the boys and the gang. Ultimately, The Writer summarizes what happened to the boys when they grew up.\n\nThe four boys are magnificent in their roles, though some of their shared adventures stretch the imagination. Their dialogue as 12-year-olds is outstanding. The juvenile delinquents are a bit stereotyped, but they look \"right\" for the era. The soundtrack uses many popular songs from the era. I had forgotten how good \"Stand by Me\" was."

        "review_detailed_main": "A heart-warming movie, \"Stand by Me\" takes place in the 50s and brings 4 best friends through an adventurous hike on the train tracks to find a dead body. Rob Reiner's 1986 film is a story of friendship and growing up. These boys have had some of the toughest lives but their stories are one reason this movie is so entertaining. You'd be surprised to learn what they deal with at such a young age. This film does a wonderful job of portraying young friendships during the 50s. Centered around the difficulties children and families have gone through in the 50s, it realistically brings depth and meaning to what you have imagined during those times. Each of the boys have experienced tremendous pain in their lives. Either from family physical abuse, substance abuse, neglect, and/or death. All have suffered from poverty in these hard times. For example, Teddy grew up with a crazy father--that suffers from war PTSD--that also almost burnt off Teddy's ear. Another example is Chris, who grew up with a bad family and had a reputation that he would turn out bad too. These boys show most of the struggles civilians dealt with back in the 50s. This friendship is as real as can be and they would do anything for each other. They make fun of each other, as most boys do, they do rebellious stunts that can get them in big trouble, make pinkie swears, but they also care for each other in a way that you don't see in most young friendships. When they get bullied by the older kids, they stick up for each other. They have deep conversations about what they are going through with each other. For example, Teddy tries to do something crazy by standing in front of the train tracks when a train was coming, but Chris pulled him off and yelled at him to knock some sense into him. Another example is when Gordie stays back with Vern when he has to crawl instead of walk on the train tracks on a high bridge since he is afraid of heights. They all love, support, and take care of each other. In my opinion, they are only 12 and too young for some of the activities that they do. This is mainly because of the environment they are around that force them to be more mature. In the movie, they are out and about without their parents knowing or caring about where they are. They also smoke cigarettes throughout the movie like it is normal. Chris also had a gun which he shouldn't have had excess too. Them acting this way shows the difference between life back then and how life is now. The directors chose amazing characters that fit the plot perfectly. The main character, Gordie, narrates the movie from himself as an adult, telling the story of him and his friends at a young age. The character is smarter than the other boys and has better chances of a great future. The only thing is, his brother had just passed away and his mother and father ignore him now, since his brother was the favorite. Chris, who is Gordie's best friend, is the leader of the group and has a very compassionate side. He is empathic towards Gordie and is always hard on himself. Teddy has an emotional side when it comes to his father. Vern is clueless character that is brings humor to the movie. They all make fun of him but not to be mean; it's just them being friends. Each of the characters make you feel empathic towards them. They are what makes the movie so great. \"Stand by me\" brings funny and traumatic events wrapped up into a powerful movie. It truly shows the strength of how young friendships impact a person with the last line of the movie said by Gordie as an adult, \"I never really had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. ... Does anyone?\" This line woke me up to the fact of how sad growing up really is. A bond of friendship is never the same as when we are young. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and the yearn for adventure and friendship."

This movie is like a fine bottle of red wine, which only gets better with time. The acting of Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell were truly their break through roles. While River Phoenix only added to the makings of this now classic movie. This movie truly highlights the aspects of being a kid without all the sugar-coating of Hollywood. Real people, foul language(The first movie to receive R rating strictly on the basis of foul language.) and a typical summer vacation. This movie is so wonderfully none that remaking it would only be like trying to make a better mouse trap. This movie is great for both girls and guys, young and old. This movie will make you laugh, cry and will leave you wanting to go out and call your best friend from childhood."

But, because of this movie, every time I hear the song, \"Stand By Me\" I just have to listen to it. This has to be one of my favorite movies and will always be one of my favorites movies. Maybe because I, myself, had three really close friends when I was that age. It's now about seven years later, and none of us hang out anymore. I didn't think much of it at first, but after seeing this movie, I realized how much I liked them and how much fun we had. Also, after seeing this movie, I realized how sad it actually made me to know that I may never see them again because we're all going to different colleges. That's how powerful this movie is. And in the end, he realizes they were the best friends he's ever had. The acting and story is absolutely amazing. They really show how good of friends these kids are and how time and different situations in their lives can just tear them apart. I have never cried at a movie, and this is no exception. But it has brought me the closest to it. 10/10 Stephen King is a genius."

I thought it was scary. Years later, I found out that the mighty Stephen King had penned the story and it made sense. It is so realistic and heartfelt, it's hard to imagine a movie ever surpassing this one. Each character represents one side of humanity and all of them beautiful and crafted to perfection. There is never a moment in the film that pulls you out. The story is so simple, it's timeless and appealing to everyone out there with a heart. It's about growing up and and it's about childhood innocence at the same time.\n\nI get the feeling that this movie was a deeply personal project and you can tell that everyone involved took it 100% seriously. Add to all this the fact that it shares the title of the best song ever written, (in my opinion,) and what you have is a miracle of a movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more and leave the couch feeling like a new human being.\n\n10 out of 10, kids."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating-7/10\n\nStand By Me is a movie about childhood imagination and wonder, but also adolescent pranks and humour mixing it all together to create one nostalgic trip for all those who partake. It has its moments of pure fun and even a little bit of laughter plotted here and there but I did feel the film is overrated, or maybe not but in any case I found it to be pretty good and here below is just why so.\n\nLook the plot is firm and is enjoyable and the whole reason they go out on there little adventure is truly a fun time and almost thrilling at certain points. I particularly enjoyed the more sweet moments but also level with the funny bits and so some conversations can go from problems at home or school to Your Momma jokes in three seconds. It has a creative ending and a sweet finale, one which should, and I repeat should leave you with quite a little sweet feeling inside if not slightly saddened.\n\nThe star of the film is truly River Phoenix who commands and also just generally acts better than the rest, at times he even seems to control not only the other characters but the actors themselves. I wasn't too keen on the performance of Will Wheaton who although of course was a young inexperienced actor back then, still didn't have the knack for being the main actor in the story. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell complete the young boys group and I enjoyed Feldman, annoying character but acted well and he can provide some of the more exciting moments with O'Connell being almost the butt of every single joke.\n\nI think Rob Reiner works it well here and he manages to create a piece not only enjoyable but fun, but a kind of fun where it still leaves a bit of emotion to be felt for the people involved. Getting the most out of such a highly acclaimed writers book is not easy I'm guessing and the two writers and Reiner seem to bring this story more or less to life without me feeling \"maybe the book is better\".\n\nIt's a sweet bit of fun no denying and I feel it's not just a movie for kids or people who grew up in the time its set in, it also brings a true depth and for it's relatively short running time actually creates a rather slow moving but interesting plot. It isn't new ground whatsoever but with the added bonus of the what the boys are looking for, it means that in the more generic scenes, it remains much more thrilling and mysterious than other films of this type. One particular point is that the plot is not only an adventure along a train track where four guys talk the whole way, they do things and they see things which make it much more enjoyable to us and I can't deny I felt somewhat the same emotion as how the characters felt, a scene involving a bridge with a train track on and Jerry O'Connell come to mind.\n\nOverall I felt it to be as I said pretty good and I gave it a 7/10 because although it's nearly a good movie, it just isn't quite there and from what some others have said about seeing this is that it's 10/10, 5 stars etc and I have to disagree. By no means don't see it, it's well worth a look and the acting, writing and directing won't let you down too much plus Richard Dreyfuss is a nice narrator."

The boys figure if they find the body it might bring them fame and fortune and may help them to escape their dreary lives in Castle Rock.Along the way the boys discover things about themselves and realise they aren't as strong as they thought, and maybe finding a kids dead body isn't exactly going to be the trip of a life time that they had had in mind. 'Stand By Me' is a film I couldn't fault in any way and the sound track is just as good. A must see film and one the best I have ever seen."

All the boys are very different; there is at least one trait within each of the boys that everyone can relate to. This movie has a perfect combination of seriousness and the more immature and fun ways of youth. The characters deal with normal problems at the age of twelve as well as other problems like dealing with death, bad reputations and local myths. Some of the things they learn are discovered in a comical way and they learn the difference between myth and reality. The script is based on the novel \"The Body\" by Stephen King. Reiner closely follows the book but adds things here and there that make it much more exciting and relatable. The script is clever and well written. This movie is funny, emotional, suspenseful and a must see."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand by Me is a movie that made me feel good for a short while before reminding me that reality isn't fun and games like that. The semi-innocent premise of the movie is fantastic and reminds me of a lot of stupid things I and other kids in the neighborhood did to entertain ourselves. I don't keep in contact with any of them anymore but it sure is fun to reminisce once in a while.\n\nAs someone who grew in a small town in the middle of Europe, I manage to relate to every character more or less. From Vern, who's always gets picked on, and Gordy, who's older brother is looked up to more than him in the family and in the society, to Teddy, who's always viewed as a wildcard and sometimes a menace to himself and others (my behavior caused a lot of problems around that age) and Chris, who's always being judged by his past actions - this movie was like my past character mirror. Of course, it's not an exact match and I do tend to hyperbolize those experiences right now but seeing a bit of myself in those four boys just made the watching experience so much sweeter.\n\nComing-of-age movies have always been a guilty pleasure of mine that bring out a huge emotional response from me. Stand by Me, however, is different. Usually, this kind of genre makes me think something like \"I wish I experienced that in my high school years\" or \"I wish I had people like that in my life too\" but here - I thought about going back in time and just playing catch in the backyard with other kids again, going camping and trespassing in old abandoned buildings, in other words - things I've done before and have crazy warm memories of. The 80's teen coming-of-age flicks were awesome and to think that the scene had a pre-teen gem of the same genre lying over there too is fascinating.\n\nI'm glad I got to watch this film and think about doing stupid stuff without any responsibilities and worries again for almost 90 minutes, forgetting that the current reality isn't like that now before it came back hitting like a freight train."

This movie reminded two movies because of its theme. The first movie that it reminded me was the \"Sleepers\" which I believe has many commons with that one. And the second was the \"Mystic River\". I also liked very much the interpretation of the little one Wil Wheaton who played as Gordie Lachance and he was simply outstanding in his role, another interpretation that it had to be mentioned is River Phoenix who played as Chris Chambers.\n\nLastly I believe that \"Stand by Me\" shows us and wants from us to understand how important and strong are the friendships that we had when we were kids. And it wants also to shows us that these friendships can either exist until today or not."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rob Reiner has only directed twelve movies over sixteen years including one TV movie and they are almost all completely different. From A Few Good Men (1992) to When Harry Met Sally (1989) to Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), he does not seem to concentrate on one movie genre. My favorite Rob Reiner movie is without a doubt A Few Good Men (1992) and now, a close second is Stand By Me (1986) which has absolutely no link or resemblance with his other movies.\n\nThere is no kid who wouldn't be intrigued at the opportunity of seeing a dead human body. He would be even more intrigued if seeing that dead body involved a two-day trip with your best buddies and sneaking behind your parents' backs. In these kinds of situations, reason seems to escape a child and excitement takes over. This is at the center of the script of the movie. There is a second part which is not as visible at first, but when you come to think of it, it is the most important part of the script. This second part is courage. Courage of accomplishing a dream, courage of facing the truth, and courage of standing by one another. This kind of courage is what allows us to determine which of the four boys is the movie's hero.\n\nFour boys, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) decide to go searching for the dead body of a young boy their age named Ray Brower.\n\nWe find out that Gordie had a brother, Dennis (John Cusack) who was killed in a jeep accident quite recently and was very close to Gordie. In fact, Dennis plays a major part in Gordie's trip. It seems that all four boys have something that allows them to be in a class of their own. Gordie had his brother to whom he looked up to and who loved him. Chris is a kid who comes from a bad family and has inevitably turned out bad as well. He also has an older brother who everyone calls Eyeball (Bradley Gregg) and has become a total bum. Teddy's father was in the second World War and stormed the beach of Normandy, a fact of which Teddy is very proud. But his father turned bad after his return and nearly killed his son by putting his ear to a stove. His father was then sent to a mental institution. Finally, we have Vern. The only standout characteristic Vern has is that he had buried a jar of pennies under his porch and his mother accidentally threw away the map he had drawn for it.\n\nSo these four kids are somewhat special and get along great. But there is another bunch of kids in the movie. The bad bunch. This bunch includes Chris's big brother Eyeball, Vern's big brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko), his friend Charlie Hogan (Gary Riley), two other guys whose names are unknown to the viewer and finally, a seventh one who turns out to be the gang leader, a kid who everyone calls Ace (Kiefer Sutherland). Apart from being the gang leader, Ace is also the craziest and most dangerous kid in that gang.\n\nThe important part of the story is how Vern learns about the dead body. As he was looking for his pennies under the porch, he overheard his brother Billy and Charlie discussing how they found the body after having stolen a car and gone for a ride in the woods where the dead boy's body was. However, the two boys finally tell Ace and Eyeball about the body and the whole gang decide to go looking for him to become famous. But the young boys are also in the woods and this is where things get very tricky and almost deadly.\n\nThe all-star cast is probably the best part of the movie. River Phoenix is probably the one who gives the best performance as Chris Chambers, the young boy who turns out to be, at least in my mind, the movie's hero. A close second in the acting category is Kiefer Sutherland who is absolutely abominable as Ace. There are two great scenes in which Phoenix and Sutherland confront each other showing Chris's gift to be able to stand up for his friends and defend them and Ace's personality which is pretty much to take no crap off anyone and be as big a bully as possible. Reiner's direction is very good as well with his unpredictable camera movements and shots. A great movie all-around."

Small town, low population, a group of kids with issues going on an adventure. The acting is solid, in my opinion. The child actors do a fairly good job, with the late River Phoenix and Corey Feldman standing out.\n\nMy main gripe with this film is that the whole thing feels like one massive prologue, full of buildup, only to utterly disappoint at the end. It's missing the main body and the conclusion. We get introduced to the characters, with each of them being different and relatable in a unique way. We learn about the problems they have to deal with... and that's pretty much the movie. Nothing gets resolved before the credits roll. Just when things are finally starting to get interesting, the movie simply ends. We are given a sentence or two of exposition about what happens to each of the characters we got attached to, and that's it. River Phoenix and Corey Feldman's characters got such an unfair treatment due to this, that you'll stare at the screen in disbelief and just ask yourself \"Huh? That's it!? That's the end!? WTF?\". Several plot points just never get answered or elaborated upon, at all. It's just over. Fin. The end. That's all, folks!\n\nI don't remember the last time a movie disappointed me. as much as this one has. 5/10."

I recall being skeptical at first about watching this so called \"classic,\" simply because of the fact that i was an adolescent girl and not some \"young dirty boy\" taking hikes to see dead bodies and smoking cigarettes along the way. But from the minute the movie started with all the boys' playing cards in the famous tree house to the moment where Chris Chambers fades away at his and Gordie's final goodbye, I could not help but get a thousand of overwhelming emotions passing through me. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, and at times even surprised by some of the language that these thirteen year old boys were using. But that is the magic of it all. How often does a movie about pre-teen kids come along where there is no sugar coating, just a plain and real depiction of how all of us acted when we were that age. The average movie always leaves me laughing or feeling entertained for the night, but very so often a dime piece will come along that leaves you in awe feeling nostalgic for days about your own childhood. And then there are the actors - how could I possibly forget about them? River Phoenix with his heart-gripping scene about the milk money, Whil Wheaton so believably portraying a quiet and vulnerable boy who had lost his brother, Corey Feldman evoking so much anger and hurt through the words he says and the emotion in his eyes, and then Jerry O'Connell-just being plain old, clumsy Vern. Rob Reiner also did a fantastic job to have the ability to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into a heartwarming tale that still held the \"spooky\" element to it all. Filled with an outstanding cast and beautiful theme song, it is no wonder this is a movie I cannot seem to go a year without watching. It is definitely a must see for anyone who feels they want to relive their past every now and again. Like the famous quote says, \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The beauty of \"Stand By Me\" is how well it captures the small moments of adolescence, the cheap jokes, the time-wasting card games, the pet phrases of the kids you hung around with. It's not necessary for you to have spent a summer weekend on a long hike to see a corpse to relate. Hell, it's not necessary for you to be male.\n\nBased on the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" part of his 1982 collection \"Different Seasons\" (along with another IMDb top 250 film, \"The Shawshank Redemption\"), \"Stand By Me\" moves at a pace so languid it should almost be in French with English subtitles. Wil Wheaton stars as a youngster named Gordon Lachance, seriously neglected by parents in mourning for his recently killed brother. Gordie finds himself on a journey with three friends to find the missing body of Ray Brower, a boy about their age who disappeared while collecting berries, but who they hear is lying beside the railroad tracks on a back road miles from town.\n\nThis was one of those films you remember well if you were around when it came out. For a long time in the 1980s, it seemed like movies were either suffocatingly serious excursions into what it all meant with Meryl Streep debuting a new accent, or else popcorn fluff. \"Stand By Me\" was that rarity, a serious film that dared to be popular, and was it ever. Even the old Ben E. King song that inspired the title was trotted out after 25 years to become a hit again. Everywhere you went, people told you how great it was, even a professor in the middle of a lecture in my Asian history class.\n\nThe film is still great. You watch four young actors, all of whom have recognized public identities beyond the film, and still get totally submerged in their created reality. River Phoenix as Chris Chambers is the obvious leader, wearing an aura of sad maturity that you gravitate to as much as Gordie does, while Corey Feldman is perfect as buggy Teddy Duchamp, a self-deluded 'wet end' spoiling for a fight. Jerry O'Connell, the only one to transfer his acting career into adulthood, is a welcome laugh magnet as the fat and hapless Vern. They play off each other so well, you forget the E! True Hollywood Stories and just focus on the to-and-fro, hearing echoes of your own childhood in what seems improvised dialogue.\n\nWhat else is perfect about this movie? The camera work, the narration by Richard Dreyfuss, the clever use of period music, the attention to detail (like the old Hills Bros. coffee can the kids pitch rocks into at the junkyard), the pace and rhythm. The juxtaposing of the main storyline with detours like Vern's penny hunt and the sad but hilarious tale of Lard Ass Hogan is brilliant, and makes this a hard film to get tired of, no matter how much you see it.\n\nComparing this to the original King story is interesting. On the one hand, whole sections of dialogue are carried over into the screenplay without change. But there's a less rueful tone to the movie, a lighter touch that is welcome. We don't need to hear about Vern and Teddy's awful aftermaths after enjoying their company for 90 minutes, and director Rob Reiner wisely gives them somewhat happier fates. There's more joy here, but its not stupidly happy. That final line, pulled from King's text but not the end of it, brings it all back home.\n\nIf there was anything I'd change, it would be some of the adult casting, especially Gordon's father and the junkyard guy. Both overplay the hostility. There's a bit too much hugging and male-bonding (when I was a kid, this would have been grounds for \"mowing\" and an early exile), and the flashbacks with Gordon's brother are a little contrived.\n\nBut this is a great big enchilada of a movie, full of vigor and fun, and some deeper questions. What did the body really mean for Gordon and his gang? How did it change who they were, and how much were they changing already? It's like that scene with the leeches. You can see Gordon pull that bloody thing off his scrotum and think there's something being said there about the crossroads between sex and death, or else you can say 'That's one big ugly leech.' You are on the money either way. Seeing this movie makes winners of us all."

Stand By Me features a cast of future stars, all playing believable characters and personifying the kinship among the close-knit group of friends.\n\nIt's an altogether well-made film founded on great writing and direction (it's here that Rob Reiner proves his bona fides) and the journey these kids take, harrowing and enlightening in its own right, doesn't quite prepare you for the gut-punch that is the epilogue (more specifically the latter demise of a loved character).\n\nMy psyche (both the adult and immature) loved every minute of this."

It really shows these boys slowly but surely coming of age, especially when they meet up with local hoodlum Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). As is a recurring theme in Stephen King's stories, the boys come from rather unhappy homes, and the four of them getting together as a group is their only escape, which King also explored in \"It\" and \"Hearts in Atlantis\".\n\nWhile this movie is mostly serious, there is one scene that is probably there just for comic relief: the Barf-o-rama.

        "review_title": "A Real Classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Stand by Me\" is often regarded as a real classic. It is based on the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" a story that depicts four close adolescent boys who go on a quest to recover a missing boy's dead body in hopes of becoming town heroes. Even King himself has said numerous times that \"Stand by Me\" is one of his favorite movie adaptations of a book. Nowadays, it is a very rare thing to come across a movie that has such superb acting, a gripping plot, and such a wonderfully made bittersweet ending as shown in \"Stand by Me.\" Although made more than 20 years ago, this movie is so timeless.\n\nThe movie is set in the summer of 1959. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (played beautifully by River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Conell) play four very close twelve year old boys who help each other through the hard times and make the best of memories together. Gordie is the sensitive writer. He is unfortunately overlooked by his parents due to his star athlete brother's untimely death four months earlier. Chris may be the most complex yet relatable of the group all at once. He is a tough guy on the outside, who steals the milk money at school, and has a reputation of being the bad seed. Yet underneath it all, he wants nothing more than to succeed in life. Teddy Duchamp is the zany one, who can make everybody laugh without any effort. His dad \"stormed the beach at Normandy,\" a thing Teddy greatly admires even though his dad held his ear to a stove (more is revealed about it in the film). Vern Tessio is the portly kid who everybody picks on but still loves. A little bit slow and always forgetting something, Vern is a character I think everyone eventually feels for. Keifer Sutherland also does a great job playing Ace Merrill, the town bully who the four boys are constantly insulted and teased by. Although it is clear Ace will be stuck in the small town the boys live in for the rest of his life, he still reigns.\n\nThe four main boys set out on an adventure together in order to find the dead body of missing 12 year old classmate Ray Brower. At first, the viewer may assume that this adventure is solely about four kids just wanting to see a decomposing body. However, \"Stand by Me\" is far from that. The adventure is accompanied by coming-of-age revelations, emotional breakdowns, heartache, and the longing for acceptance. This is the time in which their lives will change forever. Their last real time of innocence, as the movie's tagline states.\n\nI must point out River Phoenix's performance as the troubled Chris Chambers. This was his star-making performance, and obviously for a good reason. His acting is wonderful in every aspect. There is never a scene where his acting could have been improved. It is that incredible. Not to say the other boys did not do well, because they definitely did, but Phoenix's performance stood out. Due to his surprising death in real life that came all too soon in 1993, I was left at the end of the movie thinking he could have done so many other great things with his talent. At least the world was able to recognize him as such a talented actor while we had the chance.\n\nThe music in this movie is also something to be recognized as phenomenal. It is filled with classics from the '50s that make the movie that even more unforgettable. I do not believe I have heard better-fitting music for a film ever before in my life. Ben E. King's \"Stand by Me\" is placed just at the end of the movie, and it all makes perfect sense. The song made the ending that much better. It is truly a beautiful part of the movie.\n\nAll of themes of friendship are so timeless and relatable no matter what year we are in. The acting is magnificent and is guaranteed to make a lasting impression on you. It will probably bring a tear to your eye, but I think in a good way. And it is really one of those movies you can watch over and over and never fall out of love with.\n\n\"Stand by Me\" is easily one of the best films ever made."

I hate to rain in anyone's parade, or to diss anyone's find memories, but I didn't remember this as being even partly worth of all the hype when I first saw it in the late 80s and, we'll, time has not been kind to it. There's maybe five minutes of fascination in recognising the 'stellar' cast as only kids, but in truth none of them comes of of it too well. Blindfolded or reduced to a half-hour slot it would be impossible to distinguish this from an episode of The Wonder Years or some other moral-dripping slice of small-town nostalgia.

They set off hoping to find fame, but then start to reveal their own personal secrets and the journey becomes as emotional as it is physical.\n\nIt's hard to tell if the four young actors are all geniuses or just perfectly cast, but the performances are never short of real, and if some of the key scenes don't have you choking back tears, you are without a soul."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. It's one of the movies that will touch you deep into your heart. It's what makes a movie amazing. The kids did an amazing job of acting out the characters of Teddy, Vern, Chris, and Gordie. It is an deep and does an an amazing job of reanacting the novella. The plot is amazing. It's the summer that every kid has to have. The one where the only thing that matters is being with your friends and having fun. Before everything else sets in. It tells of four best friends with all messed up family life's which mostly all they have is each other. Most definitely one of my favorite movies ever. It follows the boys as they journey to find something that will either make them or break them. What they are searching for is something that will make them local hero's. I thought that book was greatly amazing as the book. Stephen King did an excellent job on his part. But he never ceases to fail in my book. The cast was well chosen out for each part. Especially River for Chirs, and Corey Feldman for Teddy. They both did an amazing job adapting to there characters. This goes above and beyond of movies that friendship movies that go deep. Absolutely amazing."

This light hearted and a bit heart warming movie will make a beautiful and everlasting impression on your mind and may trigger some of your own (relating to and not relating to film) memories. All of this due to its superb filming location and stringed events."

Many memorable moments involving leeches, Chopper the dog, the barf-o-rama, and of course the \"traaaaaaaaain!!!\" All four kids are great in their roles, each with a seperate turn to cry at some point in the film. Although it was odd that the chubby kid (O'Connell), usually the target of criticisms most of the way, only cried because of the near death experience he had, not because of any emotional problem like the others. And despite what some say, I think the foul language used could be possible by real life boys, with my view being it depended on your upbringing. I was one of a quartet who happened to not use those words for fear of being told on, but I've certainly come across younger kids who swear pretty bad, so it all depends. But as far as the film, its certainly a longtime of fave of most."

For me, that would have been the late-1970s and the early '80s; for Stephen King, it was the late '50s/early '60s, which is when Stand By Me, based on King's novella The Body, takes place.\n\nBrimming with nostalgia, the film tells of a group of young school friends who embark on a journey to find the body of a missing child. It's a heartwarming tale of friendship, camaraderie and adventure, but also a melancholic story about the loss of innocence and the inevitability of growing older, with all the burdens that adulthood entails.\n\nExpertly adapted for the big screen by director Rob Reiner, with an excellent cast (River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss), the film should appeal to all ages: youngsters will be able to identify with the central characters, while older viewers can watch and remember with fondness what it was like to be twelve, before reality came crashing down.\n\n7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

        "review_title": "One of the All-Time Greatest",
        "review_detailed_main": "Stand By Me is one of those truly special films that really only comes around once in a lifetime. Based on the novella \"The Body\" by Stephen King, Stand By Me follows a group of 4 friends who journey to find the body of a young man who has gone missing and is presumed to be dead. It's one of those stories that has a simple overarching plot, but layers it meaningful details along the way. It's not about \"the destination\" so much as it's about \"the journey.\" In this film, you'll find some of the most powerful child acting that may ever have been committed to screen, creating both a chemistry between each other and emotionally-charged scenes that deliver in the best possible way every single time. It presents a friendship that never leaves the audience wondering whether or not it's legitimate. These kids could easily have been friends for their entire lives based solely off what you see in the film. When they're happy, the audience is happy and, when the more emotional scenes come along, the audience is in on it just as much as the kids are. The film, much like the novella it's adapted from, creates a lovable group of kids and portrays the struggles of coming to terms with mortality and the difficulties of growing up with less than supportive parents in a way that feels completely authentic. Wil Wheaton is absolutely incredible as Gordie LaChance, a wannabe writer with a heart of gold for his friends; the late River Phoenix is absolutely the standout as the rugged street kid Chris Chambers, who was given the short end of the stick as a result of his family's name and affiliations; Corey Feldman is fantastic as Teddy Duchamp, a young boy layered with personal drama that directly plays into his conflicting character; and there's Jerry O'Connell as Vern Tessio who, despite being a really good actor that fit the part really well, comes off as the cheap comic relief character. He's not exactly the brightest in the group; he's very simple-minded. Yet together they created a great group of kids that pull you into the film and hold you there from beginning to end. The soundtrack of this film is absolutely immaculate, drawing from classics from the likes of Buddy Holly and, of course, Ben E. King. It's an homage to a world of music we have all but forgotten in today's society, and it's really nice to look back on it. The soundtrack album of this film is truly every bit as good as the film itself. The score is also really well done, in particular because it knows when to be quiet. It's an easy thing to slap some emotional music over more vulnerable scenes (it creates the \"emotional manipulation\" effect), but this film doesn't do that as much as it probably could've. During some of the more emotional and iconic scenes, the film doesn't have a musical score accompanying it. You just get the very natural feeling of someone opening up and expressing their feelings to a friend, and the choice to not have music and to let that happen organically was the perfect decision, in my opinion. Stand By Me is a movie that is really meant to be experienced rather than talk about, and there isn't much I can say about it that will really do it justice, except to say that it's one of the very few movies I recommend to every single person. You need to see this at least once."

        "review_detailed_main": "Believe it or not, Stand By Me was written by the king of horror, Stephen King. Stand By Me is a great film that also shows Stephen King can write much more than horror stories. If you want to see some more Stephen King movies that aren't horror you should see The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\n\nStand By Me is a delightful and entertaining film. The basic plot is about how four middle school boys decide to go on a trip into the woods to find the body of a missing kid their age. All of the kids have troubles of their own in their life. Throughout their trip into the woods, they encounter many things that they deal with in their own way, and at the end when they encounter the biggest of them all, they realize who they really are inside.\n\nThe language might be a little bit rough for some younger kids, but I think this is an important and inspirational film that every kid should see. For all of you adults out there, this might remind you of when you were kids, and everyone out there who is a kid should see this and see how it affects you. This is a film that I'll never forget, so maybe you'll feel the same way about it."

        "review_detailed_main": "More notable for its characters (and the actors who played them) than for its story, \"Stand By Me\" is a pretty decent piece of movie-making. Taken from a Stephen King short story called \"The Body,\" the movie is a sort of coming of age story that follows four boyhood friends on a camping trip the summer before they enter Junior High. Their goal: to find the body of a classmate who is presumed dead after going into the woods to pick blueberries. The movie is a flashback. It opens with an author (played by Richard Dreyfuss) reading a newspaper account of a friend who had been stabbed to death, and from his reflections on the incident comes this account of one of their adventures. Dreyfuss continues to do voice-over narration throughout the movie.\n\nThe story isn't really what most interested me, although it does manage to draw the viewer in with characters that are mostly believable and fairly easy to relate to, all of whom have some issues to deal with, not the least of which is that they all seem to feel stuck in one way or another in this drab little town of Castle Rock, Oregon. What's most interesting though - to me anyway - is the look at some very early work by some very young actors, some of whom became very well known. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Casey Siemaszko, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack - they're all in this in the early stages of their acting careers. It's even a fairly early example of Rob Reiner's directing.\n\nEssentially it's an entertaining piece of escapism. It's pretty quick, with a running time of less than an hour and a half, and to be honest, even at that there are a few scenes that came across as unnecessary. Overall, though, I'd have to say that this is a winner. 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "As I read the other comments and think about this film's effect on me -- the fact that before I even sought out IMDb I immediately recognized the 'River Phoenix character' in my own life: a pal called Babe, whom I have tried in vain to relocate, now nearly 70 years after our 12-year old childhood days -- but yes, we had that kind of friendship, in my own recall; he gave me the confidence to fight back, against a bully, which meant a whole lot, in my young years. But what I was about to say is that I suddenly see something almost archetypal in the kind of situation recognized by so many others, and myself, as the age-12 friendship scenario.\n\nNow that I can look back over an entire life, it is possible to see the elements that seemed so distinctive at the time, and are remembered as so personal, so unique, as actually being very characteristic of a time-of-life. And to see them so uniformly recalled convinces me that this is so. We already know a few such passages: the midlife crisis, and the sentimentally romantic teenage years (as certified by the pop music that is forever afterward what we favor best and return to most). Similarly, then, is there an idealized moment directly at the crossover between childhood and being what we call grown-up.\n\nIn fact, it is the final passage of childhood, after which nothing is ever quite so wonderful. We get 'drafted by life' . . . channeled into careers, relationships, professions, family concerns, and not to forget: debts and mortgages and the passion for 'getting ahead'. But before all that begins, life has left with us something richly remembered as an idealized friendship. It is really love, however, before it becomes sexual. And that precious slice of it will always be back there as a kind of prototypical ideal, for challenging comparison with every other relationship we ever have in our lives. It's back there to model our future connections . . . for as long as we can retain the ideal. As I now see it, that's what this film, along with the comments on it, has revealed to me."

At first they are having a goodtime but then they become somewhat obsessed with seeing this corpse.\n\nThis movie was really good but I truly hate Carl Reiner.

'Gol darn you!' was mostly what I heard, with the occasional 'Dang!' and sometimes, under extreme duress, 'Dammit!' So, a possibly great story in STAND BY ME was demoted to just a good story because of the inaccuracy of the language and perversity. All in all, don't miss this one.

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand by Me is the quintessential \"coming of age\" tale, where four early-teen boys set out on an epic quest to find a dead body. Think of it as The Lord of the Rings, but with less magic and more childhood trauma. These boys hail from dysfunctional families and their home lives leave them all too eager to hike into the wilderness in search of a corpse. Fun times.\n\nNot to be outdone, a rival gang of older would-be thugs - who must've used all the Brylcreem in town - are also hunting for the body. The story is narrated in flashbacks by the most successful of the boys, who, spoiler alert, becomes a writer. This might explain why the pacing feels like it was inspired by someone trying to hit a word count.\n\nTo keep things lively, the filmmakers throw in some \"exciting\" scenes, like a near-death experience with a train and a skin-crawling encounter with leeches. You know, the kind of wholesome adventures that really bring kids together-unless they get squashed or drained first. The big climax features the two gangs squaring off in a showdown so underwhelming that even the leeches probably yawned.\n\nThe dialogue aims for realism but lands somewhere between \"awkward puberty\" and \"are they really saying that?\" It's the kind of script where you get a story about a kid \"barfing\" at a pie-eating contest and wonder if that's supposed to be the highlight. Spoiler: it is. Sure, there are a few touching moments sprinkled in, but let's face it, none of these kids are exactly Shakespearean prodigies.\n\nOn the bright side, the movie gives us a glimpse of a very young Kiefer Sutherland, rocking a bleach job that looks like it was done in the dark. It's memorable, though maybe not for the right reasons."

A fat Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix... that is already an automatic win. But then you have a non-stop run of great one-liners and comebacks that are really memorable. I now know that cool things are \"boss\", and apparently even in the 1950s people said \"douchebag\" (which I highly doubt, but I am still shocked in the 1980s that it appeared in a script).\n\nThe wraparound story is a bit odd, more or less seeming like it was just thrown in there to have an introduction. Although for the first few minutes it seems that a lawyer's death may be important, it really is not at all. But, oh well. Not all life stories are clear-cut and linear."

        "review_detailed_main": "It would seem as if Stephen King and cinema are destined to be intertwined in one way or another. In this case, Rob Reiner brings us an adaptation of the book The Body. Let's not forget he will go to direct Misery, another Stephen King adaptation in 1990.\n\nStand By Me tells the story of a middle-aged man who visits his childhood town and reminiscences of the past, particularly of a certain event that changed his life for the better - we hope -.\n\nI personally think most credit should go to Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon for adapting the play, no disrespect to Rob Reiner and the young actors, but what makes the film feel so iconic to me is the real-life conversations the kids have during their adventure, because that's exactly the kind of conversation I and my friends would have when we were around that age. Sure, some characters like Teddy Duchamp are over-the-top, but not being familiar with the source material, it's hard for me to say if they're a faithful adaptation or not, so I'll leave that to someone else.\n\nDefinitely a film that didn't resonate that much with me, but still one I can appreciate."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw \"Stand By Me\", a film of the coming-of-age experiences of four young pre-teen boys, I was in my pre-teens, trying to find my place in the world. Looks like the movie kicked me in the pants, so I could get somewhere in the world, and I thank it from the bottom of my heart.\n\nBased on the novella \"The Body\", from the collection \"Different Seasons\" by Stephen King, the story introduces us to the four main players who live in the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, circa 1959. Sensitive, wunderkind scribe Gordie Lanchance (Wil Wheaton of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\") still mourns the accidental death of his understanding jock brother Denny (a young John Cusack) while being \"invisible\" and \"a disappointment\" to his equally mournful parents; tough kid Chris Chambers (strong River Phoenix of \"Little Nikita\" and \"Dogfight\") tries to be a good kid, despite coming from a family of reprobates.\n\nWild-eyed and hearted Teddy Duchamps (Corey Feldman of the \"Lost Boys\" films) vocally dreams of army service, wanting to please his mentally unstable, abusive, WW II vet father, who burnt the boy's left ear against a hot stove, and goofy coward Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell of \"Sliders\" and \"Crossing Jordan\") who provides loyalty and comic relief to the group. He also tells them about the location of a dead boy's corpse, after inadvertently hearing it from his older scumbag brother and a friend.\n\nThis leads to a two-day trek for the four, during Labor Day weekend, through the Oregon wilderness. They seek fame and adoration, but they find themselves, especially during a dramatic moment over the corpse with a band of knife-wielding hoods, led by town bully Ace Merill (Kiefer Sutherland, who was probably practicing his future, iconic lead role on the hit, serialized TV action drama \"24\"). Growing up isn't a solid timetable.\n\nDirector Rob \"Don't call me Meathead\" Reiner (\"This Is Spinal Tap\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"The Bucket List\") hugs the Oscar-nominated adapted screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (\"Starman\", \"Mr. Brooks\") tender and tense, funny and tragic, humble and honest, beautiful and poignant, sweet and thoughtful. In their pre-teens at the time, the four players perfectly play their roles, reminding us of ourselves. Wheaton's Gordie is a reflection of me, and I decided to be a writer, after seeing the film. The pie-eating tale he tells to his buds over a campfire is a hoot and a half.\n\nHowever, it's the performance by Phoenix (who should have been also Oscar-nominated for echoing James Dean and Marlon Brando) that's forever haunting since he and his role met unfortunate demises, making the film all too powerful. Heart-breaking is the moment when he tell Gordie-crying-about a good deed he did, but goes wrong due to his family's rep.\n\nKudos have to be given to Rick Dreyfus (\"Jaws\", \"Silver City\", \"W\") who narrates the film and plays the adult version of Gordie, a successful writer with his own kid, who notes to a friend how weird he gets when he's writing. The 1950s rock music soundtrack suits the film and is enjoyable, even to those who didn't grow up in the era.\n\nThough I didn't have friends, let alone close ones, growing up because I was (and still am) a weird, \"old young man\", I look at my childhood, and like others, find it temporary. I wish my friendships were like Gordie and Chris: eternal (despite one's passing, in the case of the film). Go see this classic, even with your kid (the underage smoking and profanity were part of King's life as a boy) and remember your childhood."

Also like that film, it has attained a very good reputation over the years. This one was directed by Rob Reiner and is essentially a nostalgia piece set in 1959. It tells a very simple story about four boys who set out on a journey across country to find the body of a dead boy they have heard about. Along the way, they learn things about themselves while also having to contend with a gang of older bullies who also seek the corpse.\n\nThis is certainly a very well made coming-of-age drama. It is blessed with good dialogue and impressive performances across the board. It also benefits from having no excess fat, with a short running time that avoids any unnecessary detours. It's this very simplicity that is one of the film's strengths. Overall, this is a solid film with good things about it, with its story-line about the quest to see a dead body a somewhat unusual one but one which is strangely effective."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been looking forward to watching this film for ages, neither because I'm a hardcore zealot of Stephen King, nor I'm a passionate follower of the director Rob Reiner, to me the selling point wholly lays on River Phoenix, a gone-too-soon film star, from James Dean, Sal Mineo, to River till Heath Ledge, whose early demise inexorably grants them a more iconic perception to the mundane world than their remaining peers (sadly it is never too young to die).\n\nThe film sufficiently charts the bona fide friendship and love among its four protagonists in a simple but accessible framework, the script precisely captures the intrinsic pulse from children's point-of-view, unfortunately and unavoidably, the film itself has to face the judgement from adult's perspective (no film could limit its audience under pubescence), frequently what these kids are doing is corny and slightly obnoxious, which at any rate, exactly reflects a virtually tangible authenticity.\n\nThe affiliation among the gang-of-four is firmly portrayed by our talented young cast (with endeavored details), River and Will manifest a over-their-ages interpretation to render their characters a multi-dimensional presence; Corey and Jerry are also worthy of a two thumb up applause; besides that, an extremely young Kiefer Sutherland is the will-sales here, who literally creeps me out and unbelievably makes me like the film less by his excellent performance as the leader of the ruffians (who would imagine he could incarnate as Jack Bauer, the federal agent who saves the world numerous times in the TV series 24). By the way, speaking of Will, I really cannot believe he is the one who plays himself in the Big Bang Theory series, although I am not a Star Trek fan either, but he is undoubtedly unrecognizable."

Watching Keifer Sutherland with his overly blond, bleached hair...all I could think of is his character from \"Lost Boys.\" As one reviewer said: \"It wasn't funny, it wasn't touching, it didn't show any \"coming of age.\" Could have been better, don't think Rob Reiner was the appropriate director."

        "review_title": "A growing up film for grown-ups: a classic coming-of-age story",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Stand by Me\" is such an excellent coming-of-age story that I almost wish I'd grown up in the '50s. I can only imagine then, for anyone who has, the kinds of emotions through memories that the Stephen King novella-turned Rob Reiner film must evoke. Still, anyone who's gone through puberty can appreciate the adventuresome innocence yet underscored maturity of \"Stand by Me.\"\n\nTaking place in the summer of 1959, the film is a childhood memory retold by Gordie Lachance (Dreyfus) of when he was 12 (played by Wil Wheaton) and he and three friends named Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) journeyed away from their Oregonian small town to find a missing teenager's dead body and fulfill an absent sense of adventure.\n\nLeaving behind their troubled home lives, the boys soon discover something else when they're out on their alone with only their own decisions to guide their actions. They make these choices together, quarrel together, look out for each other's backs and bare themselves emotionally in front of one another. You get the sense that if adults took this same journey that events would not have unfolded the same, with each man looking out primarily for himself. A boy, however, has nothing but his friends to help save him from a world that wants only to swipe his innocence away. That's the real power of childhood that this story unearths as it tries to understand that golden hue over our memories.\n\nIncredible, then, is Rob Reiner's achievement at making such a mature film about so much more than childhood with only children as the main characters. He captures these young boys on camera in a way that makes them appear like tiny sages helping us make sense of our own past. Having come only from rock mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap\" at this point in his career, it's incredible the kind of performance Reiner gets from these boys.\n\nYoung star Wheaton is instantly the boy we identify with most: he's quiet, doesn't pick on anyone, but commands the respect of his friends. Feldman, child star of the '80s, sheds his nerdy \"Goonies\" character to become the daredevil of the group, which he manages to excel at. O'Connell plays the scared fat kid who gets picked on the most and Phoenix, giving easily the best performance of the four, is the tough kid with a good head on his shoulders who is really sensitive inside. There's no doubt that if Phoenix hadn't died tragically in the '90s that he would've become a major acting force as an adult. John Cusack makes a cameo as Gordie's deceased older brother and Kiefer Sutherland also appears as Ace, the leader of a gang of teenagers who are also after the body, but this film belongs to the young ones through and through.\n\nGiving the children their authenticity are writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. These are normal pre-teenage boys above all else: they fight and pick on each other, have temper tantrums and occasionally break down into tears. Beautifully constructed is the metaphor of children following railroad tracks to an inevitable and shocking discovery.\n\nStories about growing up are commonplace in Hollywood, but none will impress you like \"Stand by Me.\" It's the only film starring children that serves adults first and that places it in a folder in history where it might never be touched again. It's really a treasure of a film."

And I have seen almost all Anderson films, (I will see There Will Be Blood tomorrow) And talking about Anderson, I think that is a good example for what I'm trying to say. When I watch Magnolia or Boggie Nights, there are scenes that, I just keep silence, I don't know why. Wheter if I have no words, or I'm shocked, I keep silence for almost the entire film. And then, all the rest of the day, I think about that film, saying nothing, even thinking nothing, just \"feeling\" the movie. Well, that's the exact case with Stand By Me. I first saw it when I was like 8 years old, and I didn't catch it, I didn't like nor hate it, nothing. Just a movie. Yesterday, I bought the DVD, I saw it this morning and now I'm in silence. The story in Stand by Me is actually simple: in a small US town, end of the 50's, a small group of 12-almost 13 year old boys escape on the search of a teenager's dead body, so they can come back home and be awarded as heroes. Easy thing. Sho why is this so special? It's not the story, is the characters. Based on Stephen King's The Body, director Rob Reiner grabbed a cast of kids that, in my opinion, wheren't actors playing those characters but rather those characters in the flesh, with their pros and cons. Stand By Me is just a classic film about growing up, and if we aren't kids all."

Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell are just OK as two of the boys. Wheaton is very good as Gordy and River Phoenix is exceptional as Chris--it's sad that he ODed at such a young age. Also Keifer Sutherland is chilling as the head of a teenage gang. Also John Cusack has a good small role and Richard Dreyfuss narrates the story.\n\nThis movie perfectly captures what it's like to be a 12 year old boy growing up--the dialogue is just perfect. Some people complained about the excessive profanity in this (it IS R rated), but swearing did exist back in 1959. Well worth seeing.\n\nDon't see this on commercial TV: that version edits the language out and renders parts of the film incomprehensible."

However, I find River Phoenix definetly gives the best performance of the film. The amount of emotion and sincerity he can bring to a character at that age is remarkable. And its these deeper undercurrents that he and also his castmates can channel that makes this film. This film is what you might call 'coming of age' and is really a look at a certain stage in life. And Rob Reiner does an excellent job on conveying the particular atmosphere of this film. Everything about it from the lighting, score, design and narration adds to a certain tone and feeling to this film. Despite the fact that its protagonists are kids Stand By Me is really made for adults. Its reminiscent of childhood(perhaps the one you wish you had)and viewing it with the hindsight of the future."

As all groups of friends seem to have a leader, it seemed fitting that the smartest and the toughest, Chris got the spot.\n\nIt was great to see both sides to all 4 boys. they each had their tough outside demeanour but on the inside they were all as damaged as the other. -maybe not vern as much haha\n\nWhat makes the movie stand out as a 'Great' is that is deals with an important issue all the while showcasing the true meaning of friendship. Although i love romantic movies one of the better things about this movie is that it doesn't deal with all the dramas of girls and relationships instead it focuses on a group of friends in their youth before girls became the most important things in their life.\n\nI personally recommend this movie to everyone who has taste.

In this case, it's a story penned by renowned author Stephen King and stars the likes of River Phoenix, Cory Feldman, and Kiefer Sutherland. The movie is a coming of age story about a group of friends embarking on a trek to find the body of a decessed boy. It features themes of friendship, loss, and the pains of growing up. There are some endearing moments of comodery and lots of humorous lines that will surely conjure up some laughs. And of course, there is no shortage of crude language that I'm sure many will find entertaining. I found the movie to be decent but I was quite disappointed with many aspects of it. So many people have told me how great of a film it is and that it's a classic, and having seen certain scenes before, the movie surely did look entertaining. Now, after finally watching it in it's entirety, I can say that it's really a mediocre movie that's ultimately forgettable. I found the story to be rather shallow with poorly fleshed out characters. It has it's entertaining moments but was overall quite dull. The dialogue felt forced and was very silly at moments, to the point of being over the top. The acting from the four main characters was pretty bad. I get they are kids so I'll give them a pass, but it could have definitely been better. A lot of the humor is rather juvenile, such as the scene with the story about the pie eating contest. I felt that was something you would see in a children's movie, not since rated R flick dealing with the hardships of growing up. The saving grace for this movie is it's run time, which doesn't feel too long. Perhaps I'm just becoming more cynical as I get older, but many films that have gone on to become cult classics, I find to not be worth the hype. This one is included."

I loved so much about this film, especially the scenes with Gordie and his brother, which were so touching. Some people criticize this movie because it depicts 12 year old boys as smoking, frequently cussing, and even making a clever joke about a touchy subject. To these critics, I say, \"Nonsense!\". It's those little details that make the story so believable, and even more important, so relateable. Bottom line: this is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. Boyz N the Hood, another outstanding movie, used to be my favorite movie, but now it is Stand By Me. Now I'm off to go enjoy some delicious cherry-flavored Pez!!! Ta-Ta for now!"

The way each actor portrayed each part was extraordinary! I was amazed at the talents of each of the young actors. My personal favorite was Chris Chambers, played by the late River Phoenix. His acting was phenomenal! When he broke down and spilled out his emotions I felt his pain. Sometimes my mom will automatically accuse me of things and sometimes my teachers will and they don't even let me have a say in anything. I just get in trouble right away. It was the best adaptation of any Stephen King book I've ever seen. I give it two thumbs up."

He was apparently run over by a train.\n\nRiver Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and Corey Feldman play the youngsters and Wil Wheaton is Gordie, the narrator of the story told through flashbacks with Richard Dreyfuss taking over as the adult Gordie.\n\nThe four encounter the local bully, Ace(Kiefer Sutherland) and his cronies along the way and they also learn a great deal about each other on their adventurous quest.

        "review_detailed_main": "What's not to love about this movie? It is a truly touching film that shows what the friendships of twelve year old boys in the 50s. It shows us what true friendships should be like and what it was like to be twelve in the mid-twentieth century. I have never spoken to anyone ( anyone mature) whose life wasn't majorlly impacted by seeing this film. Even though words can't express the beauty and honesty of this film, I'll try to do my best. It is true that this film is usually appreciated more by adults, but I believe it would be a shame if children didn't see it ( to fully appreciate their childhood and friends). The film is rated R for language, some use of tobacco, and some sexual references ( not too bad). If you are worried about showing it to your children think about this: the film teaches a good lesson about life and friends; that is worth letting them hear a few bad words. I cannot express the impact the movie will have on you personally ( ranges for everyone); but it more than likely will change the way you look at life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I have taken the 10 Star reviewer recommendations on board to watch this \"unmissable\" movie and now that I have watched it I must honestly admit that I am terribly disappointed. Let me clarify. The disappointment was not about the cast or the way they performed their roles. They all performed well what was asked of them. The disappointment was due to the mediocre storyline, which again according to the 10 Star reviewers had some message in it, and that it was a masterful storytelling, and that it is one of the best movies ever made, or even the best movie ever made, an all time classic.\n\nFriendship is a state of enduring affection, esteem, intimacy, and trust between two or more people. Friendship is also a very personal thing and depending on one's own experiences of their early life years friendships, will or will not relate to the movie's storyline accordingly. If you relate to it then it's a no brainer 10. If you do not relate to it, then you'll be left searching for hidden messages whilst considering a 3, or perhaps a 4 Star rating as sufficiently generous. A childhood journey with friends and some juvenile pranks along the way. No poignant message to jump out of the movie and grab one with the intensity that strongly bonded friendships deserve. That's all folks."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't expected too much from the movie at the very beginning. I thought it was just another 80's generational movie which will not resonate too much with me. I was utterly wrong because Stand By Me proved to be a perfect trigger and gateway to memory lane. It reminded me of the famous madeleine episode in Swann's Way, Marcel Proust's novel. The novel narrator eats madeleines dunked in tea which helps him recall certain past events by triggering his involuntary memory.\n\nThe film opens with a sequence where the narrator (Richard Dreyfus) sits in a car shocked by the newspaper title of a lawyer's violent death as two kids pass by his car on bikes. The plot then turns into a childhood story, when the narrator and his friends, went to find a dead boy's body in the woods. One of the friends in the company was the earlier mentioned killed lawyer with whom he had a great relationship as a kid. Moreover, he helped him raise his self-esteem and bring back his confidence on numerous occasions.\n\nI liked the characters in the film because it perfectly depicts boys in every junior high school company. Gordie (Will Wheaton) is a smart but insecure, invisible boy. On the other hand, Chris (River Phoenix) is a rebellious, intelligent kid who has the potential to become good at anything if he could only have a good role model. Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is an ill-tempered, self-destructive, romantic kid. Finally, Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is that bothering kid who desperately wants to be a part of the group but isn't cool enough for that.\n\nThis film was fun to watch since it served as a trigger to remember people, places, activities, and games I played as a child. I was also doing a lot of stuff with kids from my hometown that I don't have any contact with whatsoever. At the time, those kids were my best friends, and numerous great memories were waiting inside of me to get back on the surface again. I love the magic of film that can make such things happen."

And soon thereafter elected it to be my favorite film of all time.The acting was of a standard I had never seen before. I mean you could really believe that they were real people, not just characters played by actors. Unbelievably talented ones at that. Stand By Me is the kind of film where you can laugh along with the characters, and cry with them to(and cry I'm sure many of you Stand By Me fans did). The kind of film that, each time you watch, you find something you missed the time before. This film reminds you that life is short, and friendships are much shorter. Most of all this film makes you believe in yourself, even though others may not."

It really is a fasinating story that you are bound to enjoy, i know i did and still do. These types of movies are always well thought out, the eighties truly was the year of the best films about.\n\nIf you haven't yet dseen this classic i really think you should, it's an entertaining, enjoyanle experience.\n\nHighly recommend!"

The acting was good although at times I missed the dialog & had to reverse the tape to \"catch\" what the boys said. My only criticism was that expressions were used that were more contemporary than the 50's, and I find it hard to believe that twelve year old living in the early 50's used so many four lettered words.\n\nIn any case, it is a good film; down to earth; excitement particularly the \"train scenes\" and a picture of North American Life in the 50's. The music was tops!"

I love the pace this film has, I love the humor, the emotion and the acting! It sure is a shame about what happened with River Phoenix.

This will always be one of my favourites, it is lacking in a few places, but it is so succinct in others that you can't really complain. It manages to get a harrowing, enjoyable, simple and beautiful story into 90 mins and is riveting to watch. No other movie has captured the essence of being twelve so well. Forget the Goonies or Home Alone or any of that other stuff, this is a kids movie and an adults movie at the same time. It taps into how you miss being twelve, even when your thirteen! The characters are seen at a time just before they lose all innocence; before women come into there lives and change everything. This is a movie that always brings a smile to your face and can be watched time and time again."

I first saw it as a twelve year old myself but never gave much thought to it. Then as a 16 year old I saw it again and never has a movie taken me *for a ride* with it ever!!\n\nI cried every one of River`s tears, laughed with every laugh, stood on my toes to push them to run faster. I felt the fear and the joy of being together with people who matter to you most at that age.\n\nIt just made me look back to my childhood as a Twelve year old. There is so much in common that it is unbelieveable.\n\nThe movie makes you realize that yes life was that great and that much fun and that is exactly how *cool* we were as kids. How we used to laugh in the amazingly similar ways, those memories, the stories, the camp fires all floods back. Its the friendships which are formed when you are 12 and the way you live as a 12 year. Stand By Me makes you feel nostalgic and yes the last monologue...I for one know that I never had friends like the ones I did when I was 12.\n\nIf you can come out seeing this movie not laughing, crying and singing with the characters and not feeling any nostalgia at all you missed out on the best times of life!!\n\nI`ll see it again and again...so should everyone.Oh how I wish I could be 12 again!"

And for some crazy reason I feel the urge to dodge train near where my dad lives.\n\nI did read the story to get more background on the characters and what happened after they went home, all I can say is Stephen King is the \"King\" :) Very good in how he describes adolesnce.\n\nI can relate to how Gordie said he never had friends like the ones he did when he was 12. I know that sounds funny since I'm only 13, but I've lost a few friends. My best best friend Jodi moved to the city, and I miss her, we still talk but I doubt if we can ever meet up again. We had some great times together, we did some stupid stuff that got us in trouble but we have memories. My friend Karina is moving next week to the \"city\", so thats another friend missing from the lunch table.\n\nFriends really do come in and out of your life just like busboys at a restaurant... <3"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a beautifully shot, very entertaining movie that everyone should watch at least once. I've given it an 8. It is also a movie which bears absolutely no resemblance to reality on any level. Loads has been said about the wonderful acting (Wheaton's and Sutherland's performances carry the movie), the excellence of the simply told story, the great one-liners, etc, so I declare that this review will focus entirely on what sucks. This is one of the cases where Stephen King, master of the dark side, whose work is sometimes but mostly not outshone by the film adaptions, was more truthful with his version.\n\nNothing very much happens that has any concrete repercussions in this movie - with one exception. Gordie persuades Chris to work hard at school. Chris does and becomes a successful lawyer. Chris dies wretchedly after being stabbed in a restaurant. The movie needn't have branded Gordie as being 'responsible', the point is not that Gordie murders Chris - the point in the original book is that horrendously tragic things have a habit of happening whatever you do. The failure of Gordie's attempt to save his friend is *the* key event of the book - which is why Vern and Ted die in that version. They don't die in the film (the correct decision), but the filmmakers totally glossed over this aspect. As a result, it doesn't remotely feel like Chris's character has died at the end of the film; we never see, say, a photo in the paper, of what he looked like grown up, and there's no sense of loss, because the movie concerns itself entirely with childhood. It would be easy to get heavy handed with this kind of thing (King, in fact, often, goes OTT in his fiction) but really, the movie treats the whole thing with kid gloves. There's no sense of the real darkness and terror of childhood whatsoever.\n\nThere are a couple of technical problems. The actor playing Ted looks too old when he's got his glasses off (he's was 14, Phoenix was 15). More serious is the cop out with the body itself - the body is not that of a child at all, he looks 15 at the youngest. This seriously reduced the emotional impact of that part of the story for me - the book was subtitled \"Fall from innocence\". If The Body itself looks as much like an adult as an innocent, what kind of falling happens? The deer scene also bugged me because I read the book first - the deer stands about three feet away from him, for God's sake! Wild animals just don't behave like that, and it wasn't necessary for the scene at all. Less important is the one fairly large plot hole: that, as Ace and co have a car, there's no reason why they couldn't just drive back into town and reveal the location of the body, get the glory, etc, long before the boys walk back.\n\nUltimately, though, this film succeeds in it's mission of appearing to say something deep in as nostalgic a way as possible. Cute children undergoing serious physical and emotional trials is one of the things the cinema was invented to depict (see Night Of The Hunter, E.T., Schindler's List, etc), and Will Wheaton's amazing cuteness is more than up to the job."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie combines the best of so many truly gifted artists. It's based on a Steven King short, directed by Rob Reiner and stars 4 perfectly cast and directed young actors. It runs the full gambit of emotion, in no way lessened by the youth of the characters of actors portraying them.\n\nNo matter what your youth was like, this movie has some of your past in it. Anger, confusion, coming of age, finding independence, camaraderie with peers, standing up to bullies (or not), misunderstood or abusive parents, and most dramatically, finding the friends who get you through whatever you may face.\n\nAnd if you have the opportunity, you should definitely view the 'featurette': Walking the Tracks. The interviews with the actors, director and Steven King are as informative and entertaining as any special feature you'll ever watch. Among other things, hearing Rob Reiner talk about how he took 4 very young and completely inexperienced actors and made this movie is a true vision into the art of being the \"Actor's Director\".\n\nThis one should be on everyone's favorite list. A solid 8+.\n\nBut that's just my two scents. :)"

The boys' relationship was amazing and so precious. It reminds me almost of my life. Me and a tight group of 6 other kids of several ages would go out all day and just explore and live it out. I relate a lot to Chris in so many ways. I really felt for him."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many years ago I saw \"Stand By Me\" for the first time. Since then I've seen it a few times and it still has more or less the same effect on me.\n\nA group of friends learn about a presumed dead boy who has been missing for several days and was last seen a few miles from their hometown. It doesn't take long or it is decided that this group leaves their homes for the trip of their lives.\n\nThe movie isn't so much about finding the body of the deceased kid, it also isn't about the trip. It actually is about friendship, growing up and how friendship and people change during certain events in their lives.\n\nAs they continue on their hiking trip, they have to deal with certain personal issues that everyone encounters in their life. By the end of the film, they haven't physically but mentally grown up because of what they experienced together... as friends.\n\nI always have been felt moved by \"Stand Be Me\" because of what they go trough and their friendship. Because the whole situation is so real, some moments do come over as a bit scary.\n\nThe ending of the movie is what's most touching. Both his character and eventually himself later in his life share the same fate. This gives the ending of \"Stand By Me\" a more powerful and emotional meaning.\n\nAlso seeing Richard Dreyfus as the grown up Gordie LaChance with his kids playing outside is powerful: kids grow up and go their own ways often 'forgetting' their friends. Even though this happens, deep inside them the friendship still goes on forever.\n\nFor their age, all 4 boys did a superb acting job. I don't think it's easy to find talented actors at that age today.\n\nMy score for \"Stand By Me\" is 9 out of 10. Superb acting, writing, directing, (touching) music, etc. If you haven't seen it, you won't regret if you see it."

Yes I saw it again and I too remembered that not too long ago, I too was like them, a boy with friends who would go to the end of the world, a boy in search of himself. River Phoenix delivers a performance that we have not seen from an actor his age. Truly splendid, leaving one to wonder what he might have achieved only he was still alive. A very poignant ending, where the actor looks back at his life down nostalgia lane and delivers a worldly truth...yes the best friends are those that we had when we were still young, free and looking forward to all the challenges the world may hold...for we were invincible then!!\n\nIts a movie you should watch and once you have you should try and relive that age once again. Its a movie which brings your inner child back. Go swimming through swamps, get bitten by leeches, run on rail tracks, taunt the dogs which chase you and most of all enjoy and relish the true friendships that you have and reconnect the ones you had forgotten about."

What a great adaptation it was of a Steven King work and BTW Different Seasons was the source book for two more successful adaptations of King's works in film: The Shawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil.\n\nThe finale somewhat mirrors what happened to the four lead actors after the movie was made, but we all know that friendships truly last forever indeed and we can always remember what it was like to had one.\n\nTo paraphrase Dreyfuss's final line: I had so many great friends when I was 12 and preparing to graduate from my school in Makati in the Philippines that I will always truly remember.

Some surprises, at least for me, include:\n\nRob Reiner and Richard Dreyfuss were friends back when they weren't much older than the kids in this movie.\n\nJerry O'Connell was scared to death of Kiefer Sutherland, which was probably on purpose, as Jerry's character was supposed to fear Kiefer's.\n\nIt was touching to hear the guys talk about River Phoenix, and amazing seeing him alive again in the music video, hamming it up with Wil Wheaton and Ben King.\n\nIn other words, I enjoyed this very much!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand by Me (1986) This is coming-of-age drama film that tells the story of four boys in a small town in Oregon who go on a hike to find the dead body of a missing child. It is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. It stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. Each has had a decent career following this movie. Unfortunately, Phoenix died at a young age. He was a genuine talent. This was one of my favorite movies when I was a child. I still watch it here and there, when the mood hits, or the internet is down. It's definitely one to have a copy lying about. The chemistry of the characters engross you into a story of friendship, the kind you miss over the years. These boys are on that cusp of being a child, and becoming a teenager. I possessed the luxury of seeing this as a child, so I will always relate. I strongly suggest this film for parents of children at that age. But it's not just for them. Adults will love this movie too. It's a perfect instance of how Stephen King can write something other than horror."

The \"Deluxe\" DVD itself was a disappointment as it even had glaring grammatical errors on the back cover. I felt a bit ripped off."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rob Reiner's Stand by Me is a wonderful, inspiring coming-of-age drama. Do not expect this film to be like a Disney film as it truly earns its R-rating. But you know, Reiner captures the essence of the teenage spirit. Humans, especially teens, curse all the time. Thankfully, Raynold Gideon's screenplay is incredibly realistic when it comes to depicting teenage friends with different personalities. I cried, I laughed, and I embraced the film. Although I was not yet born when the film was released, nostalgia hit me like a train. I was reminded of my own childhood and in particular could relate to the movie's main character, Gordie.\n\nThe film was adapted from Stephen King's novella \"The Body.\" The film's title was changed because it felt like the name of a raucous comedy or a horror film from King himself. Rob Reiner came up with the title and it stuck. King himself believed this is the first work of his that was adapted to the screen the right way. Everyone knows the debacle that was Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Luckily, King fell in love with movie and he cried. Very high praise! The film was almost cut from production. Adrian Lyne was set to direct, but he wanted to take a vacation, so he was unavailable. Once Reiner took over, the film rights were sold to Columbia. It only wasn't until the film was screened for the head's daughters that he finally decided to produce the film.\n\nEven though the book focused on four teens, Reiner made the decision to center his focus on Gordie, the quiet and sensitive kid who feels uncomfortable in his own skin. The movie then details his experiences with his three friends. Gordie was instantly relatable for me. I was that kind of kid growing up. I loved going on outdoor adventures with my buddies, and we would go on similar quests. Ah, this movie made me look back so fondly on these memories of mine. Reiner said he felt like Gordie too especially growing up in the shadow of his more famous father, Carl Reiner. Reiner previously directed the sweet comedy The Sure Thing, but he truly embraces his own spirit in this feature.\n\nGordie Lechance (Richard Dreyfuss) is a successful writer. One day while reading the newspaper, he stumbles upon a story about the death of one of his dear friends. The audience then takes a trip down memory lane as he remembers the adventures that his younger self (Wil Wheaton), Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) took in the summer of 1959. The children hear of a body hidden in some Oregon woods, so they try to find the body so they can be heroes. The main bully, Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland) also has plans to find the body and will try to stop the children. As they go on their adventures, they will learn and develop some important lessons about friendship and life in general.\n\nWhen choosing the cast, Reiner wanted to find actors that closely resemble their characters and he succeeded especially considering the body of work they produced over the years. Wheaton with his nerdy sensitivity, Phoenix with his cool, tough persona, O'Connell with his humor, and Feldman with his withdrawn, emotional attitude. The four actors were great and the chemistry they exhibited is realistic. You got the feeling that they were actually friends. Sutherland made a terrifying antagonist especially with his knife skills. As for cameos or mini roles, keep your eyes peeled for Richard Dreyfuss and John Cusack as Gordie's older brother.\n\nDid you know that this movie revived interest in Ben E. King's hit 1961 song, \"Stand by Me?\" It certainly did. The songs chosen fit the atmosphere and nostalgia factor very hard. If you want a proper coming-of-age tale that has not been watered down, this is it. Cussing and violence are shown throughout, but isn't that just part of the realistic way of growing up? At least for us normal kids? This film showed Reiner's growth as a director as he came into his own. Stand by Me is a film that is poignant, inspiring, and should be seen by all generations.\n\nMy Grade: A"

We are catapulted back to the summer of 1959 where four twelve year old boys take a trek through the Oregon back country in search of the dead body of a missing boy. The four leads have never been better and there is great support from Kiefer Sutherland. The scene where William Bronder quietens and turns the tables on the four rebellious youths by telling Corey Feldman what he thinks of his father is a scream and the best scene in the film. A modern classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, based on the novel 'The Body' by Stephen King, one of the astounding authors of our generation; comes a mesmerizing story of growing up and the emotional dilemmas in the lives of youths. Directed by Rob Reiner, this film tells the story of four 12-year old boys living in a tranquil town of Castle Rock, Oregon in the late 50s: Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), a sensitive kid who faces disillusion by his father after the death of his older brother Denny and thus, feels lonely at home; Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix), a tough, but peace-loving boy who is labeled by many as a bad kid after he was caught stealing milk money at school, and is plagued by guilt after since the incident; Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), a flamboyant young man with abusive, war veteran father who once held his son's ear to the stove, requiring him to wear an ear piece; and Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell), a down-to-earth and overly cautious kid who also deals with a rude older brother. These preteens spend their summer in a tree house playing cards, smoking, and telling tall tales, until they hear the news about a dead kid their age gone missing after being hit by a train. So the four boys set out on a quest in search of him with nothing standing their way but a gang of older kids lead by bully Ace Merrill (played by Kiefer Sutherland). This story told is from narration by an older age Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss).\n\nRarely have I seen a coming-of-age film so powerful and moving as this one. This is a rare film that dives deeply into the quandaries of growing up as a young teen, and director Rob Reiner does this exceptionally well, as do the writers. The film presents us with a story of four young teens who go on an adventure, and learn more about themselves than they ever imagine, and as story goes, we watch as witness how the lives of these kids change and how they learn the true meaning of friendship. These characters develop so well throughout the picture, and the performances these actors are so touching; it is incredibly difficult not to care for these characters. When the film hits its emotional spots, you can just about feel the emotions the characters are facing, especially, for an example, in the scene when Gordie and Chris have a gut wrenching discussion about the hatred Chris deals with after an incident school. This is such an rewarding achievement done by Rob Reiner. There are some parts that will make you laugh, then there are some parts that can have you choked up, maybe even shed some tears. Yes, as this is Rated R, the characters do use some swearing and smoke in scenes here and there, but the film presents this in a subtle way to where it is not exploitative or gratuitous.\n\nStand By Me is a riveting coming of age film I may never forget, and probably one of the most memorable coming of age films its decade. Rob Reiner did a tremendous job with the film as well as the cast who put on mesmerizing performances. This is also a film that is quite realistic that many teens could relate to in ways. If you haven't seen this film, please watch this."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Princess Bride\" and \"Misery\" are certainly great films, and you've probably heard of \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This Is Spinal Tap\", but this film right here is Rob Reiner's most exceptional. What makes this film so moving is that the audience can empathize so well with its characters, characters who feels so real because of the challenges they are facing at such a young age. We can relate to the characters because most of us have gone through some similarities growing up.\n\nChallenges such as lacking self-worth, being raised in a hostile family, and society's negative viewpoint of who you are are some of the few that are portrayed in this film. Another interesting theme I found within the film is that, yes, human beings and friends come in and out of our lives without warning, but that's the way life goes. We can share amazing, incredible moments with them, and ultimately those moments just became memories. The four friends in the movie go out to find a missing boy's body, but ultimately find so much more - their self-worth.\n\nRob Reiner's incredible direction and the performances of the four friends make you feel that the trauma and turbulence in their respective lives is real. A truly wonderful movie this is and should be applauded always, truly remarkable."

The story is touching and true and real -- about the kind of friends you have when you are a kid, when those \"best friends\" are your world. This is without a doubt the best adaptation of a Stephen King story to date (together with The Shawshank Redemption). It's a very engrossing film, very funny, but also very sad. I especially like the two scenes with John Cusack. The four young leads are all brilliant, but ever since I saw it for the first time River Phoenix's performance is the one that has touched me the most. I really don't know how to put my feelings about this film into words so I'll just say: \"Stand by Me\" is brilliant, if you haven't seen it I feel sorry for you. (9/10)"

And I was in no way disappointed.\n\nThis is the story of 4 kids, on one last adventure before they are forced to grow up and move on with their lives. They all have/had misfortunes in their lives.\n\nThere's the protagonist of the group, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), who is telling the story. Gordie's brother, Denny (John Cusack) had died the year earlier, and Gordie's parents still haven't accepted the loss, making an impact on Gordie.\n\nThere is the mean kid with a soft heart, Chris Chambers (River Phoenix). Chris is pushed around by his brother, Eyeball (Bradley Gregg). People assume that because Eyeball is bad, that Chris is automatically bad as well, and Chris gets blamed for things he doesn't do.\n\nThere is the \"Joker\" in the group, Teddy Duchamp. Teddy admires his dad for storming the beaches in Normandy back in WWII. However, Teddy is also plagued by the fact that his dad is in the \"looney bin\".\n\nFinally, there is the \"pushover\" of the group, Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell). Vern's only misfortune is that his friends don't respect him at all. He is always the butt of the jokes and whatnot.\n\nThe story is moderately simple but entertaining enough: Vern is under his porch and he hears his older brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko), and his friend Charlie (Gary Riley) talking about the dead body of Ray Brower, a kid from school. Apparently, he was hit by a train and his body left in the woods. Gordie and his friends hear about this and set off to find it. However, Billy and Charlie tell Ace Merrill, the leader of the group, and Ace wants to find the body before Gordie and his friends do. Its a race between the 2 teams to find the body, Gordie's group walks the railroad tracks and cuts through the woods, while Ace's gang take a car. Along the way, Gordie's gang share memories, go on mini-side adventures, and just be kids for the limited time they still can.\n\nThis was a very moving story. The characters the plot, the music, the atmosphere, all authentic and nicely done. If only all childhoods were this interesting. Oh well, one can dream, right? 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The premise of \"Stand By Me\" is a rather simple one. A group of four tightly-knit friends living in a small Oregon town, circa 1959, set out on foot to find a dead body. What could easily have been a routine Stephen King horror show is instead an often touching and nostalgic story about the purity and innocence of friendship before the teenage years and adulthood sets in and sours the deal. Director Rob Reiner's best film by far, the subject matter will hit close to home to anyone who has ever had close friendships that crumbled before their time, regardless of what you went through together.\n\nIt helps that the actors who portray the foursome \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell and the later River Phoenix \u2013 are about as natural as they come and have seemingly strong chemistry with one another. Watching the story pan out, you truly believe these friendships are real, and for such young actors, they manage to handle the tender and emotional moments of this 90 minute film quite well. The most notorious performance is that of Phoenix, whose budding career was tragically cut short when his life met an end eight years later at the hands of a drug overdose. While Phoenix manages to steal the show away from the lead, Wil Wheaton, it must be noted that the ensemble as a whole did an outstanding job. Heck, if Corey Feldman can make you like him in any film, you know an actor and their director have done their jobs right. The film focuses strictly on these four, with minor characters popping in and out of the past and present, and if the cast wasn't so strong, the movie would have easily fallen apart at the seams.\n\nWith such a small running time, you'd think that the film is rather shallow, but such is not the case. Although more could have been expanded on (possibly this film's only true flaw), the story flows naturally as you share the ups and the downs with its characters. \"Stand By Me\" is a true classic in every sense of the word. It's got a significant amount of nostalgia, and it also has a bittersweet edge, both for its downbeat but true to life ending and for anyone who has lost similar bonds in their lives. The last lines of the writer in the film rings truest and sums up the film nicely: \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "If you were ever a 12-year old boy, especially around the 1950's or '60's, I don't see how you can help but love this movie. For me I was won over when the four youngsters set off on their adventure to find a dead body and broke into the theme song from the old western, 'Have Gun, Will Travel.'\n\nNo other film I've seen has presented the pain and pleasure of adolescence so vividly. Some of the scenes hit such raw emotional nerves that they make you cringe, not with embarrassment, but with recognition. The friendships depicted between the boys are as intense as any they'll ever have in their lives, although they may only last a year or two more. Director Rob Reiner, working from material provided by a master storyteller, Stephen King, has made a truly touching movie, showing us truths that every viewer will feel in the heart and in the soul.\n\nThe four young actors at the center of the film (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell) do a great job of depicting characters that almost everyone can relate to. Kiefer Sutherland is outstanding as a menacing juvenile delinquent who may stir up some nagging memories for anyone who was ever terrorized by a bigger, stronger kid. This is a film Reiner can be proud of and which compares favorably against the very best."

I am far too young to have been from the 1950's growing up, and even far too young to have seen this movie when it was released- so I guess many may wonder why this one resonated with me so much. I grew up largely afraid, alone, friends came and go and for a little while there I had a small group of close friends I really enjoyed spending time with. We all ended up at different schools, in different lives, with very different opinions, and many different preferences. There probably won't be a time where we all stand in the same room again, but I have those memories- and nothing has ever captured that bittersweet feeling more than this movie. People, especially adults, never truly realize how lonely it can be being a kid- and its heartbreaking to see that this is the same throughout 3 completely separate generations. Wherever we fall in age, gender, race, or conformity, I think I will look back at this film- and know that at one time we were all just little kids like them- eager and afraid- and maybe, we are all still that way. Even just a little bit.\n\nMy Rating: 10/10."

We could identify with all the characters.\n\nI have never before seen such a cast of young talents. Even though this is Gordy's story, (played perfectly by Wil Wheaton) the real scene stealer is River Phoenix. He portrayed his characters pain and difficulty by his eyes and the way he delivered his lines. It was clear to the audience that he wasn't a bad boy but just a kid longing for attention. Jerry O'Connell was fabulous as Vern and Corey Feldman delivers possibly the best performance of career.\n\nThis movie will make you laugh and cry and re-awaken your heart. Don't miss it!"

It holds a special place in my heart, especially the unfortunate fact that not only did actor River Phoenix die in the movie, but in real life too! If you've never seen Stand By Me, I highly recommend seeing it uncut instead of watching it on a channel like AMC. Not because of the profanity itself, rather because you need to experience what these boys truly said to each other and how it relates to their emotions so you can fully grasp what the movie's message is all about - how short life really is. I think the saddest line in this movie is when the Writer (Dreyfus) talks about how friends come in and out of your life like \"bus-boys in a restaurant\". Man, that is very true and very sad to think about. I've been trying to find a best friend I knew when I was 12 and to this day, I cannot locate him. For all I know, he could be deceased. I also used to walk with childhood friends along a railroad track near my grandmother's house in the summertime, so that part brings back fond memories too. The Stephen King novella Stand By Me is based on is also very emotional and I recommend reading it first to get a taste of what Reiner's film will be. It's unforgettable and timeless. Plus, I guarantee your eyes will leak tears by the end credits."

Anyone who has watched The Princess Bride and this movie would agree that the late 80's was Reiner's golden years. Most notable of the names in the cast is that of the late River Phoenix, in one of his first film roles. The story revolves around four 12-year-old boys living in the small town of Castle Rock. They set out to find the corpse of a missing child and in the process build brick by brick a friendship that transcends all kinds of relationships. It makes you look back on the past faces that have come in and out of the pages of your own life. The last line of the film is considerably one of the best lines in the history of cinema. \"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?\" Recommended for children of all ages.\n\nhttp://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews"

I hate to say any one of the actors steals the movie as all of the young cast are superb, but Pheonix is the star of the show. he was always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. His death at such a young age was tragic. One can't help but wonder what other wonderful films we may have missed out on. Sutherland is perfectly cast as the bully. And I need to mention Dreyfuss's voice over. His delivery is superb.\n\nThe full soundtrack is excellent too, not just the title track, the score is another valuable asset to the movie.\n\nSimply Rob Reiner could not have made a better movie."

Stand By Me is a drama based on a short story by Stephen King. Although there are alot of very humorous scenes(Lard Ass story, the comb, the conversations around the campfire) there is alot of depth and meaning. The moral of this movie is: You have many friends along the way but none as memorable as when you were a child. Stand By Me is about 4 boys in a small town Oregon called Castle Rock. There's sensitive Gordon, misunderstood Chris, rambunxious Teddy, and scaredy-cat Vern. On the last days of summer the 4 boys go out and search for the body of a missing kid. Along the way the discover about life and each other. There aren't enough stars to rate this movie!"

Throughout the journey, they learn more about themselves, dealing with adversities and friendship.\n\nSet in 1959, this film gives off a wistful and nostalgic atmosphere of the good old and bygone days. Even if the four friends' goal is to locate a missing body, something that is no less ghastly, the plot's centering around the friends' bond and life challenges gives off a taste of innocence and courage. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell all did an excellent job portraying the four friends, showing off their young-at-heart vibes but also showing that they're mature enough to face down life's adversities, from dealing with their dysfunctional families to standing up to a gang of punks headed up by a young Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nIn watching this film, you will feel sentimental, yet optimistic, and you will also feel a sense of adventure and humor where appropriate.\n\nGreat cinematography from Thomas Del Ruth, capturing a nice 1950's aura, and great direction by Rob Reiner, keeping the plot engaging and well-paced. This film really reminds you of the sadly bygone days of America's innocence, but also offers a ray of hope for the future generations. From the film's title to the song of the same name sung during the ending credits, this adds onto the very heartfelt drama this film offers and is a movie that one should see.\n\nGrade A"

The one last adventure, and on that adventure, they discovered more about each other and themselves than they could have in a lifetime.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has its own pace and the greatness of this film lies in the fact that it has one of the simplest plots yet the story telling is magical.\n\nIts about 4 close friends Chris, Vern, Teddy and Gordie who adventure out one day for an event they considered very important and life changing for themselves. During this adventure there are quite a few priceless moments that they share but few of them are pure GOLD like the camp-fire scene.\n\nIt also has a great scene towards the end between young Gordie and Chris, which I absolutely loved. That brings me to the brotherhood Chris and Gordie shared, special mention of River Pheonix here, he played Chris and was truly amazing. Chris' character was the best according to me and the special relationship he shared with Gordie is very pleasing and heart melting to see. Almost everyone had friends like these when they were young {may not be exactly 12 years old} BUT thats not the point, We all had our special few before adulthood. Those days were really something else...All the irrelevant things now were very important then. Life was full of fun and carelessness.\n\nOne point that instantly put this film on my favourites list is its ending. There are usually two kinds of ends to a film, one the satisfying/predictable and the other is shocking/unexpected. But this film has what I call the perfect ending. The last monologue was so true that I was amazed at its truth value...You will understand what I'm talking about once you see it {I don't want to spoil it for you}. Quite astonishing end and one I'll remember for a long time.\n\nGreat, and a classic coming of age film that everyone will enjoy. If it had not shown young characters smoking I would've given it 10. But that doesn't take anything away from the film, its just that I didn't enjoy watching them smoke {I hate people who smoke...I know they probably faked it but the scene was not required IMO}.\n\nI give this a 9.2/10"

Better than \"Now and Then\" (which was great also) which followed ten years later!"

Wanting to be heroes in each other's, and their hometown's eyes, they set out on an unforgettable two-day trek that turns into an odyssey of self-discovery. They sneak smokes, tell tall tales, cuss 'cause it's cool, and band together when the going gets tough.\n\n\"When they encounter the town's knife-wielding hoods, who are also after the body, the boys discover a strength they never knew they had. 'Stand By Me' is a rare and special film about friendship and the indelible experiences of growing up. Filled with humor and suspense, it is based on the novella 'The Body' by Stephen King,\" according to the DVD sleeve description. The adaptation, by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A.

The protagonist's dead brother haunts the film.

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1986 I was 10 years old, and I watched this movie for the first time. I remember thinking that it was cool to see a dead body on the screen, but that was about it. It's now 14 years later, and I have again watched Stand by Me, and I now understand what the movie is saying.\n\nIntensely narrated by Richard Dreyfuss, Stand by Me is a coming of age story for 4 adolescents at the end of their summer vacation before starting junior high school. A very young Jerry O'Connell (Joe's Apartment & Varsity Blues) plays Vern Tessio, the nerdy fat kid that every group of friends has. River Phoenix (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade & Sneakers) plays Chris Chambers, the `leader' of the group who has many problems with his father and is always looking for something adventurous to do. Teddy Duchamp, played vividly by Corey Feldman (Dream a Little Dream & License to Drive), has his own problems with his father, whom tried to burn his ear off for drinking bleach under the kitchen sink. This group of misfits is all bound together by the smartest of the group Gordie Lachance. Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), in his first starring role and his first movie in over 2 years, masterfully combines fear, excitement and sorrow in this role. Gordie has just recently lost his brother, whom he really loved, in a jeep accident and his parents seem to have never let go, and tend to ignore him now. Before Frank Darabont got a hold of Stephen King's novel \u0091The Green Mile', Rob Reiner was given the chance to bring King's short story \u0091The Body' to the big screen. I have never read it, but I do know that Reiner did a fantastic job directing the large body of actors and created a movie experience that should not be missed be any 12 year old, or any adult for that matter.\n\nThe movie follows the group of kids as the venture to find the dead body of a boy that has been missing for weeks. Vern hears a tip of where the body is, and tells the others who all agree to spend the next couple of days finding it. Throughout the whole trip it seems the 12 year olds do a great deal of growing up mentally, and begin to realize that they wont be together forever. There are some very funny scenes, the pie-eating contest quickly comes to mind, and the film loaded with some great actors early on in their careers. Some great performances by Keifer Sutherland and John Cusack round out the cast.\n\nThe message I received from this movie is that no matter what happens, your friends will always be there for you, and you should never forget them. I hadn't watched this movie in years; and now that I have, I will most certainly add it to my collection."

Plus, tell me another film where you get the chance to see so many young talents get together before some elevate to stardom and others fade away? Stand by Me includes young Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Kiefer Sutherland (24), the late River Phoenix, 80's child star Corey Feldman (Gremlins, The Goonies), as well as Richard Dreyfuss and John Cusack. Director Rob Reiner's assemble cast tells the story of friendship, childhood and death and stays with you long after you finish watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a fan of Stephen King's novels, it was so important to me to view Stand By Me, a masterpiece both in film and literature. Stephen King is a phenomenal fiction writer and his novels Salem's Lot, It, The Shining, and, of course, Stand By Me, all of them being a film as well, scared the crap out of me while the film I am reviewing now, offered a sense of nostalgia and happiness mixed with a variety of emotions . It has been reported that Stephen King cried after seeing this film because it is the closest adaptation ever to one of his novels and I have to agree to that. Rob Reiner will be remembered as the man who made Stephen King cry and also for making a perfect piece of film making that will be remembered as long as humanity is in existence. The performances from Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell were the best in the whole film and not one of them I mentioned have ever stepped out of line or have made mistakes. The bad actors were Kiefer Sutherland, his bad boy acting was uncool and uncomfortable, and his whole stupid gang. They looked crap and acted sh*t. Pardon my French! The best character in the film was Vern because his humor, appearance, and his stupidity was enough to set the screen on fire. Hot! Hot! Now look at him, all bone and serious! Yuck! To be honest, I was expecting a boring old-fashioned film that would be in the bottom 100 but, boy, was I wrong. I loved it so much that it belongs in my personal top 100. The other lovely thing about this is the nostalgia it offered and it was one of the reasons why this earned a straight ten from me. I was about nine when I watched this and couldn't understand most of it but three years later after watching it again, I loved it! I could go on forever about how good this movie is and that is exactly what I am going to do. So if you hate long comments, dismiss reading this for any further and goodbye.\n\nFour f*cked up kids, who smoke, play poker, talk about pornography and a lot of other things, set out on a adventurous-filled journey after hearing news from a friend about a dead body somewhere outside of Maine. Their journey will be hard and secrets will be out as the foursome go through many hard and dangerous tasks. They think that after finding the body they will be famous and successful but they aren't the only ones who are after the body. A gang of bullies, led by Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), also find out about the body and it is only a matter of time before one of them reaches it first. And if one of them find it, what will happen next? The story's protagonist is a twelve-year old (I think) kid named Gordie Lachance, whose family is torn apart from his brother unexpected death, and his adventure with friends that changed his lives. His story is important and it sends out a message to everyone: there are no friends like your childhood ones. The film could have not succeed without a bold story like the one in this film. It most certainly would not!\n\nNote: SPOILERS FROM HEREON IN!! There are many exciting scenes that contain humor in this film and all of them are wonderful. I still remember the train scene out of the entire movie because it looked so real yet so funny. Vern trying to crawl across the tracks had me in stitches and his chubbiness made it even funnier and I almost screamed as they were going to get hit by the train but thankfully they jumped . Classic Vern! There was another scene where Gordie tells the bunch a story about Larda$$, a fat-A$$ who wanted to get revenge at a pie eating contest by puking on the audience, and that was a classical scene as well. There were some parts in the film which were somewhat disturbing, for instance, when the group have leaches stuck on their bodies after trying to cross a pond but that wasn't disgusting. A leach stuck on Gordie's balls was the disgusting bit and the blood on his hands made more of an effect. The thing that Stephen King is so good in is making fun of his writing, e.g. Gordie says, \"F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!\". The film will be incomplete without the 50's soundtrack that made the film more like the date it is set in. The film didn't even win an Oscar, which it should have, but it is a fantastic film nevertheless and will be enjoyed for generations to come!\n\nP.S. Do Not rent this but buy it because a film like this deserves to be in every DVD collection and if you have viewed this film once, view it again and again and again. Did I leave out a again? Well that was my review, to read more click my name which is highlighted in BLUE.\n\n\"Over and Out.\" 25 January 2010."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first watched this movie with my best friend on August 22, 1986 at the Cortana Mall Cinema in Baton Rouge, LA. Not only was that the day it went into wide release, it also marked my friend's 18th birthday and I suggested watching this after spending some of that day at the Fun Fair Park amusement ride area. So the place was crowded by the time the movie began. There were plenty of laughs during much of the narrative and I remember being touched by some of the more emotional scenes. I don't remember if my friend liked it as much as I did (the only time I even remember him saying anything during the picture was during the scene after Will Wheaton's character shot the gun in the air and when he pointed it at Kiefer Sutherland's bully character, my friend said, \"Kill him!\"), but he must have still been in a good mood because we went bowling afterwards at Don Carter's. Anyway, I just watched it again at the Perkins Rowe Cinema today-since it's celebrating its 35th anniversary this year, it was only playing at 7:00 this evening-and it's even better than ever! I mean, besides Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and River Phoenix are aces as the four near-teen boys on their journey to find a dead body who was close to their age. And Kiefer was sure very effective as the bully, wasn't he? And kudos to Rob Reiner for truly understanding what it's like to feel so insecure while growing up with not-so-perfect livelihoods. Stephen King was so touched, he considered this one of the best of films adapted from his work. So, yes, I very highly recommend Stand By Me. P. S. When just watching this right now, I could've swore that one of the bullies surrounding Kiefer was also one of the bullies that surrounded Thomas F. Wilson's Biff Tannen in the first Back to the Future during that movie's '50s sequence. Sure enough, that bully that was in both this and BTTF was one Casey Siemaszko!"

It shows River Phoenix at his best and only illustrates what a loss he was to the movie business. King is difficult to adapt as a rule because his stories are often based on a supernatural premise which never quite works on film in the way it always works in the books. Stand by Me was a short story (called The Body) in the book Different Seasons, which was my introduction to King and began my love for his writing. It also had Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption as one of the four excellent stories. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in this terrific movie as does Richard Dreyfuss though their parts are small. As an evocation of kid's lives and relationships it is practically perfect, which is a testament to the writing,acting and direction of this film."

Using childhood was quite an effective way to portray that hope can always be found despite the circumstances. It allowed the viewer to see that no matter where one is in life, we are all in the same boat together, and sometimes during the hard times in life, that is when the best of friends can be found. I recommend this movie. It is very memorable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age movies set in a small American town of the 1950's. The period details are excellent and the story of a band of friends about to enter their teens is very well told. Stand By Me is one of four novellas of Stephen King's Different Seasons. The other two that were filmed were Apt Pupil and The Shawshank Redemption. As I recall, Stand By Me is quite faithful to the original story (The Body) which was very well told. I think the direction and the casting are the real coups that make the film such an endearing classic for many.\n\nBefore seeing Stand By Me for the second time after a decade and a half, I got to see River Phoenix again. Any misconception I had that he was an unjustly famous teenage star who was into sex, drugs and partying has been dispelled. Even at the young age of 15 years, he gives a thoroughly assured performance bringing into play a range of emotions. There is no doubt he would have gone far if his career hadn't ended with a fatal drug overdose. The rest of the cast is routinely excellent as well and the humor is very good, albeit shocking to see the extra-curricular activities and language of pre-pubescent boys from the 1950's - smoking and some foul language.\n\nStand By Me is a very good film for most viewers and I can't understand it being a great film for people who came of age in the 1950's US."

I was motivated to see it because I am a huge River Phoenix fan (not those dorky obsessive kind haha) but I got so much more out of it. The acting from these kids was absolutely breathtaking; they each portrayed their characters wonderfully. It was a good start for all of them. Since I am a girl and never really felt the \"12 yr old boy friends\" I didn't think it would relate to me as much but I was very wrong. The imagery was beautiful and it was somewhat believable. The jokes made me laugh out loud, all alone, in my computer room (I am listening to it behind this window as i type); especially the scene where Gordie shoots the garbage can and the jokes about the peoples \"mothers\" are hilarious too I make them all the time and I thought it was some new age thing but guess not! This is a 10 star film, no doubt, and completely worth seeing. I liked it more than the Godfather even. The language, even though people have found it too over-the-top, was hilarious. It's hilarious hearing these 12 yr old boys telling each other to f*** their moms because I've heard it all before and it's even funnier on camera. PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"

I didn't grow up in the time frame of this movie, but I still felt a nostalgia for small-town life in the fifties. If I had to recommend one movie for everyone to see at least once, this would be the movie. And for anyone who thinks this is a movie about kids finding a dead body, think again: instead, this is a movie about kids finding out about themselves and the adults who have made differences, good and bad, in their lives."

What we see at the beginning are 4 simple, stereotypical characters; the smart one, the leader, the scared one and the funny one. However, throughout the course of the film we discover that the depth of their character runs deeper than anyone could have expected, as the boys travel further away from their suffocating home town, they're forced to reflect on their own reality."

It is, as others have said already, a classic.\n\nAs a fan in general of River Phoenix, I like especially to watch it every year around Halloween (or All Saints' Day, Nov. 1, for which Halloween is the vigil) in commemoration of his untimely death on Oct. 31. The enveloping setting for the film is the recollections of the grown-up writer Gordon LaChance of his close childhood friend, Chris Chambers, on reading in the newspaper of his sudden death. It is especially poignant to watch on the anniversary of the death of the actor who played Chris.\n\nI would like to share a very touching and thought-provoking anecdote told by the author of \"Lost in Hollywood\", a biography of River Phoenix. During the filming of every movie in which he starred, River attached himself closely to someone else involved as a mentor and father figure. In the case of Stand by Me, this role was played by Robert Reiner, the director (who had wisely prepared his four principals before screening with adventure-wilderness-type activities of the same kind, in order to get them to \"bond.\" It worked!)\n\nDuring several takes of the \"milk-money\" confession scene, River had been unconvincing. Then Reiner asked River to think of a time in his own life when an adult had betrayed him. The result is what we see now-- what turns out to be one of the climactic moments of the film, although perhaps it needn't have been. And the biographer says that when the cameras stopped rolling, River's tears didn't. He kept sobbing and crying uncontrollably, until Reiner comforted him in his arms. Heaven only knows what had happened to River that he was recalling in that scene, but whatever it was was real."

The plot revolves around Gordie, an adult now with kids of his own, writing about the summer when his group friends found out about the location of a boy's dead body, a boy they all knew. Believing that it's what will bring them at least local fame, they set out to be the first who discover it, in the end competing with a much older gang. Stand by me is one of those movies that, no matter your gender, how old you are or how many times you've already seen it, it moves you. It makes you think of your childhood friends, the ones you haven't seen or heard in a long time and wonder if they think about you too, from time to time. The summers you spent in their company, playing or searching for a grand new adventure or when the adventure found you. This movie has those type of characters that are easily to relate to, even as a grown up. A brilliant masterpiece with heartwarming insights , the ecranisation of Stephen King's novella \"The Body\" will stand the passing of time because in every generation, there will be people who would find a bit of themselves in it. I give it 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern \"coming of age\" Dramas seem to display notions of people under 15 years of age being innocents, free from corruption and unaware of tensions between associates of different sexes. Then along comes a catalyst in the shape of going to high school, making a new friend etc. and all of a sudden a child becomes an adolescent, free from illusions and aware of adult issues. Usually the \"coming of age\" drama is focused around these issues; of first noticing the opposite sex, of the discovery of a \"generation gap\" between the subject/s and their parents/guardians, of the discovery of swearing and drinking and occasionally drugs. The thing I liked about this movie is that it highlights the fact that awareness of these issues does not come exclusively with puberty. The characters in this movie smoke, swear, tell dirty jokes, discuss sex, and hate their parents all before hitting their \"Teens\". It shows that it is naive to assume that it takes 15 years for a child to realise that there is a \"generation gap\" existing in their household. It also displays an underlying concept that many children are capable of acheiving personal skills that many adults are incapable of; that is the ability to make decisions and stick to them, the ability to lead a group, the ability to take care of themselves, and the ability to problem solve within a group. This concept, that many children depend on their parents for economic support more than emotional support is an edgy one and one that forces veiwers to redefine their mental image of the \"child\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is really beautiful and is really a timeless masterpiece. Stephen King is known for having really interesting and developed characters in his novels and I think this is one of the best adaptations of one of his book that has ever been made.\n\nIt basically tells us the story of a group of four kids that start a journey looking for a dead body of a kid that is somewhere around the woods. But this is just the surface of the story. In fact is a story about the childhood, the friends and the innocence. Is a story that we can relate to easily, because we all have been childs at some moment and we had very good time back then, just playing with our friends, with no bigger worries than what kind of animal is Goofy, or what food would you choose if you could just pick one in the world.\n\nThe four kids are so great and the actors were perfect in the roles, like you really feel their friendship, their connection, their support to each other, but also you can see yourself grinning from the jokes they make, because they take you back to those moments with your friends in the past. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Conell are really great in the movie and they provide most of the comic moments. But the true starts in here are Wil Wheaton and specially river Phoenix. They both have some very emotional scenes with each other that brought a tear to my eye more than I expected.\n\nThis movie has one of the most iconic shots in film history. The kids walking down the train tracks just singing a song with no worries at all. Some of the shots were stunning and really beautiful to look at and the movie has a really great soundtrack full of great hits from that time.\n\nThis is a movie that I think everybody could enjoy. I think this is in a more personal way but this movie touched me and made feel a bit sad and nostalgic about those lost moments in the past, but also made me happy because I was lucky to live that and to have really great friends. And I think I have never had any friends like the ones I had when I was twelve. But Jesus, who does?"

River plays Chris Chambers, probably the most interesting character next to DuChamp's and Ace's. River plays this character well, and so do all of the other actors in their roles.

All of them have that great thing to them that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Some people may like this feeling, others not. But, almost every person that I know has seen STAND BY ME and has enjoyed it immensely. Thank you Rob Reiner. The cast includes many great actors (only younger) such as Wil Wheaton (PYTHON), Jerry O'Connel (SCREAM 2), a much younger Keifer Sutherland (A FEW GOOD MEN) and the late River Phoenix.

Stand by Me is the epitome of everything that being young represented. The viewer is taken back to when they were young and whilst watching the film they also watch their past through the memories the film forces through, all from the relationship with your best friend to the fact that some friend do just become another face in the hall, even though you grew up and matured together. the whole experience forces you to watch it again and again even though every time it makes you sadder and sadder. its an extremely powerful film with 4 great actors acting superb. just wish there were more like it. 10/10"

After watching this movie, River Phoenix's death was so much closer to the bone, he could've been larger than life and to me, and i bet lots of others, he already was in his short time on the earth. Wil Wheaton was the most adorable thing in the world in this movie and having seen picture of him today, he hasn't lost that cuteness he had in '86. Corey Feldman, awesome, just great, i wish he would appear in more stuff today, \"The Lost Boys\" and \"Stand By Me\" make you love him soo much, he just attaches to you. The characters are so real even if you're a girl, an adult, or a boy with a childhood exactly like this. The characters are so real, so undescribably cool and soooooo well portrayed. The actors are even more lovable because they are close to their characters, Rob Reiner (director of Stand By Me) says you must cast them that way because they have not \"developed the craft [of acting].\" So they really are like that!! It makes me so happy to know those guys are so real, very comforting in this new world of mondo-commercialization."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rob Reiner is in my opinion an underrated director. Apart from \"Stand by me\" (1986), the film this review is about, he made other marvelous films such as \"When Harry met Sallt\" (1989), \"Misery\" (1990) and \"A few good men\" (1992).\n\n\"Stand by me\" is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel (just as \"Misery\") whose original title was \"The body\". I understand the decision of Reiner to change the title. \"The body\" would have evoked an association with rancid coming of age films, a genre which the 1980s were already full of.\n\nThe new title is derived from the (very good) 50's soundtrack, but it contains also an ironic undertone. The film is about a couple of boys, about 12 years of age, at the end of the elementary school. Next year they will go to the high school, and due to differences in intelligence it is already obvious that they will go to different schools and not stick together.\n\nDuring the adventure where the film is about they are however still together. In fact by revealing their most intimate secrets to each other they grow closer and closer to each other. In this respect the film resembles \"The breakfast club\" (1985, John Hughes), the other excellent teenage movie from the 80's.\n\n\"The breakfast club\" is about 16-18 years old, in \"Stand by me\" the characters are some years younger. In \"The breakfast club\" the group consists of individuals of different social or political background, in \"Stand by me\" the group consists of individuals who, for some reason, are not popular guys. Being among each other they loosen up and are not afraid anymore to tell what really moves them.\n\nIn my opinion \"Stand by me\" is the best coming af age film of the eighties. It has a moving story, a pleasant soundtrack and the landscape from Oregon (not the mostly filmed State of the USA) is beautiful after all."

Indeed, even adults, as portrayed variously by the junk-yarder and his dog, and those at the pie-eating contest, are no more than grown-up teenagers.\n\nWhy is meth so pervasively destructive in rural counties and states from Kentucky to Kansas? Why are mass shootings disproportionately a suburban/rural phenomenon? I don't won't to cross the line here, but Stand By Me, while undoubtedly poignant and innocent, is deeply unsettling to me, simply because of that which made it great."

You end up with a feeling of closeness to this band of four friends while at the same time really building a resentment towards the group of older good for nothings(with Kiefer Sutherland playing a fantastic bad guy). River Phoenix, for me, was the most outstanding actor in this movie, at times it was really hard to believe how mature his acting style was.\n\nThe movie is also shot very well with Rob Reiner doing a brilliant job of shooting every scene so that you are drawn into the action and really feel that you are along with the characters on a great journey both physically and emotionally. The back drop to this whole movie is also visually stunning.\n\nWithout going too much into the story as to spoil it, you can expect moments of action, suspense, heart warming stories and characters you will fall in love with, this movie does not have a boring moment in it, and even though the ending ties up the story absolutely perfectly I always find myself at the end of this movie wanting it to go on and never end.

Its both entertaining and heartwarming... A great film about 4 friends who have the greatest 2 days of they're lives, along the way learning everything there is to know in life.. Turning them from kids to adults in a matter of moments...\n\nWhen i watch it now i still get the feeling of nostalgia... The loss of contact of friends and the good times i had and things i did and how easily things can change....\n\nBut this is a great family film to watch and i will no doubt be watching it again so many times over the years........"

        "review_detailed_main": "IMDb Top 250: 177\n\nWhat a sweet film. Even though I was born well after this film was released, the story of growing up and messing around with your friends is timeless- the times before the complications of life take hold.\n\nThe film follows four childhood friends on their summer trip to find a dead body, and the tolls the trip takes on them and the things they discover about themselves. The quest has many interesting stops, like a junkyard and one famous bridge. I loved the swamp scene.\n\nYou may not have been those kids who smoked and got into trouble, but one should be able to identify with the boys. Gordon is the worldly, smart one, living in his brother's shadow. Chris is the kid who has a rough family life, the physically mature one who acts as a big brother. Teddy is the crazy one, and Vern... well Vern was the one who you always wanted to shut up. How the hell was that kid your friend? The actors are fantastic. Though I couldn't stand Vern.\n\nThis film is a classic the moment you start watching it. All the staples of the rural 50's are here: the cars, the slick hair, the music and the lingo. It's fantastic. And then at the end with the skip to the 80's... 30 years is a long time.\n\nEssentially, this film wants you to cherish your childhood. Ironically, with all the swearing, you probably won't see it until after that time is done. The memories this film extracts from your brain are vivid. Sweet, sweet nostalgia. Life and death and the coming of age are central to this very touching story. A wonderful film. 8.6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't expecting this film to explore such deep and emotional themes, with both universal and personal questions about friendships, brotherhood, fatherhood, insecurities, and just youth in general.\n\nDespite being led by four kids, the film never felt annoying or cringey but was always full of warmth and excitement. The screenplay stands out both by its comedic strengths and its emotional depths. Lots of great landscapes and cinematography in the film that immerse us in the suburbs of small American towns of the '60s.\n\nThe film isn't really about the main plot of finding the body, that's just what's driving the characters as they learn more about themselves before they start a new chapter, and it's executed really well where you don't leave feeling dissatisfied, because it was never really about the body, but about their dynamics."

        "review_detailed_main": "When i first saw the title i mistook it for a romantic film but it is not. It is a coming of age drama. As it is featured in IMDb's top 250 i had a lot expectations from it. And in the end it topped those expectations. It is such a movie which everyone is compelled to like.\n\nI've seen this film 25 years after its initial release yet i've liked it so it is fair to say the appeal of this film stands tall to the test of time. Maybe the reason behind is that the main theme of the film is something which everyone relates to. It is Friendship. Maybe because of this reason you always feel deeply engrossed in this tale of friendship. That is why there is not even a single dull moment in the whole movie unlike many other highly acclaimed movies.\n\nThe story is rather simple maybe way too simple. But it is the execution, the genuine acting of the whole cast makes this movie such a delight to watch. I loved john Cusack who has a supporting role in the movie. His role as Gordon's brother is really well crafted though it is really short. Writing review about this movie and not mentioning River Phoenix would be injustice it is his role as the born leader of the group that gives this simple movie incredible depth.\n\nSo to summarize the movie is pretty good. Highly recommended and easily re-watchable. You will love every bit of the movie.\n\nA very enthusiastic 8/10."

Speaking as a huge fan this is Phoenix at his pure best. Truly haunting. If you enjoy reminiscing then this is a great movie for you! The spectrum of emotions portrayed and invoked in this movie makes this one of the best to have come out of the eighties... Strike that, THE best.

        "review_detailed_main": "This 1986 Rob Reiner classic is ALMOST among my top 5 of all time, but not quite as good as \"Forrest Gump\", the \"Star Wars Trilogy\", \"Terminator 1&2\", \"The Blues Brothers\", or \"Braveheart\", but it is unforgettable all the same. Four friends in the 50's go in search of a dead body. On the way there is much laughter of course(mostly contributed by Corey Feldman as crazy Teddy DuChamp and Jerry\"Look how thin and good looking I am now\"O'Connell as Vern the fat kid) but lots of sadness along the way. Wil Wheaton gives what is probably the most underrated performance of all time as sensitive budding writer Gordy, and River Phoenix has many fine moments as tough guy with bad reputation Chris Chambers. A fine supporting cast includes Richard Dreyfuss(one of my personal favorites), Marshall Bell, John Cusack, Casey Siemaszko(Charlie in \"Young Guns\"), Kiefer Sutherland, and Dick Durock, the \"Swamp Thing\" as Bill Travers. The Soundtrack is flawless too(if you look at all of my faves, excluding the \"Terminator\" flicks, they all have memorable soundtracks) with \"Lollipop\" By the Chordettes, \"Stand By Me\" By Ben E. King(the definitive version), \"Everyday\" By Buddy Holly, and \"Great Balls of Fire\" By Jerry Lee Lewis(Love that mailbox baseball!) just to mention a few. The tale of Davey Hogan must be one of the most memorably disgusting(funny) scenes in a movie up there with the fat man sequence(or organ donor transplant sequence, take your pick) in \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\"(Not as good as \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"."

I enjoyed the story and looked forward to seeing the movie- but what I wasn't prepared for was the Emotional Impact the movie would have on me. When I walked out of the theater, my legs were weak. I went to my car and got in and sat behind the wheel for a long time thinking about the guys I'd grown up with. Most of them were dead or in jail by then (or should've been), but they'd been my FRIENDS and remembering them that evening, I couldn't help but break down. Sure, the movie is stylized and the dialogue retains that \"Bradbury\" feel, but STAND BY ME is one of those rare movies that (at least for me) sticks with you long after you've seen it. It's hard to watch because of the memories it dredges up, but I still see it whenever I can because sometimes, no matter how much it hurts, it's good to Remember."

        "review_detailed_main": "Anchored by four irresistible performances by the youthful leads, \"Stand by Me\" stands tall as one of the finest films to be derived from a Stephen King story (a novella originally titled \"The Body\"). It's an emotionally stirring tale of boyhood friendship, at that transitional age before boys start making the journey towards manhood. And in that sense, this has an effectively allegorical quality. If the prospective viewer is anything like this one, it will likely make you long for your lost childhood. The four main characters are well defined and very sympathetic, with most of them having to experience some painful thoughts and ideas.\n\nWith Gordie (Wil Wheaton), it's the idea that his grieving parents have no love left for him after the death of his older brother Denny (John Cusack, in a cameo). With Chris (River Phoenix), it's the fact that he seemingly has a preordained destiny to end up a no-good type like his father and older brother \"Eyeball\" (Bradley Gregg). And Teddy (Corey Feldman) lives with an unbalanced, sadistic war veteran father who seriously maimed him at one point.\n\nThe setting is Oregon, 1960 (in the King-invented town of Castle Rock, which in his fiction is set in Maine). Together with their corpulent, nervous buddy Vern (Jerry O'Connell, in his film debut), the kids set out to search for the body of a kid their age, whom they heard had come to a bad end. Along the way they have assorted adventures: dodging a train, encountering a mean junk yard dog (who's nowhere near as monstrous as legend made him out to be), discovering a pond full of leeches, and being treated to one of storyteller Gordie's yarns (the entire Lardass Hogan episode is hysterical). Eventually, they run afoul of town bully \"Ace\" Merrill (an amusing Kiefer Sutherland).\n\nThe on location shooting is excellent, and the film does have a lot of resonance and emotional impact. Some people in the audience may take exception to the cussing (which really isn't all that bad), but director Rob Reiner, working from the script by co-producers Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, does a fine job of capturing small town America in a simpler time. Both Wheaton and Phoenix have some very impressive moments; backing up the young cast (also including Casey Siemaszko and Gary Riley) are such solid character players as Marshall Bell, Frances Lee McCain, and Bruce Kirby, with Richard Dreyfuss playing Gordie as an adult.\n\nReiner truly was on a roll during this period; 28 years later this remains one of his best efforts.\n\n10 out of 10."

Like him, i was demolished when education separated me from them ! Like him, i like having adventures and i have also covered a corpse (mine was a dead cat in a decrepit hospital for which we got troubles with parents !!!). So King has really a gift to remember this golden time with his words and finally, he could leave the paranormal ! His buddy are all fantastic and their chemistry feels good ! To put it in the late 50s makes it share this mythic time with rock songs (especially the eponymous classic) and perfect nostalgic society (\u00ab twin peaks \u00bb, \u00ab BTF \u00bb) and this trip into wild nature is just a fantastic journey that my city slickers soul craves for !

Upon hearing the shocking news of the location of a missing boy's body, they set out on a venture to find him and have their pictures in the newspapers. Throughout the journey, they discover a lot more--about themselves and the world--besides the ill-fated boy.\n\nThis film is extremely nostalgic.

These four twelve-year-old boys have experienced a great fortune of pain throughout their lives already, and they begin a trek to escape from their past for at least a short while.\n\nThe whole movie revolves around the theme of friendship and overcoming challenges. We see the various emotions the boys feel, the suffering they undergo, and the will power that they have to be themselves. I truly enjoyed this Stand By Me since it's not your typical film of an adventure through the lands; no, it's an inspirational story of four boys who start the epoch of their lives.\n\nWe all have personal trials that we go through. It could be the untimely death of a loved one, finding meaning in life, battling depression or just finding a purpose to live. Regardless of the challenges we endure, this film strongly depicts how vastly we transform and learn about ourselves when faced with controversy."

After several years had passed, I rented it again, and could not believe what I saw on the screen. It was this perfect movie, the actors were brilliant as was the writing and directing. I was about the same age as the characters, and I related to their feelings and emotions. It had parts that made me laugh (the campfire scene), parts that made me cry (the milk money scene) and parts I will never forget ( \"I'll see you around.\" \"Not if I see you first.\"). This movie touched my heart like no other movie has before. It is THE coming-of-age movie. No one has made a better one, and I don't think they ever will."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched a part of Stand By Me on TV and I liked what I saw so I went and bought the film. SBM is a coming of age film and still is popular after 20 years, even if it was before my time, I loved it and watched it every chance I get. This film stars River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman and Wil Wheaton, as anyone would say, these 4 boys were incredibly talented and really put 101% into their characters and really lived in the film, doing what any young boys would've done at 12-16. They can easily relate to the film because they're not far off from their character's age hence they can act like boys with cussing, smoking and fights.\n\nThe storyline is true and how they put a meaning into the film about friendship and how people don't have friends like the ones when they were twelve, that sure is true! This is a movie to see before you die, if you choose not to see it, then you're missing out on a classic movie."
