        "review_detailed_main": "It's bad enough that Hollywood has finally run out of original movie ideas, that they have resort to making either A) sequels to successful past movies that don't come close to the original, B) movies based on successful books/video games that don't come close to the original, or C) remakes of successful movies that don't come close to the original. This version of John Carpenter's subtle masterpiece \"The Fog\" falls into Category C. I was worried when I heard they were remaking this, and I wasn't disappointed (I should get a job predicting movie success/failures--no one believes me, but I'm right at LEAST 90% of the time). I was hoping it would stay true to the original, but so many liberties were taken to \"make it so that modern audiences could relate to it\" that it became a totally different film, and I don't mean that as a compliment. I mean, I can understand the modern music at the radio station and the up-to-date equipment. But why the gratuitous sex scene? Why the hoochy-koochy-dancers on the boat? And why make Elizabeth and Stevie related to the Founding Fathers (the FF's last names are never given in the original, except for Malone)? Also, there was never any logical REASON for the \"attack\"--at least in the first movie, it was the 100th anniversary of the crime that brought on the revenge (the crime took place in 1880; the movie was made in 1980). This crime took place in 1871, and the revenge took place in 2005?? 134 years?? That made less than no sense. And that ending?? Talk about anti-climactic. At least in the original, it ended the way it should have--it followed the plot line, it was the REASONABLE conclusion. This one--I only stayed with it to see how it played out, and it was completely unreasonable. I won't give it away, but it made NO sense to the plot. The special effects weren't even enough to redeem this sad excuse for a remake--I kept making jokes about \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" throughout the whole thing! I couldn't help it--I had to salvage this film somehow! That was the part that was so GOOD about the original, that you never really SAW the faces of the ghosts or graphic details of what they did--think \"Blair Witch\", people--less is MORE. The human imagination is the best scare tactic on the planet! Once you put a face on the fear, you can deal with it. It's the fear you CAN'T see that messes you up for days on end! All in all, another wasted rental from Blockbuster."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was so disappointed about this. When I first heard they were remaking it, I was worried, but gave it every chance to actually be good. It wasn't. Everything that was good in the original was ruined in this one. There was no \"atmosphere\" to it, it was just a bunch of overly-beautiful WB-age stars thinly acting out a poor script. The whole purpose of the lighthouse and Stevie Wayne was to present this feeling of isolation and loneliness...in the new one, they seem to rarely use the lighthouse at all. There are extra points in the plot that are unnecessary and... and, I can just go on and on. It was just horrible.\n\nThen, I tried looking at it not as a \"remake\" but just as a regular movie, as though I was seeing the story for the first time. But, you know what: it still sucks. It doesn't capture you. There are a few good scenes and shots, but overall I just kept wondering when it would be over. So much potential with a story and it just didn't work.\n\nUnfortunately, that's Hollywood today. Horror films can be well made at the same time. Maybe they should stop relying so much on picture-perfect actors and corny digital special effects and start focusing more on the story, the characters, the music (Lord, the original score added so much), and just making it entertaining! 3 out of 10."

As far as I could tell NO ONE in the theatre was scared ONCE -- not even those teen girl screamers that are always at horror flicks. I think everyone was CONFUSED, not scared -- Why the two love interests for Nick? Why was Elizabeth envisioning the past? Why did no one comment on the one guy's face ROTTING? Why did no one care the priest was drunk all the time? Why did it matter that the statue was made incorrectly? Why did the ghosts resort to using GRAFFITI? (and why did they use what looked like paint?)\n\nWHY? WHY? WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS? Instead of paying for this, ask an eight-year-old, heck, make it a seven-year old to tell you a scary story. I GUARANTEE he or she will come up with a better plot, more realistic characters, and scarier scenes than this piece of garbage!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't angry about The Fog remake until I heard that it was going to be released by Revolution Studios, a company known to house crap movies. From then on, my hopes weren't that high, and they sank even lower when I saw the trailer. It looked to much like Boogeyman or Darkenss Falls rather than an atmospheric, imaginative, horror production like the original.\n\nThe original Fog deserves to be a cult classic and is a great film, but I thought it could have used a couple of improvements. It was not John Carpenter's best effort, but it still was an 8 out of 10 movie. This remake had potential because it could have corrected some of the plot holes from the original. Not surprisingly, the modernized Fog created new loopholes in the story and in addition had a terrible script.\n\nThe characters here were clich\u00e9d. The naive young girl who sees \"horrible things\" happening and who is befriended by her \"hot ex-boyfriend\". There is even a token black guy who serves as the \"comic relief\" for the film. Why can't they have black heroes in horror movies? Every character is seen in some state of undress, including Stevie Wayne, a mother of a young teenage boy named Andy, who struts around in panties in front of her son (I thought that was funny). I'm surprised Andy's old nanny wasn't shown strutting around in her undies while cleaning the dishes.\n\nThe leper colony ghosts were not scary. They were all see through, and instead of a giant fishing hook, Father Blake carried a cane (WTF??), not for support while walking, but for a scene near the end of the film where flying glass shards contribute to the death of a character. Also, the fog in this film is all CGI, and is not nearly as menacing as the one in the original was.Father Malone's character in the original was a major contributor to the story, because he represented the sins of the founding fathers. In this one, he's just a stupid old drunk who has a minimal impact on the story and plays more like the typical \"old lady who can see the future\" kind of character. Also, why aim for a PG-13? It's obvious the filmmakers wanted to put some gore in this, and they did, because there were many deaths that involved people being maimed and/or set on fire, not necessarily in that order. Only a few more drops of blood and it would be R.\n\nThere are two good things though. There is one pretty shocking death scene that was cool and there were some cool cinematography shots. The eerie image of the sailors on their ship in the fog gave me the chills. There was also a really creepy ghost who was only shown in shadows (you never saw his face) and who wore a top hat. It would have been interesting if they showed that ghost more, but alas, they shied away from it.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the ending. It's supposed to be a shocker, but it's extremely predictable. It also makes everything that preceded it make little sense. What was the point of that? Stevie Wayne's cheesy closing monologue was even cheesier than the concluding monologue in House of the Dead.\n\nOverall, this dreadful remake ran shy of where it could have won the race."

Now, hopefully you have the kind of dryer that has the clear window in front. If you do, start the load and watch the laundry spin around. Every time you see the red sock pretend to be scared.\n\nThat's it. That's the equivalent to seeing this movie. As entertaining as watching your laundry dry and every bit as scary as a red sock.\n\nOthers have already punched all the holes in the plot (or complete lack thereof) that are necessary. I won't beat that dead horse. As mentioned, the acting was completely mailed in. The CGI was hokey, stilted and throw in in a lot of scenes unnecessarily. This wasn't just a really bad movie, this was a really bad horror movie. Most horror movies these days suck to one degree or another, but this moving distinguishes itself as being among the worst of the worst. Seriously, save yourself the time and energy and steer clear of The Fog. I haven't seen a horror movie this bad since I saw the remake of The Haunting."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Carpenter's name is synonymous with horror films. A few films were not well received, but he's gone on to develop a cult status. His movie The Fog was not considered a huge hit, but has become near and dear to many horror film lovers bloody hearts. So when it was announced that it was part of the rampage of remakes and sequels, half of those who heard rejoiced. They expected that better effects could make the film scarier. The other half of horror-files just shook their heads, expecting another disaster in film. What could a bigger budget and new hot young actors do to freshen it up? Would a bad episode of the Weather Channel really scare a new generation? I was one of the ones shaking my head, skeptical, but I gave it a shot.\n\nTwo of television's young actors, Tom Wellington from Smallville, and Maggie Grace from Lost, star in this unnecessary update. The film tries to fill seats with promised SSA( Scares, Screams and Sex Appeal)- obvious from the quick cut trailer which shows typical horror shots AND a low shot of Maggie Grace in her underwear. The promises are never fulfilled. The remake keeps the same plot of the first movie. Apparently somewhere in Antonio Bay's history people have been wronged. Unhappy and looking for revenge, these people come back in the Fog around the town's anniversary. For some reason the film forgets to add the part which makes the audience care about the characters. You don't care if the living out run the Fog or not. With scary and prophetic statements like \"It came back from the sea\u0085.things always do\" this movie provokes eye rolling and incredulous looks every five minutes.\n\nNothing in this movie made it redeemable. Trying to add comedy, DeRay Davis, as Spooner, is just confusing. At the same time makes one wonder why he's the only person who isn't white in the entire town. The only way that anyone should sit through this movie is if it's being used as a form of torture. I recommend you tell them what they want to know and forgo the pain. I wish I had. Leaving a horror film shocked or scared out of your wits is a desired effect. What The Fog leaves you with is scary- you've just wasted over an hour of your life watching a needless remake."

Can you rate anything BELOW a 1? Can I give a NEGATIVE rating to this film? And most of all, I'm writing Revolution Studios and demanding my money back. When you pay money to see something in a theater, I feel that there is a mutual and unspoken guarantee from the studio releasing it that the film will, at the very least, resemble something that LOOKS as if it were made by a group of people who know something about film-making. After seeing this, I would have to seriously question whether or not Rupert Wainwright has ever actually seen a film or if he's just going by what other people have told him (\"Hey, Rupert, movies are really cool! You use this thing called a camera and it records people doing neat stuff! Doesn't that sound interesting?\").\n\nI don't need to be insulted like this. The original FOG was a good, solid piece of horror film-making that generated its scares by making the most of a small budget along with great music and decent effects. The new one is a poop stain on the remake underbelly that Hollywood has chosen to embrace. I don't just hate this movie, I LOATHE it. I loathe it and everything that it stands for because what it stands for is taking your money and then kicking you in the balls."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I should have known better before paying money to go see the 2005 remake of The Fog starring TOM WELLING and rated PG-13!! For me, the Fog, was a cult classic I used to love when I was a kid. The scary, eerie small town with a dark secret, the ghostly figures in the fog and the brutal way the townspeople got slayed in, contributed to a great ghost/horror story that was both exciting and enjoyable. Unfortunately we live in the \"era of the remake\" and naturally they had go screw this flick up as well. The small eerie town is replaced with a totally un-scary town, the fog looked like something pulled out of \"the perfect storm\" w/ George Clooney or \"the day after tomorrow\" (which is no surprise since it was the same company who handled the FX on \"Day after...\"), Selma Blair was trying to hard to fill out the role of Stevie Wayne and it seemed awfully fake at times. One thing that really got me cracking was the black guy/comic relief. I couldn't really figure out what the hell a black dude was doing in a small (all white) fishing town anyway? (if U ask me he was totally misplaced in the movie).\n\nIn overall they actually managed to turn, what could have been a great horror movie into a teen/slasher/ring-knockoff!!\n\nThe same goes for the moody \"Carpenter music\" that was replaced with the standard PG-13 b*llsh*t pop-rock soundtrack, it basically stripped the movie from having any tense atmosphere.\n\nThe script was horrible, there where no scares and no mood at all, instead of cooking up a better \"FOG\" they actually made it worse, I find it incredible that despite having the technology to make some visually nice horror flicks today and correct some of the flaws that were caused by lack of money or technology back then, the studios are still spitting out nothing but trash... PEOPLE what makes a movie is a good story and HEART not Special FX (a principle Carpenter used to work with back then when the funds were limited...even still the man still made some of the most memorable horror movies in my lifetime).\n\nThe ghost looked like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean and the only moment I thought \"hmm...that's actually cool\" was when you could see the big ship and the crew's ghostly figures standing in the fog, kindda made me remember back to the original, unfortunately things only went (even more) downhill from there...I mean WTF is up with the ending!?!?! I thought it was supposed to be a horror flick?\n\nIn overall: If U are a fan of the original Carpenter movie, DO not see this cr*p, almost no gore, no feeling with the characters (actually you couldn't care less if they all got killed...), no mood, no eerie music, bad CGI, and the list just goes on and on... my advice: Rent it on DVD or even better wait for it to be aired on TV!"

I really never had any urge to see this movie, the trailer seemed scary, but that kind of thing doesn't really interest me. I didn't realize it was based on an original movie, so the idea that there's a fog that kills people seemed so stupid. Anyway, I went to this screening last night and was definitely surprised by the movie. I didn't know who half the actors were, which usually makes me think twice about a movie, but I recognized Tom Welling! Yes, I'm a fan of Smallville and yes, I have a school-girl crush on him. Must stop hyperventilating...\n\nI am not a great judge of movies like this, but the special effects were really good. I mean, the fog itself was creepy and the \"things\" that you've seen on the poster and trailer were really well-done. I thought that the music used in this movie was great, although I gotta say; I got really annoyed when I screamed after EVERY loud noise! Every time the fog rolled in, a loud banging would sound \u0096 like someone (or something) was banging on the door \u0096 and I jumped every time. That definitely got annoying. The movie was so loud that I never felt comfortable relaxing in any scene. Scary...but it got a little old.\n\nThe thing I was most surprised about was how smart this movie was. I always think of these supernatural, sci-fi, horror movies to be mindless scares with even dumber characters. But The Fog definitely uses this subplot of a pirate ship that builds until the end to explain a lot of the mystery and confusion that surrounds everything. I really thought that certain scenes were really well-done, especially with the use of the fog, specifically with the Selma Blair-car stalling scene and this intense part with the little kid (Selma Blair's kid, yeah right) in the movie. Anyway, walking out of this film I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed it."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Antonio Island, Oregon, the dwellers are celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the seaside town and the mayor has built the statues of the founders: Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The descendant Nick Castle (Tom Welling) owns the Castle & Son, a fishing charter company, using his vessel Seagrass for tourism in the Antonio Bay. When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island, coincidently a huge fog appears with weird noises and killing locals. When Elizabeth slips in Nick's boathouse and falls in the sea, she finds an 1871 journal written by a man called Blake, who bought half the island for his leper people to build a town for them to live. While sailing in the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane, bringing his community to Antonio Island, Blake is betrayed by Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The quartet locks Blake and his friends in the vessel, steals their money and possessions and fires the ship, killing them. In the present days, the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the descendants of the criminals.\n\n1981 \"The Fog\" is a dark ghost story of the master of horror John Carpenter, with great cinematography and special effects, giving a scary atmosphere without the need of gore. The screenplay builds the horror in a low pace, but increasing the tension.\n\nI decided to see this remake just because of the names of Tom \"Clark Kent\" Welling, Maggie \"Shannon Rutherford\" Grace and Selma Blair. In spite of my wish of liking this movie, unfortunately it is terrible. The story is basically the same, but the modifications in the original screenplay are awful and confused. The edition never reaches the tension, and for example, I have not understood why Elizabeth leaves Antonio Bay (and Nicholas Castle) with the ghosts, or the modification in the statue of the angel in the cemetery. The songs that the DJ Stevie Wayne presents in her station are the best this movie offers to the viewers. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A N\u00e9voa\" (\"The Fog\")"

If you want to see likable characters, again this is not for you. If you want to toss out some money and waste 90 minutes of your life, go for it. It is best to just stick to the 1980 original. This version did not build up any suspense or leave you rooting for anybody. A very flat movie, indeed, which had very little fog in it. The fact that this was filmed close to my home community does not add any stars to my rating. In fact, I am ashamed to say that my community would have anything to do with this boring garbage."

WE did not get to identify with any of the characters as many of them were completely pointless throughout the movie...I was actually hoping they would all die. Nothing really made sense and everything just happened so fast yet it seemed like it was never going to end. The ending was almost ridiculous and completely senseless (more so than the rest of the movie) I have never seen the first movie but if it's as bad as this one, I am glad I did not waste my time. This was dreadful and painful to watch... by far the worst movie I have seen so far. I've never seen so many people walk out of a movie theater. This movie should have not been released in theaters...or DVD for that matter... What a waste!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Fog is a nice collection of \"BOO!\" scares that doesn't really try to be more than it is: hot young people in trouble. While the story isn't all that mindblowing (\"There's something IN the fog!!!\"), it had enough shocks to keep us Premiere-crashers giddy.\n\nTom Welling plays Tom Welling, a thick fisherman stud with blue eyes, with his buddy played by a guy who sounds like Chris Tucker Jr., who gets off all the (intentionally) funny lines.\n\nWelling's girlfriend is played by Maggie \"no, the other hot girl from LOST\" Grace. She enjoys showing off her underwear often, which never hurts. Maggie has returned from Manhattan to her hometown island because of terrible dreams she's been having involving drowning lepers in pirate costumes, and she needs Welling's help.\n\nWelling, however, fails to mention about the affair he's been having with MILFy (Selma Blair). Selma plays Milfy very well, and she manages to be simultaneously likable as a single-mom and lustable as a perpetually hungover DJ.\n\nOh, yeah...the plot: It seems that The Fog (and the angry spirits that \"are IN the fog!\") have come to get revenge on the residents of the island for the sins of their fathers a hundred years back. That's all we really care about, right? Just establish the excuses to rack up the body count.\n\nIt's obviously a PG-13 film, since there's not buckets of blood and intestines dripping everywhere. But as I said before, the numerous \"BOO!\" shock moments as people get stabbed, cooked and squashed are pretty nice.\n\nThe real litmus test of this came 5 minutes into the screening when the projectionist messed up the sound, and they had to start the film over. So when they replayed the first scene, the audience jumped at the Teaser Big Death just as much the second time as they did the first.\n\nIt was REFRESHING to see a horror film that wasn't all self-aware and meta. This is anti- Kevin Williamson. Aside from maybe one crack about Chris Tucker Jr. not waiting around to be the next one killed, there is a nice lack of self-awareness with the characters. Maybe they just don't get horror movies very often in their secluded island village, but no one ever gives the old wink/nod to the audience that they knew\u0085that we knew\u0085that they were acting in a horror film.\n\nIt was also nice it was to see a horror/suspense film to NOT have a crazy, last second TWIST ENDING that causes the audience to grumble to themselves as they shuffle out. I'm not spoiling anything by saying that. The film is nice and scary right up until the end, but they managed to resist the temptation to go for a silly M. Night Shyamalan ending. In the end, it was a good time for a teenage Halloween film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit it i hated this movie when i first watched it on dvd way back in 2005 & now after 15 years i decided give it another try out of pure curiosity again, as John Carpenters The Fog (1980) is probably my favourite Horror movie of all time & i have recently been watching alot of Aquatic water-based Horror Thriller's lately such as the Jaws franchise & Piranha & Anaconda & Humanoids from the Deep & Lake Placid & Crawl among others & i remembered the Fog remake from 2005.\n\nIt's weird because i hated this remake & even tossed the dvd in the bin but now after such a long period of time & with fresh & more mature eyes lol i really enjoyed this & take it for what it is now, a modern version of a Horror CLASSIC & it was never going to be better or as good as the first film.\n\nThis Fog is a polished version with some gorgeous scenes. What i now enjoyed about this flick is it's slow-paced & relaxing flow of it & it's quiet & creepy atmosphere. This is a relaxing movie that is more a Supernatural Thriller than a Dark Horror like the original & there in its tone it's supposed to be a new vision of the old story & i can except that now. The music is creepy & atmospheric but obviously not on the same genius level as the legendary John Carpenter but it's still a solid creepy score. The look & cinematography is actually really good here too with an overall creepy & moody look & some really nice shots of the Antonio Bay town & nice lovely night time scenes. The cast is no where near as good as John Carpenters original obviously but here they're fine in that early 2000's Slasher flick casting type of way. I did get nice vibes of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" in this film too with little fishing town & imagery. Back to the little cast of typical pretty faces like the new Nick Castle played by \"SmallVilles\" Tom Welling, he's not too bad as the local fisherman that was originally played by the legendary Tom Atkins, but he's ok as the typical good-looking lead hero type & Maggie Grace (Taken Trilogy) is actually pretty good here as Elizabeth, a girl who comes back to the small town just as everything gets Spooky & strange. Elizabeth does alot of investigating into the past history of the town which is a nice added bit of detail & her character is much more fleshed out than that of Jamie lee Curtis was im the original, some really nice looking scenes of her in the old museum checking it all out. We also get a good performance from Selma Blair (HellBoy 1&2) as the lighthouse DJ radio host Stevie Wayne, it's a fine part & the worst role goes to the \"Funny Black Guy\" played by Deray Davis as Spooner the friend of Nick, he's the typical wannabe funny black guy that was in all those Slasher flicks back in the day but he doesn't ruin it as he's not a main character & not too over the top. The Supernatural killers look pretty decent for computer effects & look like actual Ghosts rather than Carpenters much scarier Zombies but this is a new \"Vision\" so things change even if it's not for the better. But all in all \"The Fog\" from 2005 is actually a decent little supernatural Thriller with an ok little cast for a relaxing little low-key popcorn flick. There's actually a nice quiet & lonely feel to this flick which i really liked & some really good spooky scenes but it's definitely not scary like the first film but that adds to it's nice calm & old school early 2000's feel. It's definitely a product of it's time like all films but something nice & slow about it's thrills & chills & nothing is over the top or crazy like most Horror's or Supernatural films today, the pacing is nice here. This isn't totally the same & that's whats good as it follows similar beats but done differently & that makes it not a carbon copy & is in away it's own thing just following the old story slightly but also making changes & also adding much more depth to everything especially the History of the town & Mythology.\n\nI'm glad i gave this another watch after 15 years!!! It's not the Classic first film but it's very good little atmospheric Supernatural Thriller in it's own right & a nice late night flick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Remakes are the fashion nowadays, and The Fog was a good candidate. Not because the original is bad, but because it was so good that it's strong story could likely stand the test of updating. Unfortunately, the remake turned out not to be much of a test.\n\nTo make this short, the only good things in this movie are Selma Blair and some sweeping shots across the island and surrounding water. Tom Welling is ineffectual in the lead role, and - on this evidence - Maggie Grace simply cannot act. She comes across as a Paris Hilton type - someone famous for being something else, who tries their hand at acting and fails miserably. The ineptness of her performance is such that it really detracts and takes the viewer out of the movie.\n\nSome things get changed around from the original, not for any great benefit. With the journal in Grace's hands, we get the backstory piecemeal and in a more confusing way than in the original movie. For a horror movie, there is virtually nothing to get scared by. The ghosts are about as scary as the ones from Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nIn all, this film is actually a testament to the skill of the makers of the original movie, which is superior in every respect. Twenty years later, with far more technology at their disposal, the result is an abject failure on every level."

If you liked Carpenter's original, avoid this like you would the spectres who emerge from the 'fog', and the leprosy that afflicts them. Acting is sub pop video, and character development laughable, particularly the rubbish about the relationship between 'Elizabeth Williams' and her mother. Also, rather than being aimed at a discerning horror audience - people who liked the original maybe - this film is seemingly targeted at libidinous teenagers, with some very dodgy and obvious shots of the female stars scantily clad. By the end of this tripe, I was hoping one of the fog dwellers would put me out of my misery."

        "review_detailed_main": "On Antonio Island, all sorts of weird and creepy things start happening. A boat full of people are found dead or near dead, a woman keeps having strange dreams, weird objects wash ashore, fires break out and then there is the fog...a fog which is creepy and brings folks from the mid-1800s back to the present day! Obviously, the island is totally screwed!\n\nIn 1980, John Carpenter brought the world \"The Fog\". This horror film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau was successful and there were some who loved it. In 2005, a remake came out....and only bad movie buffs loved it...mostly because they loved to laugh at the film and how unintentionally bad it was. It currently is number 62 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list...evidence that many people strongly disliked this movie!\n\nSo did this version go so wrong? I have two guesses. First, the studio green lit this film project before they even had a completed script! This is a very dangerous move and you would rationally think they'd have the script before making the decision to make the movie! Second, although John Carpenter is listed as one of the producers, apparently it was in name only and Carpenter told the media he essentially had no involvement in the remake.\n\nSo what did I dislike about the film? Well, I was mostly sad because it wasn't as horrible as I'd hoped. After all, sometimes it's funny to watch a thoroughly terrible and inept movie...and this one wasn't that fun to watch. I think it's because of the generally slow pacing, a close-up shot of a dead dog, the hipster radio station character, the use of leprosy to evoke horror and much more....but it never was funny bad like \"The Room\", \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" or \"The Apple\". Instead, it was tedious and poorly made...though I wouldn't place it in the Bottom 100...especially since some of the effects were impressive. Perhaps it made this list because folks expected so much more since the original was apparently better.\n\nBy the way, there is a scene where someone or some thing painted a quote from the Bible on the wall. In Daniel, it read \"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin\". Well, in the movie they misspelled 'upharsin'. Not a huge error but a sign of sloppiness nonetheless."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a film, As a Horror film and as a Remake it is the worse. Whether it falls in these three categories, The Fog 2005 is an awful adaptation of the 1980 John Carpentar classic.\n\nPeople complain about \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"Friday the 13th\" and even \"Halloween\" being remade, but I think that this is the devil of all remakes. This remake has no originality and even if I heard bad things about this remake, like all films i gave it a chance. i did and as the first 10 minutes rolled in, i just wanted this piece of crap to end.\n\nI'll talk through on what I think of the film.\n\nActing, 3/10: Very poor and pretty useless and we can expect from modern horror films. The girl on the radio, Elizabeth & The Smallville Actor try their best but they don't save this film at all. Aside from those actors acting terribly, The other actors do nothing to help and they are just plain and simple, with no character.\n\nStory/Plot, 0/10: What a messed up plot!? This plot doesn't work for me at all. In Carpentar's version it was all about a creepy ghost tale. It was about an evil atmosphere that would come on a certain night at a certain time after 100 years later. This remake's side of the story is very uninspiring. It's about 4 crooks burning a boat which has men, women and children. After they return 1000 years later to get revenge. It sounds like the same thing but it's that dysfunctional that I couldn't understand what's with that and this?\n\nScariness, 0/10: The film is not scary at all. From start to end it isn't creepy. If you want scares go rent the 1980 classic because the kills and the atmosphere is more tense.\n\nBesides describing those things, I would like to describe the worse thing possible in the film that is unrealistic, overdone and not creepy whatsoever. The scenes of the Fog. When the Fog kills it is very unrealistic. When it kills, we see human hands grabbing people and we see that the Fog has cleared. When the Fog moves in and out of places it is done very quickly. It moves very fast and that gives us no tension or creeps whatsoever. Every scene with the Fog fails epically. It's not scary and it never creeped me out. I just sat there and said \"Yep, really scary\". The Fog in Carpentar's version is much more realistic because it moves in very slowly and that what gives it tension. And then when hands grab people, it's like the hands are camouflaged through the Fog to give off the nice effect.\n\nI didn't have hope for this film at the start and now I wish I had two hours of my life back because this version was very uninspiring. Nothing is pulled off well here. Nada....\n\nEven if Carpentar's The Fog isn't my favorite Horror film, I still think it beats the remake tremendously.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "After a series of strange encounters, a small sea-town comes to believe the fulfillment of a deadly curse is being brought upon by a series of malicious ghosts and try to stop it before it's too late.\n\nQuite frankly, this is a highly underrated effort that's one of the more enjoyable remakes among this current crop. One of the only true flaws to this is the lower rating which does harm this one. The kills here really lack any sort of impact or brutality with the lack of blood throughout here, and the other attacks have a slightly less intense bite to them than they otherwise would with a darker tone to this. There's also the act that this one tends to overplay its scenes far longer than they're worth, which is slightly odd in that it makes for overlong and overly dramatic scare scenes that overstay their welcome at times and instead drains some of their impact. Still, there's a lot to like here in the fact that the build-up in here is incredibly well-done with this one featuring the early visions of the ships' fate along with the items washed ashore both creating a rather fine and exciting set-up as well as the burgeoning mystery they lead to surrounding the sudden appearance of the journal explaining everything that finally puts everything together. That helps makes scenes like the ambush or sea or the supernatural activities in the radio station to seem all the more enjoyable as well as being highly suspenseful by milking the idea of the fog being a malevolent entity in this one. The scenes of it moving through town, surrounding buildings and weaving along the hallways makes for a thoroughly chilling scenario about what's trapped in the fog. When it finally pays that off in the final half causes this to be all the more enjoyable and entertaining by making for a rather chilling connection with the back-story given already in here which is where this one gets the most out of its storyline. That also helps to make for a really fine finale by really getting the good attacks and really creepy scenarios in here that really make for a high-note ending here which really sells this one. The last part to like here is the rather inspired amount of suspense in here, from the attack on the lighthouse worker and the fog chasing the family through the house to even shorter scenes with the trapped car underwater, the fake-drowning in the outhouse or the final assault in the library which makes for some really good times in here. While they may seem a little like a cop-out, these make it enjoyable enough.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence, some Language and shadowy Nudity."

The splendid original film is made a new treatment with younger actors and better special effects.The main casting are television actors(Maggie Grace: Lost and Tom Welling: Smallville) though with wide future career and the supporting cast are frankly well .Gore and violence abound including decent scares with tense horror sequences.The grisly murders are scary and creepy but are executed alive burn people,authentic massacre with nauseating and gruesome assassinations by crystal,knife or cleaver.Eerie score musical by Graeme Revell though I miss the frightening music by John Carpenter.The motion picture is regularly directed by Rupert Wainwhright(Stigmata) and was produced by Debra Hill(recently deceased) and Carpenter.It's a formulaic and regular attempt to cash in on the success of original and superior The Fog.The movie will like to terror fans but contains a roller-coaster dark suspense and disturbing fear."

        "review_detailed_main": "Today's forecast is foggy with a 90% percent chance of EVIL!! The Fog is one of those films that just make you feel like trying to figure out what the guy behind you had for dinner. This remake of another 1980's version just doesn't make the cut at all in my opinion. In fact it falls several meters short. The basic premise here is that there's a small fishing town who's founding fathers committed a terrible crime and now vengeance is being sought in the form of a killer fog.\n\nThink about that for a second A KILLER FOG!!!!! Does that sound scary at all!?!?!!? It's not as if you could possibly go into a movie about killer fog expecting to come out crying (unless you cry when your extremely bored). From a horror movie point of view this movie is more akin to an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. It's just not scary at all you can spot every single little BOO from a mile away. On top of that it doesn't even make sense!!! I don't want to spoil anything here (because I know you're all just burning inside to drop whatever your doing and go see this film) but things just happen in the movie that don't even make sense at all!!! And you think they'll tie in later but they don't!!! Maybe they're setting up for \"The Fog 2: Thicker Fog\"? The movies only saving graces are some hot actresses, and Superman. Actually no, not even Superman could save this god forsaken kitty litter of a film.\n\nTo put a cap on things I would rather be decapitated with safety scissors than see this movie again. Please if you go to see this movie make sure to wear adequate protection,and you might want to book your therapy appointment before you go. They're a little bit backed up these days."

If your town were being gobbled up by an unknown fog that killed people, I think you'd be panicking a little bit. But no, they're driving around and such, making complete donkey butts of themselves (I'd use other words, but expletives are prohibited).\n\nThe ending, ha! Overall it just wasn't good. Poor remake, and shame on John Carpenter for allowing Hollywood to botch what was a good flick. It boggles my mind that he was even interested in seeing a remake of The Fog."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was hoping and praying that \"The Fog\" was going to be good and better then the original. Nope, didn't happen. Where the original film at least kept you on the edge at times, the new remake is very predictable. The story isn't any different then the first one. Ghost of a 100yr old ship come back to an offshore island town to get revenge for what was done to them by the founders of the island. Yes it's a remake, but at least add something original.\n\nThe main problem with The Fog is, there's no build up or suspense. Even when it tries, it fails with the results. There are maybe 1-2 jump out of your seat moments and they aren't because of anything scary on the screen. Even the deaths are pretty weak, except for one, which you'll have to see for yourself. Then again, maybe not.\n\nThe acting is drab and weak. Maggie Grace should choose her films more carefully. Coming from a hit T.V. show like \"Lost\" to make this crap is unforgiving. Tom Welling (Smallville, Cheaper by the Dozon) isn't going to set his film career ablaze with this film. A least this will be a learning experience for both of them. Selma Blair is the only one who at least give an admirable performance, but she really don't have much to do it this film.\n\nWhat the Fog does get right is, \"THE FOG\". The eerie mist has a mind of it's own and I loved the way the ghosts slipped around in the background. The fog is done very well, but everything else is way below average. There's just not enough scares and the story just won't hold people's interest for long, as it's been done before.\n\nStay out of the fog and out of the theater for this one. Now I know why John Carpenter didn't want his name on this film. What a bomb."

Surprisingly, the \"gotcha\" was what one didn't predict. Just when you finished patting yourself on the back, you may find yourself a few inches off the seat. If you anticipate anything at all, you will find yourself surprised on several occasions.\n\nTom Welling from Smallville was very good although he can do better and I am sure he will. Everyone else did fine. Selma Blair contributed plenty to the movie. Maggie Grace came out of the fog with a few scratches but she was good to watch as well.\n\nEssentially, the film makers kept their audience in enough of a fog to keep interest alive. Not only that, but for a remake, they did a very good job. They brought modern technology to the movie and mixed in some good old \"scary movie\" technique.\n\nFine movie. Gets a gracious 7 from me."

It felt like she knew what was coming. She wasn't the only one: not a single actor was convincing. It was horrible! They changed the story too much, there was too much fog at times. Yes, I know it is a big part of the movie, but they just over did it. There was way too much spotlight on parts of the story that were not relative. I didn't like the fact that you could see the detail of the ghosts, like their faces. The unknown is better to me, like in the original.\n\n~ Amanda Harmon"

She then used her extensive experience reading teen-romance-novels to help her craft this snore-fest. She also may have had some ideas for casting.\n\nI have to say I was concerned when my boy came in and sat down next to me shortly after The Fog started--these remakes sometimes ramp up the violence and gore quite a bit and he was a bit young--but I soon realized that it wasn't going to be a problem.

It has that post 90's Scream vibe in its look and aesthetic that seems more dated than the 79 original. The biggest problem was disassembling the component parts of the story then never bothering to assemble it again so the story is a jumbled mess. There's no feel for the geography of the island, the fog itself does nothing and doesn't provide a threat, the ghosts have no coherent or specific power, the characters are so thinly drawn that major characters were reduced to bit parts and that ending comes out of nowhere. It's feels like a film the makers lost interest in making."

I have.\n\nThere's going to be lots of spoilers so lets just dive right in.\n\nWe have Selma Blair who looks about 13, and is no Adrienne Barbeu. She's playing Stevie Wayne and there isn't going to be any \"Chased up the lighthouse\" sequence in this version sadly. The boy playing her son looks older than she does, so clearly they picked the wrong person for that role. Someone who looks a fair bit older would have suited.\n\nWe're back in Antonio Bay but this time we're calling it Antonio Island. Instead of smugglers/pirates/buccaneers (whatever they were in the original) we have a ship full of families with leprosy who have bought land on the island fair and square and their ship is set on fire and and they are robbed and killed by the founding fathers of Antonio Island.\n\nIt seems most people on the island are related to at least one of the founding fathers (I would have liked to have seen the ghosts go up to the black guy, look at him, then ignore him as not related to the killers).\n\nThe priest is played the same was as the original but the final conflict is in the Town Hall instead of The Church. The whole past lives things was a waste of time.\n\nWhy Stevie didn't just take her brake off and put her car into neutral when she was on the road (she was on the crest of a hill facing downwards, she could have bump started the car that way easily) and how the truck missed her headlights which were on.\n\nThe ghosts in the river and coming through the sink annoyed me. I noticed they kept the \"saving Stevie's son through a window\" idea.\n\nMostly the plot has been kept the same apart from a few small places. If you want to enjoy the film and you haven't seen the original, by all means watch this.\n\nIf you've seen the original and want to compare the two then watch this. Otherwise just stick with the original, this will leave a bad taste in your mouth and a lack of respect for John Carpenter who knows he could have done much better. He will have to produce something mind blowing and mentally scary to make up for this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll just say this and bring it to the table; The Fog ain't that bad.\n\nHave you clicked that \"No\" button yet? Great, I'll continue.\n\nFirst off, I don't understand why so many people are being so hostel towards this film and the people who like it. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions. If someone liked this movie, let them, its OK! You are allowed to like it and you are allowed to hate it. Movies are made to entertain and if you were entertained by this, great! If not well, I'm sure there are other films that many other people hate but you like. Not everyone has to have the same thoughts about a film. I'm still amazed at some of the stuff that I read on these boards, the lack of courtesy is mind numbing.\n\nRupert Wainwright's \"Fog\" was nowhere near as bad as so many have made it sound. There, I said it. I am literally, to this day, at a loss over the sheer overwhelming barrage of by-the-numbers negative reviews it has received since its initial release. Not just negative, mind you. These people are very literally picking this apart, weeding out each and every individual aspect they feel the director got wrong. What does that say about why we go to movies in the first place? When I pay to see a film, especially a horror film, I go in with the intent of forgetting my troubles and the harsh realities of the world I live in. Most people, I have noticed over time, seem to demand far too much perfection and realism from their films. To them I say, watch the nightly news. You will find all the unpleasant reality there you could ever want.\n\nWainwright's retooling of \"The Fog,\" while not as overly scary, is a fine companion piece to the landmark original. Some may disagree with that assessment. But, before anybody makes the foolhardy assumption that I don't know what I'm talking about, I will go on record and say that I have been an avid follower of horror for the last eightteen years of my life. I own John Carpenter's \"Fog\" on DVD and, like many here, hold that film in the highest regard. For the longest time, I have been struggling to understand why people who claim they are so steadfastly against the idea of remakes bother wasting their money to see them. I made the same argument in my review of the recent \"Amityville Horror\" remake. If somebody is already resigned to feeling bad about a remake, logic should dictate that they stay at home or pay to see something else. Such reasoning really doesn't get any simpler.\n\nHaving said that, I really must be honest and tell everybody here that I did not see one single solitary thing wrong with this movie. Nothing at all. Spooner, that \"token\" black character people constantly whined about.......what was supposed to be so annoying about him? I take public transportation to work and see people far worse than him each and every day. The changes to the story that differ from Carpenter's original were all handled pretty well. The way some of these nitpickers have been talking, I went into this film expecting ninety minutes of audacious hellfire and brimstone. Well, as hard as I looked, I just didn't see anything that backed up all the negativity. Many people, too, it seemed had a problem with this newer film's ending. Why? What makes this ending so stupid and hard to swallow? Considering the dreams Elizabeth was having throughout the film, I thought the ending made perfect sense. Say whatever you want, but it worked.\n\nThe main question I feel compelled to ask is: Did the fans who went to see this really believe they were going to see an exact carbon copy of the same original film? Folks, the original film was done twenty-six years ago! The world is a far different place than it was in 1980. Sensibilities have changed just as much as our own individual attitudes towards film. Rupert Wainwright is not John Carpenter. He has a completely different style and approach to film-making. While I do agree that this was not a blockbuster, in any real sense, I also do not believe it was the irredeemable garbage it has been unfairly labelled as. Many of the purists out there complained over the fact that it hit theaters with a PG-13. Why? The tone of this movie was really no different from Carpenter's. Had he released his version of the film today, it too would have received the same rating. It basically all goes back to what I said in my review for \"Darkness Falls,\" and it bears repeating here. Every single horror film, contrary to popular opinion, does not have to be a gratuitous bloodbath to get me in line at the ticket booth. All this idiocy is why I take simple word of mouth for what it is. I'm not disrespecting anybody else's opinion of this film, because that's not what I'm about as a person. But, you'd better believe I'm standing by mine. Regardless of what anybody says, this was not a bad movie. \"House of the Dead,\" yeah, definitely. This one, no, not even close.\n\nEnough with all the nitpicking please. If you can't commit yourself to suspending disbelief in horror, fantasy, or science fiction, you plain and simply have no business watching it. Sorry for this rant, but somebody had to say it."

I mean this was bad. someone said, at least it wasn't as bad as \"the village\" i said at least the village has a plot, at least the village had thought put into it, at least the village had a big name director. This movie is a disgrace to our film industry. To think we actually put out movies like this. It is disgusting, we need real entertainment. This is my cry for help\n\nHELP"

Well, most of them. But this one is a perfect example why not to remake a classic. Even on the cover of the DVD you could see that there wasn't a bloody shot in it. There wasn't even one scary moment in it. And to make it worse, the shower scene even didn't contain any nudity. When the 'ghosts' came on screen it did remind me of Pirates of the Caribbean. I even can't understand why it is rated for 16 and above her in our country. I could watch it with my 9 year old daughter. She would never be afraid of it. What a waste of time."

The soundtrack is updated, the cast is much easier on the eyes, but the story (with a few minor details changed) is remarkably the same. And once the film gets going, Carpenter's creepy and suspenseful piano music ties you to the original while the updated fog effects modernize the film. And yet the style of suspense and scares are the same brand, without resorting to buckets of gore.\n\nThere are always going to be those who will automatically bash a remake without seeing it and occasionally I'm one of them. And to be certain, many of them are pretty crappy. The Fog (2005) isn't one of them.\n\n-Mikey"

That's how I felt about the \"new and improved\" version of THE FOG, which was based on the 1980s classic from John Carpenter. What a waste of time and money! Guess I should have stayed home watching the grass grow, which would have been much more entertaining than having to endure this piece of sludge! I had to laugh when I read the reviews from folks (mostly young 'uns, it seems) who saw this movie right after it came out - what were you people smoking?! A lot of those folks seemed to think the movie had some redeeming qualities - WRONG! It this is your idea of a good movie, then I'd hate to see what you consider \"crap\" as far as movies goes, because you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nOnce again, Hollywood proves that it no longer is capable of coming up with an original concept, even for a remake, thus further convincing me that we have seen the best they have to offer, and it's all downhill from here...sad as that is. Let's see - that makes how many bad Hollywood remakes from former movies/TV shows over the past few years - too many to count by my reckoning.\n\nNot even Smallville's own Clark Kent (Tom Welling) can save this monstrosity from total destruction, and I wasn't too impressed with the 2 \"pretty girls\" either - back to acting school with the lot of you. Since this movie was apparently filmed on the coast of British Columbia, near the Vancouver area (near where Smallville is filmed), the people in charge would have been better off recruiting Lex, Chloe, Lana, Lois and Mom and Dad Kent to come on over and make special appearances in this show, which would have then meant we could have our usual Smallville-like \"freak of the week\" episode instead of this garbage, which probably would have been much more entertaining. And don't even get me started on the \"hip-hop daddy\" (what was he doing in Antonio Bay in the first place?), or Father Malone, or the vagrant hobo dude who got swept up in the mystery fog - I'm not even going to try and rationalize what parts those folks had in the movie, or why they were there in the first place.\n\nI'll give this movie a 3-rating, only because of a couple of good moments right near the end, but that's as generous as I can be. Wait for the video to come out - at least then you'll have something else you can do at home when this \"stinker\" has you bored to death after a few minutes. Go rent Carpenter's original from 1980 and enjoy what a \"real movie\" has to offer - you might just be surprised."

        "review_title": "Worships the original, then defecates all over it.",
        "review_detailed_main": "When a remake is released, fans of the original can pick it apart for two reasons. Either it is too reminiscent of it's predecessor and therefore a pointless exercise (see Gus Van Sant's Psycho) or it isn't close enough to the original hence undeserving of it's title (see The Italian Job.) This remake of a low budget John Carpenter horror flick, the second to be released in 2005, manages to fail miserably on both counts. I warn you now, this deconstruction will contain spoilers.\n\nJohn Carpenter was a master filmmaker in his heyday. Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Escape From New York, all cult classics. The Fog did less business than Halloween had done a year before and a lot of people missed it. A shame, because it's Carpenter at his schlocky best, laden with cheese and bad acting, but great fun. Carpenter's gift for creating wonder is evident in the first minutes as a craggy old sailor tells a group of wide-eyed sprogs a tale of the sea that occurred exactly 100 years ago to that day, in which we learn that the founding fathers of Antonio Bay murdered a ship full of sailors and stole their gold to build the town. We are then introduced to the principals. Nick Castle played by Tom Atkins (Lethal Weapon), Jamie Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley and Hal Holbrook camping it up as the impending-doom-fearing Father Malone. That's a tradition of that time in which all horror films needed a worried looking priest to hold it together. Chaos ensues, there are jumps and scares galore and if someone comes knocking at your door in the middle of watching this movie, you will jump six feet in the air, as the wronged sailors return through the fog to wreak vengeance on the towns people.\n\nNow, to 2005. Smallville star Tom Welling, Lost star Maggie Grace and Hellboy's Selma Blair all play roles taken straight from the original's screenplay. Hell, even some of the lines are direct from the 1980 flick. The first hour for the viewer who has seen the original, is deja vous as the movie plays out much in the same way. There are a few changes. The budget is bigger so the gloss shines through and some minor character changes are weaved in. Still, you're watching the same movie. In a 10 minute period, all mystery and fear (if you had any to begin with) evaporate as the story that our craggy old seaman told at the beginning of Carpenter's Fog is played out in flashback. Then, the ghosts start talking. Then the main honcho who could just as well be Cap'n Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean, kisses Maggie Grace's character and, well, it just doesn't bear talking about. Gone is the fear of the creeping fog bank. Gone are the faceless ghouls who will stop at nothing to get their revenge. Now you just wish they would have left it alone. Where the original had a dynamic ending, in this film the ghosts just leave. Honestly. It's like Michael Myers taking off his mask and sitting down to have a cup of hot tea with the kids.\n\nNormally I would judge a remake on it's own merits, but this doesn't have any and it's insistence on following the original so closely for most of the run time revokes it's \"stand alone film\" privileges. Despite some creepy images, the direction from Stigmata helmer Rupert Wainwright is downright tiresome. Some of the film's most intense scenes are intensity free due to his overuse of slow motion and the uneven but overall snail like pace. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are dull. Simply dull. They aren't like that on their respective TV shows. They have potential. It just goes to show that sometimes, actors need to do the high profile movie, good or bad, to get money and attention. In summation, see the grainy, low budget, badly acted original and enjoy, because this big budget update can't stand under the weight of it's unnecessary CGI and poor direction. If you see one Carpenter remake this year, see Assault on Precint 13."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked \"The Fog.\" It's flawed but very satisfying. Why? It's not cheesy or arrogant or trying to define \"the new horror.\" There aren't any puns or pop culture references. It's an old-fashioned ghost story that delivers the goods \u0096 moody atmosphere, tension, big scares. That's \"The Fog\" in a nutshell. It won't disappoint realistic expectations.\n\nThe set-up is pretty simple. Antonio Bay is one of those places where everybody knows who you are and everything you've ever done. Tom Welling is a charter captain named Nick. His character is the least flushed out, but he's shirtless four or five times, so you forgive the two-dimensionality. He's had a fling (or three) with Selma Blair's Stevie Wayne, the DJ who owns the island's radio station and broadcasts from the lighthouse all by herself. Luckily Selma Blair doesn't need anyone else to fill the space. Maggie Grace is Elizabeth, Nick's other fling who mysteriously returns to Antonio Bay only six months after leaving for Manhattan. There's also a pompous mayor, a constipated mother (Elizabeth's), a drunk priest and a Black Guy - Spooner, who completes the quartet of main characters as Nick's first mate and best friend. Spooner's played by Deray Davis, a handsome guy who deserves more screen time. But he is given a role with actual meat, more than one choice scary scene, and more to do than the expected token minority/comic relief.\n\nSomething happened in Antonio Bay more than a hundred years ago. There was a fog that night and a lot of people died horribly. The ghosts have now come back (the \"Why now?\" is never really explained), and they are seeking revenge on the descendants of Antonio Bay's forefathers. Yes, there's something *in* the fog... about a hundred angry dead guys who can kill you in lots of different ways.\n\nThe special effects are good but not great. The foreboding \"wall of fog\" look doesn't impress, but on a smaller scale it's strange how eerie fog can actually be, especially when its acting to isolate, and especially cause we the audience *know* there's something in there.\n\nThe death scenes are unique enough and deliver excellent scares. With one notable exception (an old man follows a rope into the ocean and drowns - for no apparent reason) the body count impresses. I also like the \"what you don't see is scarier\" approach. The best way to explain it is to say this movie tows the line between on-screen horror (stabbing deaths, characters being lit on fire, and so on) and off-screen jump jolts.\n\nThe acting isn't the best part of the movie but it's fine, people. Selma Blair and Tom Welling are actually perfect in their respective roles. Deray Davis was good, and yes has a few lines of comic relief. He and Welling make an excellent duo because they're not smarmy or annoying. They act and talk like guys act and talk. Less can be said of the relationship between Welling and Grace, who look great together (like an ad for J. Crew) but don't make a very convincing on-screen couple. There's plenty of heat but... I'm not sure it's believable."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story takes place in the small, secluded town of Antonio Bay, which is falling victim to a deadly fog containing revenge-seeking lepers killed many years ago by the town's 4 founding fathers.\n\nThe beautiful Tom Welling (\"Smallville\") does a great job with his acting. His character is believable and he pulls it off well. Undoubtedly the best part of the movie. Maggie Grace and her character seemed a bit bland to me. Not particularly horrible, but the character definitely could've been portrayed better. I liked Selma Blair and DeRay Davis. They both did good jobs.\n\nA good part of the movie was the CGI and special effects which were both well done. Images were spooky, but not necessarily scary. The movie as a whole wasn't scary at all. The scariest parts being some of the more graphic images and unexpected loud noises, which aren't even bad (scariness-wise).\n\nThe movie wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. The storyline was predictable for the most part (although the ending did leave me a bit confused) and it wasn't scary. I did enjoy the movie, however. The trick is really just to walk into the theater not expecting much. I didn't walk in hoping to see some fantastic horror movie. I was expecting a movie with a straightforward plot with some run-of-the-mill scares. It was pretty much what I expected, so I wasn't disappointed.\n\nJust go and take it for what it's worth and enjoy it for what it was supposed to be: a good, old-fashioned ghost story. I'd recommend this as a good movie to see if 1.) You're looking for a fun Halloween flick to see with some friends, or 2.) You're a big fan of Tom Welling. If you like him, it'll be worth it."

The residents, of the island, cheat them out of their money and cause the deaths of the lepers. 100 years later the lepers spirits return and extract vengeance upon the ancestors of the settlers. This story had more holes than swiss cheese. What purpose would vengeance on the ancestors of their enemies serve? Their enemies still benefited from the murders and the ancestors really did do nothing wrong. The sins of the father should never be extracted upon the son. It was a bad story. The remake had all the same aspects with a slight twist at the end. The twist was about as interesting as the rest of the film though--none. The newer version not only stays with the original concepts, but the grade B acting (from the original) seems like Shakespeare compared to the newer version. The only decent part of the remake is the special effects; which are few and far between. This is a rental only--but even a $2.00 rental seems like a rip off after watching The Fog."

Other than in the original version of John Carpenter from 1980 you will have a hard time to get attached to the actors for the character development is blend and most of the dialogues are quite off. Especially the two leading characters played by Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are an epic fail. However, John Carpenter himself was sitting on the producer chair here, so he must have seen something in this movie. And there is actually some quite good stuff in it as well. The animation of the fog itself looks great and I totally love how they changed the 1980's zombie look of the crew to a transparent but still great looking ghost appearance. The showdown also is very great, with an unecpected ending and therefore I consider it quite entertaining. If you really expect a remake of the original, you will be pretty disappointed, for only very little details carried over to Rupert Wainwright's take on of the material. After all it would have been really interesting to have Carpenter direct this classic once more and bring it up to the standards of the modern times!"

They need to show the original then the newest right after. I don't understand why they don't show the 70 and 80s horror movies so many great ones. They keep showing the same ones over and over. The actors and actresses in this show were good, but should made this make over scarier. Like Halloween that is so crazy he ever died make way too many movies , and Saw come on why keep making new movies. So Many gory movies to play on TV especially around October."

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing I can say about this remake is, I LIKE IT! The only star I remember is Tom Welling from \"Smallville\". Unlike the 1980 version of \"The Fog\" that had star appeal. The remake had sex appeal. The real scary part about the movie is the fog itself. It's just as scary as the original, only without all that gore. The scare factor was not lost in this movie. The excitement factor was there as well. It's OK for people to express their opinions about this one and the original. The descendants of the founding fathers of Antonio Bay lived with the guilt for a long time and unlike the original, they had a resident named Spooner(DeRay Davis) who said his fathers from Chicago, at least he was the innocent ones in that town. After finding the inaccuracies in the memorial, it really didn't matter. Lies and shame plagued the town and the people knew it. Elizabeth(Maggie Grace) was the only sacrifice who went with the dead, while everyone else, paid for their shame in the past. This version show they got avenged, despite some of the changes the ending had in-between feelings. All I cared is that the spirits will finally rest. How you feel about it is up to you! Beware of the spirits, this movie is more mystifying than the latter. Rating 3 out of 5 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is not that good but it is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. The original was done by John Carpenter. I believe John Carpenter would feel that it was done pretty good justice. It has removed the cheesy pirates that were in the original and replaced it with a more supernatural feel to it. Though some of the deaths in the movie are fairly cheap at times, I feel for a remake it is all around not bad. Anyone who enjoyed horror movies of the 70's & 80's then you want to check it out. I enjoy goofy and great old school horror movies. When a remake is done it should be far superior than the original or at least attempt to. This movie stays very close to the original which I enjoyed. Again this is not a great movie and it is border line crappy but it is not as bad as everyone reviewing it makes it out to be. It's a good Halloween time movie to watch on TV if it comes on. As much as I love John Carpenter I feel this movie is definitely better than the original. Not a lot better but it still is. Don't go out of your way for this but if it's on and it's in the Spirit of Halloween time then give it a watch with a few beers. Take it for were it came from."

The special effects are okay i like especially the part where the kid runs from the fog.

        "review_title": "This reattempt of The Fog suffers from classic remake hatred",
        "review_detailed_main": "The 2000's have been a time when the horror community fuelled with rage and hate, as the mainstream film industry took over beloved classics such as \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"Halloween\", \"Day of the Dead\" etc only to rehash them with modern film equipment and technology which usually insults the original film and its fans. Because of this horror buffs and film lovers in general, hesitate when a \"Escape From New York\" or \"Fright Night\" remake is in the works and typically it will be slandered as \"one of the worst films I have ever seen\". This 2005 remake of John Carpenter's 1980 film \"The Fog\"\n\nis listed as one of the worst, however when I watched it I didn't really see anything that wrong with it other than typical horror cheese and its lack in effective substance.\n\nOf course most horror films have cheese. When I watch the original \"The Fog\" (which I adore) I can't help but feel a little embarrassed when I see ghosts with glowing red eyes but that is all a part of the dating process so that isn't really anything to hold against the film. This version does the exact same only with cheap computer graphic ghosts and burning, rotting flesh \u2013 it's cheesy and it dates a lot faster than effects from the 1980's. It really backs me up when I say the film industry jumped ahead of itself before truly mastering CGI whereas today we have films like \"Avatar\" and \"Clash of the Titans\" which do have quite impressive computer visuals. Other than these moments in the film which occur in the last thirty or so minutes, there isn't really anything too horrendous that the original didn't do other than its lack in atmosphere and scariness.\n\nWhat this movie was missing the most was suspense and thrills. It has a good opening, twenty minutes of opening shots of the island, the sea, crashing waves, fog horns etc. which create a serene, creepy setting accompanied by a particularly chilling piano score, only the film moves on from its focus on horror and atmosphere and moves into a series of events plodding around with uninteresting characters rather than creating any truly suspenseful scenes. Even when it's trying to create suspense and creepiness you can't help but care less as the characters are so plain and boring to watch.\n\nThe acting is passable but it doesn't redeem the poorly crafted characters. We have pretty boy Tom Welling who has no character development at all, the script attempts it but not well enough. He is the main character and couldn't be more uninteresting and forgettable although luckily Tom Welling isn't a bad actor otherwise that would be a real problem. Maggie Grace is no better but fortunately enough isn't droll to watch on screen. Then there is Selma Blair who I really wish was written into the script more as she was the only person in this film I came close to liking; however as Stevie Wayne she doesn't quite cut it. Then we have the token African American comic relief; DeRay Davis's character \"Spooner\" which by the year 2005 this textbook joker should have left out of screenplays.\n\nRupert Wainwright's remake of The Fog certainly isn't one of the worst remakes out there. It is quite cheesy at times but personally I found it stuck sensibly to the 1980 version rather than humiliating itself and insulting the original like many remakes do. It is a rather forgettable film as there are no overwhelmingly great moments, it didn't really go anywhere further than the original film did and the cast of characters are flat and have no substance - this movie is bland not bad. Still, there are far worse out there that deserve heavier criticism than this 2005 remake gets."

        "review_detailed_main": "The gentle glow of a morning mist flows across the sea and it makes you wonder, can there be something hidden in that cloud? That question can take a toll on your mind when it's around midnight and a giant fog bank is now flowing across the sea onto land. The Fog takes that idea, originally made by John Carpenter a while ago, and remade it into a joke rather then a scary question. The Fog packs one to many boring moments into a long movie that just treads on and on with no sense of horror or entertainment.\n\nYoung Nick Castle and his girlfriend Elizabeth suspect their island of a hidden secret when finding a diary of one of the islands founders. The night before, a large fog bank rolled over Nick's boat and everyone except for his pal Spooner is killed off. Spooner gasps it was the Fog but no one believes him. The truth unravels as Nick discovers the island was founded by lepers, leaded by a rich man named Blake, who was ambushed and attacked on the sea's waves by the fake founders of the island. Now the town is being haunted by Blake and his team of ghost in the fog banks and it's up to Nick and Elizabeth to save the whole town. Yawn.\n\nThis movie made me shed a tear. Not because I was so into the movies depth and genius, but because I was bored to death. I promise you there is not one moment in this whole film that will reach out and catch your mind and make you enjoy it. The movie is so slow and badly paced that it will make you leave the movie running as you go find something else to do. None of the actors make it worthwhile. Tom Welling plays a younger and gentler Nick Castle with so little enthusiasm, you feel as though he's going to look at the camera and ask \"Where's my paycheck?\" Maggie Grace plays Elizabeth who now has a purpose to be in the movie rather then Jamie Lee Curtises passing on through town character. She makes the role a slap dash dribble of damsel and secret holder. And we have Selma Blair playing the radio mistress Stevie Wayne who looks and sounds like she's sleepwalking through the part with such little acting that she's a complete mess.\n\nThe special effects are alright, nothing special. The only problem is the special effects takes the mystery out of the ghost in the fog. Trying to give the fog a mind of it's own with computer generated ghost sucked. In the original, the ghost were scary because they were played by real people in solid form and you could not see their faces. In the remake, you can see the ghosts faces but can barely make out where they are standing because the frames are so cloudy and cobbled together with fire and smoke. The ghost were trashed apart in the movie, only being in it for a mere three minutes and having a newer purpose to kill. No they're not after a stick of gold, but love. And that my friends is a pure example of Changing the story and it will Suck.\n\nDirector Rupert Wainwright came into this project and actually made it look like a cool movie to see but the film was a big disappointment. It crashes and blows up in the second act and can not pick up one ounce of steam to actually make it enjoying. This movie will move you. It will make you get up and Move over to the TV and turn this pile of trash off. The Fog gets a 1, a complete mess and one of the worst remakes ever. John Carpenter must be kicking himself for this producing choice, destroying one of his classic movies. John, let me give you some advise. Don't remake classics! The Fog= D-"

The only plausible thing about the movie are the beautiful B.C. Locations.There was some interesting shots of the boat and the boathouse early in the movie and they really reminded me of Jaws, ie.

So I guess it's needless to say it just doesn't live up to Carpenter's classic. The 2005 version of The Fog falls into the clich\u00e9 trappings of many modern horror flicks. The characters are thinly-written and are cast with actors much younger than those in the original film. The \"scares\" rely on CGI-created violence rather than on suspense or brooding atmosphere. On top of this the stereotypes are many and the film was obviously created to be pleasing to a certain demographic audience.\n\nWith that said the remake does feature some decent direction from Rupert Wainwright and screenwriter Lew Cooper does produce an interesting, if flawed, re-working of the plot of the original film.\n\nSo, is it as bad as people say? Well, it's no winner but I don't think it's as bad as such lame remakes as The Wicker Man 2006, Black Christmas 2006, When a Stranger Calls 2006, or Prom Night 2008.\n\n** out of ****"

I thought with better technology and CGI, a remake could be a great film and tribute. But the remake of \"The Fog\" was nothing but disappointing.\n\nCharacters can make or break a story. When most of the characters are likeable, it's hard to enjoy the film. The characters in the remake are plastic and stereotypical. The lead character is a two timing loser with an unknown chip on his shoulder, his girlfriend is a narcissistic mental case who tends to disappear for months to the big city on fancies of escaping the fishing island. Of which, the inhabitants of said fishing island are stuck listening to their only radio station which plays off the wall hip and trendy Indy music with a DJ that only speaks in a sexy voice while on air which would drive any town insane after a while. Especially one filled with old fishermen. And ghosts that are lame. The drunk priest. The overbearing mayor. Inept police. The teen who doesn't listen. A local village museum that looks like a small Louvre. You name it, the stereotype is in the film. You'll fill you're Bingo card in the first 10 minutes.\n\nAnd working with fog should provide a ton of opportunities to set eerie atmospheres. But the fog is reduced to cheesy CGI which doesn't resemble fog at all. Just some fake cloud that comes and goes. Maybe the ghosts had bad gas, I don't know.\n\nI didn't find any redeeming qualities in this film. I vote skip this bad remake and find the original \"The Fog\". This one is 100% dud.

As a result, the tension and stakes of the story fall flat.\n\nPredictable Jump Scares: The scares in the film often rely on cheap jump scares rather than building genuine suspense.

This is by far the worst of the horror remakes that came out during the 00's and that's saying something as there were lot of terrible ones during that time period.\n\nThe Plot = Pretty much the same as the original where a thick mysterious fog full of vengeful spirits haunts a small island town off the coast of Oregon, as Nick (Tom Welling) and Elizabeth (Maggie Grace) tries to learn their town's dark secret in order to stop it.\n\nDirected by Rupert Wainwright and his interpretation of Carpenter's original film demonstrates why the remake boom of the 00's gets so much hate as it misunderstands the source material by taking the simple straight forward premise and over stuffing it with baffling ideas and relies heavily on outdated and tired tropes that lacks any sort of passion. The over reliance on the CGI used for the fog itself looks horrendous with the special effects not being quite there at the time to make it look creepier and menacing, but here it just looks fake and fails to muster any sort of scares or weight to the moment and lacks any sort of subtlety whatsoever.\n\nThe cast themselves weren't that bad but given the generic and surface level material they were given didn't help their underdeveloped characters. Tom Welling is a decent actor and does what he can with the role but pales in comparison to Tom Atkins who originated the role. Maggie Grace tries her best but can't do much with the awful material. Selma Blair does okay with her role and Adrian Hough was awful as Father Malone and a complete insult to Hal Holbrook.\n\nOverall 'The Fog 2005' is a typical dire remake that lacks any heart or soul and totally insults the cult classic original in every sense of the word."

I was at this hoping THE FOG would stir some ting of fear and suspense in me. Nope, nothing, Nada. Unfortunately, this writers figured the only way to make the audience involved in the movie was to divulge the weak ghost story at the end.\n\nApparently, the four founding fathers of this Oregon town actually stole the deeds to the land from the true title holders in 1870's. The 'founding fathers' eliminated all evidence of this treachery by killing all future inhabitants. Years and years later, the spirits came back to pay a little revenge on their kin thus bringing us present day (except I think there were a few people who weren't kin that were killed).\n\nClassic scary story that just didn't have enough scare (or acting skills) to make it into a GOOD movie.\n\nQuestion:I'm guessing the head honcho ghost was apparently married to Maggie Grace's 1870 character. He maybe 'returned' for her? If everyone died on that boat, who were Elizabeths (present day)ancestors? Confused about this pointless movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This 2005 remake of John Carpenter's \"The Fog\" (1980) stars Smallville's Tom Welling, as well as Maggie Grace & Selma Blair.\n\nTHE PLOT: A prosperous island community in Oregon is eerily beset upon by a mysterious fog -- a fog full of leprous ghosts who have come back from the dead to wreak vengeance on a town for the \"sins of the fathers\" over a century earlier.\n\nI don't understand the negative reviews of this film, not even a little bit. I'm not a John Carpenter aficionado but I did like his original version of \"The Fog.\" It was slow and it wasn't gory, but it had great locations (Point Reyers/Bodega Bay, California) and a palpable eerie MOOD. This remake is an updating of the story 25 years later. Unless your an uber-fan of Adrienne Barbeau or Jamie Lee Curtis, this film is on par with the original and even superior in some ways. Here are some highlights:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the downside, Selma Blair is so over-the-top hip as the DJ it's actually annoying, but this is a minor criticism; she's fine otherwise. Speaking of excessive, some of the death scenes are so overdone they'll strike some people as more funny than creepy, e.g. Aunt Connie.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a fast-paced slasher gorefest, you won't like this movie. If you're anal about Carpenter's original film, you won't like this remake. If, however, you're in the mood for a well-done, atmospheric, spooky and aesthetically pleasing mystery/horror picture, this 2005 version of \"The Fog\" will likely trip your trigger.\n\nThe theatrical version runs 100 minutes and the unrated version 103 minutes (I saw the latter).\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILERS***):\n\nApparently, the ghost of Blake seeks Elizabeth because, despite being a descendant of David Williams, she's actually the reincarnation of Blake's wife and was one of her ancestor's victims, which explains her mysterious dreams about the Elizabeth Dane. Blake kisses Elizabeth and she transforms into a spirit and disappears as Nick watches helplessly. Obviously the writer of the script (Cooper Layne) wanted to add a love angle & reunion to the leper-ghost story of the original film. I think it's an interesting touch."

But maybe I wouldn't have been that harsh on my judgement, if I was..say 15 or 16 years old.\n\nThe movies goes into the category of teenage horror movie, where the plot is very predictable from the beginning. It goes into the mould, like the The Nightmare on Elm Street and alike. You have the small town, with the spoiled blond from a rich family (Maggie Grace from Lost, is reminding me of the spoiled blond..erh, Kelly?...from Beverly Hills 90210). She should have the award for overacting. And then you have the hero type kind of guy (Tom Welling). I think, he did a good job in the Superman series. But here, you get the feeling, that he wants to be anywhere else, but in this lousy movie. When he tries to look serious, he almost looks like he about the laugh his pants of. All the other characters in the movies, is alike stereotype, or cartoonish. It also fits the teenage-horror-movie-mould, because you have all the typical things, you see in teenage-horror-movies (Who said \"Scream\"(1996)?). The token black dude, with a streetwise talking', who get killed when he (and his buddy) are about to have sex with two chicks on a boat. But then the fog is coming from the sea, with some creepy ghost-pirates. And oh my gosh...they are getting killed. The fog with all the ghost-pirates inside, goes on terrorizing the small neighborhood. I must admit, I had to see the movie in tree parts, because, I got the urge, the take my dish wash, to paint one of my rooms, and have a snack. But I did it...I saw the whole movie. And it wasn't good. There you had it, you are warned. Ofcouse you should see movies like this, just to be entertained. It's not meant to be something thougfull. A night with popcorn, candy, friends,and the tube-kind of movie. But it's not even worth that."

I joined Blockbuster just so I didn't have to spend almost thirty dollars to buy it and I am glad I did. I'd rather lose five dollars than thirty. Maggie Grace was just irritating throughout the whole movie. It wasn't even believable that Tom Welling had any feelings what so ever for her and it looked like he was more into Selma Blair.

Debra Hill probably wants to return from the grave and take revenge on the film makers of this movie, just like the ghosts from this film. From the director who brought us such classics like \"Blank Check\" and \"Stigmata\" comes THE FOG...remake.\n\nFirst off, the 1980 The Fog isn't one of John Carpenters best, but it is still a good horror movie with great chills, cinematic directing, and a creepy musical score. Remaking The Fog was a risky decision, but it could've worked; the original was missing a lot of things, so a remake could piece them together to make an excellent horror film. For example: GORE. Despite an R rating, the 1980 film has very little blood. So a remake could've added the gore to make it even more cringe-worthy. Look at The Blob, the 50's version has no gore at all, but the 80's remake is basically the same film, just arguably one of the goriest films of the 80's. But no, the producers went with a PG13 rating here just for more money.\n\nThe acting is bland, the writing is like something out of a SyFy channel movie, the CGI is hokey and laughable, the ghost sailors aren't scary whatsoever, and everything in between just sucks. The ghosts and fog are CGI, and it looks abysmal. The ghosts in the original were dark, mysterious, quiet, and had glowing red eyes that haunted your mind. Here, they just look like typical Haunted Mansion ghosts. Most of the time, we don't even see them, people just get attacked by nothing. The fog itself doesn't look as near as scary as the real fog in the original.\n\nThe characters suck too. The originals' cast was played by ADULTS, who did ADULT things in ADULT situations. This time, 90% of the heroes look like they haven't graduated from high school yet, so we have TEENS doing TEEN things in adult situations, which doesn't add up. Every girl in the movie is hot, and has at least one skimpy dress scene. The love interest that the producers through in was terrible and pointless. We even have a token black guy for comic relief! Why does THE FOG need a comic relief black guy? Imagine if Halloween had a token black guy, or The Thing.\n\nOverall, this is by far the worst remake of a Carpenter/Hill film, and one of the worst horror films to be released in theaters...ever. The Thing prequel may have been disappointing, the Assault On Precicnt 13 remake may have been bad, the Halloween remake may have been even worse, but THE FOG takes the cake. I'll be waiting for an Escape From NY remake with an all teen cast, CGI explosions, and a token black guy."

Be prepared to endure a storyline that often does not make sense, and i know it's a clich\u00e9 in horror movies for the characters to do dumb things but there are points in this film that truly show it up as a work of fiction, and as we all know, the reason why horror movies can be so good is because of how real they can seem. In conclusion this is not so much a horror movie as it is a new shiny coaster for my coffee cup."

The moody setting was pretty much intriguing and so were the characters. But this 2005 film has the thrills alright, thanks to the enhanced special effects and make-up, but it is low on substance. The characters are cardboard-like. The incredible premise seems too hackneyed. Further the effort to make this spooky film almost shows throughout the film. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are both okayish, and they sure would have done well in a better film. It is a lesson to all that remakes are a strict no-no, unless they are made with the intent of making something better and more contemporary."

        "review_detailed_main": "2005's remake of the classic film \"The Fog\" had everything going for it: An eerie title with prior association, the late Debra Hill as a producer, and a hot cast including Tom Welling, Maggie Grace and Selma Blair. Unfortunately, \"The Fog\" didn't live up to the hype, and was over-all, rather boring, and definitely not scary.\n\nIn typical horror-fashion though, something that happened in the past finally comes full circle to destroy a sleepy island town, and when it comes down to it, it is quite likely that the viewer will be wanting this mysterious fog to destroy the town, simply because there are absolutely no characters that you can care about. Hottie Tom Welling is rather stable as his character Nick Castle, while Maggie Grace is somewhat devoid of emotion as his returning girlfriend Elizabeth Williams. Unortunatly for the both of them, who are fine actors, their characters are so boring and underdeveloped that if they weren't nice to look at, you'd probably want to watch the trees in the background. So little is revealed about them that they can hardly be called leading characters.\n\nThe same goes for Selma Blair, who plays radio host Stevie Wayne, and while she is quite lively, this is a far cry from Blair's terrific performances in \"Cruel Intentions\" and \"Kill Me Later\". DeRay Davis is terribly annoying as Nick's friend Spooner, Rade Serbedgia is unrecognisable as Captain Blake, while true to horror form, the figures of authority are bumbling idiots. Even Elizabeth's cold mother Kathy, though Sara Botsford does really well in the small amount of screen time she is given. The only character that you really hope survives is of course Stevie's son, Andy, played by Cole Heppell, who gives a fine performance and shows some promise for a serious career in acting.\n\nOther than boring characters, the plot of the film is rather convoluted, and while that's nothing new in horror, this \"Fog\" doesn't really turn out to be horror, and while the flashback scenes are quite interesting, taking place at various points in the film (including one particularly sad and disturbing scene towards the end) they are quite distracting from the present-time story. In saying that though, the film does have some positive features - the special effects are decent, and the cinematography crisp and effective. That alone however does not make the film a \"must-see\", especially as the gang from Scooby-Doo could have solved the mystery far quicker these wannabes. It's a terrible shame that one of the lovely Debra Hill's last films is so disappointing. R.I.P. Debra Hill."

Little do the survivors realize that there's a deadly mystery hidden in the town's past that has come back to get revenge.\n\nThe original film is pretty good. It isn't great but it is entertaining to watch. The remake is the type of horror film you expect to come out in January. It was very disappointing and it offered very few scares. They changed the story a little. The characters are younger and the two main characters know each other. There are also a few other changes though it doesn't matter since the film is bad.\n\nThe acting is horrendous and brought the film down quite a bit. Tom Welling is okay in Smallville but he can't carry a major film. His reactions and overall performance is very bad. Maggie Grace takes the role of Elizabeth and gives a horrible performance. I wasn't expecting her to be as good as Jamie Lee Curtis. However, I was expecting at least a mediocre performance but instead she gives one of the worst performances this year. Selma Blair plays Stevie Wayne and she does a decent job. She is no Adrienne Barbeau but she is pretty good when compared to Tom Welling and Maggie Grace.\n\nRupert Wainwright should probably get the blame for making such a horrible film. He just tries to get as many cheap thrills in there as possible without really trying to move the story along. The story and characters develop poorly and the ending is also poorly done. The ending is so absurd and so random that it kills the film completely. He ends the film awkwardly without really explaining of what just happened. This is the same director that made Blank Check and Stigmata so there's no surprise the film turned out to be a dud.\n\nI also blame the studio for releasing such an atrocious film since they were probably pushing for a PG-13 horror film. If it was rated R, I'm certain that the film would have been so much better. Of course, the studio was more concerned about money (which makes sense) and the final result is not good. In the end, The Fog offers very little in scares and creativity and it's not worth watching at all. I would recommend going out and renting the original which was a lot better. Rating 4/10."

Stevie Wayne is the local radio DJ, who is interested in Nick.When Elizabeth Williams comes back from New York, Nick can't be happier. Though on Elizabeth's return, everything goes awry. A mysterious fog has come from sea, with inhabitants in it; murderous ghosts. The ghosts have come back to Antonio Bay for revenge on the descendants of the founding fathers of the town; Nick, Elizabeth and Stevie.\n\nIn the realm of remakes, The Fog is one of the worst movie remakes. While the bases of all remakes just fall short of surpassing the original version, The Fog doesn't even come close. Even on its own merits The Fog would cause enuresis; which wouldn't surprise. Taking every clich\u00e9 possible, its hard not to be bored within the first thirty minutes.\n\nWhile John Carpenter may have produced this film, it misses all the parts that made his film so good. When you look at John Carpenter's films, they aren't great pieces of cinema; dodgy dialog, hammy acting, but Carpenter always made them work and made them enjoyable. Carpenter has always place some sort of social commentary in his films, raising them beyond pointless entertainment. This version of The Fog missed every mark. The script is emaciated, like the script writers brain, with terrible dialog, perfectly match by awful acting. While credit could be given to Rupert Wainwright, trying to make a film based on atmosphere, but it fails miserably. The scares rely on loud sound effects, which is a poor mans way to evoke scares from a loud soundtrack.\n\nTom Welling should stay of the big screen, sticking to the small screen for smallville. Maggie Grace performance is absolutely painful to watch. Selma Blair is the strongest link the acting, yet she gives one of her weakest performances.\n\nIt could slip you into a coma, so The Fog is one to keep away from, if you like your brain not to be damaged."

Again, very overplotted, but I ignored all of that. I think it'll be disappointing on DVD because you need the talkback-theater screaming in the dark LOUD experience of seeing it live, but damn if I didn't enjoy it. Yes, the ending was silly and really didn't have to be there, but it'll give you something to argue about. Even if I hate a movie I like it to be debatable. The Fog is VERY debatable. Love it or hate it, you'll want to talk about it. And it's fun. Not as good as the original in screenplay, drama, acting, or tension, but it was still a more enjoyable movie because there were big loud scares and it moved very quickly.\n\nSee it if you like to jump in your seat, like to roll your eyes, and like a scary movie that isn't afraid to try something different even if it fails in doing so. Honestly, the actual quality of the movie? 5. The experience of seeing said movie? 9. Really."

The whole \"atmospere\" of the fog was very scary. I wouldn't worry about the gore factor, because I don't remember much blood at all. If you like zombies, stabbings, car crashes, windows breaking,and and a mysterious fog, this if a good movie for you to go see. The deaths and fright may seem lame at first, but your in for a frightening good time, as the movie picks up it's pace, and becomes even more frightening."

I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my entire life! I strongly urge everyone to go and rent the ORIGINAL \"The Fog\" by John Carpenter and enjoy how a true director does things. Wainwright is nothing but a wanna-be, knock-off and should quit now.\n\nFor those of you who were totally confused, thought the computer generated imagery, the 'ghosts' in the movie, and everything else sucked... I'm right with ya! Not only didn't Wainwright follow the plot of the movie... but his own version was horrible, erratic, and made no sense! You couldn't side with a character because there was no character development; you couldn't understand the plot because it was to shallow to wade through and really grasp; you couldn't get scared because of all the corny clich\u00e9's that Wainwright wrote in. Can a movie get any worse than this? I think not! We live in the year 2005 - a time when George Lucas shows us the power of computer generated imagery (and amazingly so), when Quentin Tarantino shows us how to develop a story, characters, and show us how are SHOULD be in films (i.e. Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 and Sin City just to name a few), and a time period when we can look at classic and present horror films and not only understand them but use their astounding techniques to make a great film (using George A. Romeo, John Carpenter, and even Rob Zombie). Then we turn around and ask, why with all of this background out there, with so much to learn from, understand, and put forth does a man put out such filth... such fecal trash as this?! Simply because Rupert Wainwright is a horrible director...\n\nSo in conclusion (for now at least), I DO NOT recommend this movie, but I do recommend seeing John Carpenter's ORIGINAL film \"the Fog\"... don't let a cheap knock-off kill such a great movie! Boycott Wainwrights cheap-ass movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"

Selma Blair was also another great character, although she wasn't in it as much as you think.\n\nThe effects were 100% NOT cheesy and very awesome. You would think killer fog would be so stupid but it was done very well in this remake. Without spoiling anything, I can say I really enjoyed the ending and it was done very well. There's also a bunch of pop out scares which is always fun when your in a dark theater.\n\nWhat can I say?

        "review_detailed_main": "If nothing else, the decade following the year 2000 will be remembered as an era of remakes. Everything that has been made previously, be it a film or a video game, they have tried to make again, and with rather mixed results at best. The Fog, an early John Carpenter film that demonstrated his enormous talent for making the simplest stories compelling, has failed to escape the trend. And it is a shame, too, because Carpenter himself would do well to stop revisiting his old glories and relearn what made him one of the most compelling storytellers of the early 1980s. If I could sum up this remake in just one word, it would be \"pointless\". I have not seen the original enough times to remember exactly what the conceit was about the ghosts that inhabited the fog of the original film, but this remake attempts to elaborate on all of the details, and strangely manages to add nothing. The script is a verbatim copy of the 1980 original for the most part, except it tries to explain the deeper motives of the fog-spirits, and thus makes them a lot less menacing.\n\nThe most obvious element to go wrong in this mess is the cast. The original had a cast that, while not lining up for awards, could put on a good performance that sold the story. In place of Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh, we have Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair. Tom Atkins may have always looked like he drank his salary on each film, but he at least delivered his lines in something other than a whine. His equivalent in this film, Welling, is such a timid excuse for a hero one rarely knows whether to wish he would hurry up and die or wish one could punch him. Selma, on the other hand, does a better job in the Adrienne Barbeau role than the film deserves. When done up right, she can actually be quite pleasant to look at. It's just such a pity that the rest of the cast has such a high suck factor that one never really gets into the mood of the story. And that is what made the 1980 version so great. Because one cared for the characters, one got into the film, and it worked.\n\nI also have no idea who edited this dross, but they deserve a good slap in the face, too. Much of the back story involving a profitable trading colony becoming infected with leprosy and fleeing in search of greener pastures is shown in flashback. Granted, I would have used flashback to tell this story, too, but at the right moments. The Fog circa 2005 has so many flashbacks scattered throughout its running length in order to illustrate parallels between past and present that one becomes numb to them just as they are about to illustrate their story point. Horror films of all walks can suffer for having an element overused to the point where the audience becomes tired of it or even bored with it. The contrast between the original Nightmare On Elm Street films and the obviously toned-down to appeal to the juvenile audiences fourth and fifth episodes in the franchise is a good example of what I mean. Think of The Fog circa 1980 as the original NOES, and its 2005 equivalent as the Renny Harlin butchery. Yes, this new Fog really does get that trite.\n\nI must also make a special mention of the Sony Pictures DVD that was released in Region 4, not because it represents the film well, but rather, because it does not. It may have affected my enjoyment of this film even more, because the image quality of the DVD is, to put it nicely, terrible. It is not as bad as the independent releases of neglected films like Dune that are often released here, don't get me wrong, but there is literally so much posterisation, macro-blocking, and mosquito noise during scenes in which we see the titular fog that one could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a VCD. Don't get me wrong, the film is still a piece of manure, but this does tend to affect my enjoyment even more. After all, how can I enjoy the spoils of something being so bad it's... bad, if I cannot help but think of how dodgy the picture looks? Not that these scenes would have had the tiniest shred of suspense otherwise, but this is really letting the side down.\n\nAnyway, everything here smacks of convenience. When we want to make a death scene that is, to the credit of the filmmakers, impressively gory, the fog kills on contact. When it is near the top-billed stars, it does everything from stand still when it gets too close to move backwards away from them. This inconsistent approach to the \"villain\" of the piece has killed many would-be horror films before, but it is amazing to see it done with such aplomb here. Having a graveyard across the road from a town hall is not too far out, and I think a lot of towns would attract less ill-will from disgruntled residents if they were this honest about their effects on residents. But when a town supposedly this remote and isolated that it only seems to have ten residents who all know each other can get internet connections to broadcast web camera video with that kind of resolution, you know reality has taken a rolling turn off the road. Don't even get me started on the computer failure shown at one point.\n\nAll up, this 2005 remake of The Fog is a desecration of a memento from a time when films were allowed to aim for an adult audience, whose intelligence it respected."

In addition, the locations ARE all shot on the West Coast (Vancouver BC and Vancouver Island, BC) and the beaches, scenery, ocean in itself are beautiful to look at. The special effects are VERY well done, the suspense builds and you might have a jump or 5 during certain scenes, good music and sound effects, all in all, a fun horror/thriller with a great cast. The story/script is quite original. Why not give it a go?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen John Carpenter's film \"The Fog\" a few years ago, but I remember it well and how pleasant it was to see it. The original film didn't shed a drop of fake blood, it wasn't the kind of extremely visual film we've grown used to in recent years, with blood spurting everywhere and chunks of flesh flying towards us. Carpenter made a clean film, without the jumps that made us fall out of our chairs, but tense, very tense and full of mystery. And ultimately, that's really what made the film work so well... and that's what this film lacks, precisely!\n\nThe remake maintains, in essence, the script of its predecessor: Antonio Bay is an American coastal city that is about to celebrate the centenary of its foundation when mysterious occurrences and macabre deaths begin to happen, always related to a strange-looking fog, quite dense and somewhat greenish. However, the discovery of an old diary, written by one of the city's founders, finally brings some clarifications: after all, the entire city was founded at the cost of dozens of innocently killed human lives, and now, a hundred years later, his souls are returning from the sea, desirous of revenge.\n\nI confess that I expected more from this film. The truth is, if I didn't really know what happens in this movie (thanks to Carpenter's movie) I don't know if I would understand what's going on here. Terribly poorly written, the script fails to convey the whole story to us, and new audiences run the risk of not understanding everything. It's a messy story, with flaws and missing parts. On the other hand, the film lacks any kind of tension, suspense or functional mystery. It has some good things, it tries to involve more characters, to take the focus away from that isolated broadcaster at the lighthouse, but the truth is that I don't know if this was really a good idea, since the film was much less clear and understandable than its predecessor and none of the characters manages to engage us, or capture our sympathy and interest.\n\nDirected by Rupert Wainwright, it was the last feature film of his career, and although John Carpenter lent his name to the film, he has publicly stated that he was not involved in the project. The cast has several names and actors, but none particularly sounding name, and none of the actors was able to shine or really give us a work worthy of being fully appreciated, in a positive way.\n\nOn a technical level, the film has a fairly regular cinematography and makes good use of all the filming locations used. The visual effects and CGI work quite well, and the fog is truly impressive and even beautiful. But the film's redeeming qualities end here. I would like, as a historian, to highlight in particular my repudiation and disgust for the way they recreated the boat scenes, where we see Blake and his traveling companions. As the event takes place at the end of the 19th century, it is inconceivable and unacceptable that the production decided to use clothing, props and even a ship style from the late 18th century, that is, from a period one hundred years prior to the one intended to be retracted. This is mocking with history, and a sign of utter negligence on the part of the producers and the technical team."

Needless to say the story seemed almost not existent and strung together in some incoherent way and you'll find better plot lines in children's books. I'll be honest though, I watched the movie half-assedly dozing off once in a while. I mean, after the first half hour it was apparent that the movie would be a enormous waste of time, but I still sat through it hoping it might get better. It didn't.\n\nAlso, there were numerous times people got thrown through glass and like four scenes where glass breaks. Did the writer have some some odd glass fetish or under the assumption that glass breaking is scary? The only thing good in this movie is that white chick's legs."

Yes, the original IS better but the remake does what it's here to do.\n\nI barely thought of this as a remake since they added this intrigue that changes the feel and movie in general. There's more stress on the back story which is nice but not for a horror movie.\n\nAnother thing that really ruined the movie in my eyes was the deaths. There were more than the original, which was much appreciated, but they were not at all creative. Half of the deaths aren't even shown on screen, =( Bottom line, this movie serves it's purpose and is worth the money to have a bit of fun and a few scares.\n\nHowever, I am still deeply disappointed that it seem just thrown together. I know they were limited with the PG 13 Rule (Enforced by the company) to give it a broader audience, but just seeing the things they mildly did made me wish they had gone with it. I didn't like the romance they attempted to add in the remake; horror should be just horror. The ghosts IN the fog need a bit of help too. I LOVED how we saw their rotting flesh and bones but they shouldn't have been transparent. Yes, they ARE ghosts but it made them feel weak. The 'Ghosts' in the original were ghosts but appeared opaque which creeped me out.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "While it's not the superlative example of his work, John Carpenter's 1980 film 'The fog' is all the same a terrific classic. If a bit more low-key by comparison to his other pictures, it's still a fine example of the atmospheric horror he does so well, blended with good ol' ghost stories. Meanwhile I'm broadly skeptical of remakes in the first place, and I recall well how this 2005 retelling of Carpenter's movie was received upon release. I'll watch just about anything, though, so why not? Well, I'll tell you why not: I don't know whether the fault is best laid at the feet of director Rupert Wainwright, known largely for his work in music videos, or those of Cooper Layne, whose only prior writing credit was 2003 inverted 'Armageddon' knock-off and overcooked blockbuster bust 'The core,' but this updated rendition of 'The fog' is tawdrily overdone in almost every way, and sadly not very enjoyable.\n\nInstead of the atmospheric horror Carpenter delivered, Wainwright's production carries the vibes of a very common, overproduced horror-thriller, with all the sensibilities thereof, of the early 2000s. It's the same mindset that saw 1973 British folk horror classic 'The wicker man' reduced to a bland Hollywood horror-thriller in 2006, only 'The fog' plainly endeavors to be even more \"hip\" and forceful. Revisiting a concept is pointless and counterproductive if you destroy what made the concept work in the first place. This is all the more pitiful given the recognizable names and faces in front of the camera, and the skill we know they possess; the participation of Carpenter and regular collaborator Debra Hill as producers; and the benefits of a substantially larger budget. This remake could have been good and worthwhile, but it is unswerving in its embellishments and adoption of every trope and cliche of its timeframe, and as a result all its best possible value is subsumed. Even if we tried to separate the two features in our minds, and take this at face value, I don't think it would come off any better.\n\nThere actually are some good ideas here; one can glean a sense of how this tried in at least some small part to take cues from its predecessor to build tension, and an uneasy dread air. For that matter, not every divergence from Carpenter's film is an inherently bad one; it's not inherently wrong for this picture to have tried to stake its own claim on the story. Unfortunately, a significant preponderance of the inclusions herein are best described as tasteless, heavy-handed, dull, overblown, or even just plain unnecessary. It's impossible to succinctly delineate all the many ways in which this feature becomes tiresomely unremarkable, ordinary, and pedestrian, but it mostly comes down to a severe lack of any subtlety, nuance, or delicate hand. 2005's 'The fog' endeavors to be extra slick and polished, extra modern, extra outright shocking, and just all around More, with the result that it is invariably Less. Characters are mostly empty vessels, and dialogue ranges from banal to insipid. The scene writing goes so overboard as to either become tacky, rob itself of its potential, or both, and the same can be said of the narrative at large. The titular weather condition even seems like a poorly considered afterthought under the circumstances, and not the deserved focal point.\n\nI feel bad for everyone involved. I certainly don't think Wainwright, Layne, or anyone else intended for this precise outcome, but their effort to give a classic a facelift failed because the notions of the 1980 film do not comport with the style of film-making and storytelling of 2005. The suspense, tension, and thrills this new version should have boasted are greatly diminished if not altogether quashed. The special effects are generally downright excessive and are relied upon far too heavily; the cast are restricted by the extra bombast; the frenetic bent of the presentation isn't stimulating, but instead borders on overwhelming. It's possible that I'm not giving Wainwright's feature enough credit, yet with each additional instance of something that inspires as Too Much, I conversely wonder if I'm being too kind as it is. There is an audience for this, people who will see it and earnestly enjoy it on its own merits. I'm not one of them. Whether by comparison to Carpenter or just for the bluntness represented in this title's contemporaries, I think 2005's 'The fog' is a sadly limping production that tries to hard in the worst ways. If you like it, I'm glad for you. But I can't recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood has not gotten over its John Carpenter remakes, and The Fog is the latest in a series. From the trailers, we were teased that \"there is something in the fog\", but we do not know what. And no, despite being nice to look at and all, the Fog is not at all suffocating.\n\nAntonio Island is celebrating its founding fathers, and we're introduced to the descendants of the Malones, the Waynes, the Castels and the Williams. Tom Welling (Clark Kent in the Smallville television series) stars as Nick Castle, the hero of the story who runs a washout boat business. Maggie Grace stars as Elizabeth Williams, Nick's girlfriend who has returned to the island and somehow feels responsible for the events that transpired when the fog descents. Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne, a single parent running the only radio channel up atop the only lighthouse on the island.\n\nPretty standard fare, one-dimensional characters. What will probably keep you engaged in the movie, is the quest to discover the truth and back story to the entire fog shenanigans. A mysterious menacing looking fog arrives, contrary to physics and wind directions, and strange killings and happenings occur on the island. Age old objects like a hairbrush and timepiece turn up at the beach, and itchy-handed folks pick it up despite us folks knowing bad things will happen.\n\nBut it bores you after a while, with its usual sins of the fathers theme having little depth (ok, so it's a horror flick after all). It's simple, but with potential, which degenerates into almost a Pirates of the Caribbean copycat in the special effects department. And the special effects and makeup could perhaps be the only saving grace in this movie. There are loopholes in the storyline, especially the ending. You understand what the filmmakers are trying to suggest, but it just doesn't make much sense anyway.\n\nIs it frightening? No. It's a tame pussycat in its scares, relying on cheap, loud, clanging and knocking of metal three times to signal the demise of the characters who hear them, knowing that Evil is around and knocking at your door. Any more, you'll probably go deaf with the theatre's surround sound system.\n\nIf there's a movie like The Fog which can be made, perhaps someone would be bold enough to make The Mist, or The Haze in local context. Don't waste your time, you'll need strong fog-lamps to attempt to look at the good in this picture. Being a Tom Welling groupie fan, will probably help."

Too many unconnected dots, scenes out of order (i.e. One of the four 'conspirators' was pulled out of the returning rowboat by a wraith even before the 'Elizabeth Dane' sank), people 'magically' acquired clairvoyant insight (The beach derelict/bum, Elizabeth, etc.), heavy, metal objects (i.e. Silver artifacts for the Dane sinking) impossibly travel miles through deep water to 'wash up' on the bleach, the endless, mind numbing, attempts at 'horror & shock' that come at pinball speed, racial stereotyping (the black guy plays a shallow/stupid, inarticulate/poorly spoken, dishonest, irresponsible, guy only interested in having intercourse with white women), and more of hollywood's endless attacks on those farsighted & brave men that founded this country and made it great. The least that the flick could have offered was continuous gratuitous full nudity of the two female leads and the two girls on the boat for those that suffered through the movie. Save yourself 103 minutes of your life that your can not get back and pass on this one..."

Everything in this movie is bad. The acting, the script, the...Everything, that's all I need to say.\n\nThis version of The Fog sticks pretty close to the original, but in this case it's a downfall. It tries to be new and hip, and it's ridiculous. It's so much like the original, and yet, so much unlike it. They took everything that was creepy about the 1980 film and made it not creepy. For instance, in the original, the ghosts were always in silhouette, but in this, they actually appear as stereotypical transparent ghosts. The director even tried to add a twist, but it made for the stupidest ending in film history.\n\nThe acting was even worse. Everybody in the movie except for Selma Blair, who is terrible anyway, is a TV show actor. They obviously don't know how to act in a movie. This movie was a complete bore fest. I was so disappointed. I actually forgot for a while that I saw this movie in theaters.\n\nJust terrible. 1/10"

Her scantily-clad body may inspire sinful thoughts, but watching the rest of this movie is penance enough to cover them, with plenty of absolution to boot. So pause, rewind, and enjoy, because the balance of this movie blows.\n\nIt begins with some guy getting predictably killed by a monster/ghost/whatever, and then moves on to introduce Nick Castle, the hunky male lead, and the stereotypical funny black sidekick, Spooner. They trade some lame quips while Nick takes off his shirt and displays his hunkiness. We learn he's been getting it on with another woman while his girlfriend is out of town. The \"other woman\" is the radio DJ Stevie, played by the delectable Selma Blair. And believe it or not, *none* of this ends up having any bearing on the plot.\n\nLater, Nick tries to pick up a woman on the side of the road, and realizes it's his girlfriend Elizabeth, who is suddenly back in town, unannounced. We never learn why she left, or where her luggage is, but what matters most is that she is played by Maggie Grace and later she will appear in her underwear. She playfully teases Nick about picking up other women because, unlike women of the real world, she realizes that a guy who sleeps around while his girlfriend's out of town is really a lovable rogue, and not a cheating prick at all.\n\nNick takes Elizabeth to her Mom's house where we learn they don't get along, who knows why. Mom also points out Elizabeth's lack of luggage, but that also remains unexplained. Elizabeth tells Nick as they leave that going there in the first place was pointless. We find ourselves vigorously nodding our heads in agreement.\n\nNext, Nick and Elizabeth have sex in Nick's shower. I hate scenes like this. Hunky male leads in stupid movies always have huge, expensive showers, even if they have no money and live in a tree. Nick drives a beat-up old pickup truck, but he has a shower big enough to park it in. Go figure.\n\nSpooner, meanwhile, is partying with a friend and two girls on the boat, when the fog sweeps up and they die in unsurprising, unfrightening ways. What a waste. To think they could've all partied with Nick in the shower.\n\nFinally, we get to see Elizabeth in her underwear, and the best part of the movie is over. That doesn't stop the wretched film from plodding on: turns out Spooner is the sole survivor of the boat incident, and now now he's a triple-murder suspect. Nick finds a videotape on the boat and hides it from the police because it proves Spooner's innocent. Huh? He gives the tape to Elizabeth, who loses it in the ocean, but the police let Spooner go *anyway*, presumably based on his testimony that \"the fog killed them.\"\n\nThis would all make sense if the fog were actually a huge cloud of marijuana smoke and everyone in the movie was completely stoned. In fact, it would make it a much better movie. As it is, well, Maggie's underwear scene is entirely too short. Pause, rewind."

The acting would probably have been better if they brought in a set of toddlers and gave them the scripts (sarcasm). The best actor was Elizabeth, but that is not saying much. What this story needs is a descent director and a better budget. The computer animation was fairly well done as 2005 movies go. No, what this story needs is someone to streamline the progression of the plot and add more character development while also adding a scare factor greater than negative five. Much of the story, while intriguing, was marred by the bad acting and a management team that deserved to be fired. I, personally, am hoping to see another remake of The Fog in the next decade or so, and when it happens I would very much like to be on the staff or better yet the editor."

The acting is actually decent for a horror flick with Maggie Grace doing a good job of making you care what happens to the main protagonist.\n\nIt's not the most original plot ever and is fairly predictable but if you watch this with an open mind it's not actually too bad at all. It is pretty gore free and relies more on creating an atmosphere so will not appeal to those looking for plenty of bloodshed.\n\nOverall a watchable if slightly predictable horror film and much better than it's current 3.6 rating on here."

What made the original so good, is just like what made Halloween 1978 stand out. Good music, good acting, good build-up of tension, in other words, a good horror atmosphere all the way up to the climax - this one was totally pointless. Why always make a new version when the only new thing added is young faces? The 1980 version would still be appreciated now, and does not need polishing!"

This film however goes beyond this and causes blatant outrage.\n\nGiven the fact that I really didn't enjoy this film it's still one I've added to my collection for prosperity.

Worse, not only did the filmmakers waste the chance to improve upon the original, but they forgot what was frightening about it in the first place. The claustrophobic feeling of being trapped by the fog which was so thrilling in John Carpenter's movie is discarded entirely in favor of CGI ghosts and expositional flashbacks which regularly show up to deflate any potential tension. The fog itself has been animated to seem more alive, yet I found myself missing the fog machine with a green light behind it. All in all, I can find absolutely nothing to recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Generally one remakes a film because they feel there is something missing, something that can be improved on or done better. Sometimes they are updated to make them more relevant to 'today's audience' which is usually code for 'younger/more familiar actors', 'needs more gore' or someone has a career they are trying to promote, depending on the whim of the director. This film has all three, including introducing a needless love story angle which just fizzles based on the way the characters are presented. Instead of a creepy soundtrack, I'm expected to be terrorized by a bunch of pop songs? Hardly menacing in any way and worse, serving to immediately date the film.\n\nThe movie is shot well-its not hard to look at and the people you are supposed to sympathize with are all very pretty/sexy. I was thinking with a little money and some newer actors and the available technology/effects they would at least do something daring with the film. Instead it was one endless nu horror clich\u00e9 after another with CW/television level acting. In addition, the characters were just so unsympathetic. The main character is cheating on the girlfriend with the DJ which is explained away because the girlfriend just \"Up and left town for 6 months\" without saying where she was. Huh? So essentially, she is missing for half a year? When he happens to pick her up on the main road into town, ala Jamie Lee Curtis' character in the original, they just go on like \"hey no big deal, glad you're home! lets have sex!\" Her mom acts like some cold cardboard Ice Storm extra, the priest is either totally drunk or totally sober depending on what scene and \"Stevie Wayne\" the heroine of the original is acted by Blair like some house cat who dialed in what is probably one of the worst performances in the film though not the only one.\n\nWhile the effects in the original film are simply done and creepy due to looking 'natural' (i.e. its really 'fog' they created in much of the first film) almost every sequence where the CGI is used feels forced-I'm thinking particularly of the scene with the aunt burning up but the fog itself is too digitized to be creepy). Really the only sequence that was interesting to watch were with the Elizabeth Dane, where the make up seemed good, the effects natural looking and the acting believable. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the film.\n\nThe only person I felt sorry for was the old man with his dogs but his story arc seems unexplainable and meaningless, other than showing cruelty towards him and his dogs. In the original film, this doesn't even matter. Dogs are shown barking, not being left as a steaming corpse on a dock or worse yelping in pain in the darkness. What would the dead even care about the dogs anyway since the plots revenge angle is about the people? You can tell a lot of this was created to please a very specific demographic (I'm thinking people who watch Buffy or those who feel the Final Destination films are rife with pathos) but if you wanted to see a reasonably scary horror film, this isn't the one.\n\nThis film has so many plot holes that, rather than the viewer being able to ignore them, the film collapses into them. I am not sure why Carpenter was even involved other than writing and directing the original. This isn't the worst film I have ever seen, but I really felt like it didn't do the main thing a horror film should do which was to scare me or at least keep me entertained and it did neither."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original thriller from John Carpenter was considered a minor disappointment coming after the unexpected mega-success of his Halloween, but over time managed to carve out a niche for itself as a classy modern-day ghost story. The remake, yet another in a seemingly endless cavalcade, fails to improve on any of the original's shortcomings and emerges as an underwhelming failure. On a small coastal town's 100th anniversary, vengeful spirits from a shipwreck arise to wreak havoc on the descendants of those who conspired to murder them and steal their fortune. The remake keeps the same basic premise as the original, but jettisons all of the atmosphere, character and quirkiness of the original film. Familiar faces were littered among the original cast, but the remake features no one in particular. Leads Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are very photogenic. Unfortunately, Grace spends much of the film reading her lines in a flat affect and resembling a deer caught in the headlights. Welling may not have been bad had someone bothered to write him a role. As it stands, he gets to take his shirt off once and spend the majority of the film yelling thankless lines like \"Let's get out of here\" and \"Run.\" Selma Blair, replacing the coolly sexy Adrienne Barbeau, is laughably miscast as a sultry DJ. Can anyone honestly listen to her voice and believe any radio station would hire her? The remake slightly beefs up the back story of the ghosts to no avail and contains a completely incomprehensible and pointless conclusion, which is not surprising from a screenplay that still appears to have been in the development stage. A total mess \u0096 stick with the original."

There seemed to be too many minor characters and not enough focus on the lead actors, which might explain their lack-lustre performance - except for Selma Blair, who would have stolen the show if it were worth stealing.\n\nThere are also some great special effects towards the end of the movie if you can wait that long, but you might just wish the fog would come and get you first."

That was not very interesting. Spooner is ICE CUBE minus the fat appearance. All in all, the FOG delivered very few goods. I would suggest watching this movie if you are interested in Leprosy because all the ghosts in THE FOG seem to have this dreaded disease. The worst part about this movie was that annoying lady in the light house. She could not compare to John's wife from the Original movie. The sad thing is, I bought this DVD in Sacramento.

In the small town of Antonio Bay, a terrifying and force hidden within a thick and eerie fog terrorized its residents. Shrouded by the fog lies a ghastly secret of merciless revenge, one that the town's inhabitants would do well to unravel -- before it's too late. This film is obviously a remake from the John Carpenter classic which opened in 1980. This film stars TV's \"Smallvile\" Tom Welling, Maggie Grace and Selma Blair.\n\nI had a feeling this movie wouldn't be satisfying. I absolutely hated how it turned out and this movie has the dumbest characters who don't use their brain. When one of the characters hear and see the fog, they get out of bed and go to check and see what it is, they're walking so slow and this slow horror music is playing, they turn around and their friend is there, who just sticks his hand out to say something. These things in horror movies have to change.\n\nI didn't see the original Fog, but of course it may be a little better than this garbage. It's actually a sign that they got a PG-13 rating and not many critics were screened to view it. So it's a sign that this movie will be terrible. I hated this movie and I feel that there are other horror movies that you should see. Do not waste your time and money to see this movie. Even if you're a fan of the old one, I know you will be disappointed. I was. The Fog has cheap jump scenes that you wouldn't even jump at. Who really cares about the PG-13 rating, there won't be a difference.\n\nSo let me just say again. This movie is trash, garbage and deserves to be thrown in a dumpster. I give it a 1.5/10"

You unfortunately have to keep watching though to find out what the 'real' story behind everything is. In the end, it's not really worth knowing.

I went into the movie unenthusiastic, and came out laughing hysterically and feeling cheated. Everything in it was clich\u00e9 and had lame coincidences. For instance, when Elizabeth falls in the little pool of water in the old boat house, she swims to the side and tries to climb out, the rocks she grabs onto somehow come loose and expose a perfectly shaped hole containing a book telling all the secrets to tie the plot together. WHAT ARE THE ODDS!? It wasn't scary, the ending was incredibly stupid, it had what seemed to be a token black man who had stereotypical one liners and wasn't really necessary. I kind of had the idea it would be lame, after all, it did open up with Fall Out Boy's 'Sugar, We're Going Down.' and not a descent soundtrack. I have no idea why the editor didn't bring it back to the director and say 'Change it, all of it. Just start over.', and the acting was a mess. In conclusion, I hated this movie, it was a waste of time and money, I slap myself for going to see it. However, if you want a good laugh...then I guess you should watch it."

Another thing is why did the fog kill innocent people? like the two girls on the boat? I left the movie with a billion questions about what was going on. The most confusing part, was when the movie went back into the past to see the Elizabeth Dane boat, and then it was in the present? which left me wondering if the people on the Elizabeth Dane were originally ghost? another concern is the ending, the main female character is actually a reincarnated wife? that part must've been added in to add more time to the movie.

Don't be surprised if you can't follow the flashbacks because it seems the director felt it would involve too much common sense to put them into any sort of logical order. Don't worry though, the blonde chick from Lost will occasionally state the bleeding obvious, thus giving you a nice recap of what the **** is going on.\n\nIt seems the only reason this pile of steaming crud managed to obtain a theatrical release was because blondie and Superman agreed to get their kit off and have a bit of rumpy pumpy fun in the shower.\n\nThere's no real scare factor to the movie - unless passive smoking happens to be a grave fear of yours. Occasionally Selma Blair will walk around in her underwear attempting to act cool and trendy - but really she's fooling no-one.\n\nThe special effects are worth a special mention because - let's face it - it looked like someone knocked this movie up on their iMac.\n\nDragging on and using tired fog-gags every five minutes will leave you asking for the final 67 minutes of this movie - 'Why didn't blondie get her norks out twice?'"

But something told me a horror remake in 2005 couldn't beat a classic, and shock, shock...I was right.\n\nThe movie isn't a total waste, just that some things work and some don't. Selma Blair, while indeed a good actress, doesn't fill the shoes of Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie Wayne. And Tom Welling and Maggie Grace, though capable actors (and good eye candy) are poor substitutes for the original cast and seem to only be there to draw in the teenyboppers. Yes, that does mean we get shots of Maggie Grace walking around in her panties and even a shirtless Tom scene.\n\nThe main problem with this new version is that due to bad choices either by the writer or the director, the scare factor is minimized significantly. For one, the ghosts in the fog are often shown as silly CGI zombies that remind you of something out of \"The Mummy.\" At one point the fog forms into a screaming angry face, but instead of being scary it just looks cheap and silly. The ghosts themselves are actually transparent, which weakens their presence, yet somehow they are able to perform tasks the ghosts from Carpenter's original weren't capable of, like attacking people from kitchen sinks (a scene that actually is more comedic than horrifying) and strolling around at ease when there doesn't even seem to be any fog present. Aren't these things supposed to be CONFINED within the fog? Apparently someone forgot that come the finale...\n\nRupert Wainright, try as he may, just isn't capable of pulling off the atmosphere of mystery and dread Carpenter infused into his original. Carpenter's \"Fog\" was downright creepy...a twisted ghost tale set in a small fishing village that had a dark past. It dripped with atmosphere. This one's just a drip. The new town locals are undeveloped and boring and no matter how many wide shots we get of the fog rolling in off the coast of Antonio Bay, it doesn't evoke the same sense of dread Carpenter's did.\n\nThe story was also changed drastically in one respect, and the final outcome is unsatisfying and makes you wonder why they even bothered writing that into the screenplay to begin with.\n\nAll in all, there are some very decent chills and scares in this movie (one scene in particular involving Blair's son on the beach and a vagrant snooping around with a metal detector is very thrilling...), but no matter how many CGI zombies and cheap shocks you have, you can't beat a good classic ghost story with tons of atmosphere...therefore this one is stale compared to Carpenter's.\n\nIt's not as bad as most of the new horror movies out there. But it's just not the original.\n\nSee it to remember why you loved the original so much and to get a new twist on the story plus one or two really good scares. Not a total waste of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there ever was a strong argument against pointless remakes then this would be it!\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the original to be truthful, but it had a story and character development.\n\nThe problem with this awful remake is that it's story is incredibly sloppy and we learn from the first five minutes pretty much everything. I won't spoil it for you just in case you feel you need to see it. The plot holes come thick and fast and what we see is \"anything goes\". what i mean by this is: \"We need the black guy to be seen as he done the killings, but he filmed what had happened\" Right so to get that suspicion we have the girl from Lost magically trip over nothing into the water and lose the black guys camera. So hat happens next? The black guy runs from the hospital out of the window.....Police never chase him, looks like he got away Scott free. (I nice message to all wannabe killers)\n\nAnd it is this kind of sloppiness that miffs me. To think a director and a script writer did not realise what they have created is beyond me. Pure laziness if you ask me, a quick buck for no work. It's unacceptable.\n\nCharacters are hugely undeveloped and are there just to look pretty. Selma Blairs role is a mere cameo, yet early on we are lead to believe a romance happening between herself and the guy from Smallville. Yet it never develops.\n\nHe's girlfriend who has been away (why?!?!) and has come back and for the life of me I don't understand why he is actually with her, their on screen chemistry is absolute stone cold, which leads me to a pointless sex scene in the shower (They look bored!) with clich\u00e9d fade out's and much back rubbing. And these are the main characters! Frightful casting, to think a fairly unknown support TV actress from Lost (and easily the most annoying) and Superman was actually thought that they could carry the film is amazing to me. But as I said they weren't there to act...\n\nThe support roles are even more cardboard and clich\u00e9d. We have a token African American who is beyond stereotypical and annoying person ever. The \"mad misunderstood preacher who saw it all along\" and others I feel I shouldn't waste my time mentioning.\n\nAnd finally to call this a horror is a joke the biggest scare was as cheap as your brother or sister jumping out behind a door at you every hour on the hour for a week. The scares went a little like this:\n\nGhost knocks...Ghost jumps out at victim...Victim dies.....replay that like five times through out the movie and viola you have the suckiest movie I have ever seen! It actually offended me.\n\nSo to sum this film up in a way that reflects how the film was made....Don't, it's awful (repeat five million times in the most annoying voice ever)"

I had switched it off halfway through but thanks to Cedric the Entertainer we came back to watch the rest of it. Yes thats right the only film worse then this has got to be Johnson Family Vacation and we though we'd go back to the lesser evil thatis The Fog.

I was constantly distracted by the ghost in the jaunty hat who appeared in the background in several scenes, mainly as something about it made me think of Jack White from the White Stripes, and, since Selma Blair's song selection (in her role in the film as a radio DJ) seemed tailor made for a teen-friendly soundtrack album, I kept hoping we might be treated to a musical interlude (perhaps during the flashback) in which it broke into a performance of Seven Nation Army. I could go on, but in order to write about this movie, I have to think back to watching it, and I really, really want to erase it from my memory. So to sum up: AVOID!"

And somehow, they managed to take all the classic scares from the first film and find a way to ruin them. Then the film culminates in a nonsensical ending.\n\nOn a purely shallow note, Tom Welling might be one of the most insanely beautiful actors working today, and he's not bad in the film. He shows some presence. On the other hand, Maggie Grace is a good looking girl with all the charisma and expression of a block of wood. There's more spark and chemistry in a 2 minute scene between Welling and Selma Blair then there is in any scene Grace shares with him (including a supposedly steamy shower scene).\n\nWishing for better things ahead for Blair and Welling, and chalk this one up to a learning experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm sure many have been happy with the new \"resurgence\" of horror films in the past couple of years. I'll admit, I do like a good scary movie. But I have noticed that here lately, a lot of horror films have just flat out sucked. And, it seems that the horror remakes have really, and I do mean REALLY, sucked big time. Dawn of the Dead is one of the exceptions, and I was hoping that The Fog (remake of the 1980 John Carpenter cult classic) would join Dawn as a good remake. About the only thing good about this new Fog film is the ultra-hot Selma Blair playing Stevie Wayne. Hearing Selma talk like a phone sex girl turned me on, but it wasn't enough to help this weak remake. How many women can say the words \"low tide\" and make it sound so damn sexy? Not many can, but Selma did it. Still, it wasn't enough. She could not save this train wreck of a film. Hell, not even Superman (Smallville's Tom Welling) could save this movie. Well, I think Welling just wanted to make some extra dough and signed on. Plus, I'm sure he wanted to get next to Selma after hearing her say \"low tide\". I know I would have signed on for that reason...lol.\n\nAnyways, this movie takes you back to when horror films were just plain dumb. If you can remember the eighties, then you remember all the dumb horror flicks that came out. Nowadays, studios want to make horror films PG-13, so they can make a buck. Well, when you do that, you get weak crap like The Fog, Boogeyman, Ring Two (alothough Ring One was very good), and When a Stranger Calls. Now, you can make a good PG-13 horror movie, as long as there is a solid script. The Fog does not have that, nor is it all that scary. There are a few moments that can get you to jump, but a horror film is supposed to scare you. The Fog doesn't do it at all.\n\nSo. What's the movie all about? Well, I will say this without giving out spoilers. The movie tries to tell us why this actual \"fog\" is happening, and why it is killing people. Basically, the \"fog\" is ticked off at Antonio Bay, and it wants revenge. Seem silly? Well, it is, but for me to tell you more would ruin it for those who have not seen it. To be honest, the people in Antonia Bay (present day) are taking the blame for what the towns ancestors did years earlier. That is all I will say about the story. Trust me, once it all develops, you'll still be scratching your head wondering why in God's name this script got approval. It is a basic script, and an easy one to follow. Yet, it has many, many holes in it that are never explained.\n\nIn any case, watch it to hear Selma Blair's sexy voice. Trust me. Her \"low tide\" comment will get you turned on. If you are a guy, suggest this movie (over porn), cause Selma can get ya going. Otherwise, try not to figure this movie out. It is obvious that anybody involved with the making of this film never could figure it out either."

Shrouded by the fog lies a ghastly secret of merciless revenge, one that the town's inhabitants would do well to unravel - before it's too late.\n\nIn 1980 director John Carpenter scared the pants off moviegoers with The Fog and serves as producer for this remake by British director Rupert Wainwright (who also directed Stigmata) .\n\nThe original Fog was set in California, in Antonio Bay. This one was set in Oregon on Antonio Island. The original had the founding fathers of Antonio Bay lure a ship into the rocks, sinking it. This one had the founding fathers board the ship and burn everyone alive. The original had older characters who were experienced at sea. This one had sexy teens having dance parties with bikini chicks on... an old fishing boat. But every other aspect of the story was kept in tact.\n\nProdigal daughter Elizabeth (Grace) and lighthouse DJ Stevie (Selma Blair) are great to look at and both show there acting chops to boot. Here we have a great ghost story from Cooper Layne (screenplay), John Carpenter. The excellent DNA of the 1980 film works again here.\n\nI liked the cinematography, practical and CGI effects well done. The characters to be likable, the relationships were interesting, and the history of the town -- fascinating.\n\nI may be the odd one out , I found this remake of John Carpenter's flick atmospheric, eerie and intense. 8/10"

Unfortunately, that's the sad state of things with horror nowadays.\n\nSome rather shocking (to the point of evoking laughter) bits occurred here and there but on a whole I thought I was getting just what any other contemporary horror film delivers. It was slightly prettier than Carpenter's version probably because of that thing that makes everything pretty in film- what is it again? Oh yeah, money. I can even look over a bad A story line and a flat-lined performance by Maggie Grace. It was entertaining- mostly. One word of advice, please don't try to be clever and reveal what happened 300+ years ago right when the audience gets to see special effects and creepy events. That's just called a saltpeter. That's bad directing or maybe even writing.\n\nAnyway, with all of these shortcomings I was still entertained. I wanted to hate it and was certainly walked to the edge of the cliff by the director and that actress, and yet here I am saying it was better than average."

In the original, Stevie Wayne is a likable character, but in this remake she is portrayed as irritating. The same can be said for most of the other characters. The plot has changed slightly, but don't bother to try to understand it, because the film is so badly made it takes too much brain power. Where Carpenter's plot was original and clever, in this film all the good parts have been omitted and replaced with confusing and pointless ones. I wasted \u00a35.80 watching this film."

It turned out to be a cult classic, because of it's interesting characters, amazing cast, and terrific visuals.\n\nSince the original movie wasn't flawless, how about we remake it with the help of John Carpenter and Debra Hill? Sounds good to me! How about we explore the backstory of the lepers? Sounds good! How about we cast Selma Blair as d.j. Stevie Wayne? Sounds terrific! How about we add in a backstory about Elizabeth the hitchhiker coming back to Antonio Bay so that the Blake can take her back with him to the other side? UHHHHHH...no! This new remake will go down in books as how not to remake a film. I'm not going to dump even more crap on the film. I will point out only it's good parts.\n\nRupert Wainwright's direction is beautiful and quite atmospheric. Selma Blair is wonderful(considering the script)as Stevie and seems to be the only one trying. Umm...that's it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Keep it Simple Stupid is my message to the filmmakers.\n\nThis film doesn't work. Sure, it pieces together at the end and makes sense, but it's one of those films with too many scenes that achieve nothing but bloat.\n\nWhy add another death? We know the ghosts are coming to take out whoever gets in their path, but the message is clear after a few of those. Cut the bulk of the uninventive scenes out -- like cars (yes, plural!) not starting when a zombie is on your tail. Focus on making the good ones better by drawing them out a bit, injecting some suspense and asking yourself, \"Is this scary?\" If it's not, then modify it until it is.\n\nSo after wading through a hundred more scenes of watching zombies and fog kill people, the film finally draws to a close and we get to learn what is going on. Personally, I think this film would have been more effective had we been given the background at the beginning of the film. Instead, we're left wondering what the hell is going on right until the end by which point we no longer care.\n\nA script with more err ... script would have helped made the point of the film clearer too. We shouldn't have to scratch our heads all the time. I'm not advocating dumbing it down, just telling the story more effectively by adding a few realistic conversations -- then it's a win-win situation: by watching the characters communicate, we care for them more, and we follow the story better.\n\nThe pacing was another issue. There weren't enough slow/quiet scenes, so like most modern horror, it felt rushed, which is the director's fault. If you want something to be scary, a buildup can work wonders to frighten someone -- see What Lies Beneath (Zemeckis knows Hitchcock had it right).\n\nThe trouble with this film, like so many others, is that the budgets are too big. Directors make the mistake of putting special effects everywhere they can, instead of where they're needed. Look at some of the 70s horror classics and learn: Keep it Simple (Stupid!) and refrain from making the objective to cram as much crap down our throats as possible, or face the consequence: sensory overload and glazed eyes."

Maybe too pretty. He plays a fisherman in this movie but I don't think any fisherman that I know of shave their chests. The whole cast was sleepwalking through this movie. You might say that they were in a fog. Tom Welling was no Superman, Maggie Grace was Lost, and Selma Blair? More like Selma BLAH! The cast was not the only cringe inducing aspect of this \"movie\". The FX were evil bad. It looked like stock footage from Pirates of the Caribbean. My Playstation 2 had better graphics than this. Overall the movie sucked big time.

This new one is filled with fire, flying glass, people being pushed around by 'unseen' forces, and way too many REALLY fake looking CGI ghosts.

Then to entice pubescent boys & girls they decide to throw in a completely useless shower scene, nothing was shown except for Tom's nipple, which being a straight male is not really my thing. The biggest kick to the head was the lame ass idea to change the purpose of that attack from greed to 'lost love'. Let me point out something about how stupid this part is, just in case you're not getting it, they both died at the same time! Why/How the hell would Elizabeth be separated? The movie just f/ckin blew, worst of the year that I've seen, things just didn't make sense, and characters were next to useless, why did they show the fisherman get leprosy, while no one else was infected? Why the hell did the fisherman show up at the car wreck? He was just plain stupid! Then you have the lamest token black character EVER in a movie! Did they not get the hint while watching South Park that the \"Token Black\" character is played out? It was almost like the Producer one day said \"you know what this movie needs, a funny black guy, kids love that these days!\". The Priest was another useless character, in the original he was the one that explained everything, he was more of a functional drunk, in this one, and he was just sitting around waiting to be killed\u0085 LAME.\n\nOn a final note: what the hell was the purpose of the burning vehicles? They weren't in accidents, they just where curbed parked and on fire\u0085 STUPID!

There is something hiding within the fog and certain nasty town secrets seem to point to the explanation of what is going on. **cue the cheesy horror film music**\n\nIn this age of easily accessible digital effects, this is yet another horror film, that despite great potential with the aid of these effects falls flat on its face and ends up being stupid. Like with 'Boogeyman' the story dissolves to mediocre computer images that are supposed to be scary. Not even close and definitely no cigar. Of all the horror films made before digital effects were prominent, John Carpenter's 'The Fog' could have really used computer aided help to cover up the limitations of its all practically generated special effects. Instead the film makers decided to go all out, and I really mean all out. The ghosts are computer generated, certain death scenes are, and to make things worse it is all right on screen in plain sight. Which effectively takes out any horror and creepiness that the original conjured up so well despite its limitations. Another thing is the changing around of certain character relationships: they are all cookie cutter soap opera young pretty people crap and that's quite pathetic really.\n\nThe only positive thing here is the explanation of the back-story. A sequence shows us the sins that the townspeople committed back in the day and it is really the film's only good use of special effects to go along with a horror story. The other reason that you could watch this movie, back to back with the original, is for a great lesson on horror film making. Just watch the original first. 3/10\n\nDVD is unrated and has violence and horror images."

The story is stupid.\n\nTypically modern Hollywood pulp that places stupid teenagers who can't act, blurring out ridiculous one-liners and painfully crap dialogs. Completely unbelievable scenarios. This is a shipwreck of a film, made worse by the dreck cast and production team.\n\n...but it looks nice.\n\nThis sucks."

No. Been there, done that, this film was all about going back and correcting the neglected back story and bringing it up-to-date so that a younger crowd could appreciate the actors and actresses they want to see.\n\nThe original was just not that great... it had a fantastic cast, but it was not quite done right. This time the story was done right, but with a lesser cast.\n\nI rate BOTH of them with a 9 out of 10 and I will be adding this one to my DVD collection right next to my DVD of the original."

I loved the original movie because, unlike other horror movies of the time, there was a real attempt to incorporate a plausible and coherent back story into the plot. That is why it will stand out as one of my favorite horror movies. Attention was made to keep people as real as possible and the situations believable. I found the remake took too many liberties with the story and as such had a number of holes that just never got filled and thus, the \"terror\" that should have been generated was awash with questions and uncertainty. \"Why did *that* happen?\" \"When did *that* get fixed?\" Those sorts of questions plagued the movie and I was then sitting wondering about the answers rather than getting engrossed in the story. Good attempt, but more attention should have been taken in the process. Thanks for reading."

(Dir: Rupert Wainright)\n\nAs thick(headed) as pea soup\n\nIn yet another uninspiring remake of a cult horror classic Hollywood continues to rub salt in the wounds of audiences seeking out a decent genre flick (or at the very least a better than expected 're-imagining') in the latest bastardization with a limp re-hash of John Carpenter's cult ghost story with some laughable results.\n\nNamely in Cooper Layne's boring screenplay adaptation by adding more back story than was necessary (in this case a leper colony being destroyed by the founding fathers of the sleepy hamlet of the inlet of Antonio Bay which is preparing for a celebratory induction of a statue erected of the very pioneers who betrayed a trust between the lepers that were killed off for riches instead. Unknowingly unearthing at sea the bundles of the aforementioned booty by charter boat skipper Nick Castle (\"Smallville\"'s Welling) leading to the titular stormy accumulation that will eventually unleash hell and vengeance seeking ghouls.\n\nTo add any more to the 'plot' such as it is only enhances what could have been an exciting boost to the spooky Carpenter flick with its atmospheric dread lurking behind every smoke-grey cloudburst spiraling into the township with God knows what waiting in its shadows. Instead filmmaker Wainright (responsible for the egregious \"Exorcist\" rip-off \"Stigmata\" follows blindly the inept followings with groaning puns, lackluster scares (yes someone actually gets their shoulder touched followed by a boo! sting of music) and wooden performances (Grace of TV's blockbuster \"Lost\" gives new dimension to pine as Welling's girlfriend who has some unearthly and ridiculous link to the historical tragedy that truly upsets the incredibly stupid finale) only make it a sore endeavor for those paying to witness this atrocious remake. There seem to be some chunks of story missing (i.e. one character suddenly has leprosy like facial sores inexplicably and seems to wander into every fifth sequence for no reason). Even Blair seems bored in her fitting into Adrienne Barbeau's single-mother DJ in the lighthouse character adding nothing new to the feisty character. The visual effects are mixed from not-too-shabby to kinda lame.\n\nWhen will someone in Hollywood finally say, \"NO! Leave well enough alone!\" There's absolutely no reason for this remake or for anyone to go see it. Rent the 1980 version instead and guarantee a shiver or two."

It's a movie that had promise and potential to be effective and creepy, yet it throws it all away. The worst offense the movie makes is that, using all the same materials, it could have been a lot better.\n\nThe plot concerns a heavy fog that rolls into a coastal Oregon town, containing malevolent forces in it, desperate for an attempt to right past wrongs done to them. Underneath all the backstory, an intriguing mystery exists, yet the filmmakers all but ignore it to go for the cheap thrills and scares.\n\nThere's absolutely no character development here either, even though there are hints at it throughout. For example, Tom Welling's character is the ancestor of one of the town's founders, yet he resents his family name appearing on the tribute statue. This is never explained, nor is the strained relationship between Maggie Grace's character and her mother, as well as the motivations of the crazy, drunk priest who seems to know more about the town's history than he lets on.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder what kind of movie this would have turned out to be if another writer was given a shot at the screenplay. Rupert Wainwright's direction is competent, but paired with a script that throws a lot of good ideas down the drain, the end result is just a big mess."

I can see what the producers of this remake were trying to do and that is recreate the atmosphere of the original and even though they try there seems to be something missing . I'm not saying this is a great film and by doing a fairly straight remake it shows signs of laziness on the part of the studio but it probably deserves a slightly higher average rating of 3.6\n\nPerhaps the main problem is the casting . Tom Welling , Selma Blair and Maggie Grace ? A little bit too pretty and young compare them with the cast of the original who did tend to look like \"real people\" for a better phrase and were of a wider age demographic . Ah I think I might have hit the nail on he head . This remake tries to pander to the teen demographic where a senior citizen is anyone on the wrong side of 30 . There's also a bit more incidents involved almost as though the studio think teens will be bored senseless if nothing much is happening which means everything is a bit clich\u00e9d . Perhaps worst of all the film feels the need to explain the ending and how it ties in with the rest of the narrative where as the original is left open ended and ambiguous and if a film needs to spoon feed the audience information in a clumsy way this can only be seen as a failure . As I said it's not a great film but probably no worse than the other vapid and insipid remakes we've seen over the last ten years"

There are references to the classic film from 1980 although they are scattered about as much as this script is. The story revolves around a young woman who returns to her hometown during a strange occurrence in which an an enormous and eerie fog seeks out revenge on the townsfolk. The setting is taken away from California to Oregon on an Island. The location is perfect and eerie but the cast is so inept and awful it literally hurts to see them act or care about them. The worst being Selma Blair doing a painful to watch and listen too rock and roll DJ. This whole movie seemed miscast and a lot of background on the characters and their relationships are just hinted at and never explained. The only scary moment in this entire films comes during a scene where a young boy is on the beach and the fog starts to roll in. This film should have completely had the energy and feel of this moment throughout but it didn't. The monsters in the fog, or what there are of monsters, do not compare to those in John Carpenters original and are less threatening. Bad, bad, bad, bad...did I mention this movie was bad.

She doesn't do much in the movie (and her character doesn't even come close to Adrienne Barbeau's turn) but neither do any of the other characters for that matter (blame the script and director, not the actors).\n\nWhereas in the original, John Houseman set the creepy tone with his captivating ghost story around the campfire, this version tries (and fails miserably) to recreate what happened 100+ years ago off the coast of Antonio Island. I was completely confused by the string of events and wondered why we needed to see this flashback at all. In fact, almost every decision Rupert Wainwright (\"director\" of said remake) made was a bad one. He should have just stuck with the original script, since he obviously has no sense for creating suspense. None at all!\n\nI was bored out of my skull the entire movie (actually, I left 10 minutes before the end when it tried to substitute scares with car crashes). So beware of the high ratings. Ninety percent of reviews that appear before the movie opens is from people who worked on the film or who are associated with it in some way (i.e., they can't \"afford\" the bad word of mouth).\n\nAnd how bad can it possibly be? At one point, the character of Dan the weatherman (in another botched scene compared to the original) yells at the fog, \"Is this some kind of joke?\" Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding, \"Yes!\" And more unfortunately, that joke is on the people who paid to see this suckfest."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was fairly excited to see this remake, I wanted to see where the filmmakers would go with it, because the original film was so good. Well, I went to see this with some friends, and we found it to be extremely unexciting and uninspiring. This updated version features basically the same plot, this time though it's set in Antonio Bay, Oregon, rather than Antonio Bay, California. There is an eerie thick fog that begins rolling into town on the 100th anniversary of the town's founding, and, as the priest said, the ghosts of mariners who want revenge come ravaging through the town, picking off the descendants of the town's founding fathers who were responsible for their horrible deaths.\n\nTwo major television stars, Tom Welling (\"Smallville\") and Maggie Grace (\"Lost) star as our main leads, and give lackluster performances. Welling plays the clich\u00e9d \"ex-boyfriend\" and Grace is the innocent girl (who also likes to walk around in her underwear) who can see all of the horrible things that are happening. On rare occasions, some horror movies can work with so many clich\u00e9s, but this one didn't at all. Selma Blair is the best performer of the whole film (playing the radio host Stevie), she alone is the best in the movie. Too bad she was involved with this, but I guess she improved it slightly. The fog this time around is obviously CGI, so it's everywhere, slithering under doors, through car vents, etc. I think real fog would've been much better, but with the technology, I expected CGI.\n\nThe kills in this movie weren't scary at all when they tried to be, in fact they were just boring and unoriginal, example being the scene on the boat with the guy and those two promiscuous girls. Not once was I slightly spooked at all, I was just bored. And when the ending came around, I was so confused I wanted to yell at the screen. The film's conclusion was abrupt, semi-confusing, and just completely unneeded. The credits rolled, and I didn't feel like that had been the end of the movie at all. It just didn't fit.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire film just \"didn't fit\". It was boring, unoriginal, and was just an all around unfaithful and uninspired remake. This is the kind of horror movie you go see on Halloween with some friends without any intentions of seeing a good movie, because this one really wasn't. Some CGI fog and a lackluster ending don't make a good movie. A failed effort that could have been halfway decent. 3/10."

(The fog) . It does had its scary moment as well.(My 5 year old nephew was petrified during certain scenes) The only problem was all the actors and actresses were pretty bad. They were stiff throughout the movie. Very very disappointed with Tom Welling (Superman), Maggie Grace (Lost) and Selma Blair (Hell boy). However, it should get at least a 5 star rating for effort!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't love the original. Nor am I one to claim that the only way a remake can be good is if it doesn't deviate from its source in the slightest. Heck, I'm not even going to insist that the atmospheric, deliberately paced, skillfully built up method of the '80 film is the only way to do this. What I am going to argue is that if you're going to copy as much of what you're going by as this does, you might want to try for a similar overall feel to it. You know, as opposed to just taking all that seemed to work that time around and stringing together scenes so as to allow for about all you can possibly muster of them, with the occasional change. Honestly, even that far, this doesn't completely lose. No, I think where this completely tanks, if you ignore the way some of the \"creepy\" situations come off supposedly commonplace(?) to the leads, the lazy and obvious delivering of exposition(was any attempt at all made to conceal it?) for quite a bit of it, the apparent lack of memorable lines as well as even a single genuinely impressive performance... no, where it ceases forward momentum is in one simple, unfortunate attribute: It ain't scary. Not particularly, if at all. It's not the PG-13; The Ring did masterful with the same rating. It's not directed with the proper understanding and care for horror. I haven't seen anything else by Wainwright, but I imagine Carpenter could take him to school on the genre. For now, us fans will have to re-watch classics, as the most terrifying thing in the current world of movies is how significantly awful the majority of the recent ones are. I recommend this mainly as MST3K fodder, and/or for those members the young crowd who are satisfied with music and slang that's in, as well as half-naked members of the other gender scampering around. 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite the rise in their popularity in recent years, horror films don't seem to be getting much scarier. In fact, quite the opposite: many recent horror films are just rehashes of material we have seen countless times before, without much anything new to offer in the mix. The new remake of The Fog is a good example. While there is potential for suspense and the film has some strong atmosphere at times, it fails to be terribly scary, for the most part.\n\nBased on a film directed by John Carpenter after he hit the big time with Halloween, The Fog is set in the small town of Antonio Bay on Antonio Island in Oregon. The town is preparing to celebrate the founding by several individuals more than one hundred years ago, including the building of a statue to commemorate the event. However, the festivities are being interrupted by a large, rather ominous fog bank which is engulfing the town. At the same time, strange objects are washing up on the beach, relics over a century old, a descendant of the town's original founders, Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) is having strange dreams concerning the town's past. Meanwhile, another descendant of the town's founders, Nick Castle (Tom Welling), is in the midst of arguing with one of the town leaders about misdirecting funds from needed repairs to the infrastructure of the city to instead be used for the dedication statue. When his partner, Spooner (DeRay Davis) are at sea and engulfed by the mysterious fog bank, people begin to die, and the very survival of anyone in the city is put into question.\n\nThe Fog is an interesting idea for a horror film, with the very nature of foggy environments chilling. However, director Rupert Wainwright doesn't do much with it that hasn't been seen in countless other horror movies. Yes, there are some decent shocks here and there, but most of the movie is pretty formula, with the fake scare followed by the real one, characters not acting very smart in dangerous circumstances, and horrifying images that are, honestly, not that horrifying. The imagery of the fog is rather intimidating at times, but it doesn't really hold up for very long.\n\nInterwoven into the film are flashback scenes set in the past, showing the events that have triggered this particular attack of the fog, but the film raises more questions than it answers: why does the fog return now, what is it really after and, finally, has anyone from this city ever decided to move away, since most of the characters are descendants of the town forefathers. The Fog is not exactly an example of crack plotting.\n\nOverall, The Fog is just a big \"eh\" in the genre of horror films. Nothing unwatchably bad, but nothing I would recommend to anyone. Save your time and check out The Ring, or something else appropriately scary."

Tom welling especially was a novelty to watch. Although this movie was not the 'horror' film i had expected when i went to see it, it was still very suspenseful and enjoyable.\n\nDon't go see it if you are expecting it to be bad, because then it most likely will to you. My suggestion is to watch it with an open mind......don't judge the movie until you watch it."

It would've just been a plain old boring movie (which wouldn't have been that terrible) hadn't it been for that ending, yes the ending that didn't make any sense at all and had nothing to do with the original.\n\nSure the actors are nice looking and you know they all tried to make this movie scary but thats it, they tried, my best guess is, they got distracted by a pretty bird outside while writing this movie and just said, this BS makes enough sense to me lets go outside to see this pretty bird. Bad bird, very bad bird! Bad movie, very bad movie.\n\nThe best advice that I can give you is see the original, the special effects are amazing for the 70's the acting more believable, you care more for the characters and it's creepier. I bought the original without knowing if it was any good, well it is, it really is.\n\nSo to sum up: \"wannabe remake\" = bad. Original 70's movie = kick-ass"

The original fog which I have seen when I was 12 or 13 made me very scared. It was very well made. In fact I love old horror films very much. I mean in the late seventies and eighties because of lack of digital effects. I loved the plastic effects and real make up very much. Add the technology but make it more real horrifying. For example I have seen the latest cigarette burns of masters of horror. It was all right the gore is good and the effects and make up are realistic. But the fog remake has fell from these points. I am sorry I wish not to be made."

If they had read the original script they could have made it much better. Of course if they had hired me as the writer...never mind. This is good for a rent for a so-cheesy-it's-good craving. I hated it when I first saw this, but after a while it grows on you. This is nothing like the original Fog. Hopefully, they'll make a better remake than this one."

The Fog is empty and thoughtless, the \"impatience\" of its pacing never establishes suspense, the cast is \"young\". BUT . . . The Fog ('05)made me jump every-time and loathe the sheer creepiness of the terror therein. My mom and dad took my brother and I to see The Fog (original) on my 10th birthday as my first \"rated R\" movie--its what got me \"into\" collecting soundtracks. Just as moviegoers born between 1980 and 1993 roughly have a staid sense of aesthetics(can anyone hum the theme for \"Friends\" the defining show for \"your\" generation? but i can hum the theme of Greatest American Hero and The Munsters), The Fog ('05) has a staid sense of aesthetics. but it made me jump and it explored the leprosy aspect a little more\n\nand hey . . . everyone in the cast probably digs \"Friends\" replete with its insipid episode titles. So \"The Fog\" is \"horror\" in its current state for its current audience. I can't relate to the Fog but I dig the Fog, I understand where its coming from. see it. 10 outta 10. an apt rating.

To remake this film is a mistake of the highest order; as much like Halloween, the original stands the test of time because it solidly personifies a moment in cinema history, that could never occur again...memories of a past era of cinema caught on film.\n\nI may sound cynical; but each and every remake seems to solidly bear the banner of \"Cash Cow\" film making, JC knows he has had his best years in Hollywood during the 70's and 80's; the current trend of \"Documentary\" style and realistic raw & gritty filming of footage, do not compliment Mr Carpenters unique style; and he does not seem capable of moving with the times...\n\nI would warn any fan of early JC works; away from this corporate exercise in cold money making over substance.

Indeed, some of the flick, to perhaps give the viewer a break from what otherwise was a poorly scripted and acted flick better shown once on HBO than in the theater.\n\nNo matter, it does have great color, nice ocean and sea scenes of the northwest. Perhaps it's a kind of poorly acted travel log?

He even says that he wanted to really tell Elizabeth's story, If he wants to film a romantic ghost ripoff go take a hike and make your own movie. This piece of garbage is worse than Bloodrayne a rivals Uwe Boll for the worst director of all time.\n\nThe story is that on the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay Ghosts come back for revenge on the descendants of the people that killed them or at least that was the or at least that was the original story now it flipped upside down and regurgitated Only Tom Welling and DeRay Davis are any good in the acting category.

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow! This film really didn't need to be made. I love the old The Fog. It's a scary film with lots of intensity, John Carpenter behind the camera and creating some neat music, a cast of stars(albeit some very faded), and Adrienne Barbeau. Did I mention Adrinne Barbeau? Well, the new The Fog doesn't have John Carpenter, doesn't have any star power(zippo!), isn't scary at all, and doesn't have Adrienne Barbeau(who even at this stage of her life would be far more welcomed than this film I might add). What we do have is an almost exact retelling of the first film with some obvious changes made to accommodate our times. I find this trend in horror films very unnerving. You know the trend: find an old horror classic(which means something from the 70's or 80's for the dolts that produce and make these films) and \"modernize\" it. Give it some hip music here and there, lots of teen wannabe \"stars,\" usually some skin(sorry don't get too excited in this FOG), and change the story just enough to make people think it is different just enough. The last one is the least important t the producers because those of us who saw these films in the 70's and 80's are not the target audience. Sadly, these are made for the teens of today. Based on that I could expect little, but get even less than I expect more often than not. You know, movies like The Fog, The Hills Have Eyes, Willard, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre were trend setters in their own way. They were original in a variety of ways. The 70's was a decade of invention and creation and independent financing for the horror film. Shouldn't the guys making these films try and emulate that rather than bring out tired, old remakes of films that really have no business being remade in the first place. Enough! I could just go on and on. Let's get back to this disappointment at hand. This Fog isn't horrible nor any good. The story is the same but without the suspense. Like all the remakes(here I go again), The Fog is really tame in comparison to the original. Where is the horror in that? The only thing I liked about this film was the exploration into what really happened to the people on board the Elizabeth Dane. That was it."

Back in 1980, \"The Fog\" was one of John Carpenter's lesser praised but unquestionably amazing low-budget horror achievements, as it benefited from a terrifying atmosphere and a straightforward script. Rupert Wainwright added or removed pretty much nothing from Carpenter's original script (apart from some unimportant details) and yet he managed to get rid of ALL the scary elements! How the hell did he do that? Well, presumably because our inexperienced Mr. Wainwright exclusively focused on the CGI-effects and hi-tech visual eye candy, and therefore completely neglected everything that involves the drawing of the characters, the build-up of tension and atmosphere and a plausible story-structure. The characters are running around the sets like headless chickens, not really knowing what to do or say. The whole point of the movie is the anniversary-celebration of Antonio Bay's founding, yet we get to know NOTHING about the town itself and only a very limited number of inhabitants are introduced. Even the personalities and relationships between the main characters remain pretty vague at all times. How are you supposed to care about these people's fades when you never get to know them? Personally, I truly & honestly cared about Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins in the original version of \"The Fog\", because they were sympathetic and properly introduced characters. Well...then at least the special effect are great, right? No, they're not. In fact, the fog-effects and especially the undead monsters that home inside it are some of the most embarrassingly inept digital creations I ever saw. They provoke feelings of pity instead of fright. There's no gore and the acting performances are disastrous. So far, I only described 10% of all that is wrong with \"The Fog\", but wasting any more time on this turkey would be just as stupid as watching it again. Avoid!"

This movie came out in the age of CGI, so I figured: finally, a remake that might correct an injustice. How wrong I was. The story took a lot of it's elements and characters (if not the character names) from the original, but it cut out many scenes that gave the original so much excitement and changed the back story in ways that made it hokey at best.

For real, I've watched 100s of films that should've NEVER been made get a decent rating... This film has it all. All the factors to make it a kick-a** movie. Definitely feels I'm the only person who knows how to spot an awesome movie! (& that's a fact) 2005 version 2 thumbs way way up! 1980 version \"BOO!!!! BOO!!!\" 2 thumbs way way down.\n\nI'm actually quite surprised that \"The Fog\" 2005, only got a 3.7 rating out of 10. I think/feel it deserves at least a 5 out of 10 rating. I tried watching the older version and I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes without thinking the newer version was 1000 times better. I rated the 2005 version 5/10, & the 1980 version I gave it an 1/10. & honestly I'm a harsh rater. Most of the movies I've watched & rated, nearly 2000 I believe, half or more than half of those are rated 4/10. & the highest rating I've given a film/show is an 8/10. Because there isn't anything out there that deserves a 9/10 or 10/10. I gave this film a 5/10, so (for me) giving this movie a rating higher than my usual 4/10 pretty much says I enjoyed this film a great deal! Now I'm gonna have to start actually watching movies when I see they've been rated & reviewed lowly. P.s. I think those who disliked this film are crazy!!!!"

Some people might get disappointed by the \"The Fog\" 2005 edition as it most of the time is a surprisingly quiet and absolutely not scary horror movie. But if you watch as a poetic ghost movie and pay attention to the pictures and the scenery it is one of the most visually beautiful movies of the decade. And as things at last heat up also quite entertaining.\n\nJohn Carpenters version is far more scary and crude (and funny). Even though the two versions are using the same plot they are really not fitted to be compared to each other as they are using completely different languages to tell the story. If you liked \"Stigmata\"- go watch the new edition. If you didn't, you'll probably be better of with the old."

Also, Maggie Grace is actually good on Lost, but seemed lost on the big screen. Her pitiful and fake screams of terror did nothing for me but make me cringe. Even Selma Blair looked bored. The movie was so predictable. The viewer has seen it so many times before that nothing the movie did was original. Scary? Not the least. Not once did I jump. Gee, I wonder if something is going to happen to the aunt when she's at the sink? The movie was a remake of the original, so nothing was new. Also, everything that happened was convenient. Finding the book? That was a joke. It was like it was no big deal to find a 134 yr. old book in perfect shape."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some times that I really question my sanity, and where I question my status as a film-goer. I know a good film from a bad film, but even some that I know will be bad, I just give a chance anyway just to see if I like it. Of course, this works in small doses, but as a whole, it really does not. Which leads me to my thoughts on the recent remake of The Fog.\n\nBasically, the film starts with a backstory before going right into the present day of Antonio Bay, a small island town, with a tightly knit population. They have their own radio station, their own marina, and their own historical society. But soon after the introduction of our main two characters Nick and Elizabeth (Tom Welling and Maggie Grace), things begin to go a bit awry, as a giant fog begins to sweep over the town every night, causing havoc as it does.\n\nOf course, to say anymore would just ruin the lunacy of the entire plot, which I can only assume made some sort of sense when John Carpenter made it in the 1980's. I never saw the film, but going on Carpenter's early track record (as opposed to his recent one), I'll assume that he made it work, and that it truly had it's horrific moments. In 2006, it just does not wash. The story is silly, and as it goes along, it just gets worse and worse. Suspenseful sequences are down right laughable, and anything vaguely \"horrific\" comes to little too late, and just fails to scare the audience at all.\n\nWhile what happens in the story may be a slight bit zany, it's the fact that so much could have been done in order to make it better. You learn early on that many of the inhabitants of the town share the same last names as others. Yet, nothing really becomes of this important subplot. Other subplots like character's departures, or character backstories are vaguely poked at, but go nowhere later on. In some instances, other events happen later in the film that would make sense had the early mention been anything but, and unfortunately become questionable in the whole scheme of things. The movie is really not that short, I am certain that they could have at least made some of these subplots that are oft used make some sort of sense if they are going to come up more than once. If not, then they should have just cut them out altogether.\n\nEvery character is a cardboard cut-out, one dimensional and all. Welling and Grace show almost no acting muscle whatsoever, and they just look awkward in their roles. But then again, Grace looks awkward in anything she does. They cannot carry the film (even with their \"hot\" sex scene), so they look to the not much better Selma Blair for help. While Blair delivers in small doses, her character never really moves away from the one dimensional territory vacated by the rest of the cast. Each speak their lines with little to no enthusiasm, and you really begin to wonder if they are actually acting, or are just there to pick up a paycheque. Many of the sequences are just boring because the cast has no direction as to what to do in order to make the scene work. Had a director been hired with more experience than music videos, TV movies, a Disney movie and a subpar 90s thriller, maybe there would have been some form of direction.\n\nWhich brings us to the special effects. The film has some very heavy effects driven scenes, and while some of them work, others just look awful. When the fog and what it brings show up, the scenes just look half-baked. You can tell what is fake and what is not, and for a movie made during the current upswing in great special effects, it comes off as totally amateur.\n\nCarpenter may have had some sort of greatness back in 1980, but Rupert Wainwright has nothing now. Eventually Hollywood will realize this slate of remakes does not work, and until they do, we will just have to contend with more and more trash like this.\n\n2/10.\n\n(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

The actors looked as if they have never read a script before in their lives. Spooner one of the sub characters was one of the worst actors I have seen. The supposed scary scenes were actually funny due to the fact that Spooner sounded so phony and fake when trying to act scared. I have not see the first film except for about 10 minutes a couple years ago. I do intend on watching it one day just to see the similarities in both films or lack there of. Save your money and your time. This movie is right up there with the movie \"The Stupids\" back in the nineties. Or \"Mom and Dad save the world\". Nuff Said, It's been your pleasure - Kevin McMahon"

Tell me, if you were home alone and something crashed on the outside of your house to the tune of a giant hammer pounding on your door, would you honestly grab your robe and approach the front door and go outside in the dark of night to look around to see what it was? Well apparently that's exactly what you would do, as stuff like that happened over and over in this flick. Forget the $15 for the tickets and the $10 in snacks my wife and I bought, that's just 2 hours of my life I can't get back. Although it is good for those couples out there struggling to find anything to agree upon lately. One trip to this movie, and you'll both spend the entire car ride home agreeing how pathetic this movie was, ranting and raving about how Hollywood can't make anything good anymore."

But in my opinion, it's a 7 out of 10. Definitely.\n\nThe violence wasn't too bad, about a 6 out of 10 for violence, ten being gory/nasty. There was barely any drug use, except for one scene, so about a 4 out of 10 for drug use/references. The language was about a 5 out of 10. Now, the sex was a definite 7 out of 10. There was no nudity, except half a butt crack. But there was a lot of kissing and rubbing and scratching during the brief, one minute long scene of sex in the shower. I recommend not taking anyone under the age of 10 to see this movie because of the sexual scene and of the disturbing images.\n\nThe Fog is a definite 7 out of 10.\n\nOriginal MPAA rating: PG-13: Violence, Disturbing Images, and Brief Sexuality\n\nMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Intense Sequences of Terror/Violence, Disturbing Images, and Brief Sexuality\n\nMy Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Sexually Suggestive Scene\n\nMy Canadian Rating for the Unrated Version: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Sexually Suggestive Scene"

Yes, there were a couple of jump scenes in this movie, but not enough to pay seven bucks to go see it. It's basically a digitally remastered version of the original version of \"The Fog\". Don't waste your money on this one! Go with your first instinct to go see \"Elizabethtown\" or something else instead!"

I've already made up my mind as to whether I'm going to see a certain movie or not and reading the user comments will not defer me from see that movie. I read the comments, watch the movie and then make up my own mind. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Tom Welling did a good job. For the first couple of minutes into the movie I expected to see Lana or Chloe sipping coffee at The Talon or something like that. It took just about two minutes of Tom's character in this movie to tear me away from that. Smallville is the only place that I've seen him act and he did a marvelous job of showing me that he's not just Clark Kent. He made the movie for me and to me, ladies and gentlemen, he proved himself to the world that he's now a proved actor who can stand on his own merits.

She manages once again to convey at least a hint of personality to a character who is rather influential but poorly drawn.\n\nNow, with the really good... The special effects have of course, improved over the year, and there are some very good ones here.

I can honestly say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole life. And boy, do I know bad movies.\n\nThe plot: The quiet seaside town of Antonio bay is preparing to unveil the statue of the four people who founded the town. But things go horribly wrong when the ghosts of lepers murdered by the four men invade the town in a mysterious fog and begin killing everyone. I can't say much about the plot of this one as it IS a remake, but what I truly hated was that they ALTERED THE ENDING. I can't stress about how much I hate this after watching the remake of 'Planet of the apes', and the ending for this mess was rushed and nonsensical.\n\nThe acting/characters: I have never seen such poor acting in a movie before. The casting director should be fired. Or are the actors just struggling to put up with such a lousy script? It's hard to tell. I'm actually surprised at how the actors got any work after this. The two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and all of the actors are practically expressionless. Seriously, kids in kindergarten could do better than this. As for the characters, they were one-dimensional and underdeveloped.\n\nThe scares/special effects: There are no scares at all in this movie. It's all just soooo predictable! It's so obvious who's going to die from the characters stupid actions and the kills are unsatisfactory. The CGI is awful even for a Syfy movie, and that's saying something. Not to mention the ghosts themselves. Ugh! What made me so angry about the ghosts is that they were TRANSPARENT. I haven't seen transparent ghosts since 'Scooby Doo'! They made the movie even more unappealing and made it look cheaper furthermore.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is a complete waste of time and I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE. I completely regret watching this movie, as well as acknowledge its existence."

This is real bad and I avoided it for so long, but the fact that his royal highness John Carpenter was lending his name to the project always kept me interested, it was the itch I was destined to scratch at some point.\n\nIt's poorly directed, badly acted, in fact there is a scene with four people on a boat (two of each sex) that is so badly acted you would be surprised if these actors ever worked again!

The most entertaining moments are when Tom Welling takes his shirt off. Honestly. When you try to add so much back-story to a tale that really doesn't need it, well you're in for trouble. The movie becomes weighted down by stuff that has absolutely nothing to add. Maggie Grace gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Other characters make no logical sense. If it weren't for the occasionally good visual this movie wouldn't have even rated a 2. If you've really been wanting to see this movie, and judging by the size of the audience I saw it with tonight, there aren't really that many. Wait till video. Save a few bucks."

I've seen a lot of bad horror movies (maybe no that many, cause I am not to thrilled of spending hours and hours on junk movies), and I can certainly state that this wasn't one of them.\n\nYou should give some credit to the young actors from this movie. I mean, come on! It is the first movie where I see Tom Welling in another role than Superman and he doesn't look that bad, although I kind of imagined him getting rid of the ghosts with some super powers. Not to mention Maggie Grace, whom I only seen in \"Lost\" and she seems also convincing. They are all growing into mature actors and they tried to do a good job with this movie too. Maybe the script wasn't that great, or some of the other actors in the background weren't that convincing, but the lead actors weren't that bad and the special effects were cool enough.\n\nDon't try to see the movie hunting for mistakes or flows, try to keep an open mind and observe the good aspects of the film, you will notice that it is good enough to waste a little time in a sleepy evening.\n\nTo Tom and Maggie: you did good, keep it up and let us see some more good stuff from you, you have real potential as actors. Good luck with your future films!"

Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Ring, 28 Days Later, etc. This is not a really good horror film. i did like it though, and i don't know why everyone is saying how horrible this is. i mean, i watched the unrated version, maybe that made a big difference, i don't know. Most horror films suck. thats just a fact. this one was not really scary or anything, but i didn't feel cheated out of my hour and a half like others are saying. Yes, the special effects are much more advanced than in the first, and i usually don't like a lot of CGI, but the CGI in this was pretty good i thought. they didn't over due it like in a lot of films today. yes, Tom Welling is much better looking than the original Nick Castle, yes, Selma Blair is better looking than the original Stevie, and well neither Maggie Grace or Jaime Lee Curtis do much for me, but I don't having younger, more attractive actors hurt this film. I will say it, i liked this one better than the original. people can actually do that from time to time. the original \"Fog\" was okay, this one was decent, which is better than okay. It was a fun movie to watch, the acting was not spectacular, but aside from just a few moments from Maggie Grace, i thought it was alright. People who love the original version of films like them for certain reasons, so when a remake comes out with better looking effects and actors and a bit of a different story, they want to hate it. but if a remake is the exact same, what the hell is the point of remaking it. if anything, more people will go back and watch the original because of seeing this one, because most people have not seen the original. I think if you just go into this film not trying to compare every detail to the original, and not expecting it to suck, and just watch it to watch and enjoy a movie, you might be pleasantly surprised, or you might think it sucks, but it certainly is no worse than 95% of the horror films that come out"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ahhh, just what the world was missing....a naff remake of one of John Carpenter's poorer 'classics'! This totally unnecessary update of the fairly lame 80s spook movie blows on so many levels: the acting, the direction, the CGI FX, the plot-hole ridden script. I had heard a lot of bad things about The Fog before settling down to watch it and asked myself 'Could it really be that bad?'. You betcha\u0097this movie is awful!!!\n\nTaking the original premise of Carpenter's flick\u0097ghosts take revenge on the ancestors of their murderers\u0097and adding several pointless plot threads that go nowhere, director Rupert Wainwright presents a lifeless mess of a film that fails to be either scary or exciting. The wooden leads (Tom Welling of Smallville fame and Maggie Grace of Lost) have obviously been selected for their looks rather than their talent and both give dreadful performances. Meanwhile, Selma Blair tries her best to emulate Adrienne Barbeau's character in the original, but her weak imitation ends up grating on the nerves.\n\nIf you check the reviews of those who gave this a high rating, it appears that they either a) think Tom Welling is hot, b) think Maggie Grace or Selma Blair are hot, or c) are too young to know any better. Seasoned horror fans, on the other hand, recognise bilge when they see it.\n\nWith no gore, no effective scares and no atmosphere, The Fog is a horror movie without any horror."

His girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island after six months in NYC. Stevie Wayne (Selma Blair) is the radio DJ out the lighthouse. There is some strange occurrences, gruesome deaths, and a mysterious fog.\n\nThis is a remake of the original John Carpenter movie from 1980. I wasn't really a big fan of the original and this is a poor copy. At least the original had a creepy atmosphere and Adrienne Barbeau. This one doesn't have anything in comparison. The production and the acting is so bland. It's like nobody aspires to do better. There is also something about the CGI fog. Its fakeness took me out of the movie.

There's a group of horny teenagers partying and drinking on a boat. They're the first to die (inevitably). Soon after, there's the requisite ass-shot of the hot girl walking around in her underwear. The Fog is primarily a check-list of lame horror clich\u00e9s, one after another.\n\nAnd did I mention that Selma Blair plays a single mom? Yeah right! That's as believable as Tara Reid playing the scientist in Alone in the Dark! Oh, and there's a priest, Father Malone, but he's not very godly at all. He's always drinking and yelling \u0096 not a convincing priest at all. On the surface, there's really nothing to The Fog, but if I really rack my brain, I'm sure I can find some deeper moral message about colonialism and violence. But why would I want to do that?"

I was a little worried that throughout the movie i would be \"Why is Clark doing that and why isn't Clark.....?\" Maggie Grace was a pure disgrace(no pun intended) and was awkward as the \"sexy\" girlfriend.

This movie is terrible and a perfect example of how not to make a remake. The acting was pathetic. The atmosphere was destroyed by the amateur acting \"talents\" of the principal players. The guy who played Nick (Tom Wellington from Smallville) is surely one of the worst actors in movies today. He is completely unbelievable in this part. He thinks he is so cool and I guess that gets in the way of any attempt at acting he might be able to try. He doesn't even look good either, despite the heavy layers of make-up, the gobs of mascara, and the colored contacts. He is looking too old to try to play a \"pretty boy\" any longer and it shows too! He goes around never getting very emotional or excited about anything (I guess he is afraid he will mess up his make-up). One thing is certain and that is he was very miscast in this part (it ruined the whole movie). He would have been perfect for one of the gay cowboys in Brokeback Mountain, because he acts and looks so very, very gay.\n\nThe original movie was frustrating and this one is more so. There is not much of a plot to be found, no frights at all, and a completely asinine story. The whole thing is just pathetic and really boring and I do mean boring! I can't believe that John Carpenter had his name in the credits! He should have given up after his first attempt with The Fog. The most frightening thing about the first film was Jamie Lee Curtis doing a topless scene revealing her mosquito bites, and the most frightening thing about this travesty was that some idiot made it in the first place. It does not even deserve to be watched unless one is desperate and even then one will be very disappointed! Avoid this disaster at all costs and it flat out gets no stars at all because it is a bomb of the greatest magnitude! I had to give it one but that was because there was no other choice!!!"

Something did come back ... Sooner or later, everything does\"\n\nWhy did \"The Fog\" come back?\n\nBecause it could be done better than the original horror classic? Not even close.\n\nThis film had a few good moments, saving it from the dreaded one star rating, but it is greatly inferior to the original masterpiece by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, which I will likely watch many times in the future. I will not watch this film again.\n\nThe good:\n\nOccasional nice cinematography.\n\nImages of story elements not in the original were well done, but I would take John Houseman telling the campfire ghost story to the children on the beach at the beginning of the original over this addition every time.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe acting was amateurish and the characters were shallow and ridiculous. I had no sympathy for them.\n\nShowing copious amounts of too young female skin and a sex scene that is gratuitous during the first half of the movie is of no value and is always a sign of a bad film in need of CPR. Sure, Adrienne Barbeau provided some eye candy in the original, but she had the aspect of a mature woman.\n\nSpecial effects over substance. No thanks.\n\nIt is not scary; a bad sign for a film that is supposed to be scary.\n\nThe ending which showed some promise, was reduced to complete absurdity.\n\nWhy do they always come back?\n\nI should know better than to view the remake of a classic movie, but because of the rare exception, \"Nosferatu\" comes to mind, it is worth giving it a chance. (I now pledge to never watch the remake of \"The Hills Have Eyes\")\n\nThe original has some great acting, with the mother-daughter duo of Janet Leigh (\"Psycho\"!) and Jamie Lee Curtis (scream queen of\"Halloween\" fame), the aforementioned Ms. Barbeau and John Houseman, and Hal Holbrook, among others. The cinematography is beautiful. The score by John Carpenter is one of the best. It is great work of film art. It is tense and scary, which is what we horror fans want.\n\nCheck out the original, it is a must see film, and skip this poor imitation, which is not even a good film on its own merits."

Ground fog may be only 20 or 30 feet deep, while even the deepest fog layers are rarely more than several thousand feet thick. Fog droplets are small, and while the new radars may be sensitive enough to detect some of the droplets, the elevation angle of the radar beam, coupled with the curvature of the Earth, quickly raise the radar beam above the top of the fog layer. Radar can only detect objects that pass through its beam."

Tom Welling is so handsome, and great to see him in something other then his television role on Smallville. It had the same suspenseful events that made the scary movie's from the 1950's so much fun to watch. The setting was believable set on an island off the coast, reminded me of Pitcairn Island. A dense fog keeps coming in and blanketing parts of the island, and when it does someone always is missing. No one knows where or why it has just started coming onto the land. Strange things are happening, no one is able to explain. It creeps into homes kind of reminded me of the Blob. People on the island are scared! The premise for the story was just so original. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I really enjoyed the film. I would watch it again. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good scary movie but it isn't run of the mill kind. A great movie. It was definitely worth watching. I have told many friends to make sure they get to see it."

For most part, it held to the core plot, with a twist at the end that took it away from the original. Was I scared by the movie? Not really, but that was probably because I knew what to expect for most part.\n\nThe positives - a good ensemble cast, with the characters well picked out; an exceptionally well done set of visuals, and a decent soundtrack/score. They played with the plot enough to not make it a complete remake, while making it appeal to a younger audience of today's generation. There are plenty of today's little consumer based do-dads and gizmos to appeal to the geek in everyone! (Talk about smart product placement!)\n\nTom Welling and Maggie Grace are decent choices for the roles they play here, and both pull of admirable performances.\n\nThe negatives? Well - I can't really think of any that would make it bad. If anything, maybe the fact that I knew what to expect for most part of the movie. I didn't really care very much for Selma Blair's performance for most part though.\n\nAll in all, thoroughly enjoyable, but it could have been better. It's worth 2 hours and the price of a movie ticket! Go watch it! :)"

The storyline focuses on a small California town with a tumultuous past that is about to return. A town that was once inhabited by pirates was saved when one of those pirate ships disappeared. In modern day a fog approaches the city and the pirates seem to have returned. This remake is directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata) and stars Tom Welling (Smallville), Maggie Grace (Taken), Selma Blaire (Hellboy), DeRay Davis (21 Jump Street) and Kenneth Welsh (The Day After Tomorrow). The storyline is almost identical to the first one with some slight tweaks from the original including a high school love storyline, the priest wasn't as intricate in this as the original and the ending wasn't so creepy and open ended (feeling wise) as the original. The original cast was also outstanding (this cast had no chance of reaching that level). Overall I don't hate this as much as some people, but it does suffer from trying to recreate the magic of the first one and coming up way short. I'd score this a very average 5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have you ever been lost in the fog? Not only is it hard to see something, but when you do see, it is too late. The remake of The Fog was well done and it had some scary moments. Are you ready to watch a bunch of dead lepers come back for revenge? As the mist creeps into Antonio Bay, so does the leper ghost of the past. These scary ghosts come to bring vengeance upon the descendants responsible for their deaths. They all become unwitting victims as the fog fills the town. No one is more unwitting than bewildered and dumb Maggie Grace.\n\nMaggie Grace(TV'S \"Lost\") needs to take some medication in this movie! She clearly had some foggy thinking, one moment she was making sense and the next you want to choke her! You will get \"LOST\" with Maggie Grace in this film(Pun intended).\n\nAfter she saw three people dead on a boat, she realizes something is wrong, she watches a video clearly demonstrating some crazy demonic fog behavior. She is having dreams about people burning up in the fire, and that she is dead underwater. Next she goes and talks to a priest and says, \"There is something wrong isn't there?\" What gave her the first clue? Is this a remake of \"The Fog\" or Clueless? If you saw three dead people on a boat and watched a video where a knife magically flew through the air and killed someone, would you stick around? This girl stayed when anyone with an ounce of sense would run for their lives! Maggie Grace was the most annoying feeble-minded character throughout the movie.\n\nTom Welling thought Maggie was a basket-case and he should have dumped her and went after Selma Blair(Hot Radio DJ Chick). Tom Welling does get lucky at the end of the movie, as Maggie Grace disappears into the mist with creepy dead leper man.\n\nThe filming was well done and there were some creepy looking leper ghost people. I thought the dead shadow look of the long-dead mariners was creepy and made the movie more entertaining. The effects with the fog looked great and the eerie mist produced a horrific sense of terror.\n\nYou will notice that the leper scenes on the boat could have been more disgusting. Maybe an eye ball could have fallen out of someone's head or maybe a hand rolling around on the boat deck. Even if a leper's head fell off, that would have been the icing on the cake! Imagine Tom Welling with a superman's outfit driving like a mad crazed lunatic with Maggie Grace next to him and you have a winner! Seriously, this movie was not the worst and the acting was not the best, but it was creepy. You may discover, as I did that Tom Welling should stick to Smallville and stay away from fog ville."

Where's the security. And when others find her there, they don't question how the corpse got on the floor. Elizabeth falls into the water and gets tangled in kelp and drops the camera. Yet she never tells anyone where she lost it so it can be retrieved. Everyone tries to out run the fog in their car, yet have no problem taking back roads through the fog. Kissing a ghost, then turning into one. I never heard that before. Silly resolution of problem. Ghosts who write weird symbols in really bright red paint that make no sense.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Bad script. I remember the original was scary, but I didn't think so much of this. This movie is only good to watch if you want to laugh at how stupid the characters are."

What made someone decide to remake it is beyond me, and in retrospect, what made me decide to watch yet another goofy teenage horror remake is also distantly beyond me.\n\nDirected by the director of such gems as Stigmata, Blank Check, and various M.C. Hammer movies, the remake of The Fog makes no effort to cover up or improve upon even the most obvious weaknesses in the original film. The odd character of \"Stevie Wayne,\" for example, remains about unwatchable, and the rest of the movie is not much better. On the other hand, I recently watched Hostel, Eli Roth's latest excrement, so this really looks like Shakespeare in comparison.

I enjoyed the original which is a classic horror film. maybe thats why I was hoping this wouldn't be a dumb horror remake to make a buck for Halloween. The acting is terrible, and its partly the scripts fault because the characters actions and reactions lack any motivation. Selma Blair is not very convincing as a radio show host. She could of put some effort in and taken a class to learn how to be a disc jockey for research. Maybe listened to the radio and heard how others use their voice properly on the radio. The superman guy is one of the lamest characters in the film(even the token black guy is better written). The blonde girl who is the dumbest lead in a film you'll see for a long time. The part with her mom was funny in how bad it was and as incoherent as the plot. The film makers went for a cheap thrill (hence the bad CGI) over mood and ruined anything that might have been good with this picture. At least the original movie you could understand the plot going on.\n\nAn utter mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "This remake of the Fog will inevitably be compared to Carpenter's original. Nostalgia may color the perception of Carpenter's original which lacked in story and character development. Wainright's remake attempts to add more depth to the legend of Spivy Point as well as situate the main characters within a deeper relationship to what is going on.\n\nI say \"attempts\" because some of this enthusiasm comes through and works, but at other times it simply falls flat and leaves many events in the film hanging or appearing to be fortuitous tangents.\n\nCarpenter's original seems to be merely a montage of events in comparison to Wainright's attempt to create a larger narrative. But even so, for some reason I found the hokey effects of Carpenter's original to be more effective than the modern digital graphics. The original was more tangible while in the remake, where one wanted to encounter the \"horror\" of the Fog, one got vapors."

If you want a good scare besides that thought, just rent \"Scream\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"The Joan Rivers Show\" or \"Psycho.\" Spare yourself on this one, that's 100 minutes of your life you'll never get back.

Had the film continued as it had began I think it would be an effective thriller in line with Final Destination. This film, by the end is more laughable with similarities to Final Destination 2 although an enjoyable experience if watched with a few drinks on a Saturday night and taken lightheartedly. I would watch it again and in general don't think it deserves the pants reviews it has received, although it will not induce the same iconic status and cinematic experience of the original a quarter of a century ago."

As if a remake wasn't enough, this soppy ghost story fails as a horror movie, as a drama, as a thriller-in fact as anything. The story resolves around a mysterious fog that causes havoc on a remote island with a lighthouse. Okay, so the story is Corny, but hey, who cares? The original Fog with Jamie Lee Curtis was a nice little shocker, and John Carpenter made sure the scares were proud and bold. This version is so laughably drib and unscary, your average episode of Balamory is more moving. A terrible waste of everyone's time...mainly yours. Go see a real hardcore Horror movie, and avoid this evil contraption. You will come out of the Movie Theatre cursing it, and yourself..."

For the \"natives\", though, I thought they looked fairly neat.\n\nThe film definitely goes on for too long, while the ending is terrible. Acting wise I think it's OK. Tom Welling (Nick) and Maggie Grace (Elizabeth) are passable, the rest of the cast give pretty lame performances granted.\n\nBad, but not *that* bad in my opinion.

It has lost a lot in the translation....mainly the 'spirit' of the film...as it were.\n\nThe CGI of the fog rolling in might be better, but the FOG itself is less menacing and oddly, prone to laughable tidal activity. There one moment...right across town the next and clear as a bell the following scene. Some cretinous FX - such as the old lady having a bad night washing up, insults the viewer - least those who hung around in the theater long enough to see it.\n\nInarguably from the DARKNESS FALLS and GHOST SHIP school of horror, the film is an exercise in futility. How many genuinely needy people worldwide, could the $40-50 million budget allocated to this flop, have fed? As for Smallville's favorite son, read my lips: \"The guy doesn't have it\" Mind you he was in equally charismatically-bereft company. Something's majorly wrong when a pair of rather sexy little panties proves to be the highlight of the movie!\n\nIs Hollywood so hard-up for original scripts they must continue to pillage (and desecrate) those from yesteryear? How long before Adam Sandler stars in a remake of THE THIRD MAN or maybe Jackie Chan can upstage Chuck Heston in the new BEN HUR (After all, look what he managed with AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS) Meanwhile someone might fancy their chances remaking Carpenter's classic THE THING next..I'm sure there are people out there THAT stupid!\n\nWhat really irritates me.

In addition, Janet Leigh's daughter Jamie Lee Curtis was the lead, shrieking babysitter in peril\" and both acted in The Fog....\n\nAnyway...And in Psycho...Allan Bates was not only a motel owner but also a TAXIDERMIST...remember?

Ghosts of men who were killed 100 years prior come to Antonio Bay to exact revenge, and they do so inside of the fog that surrounds the small town. All of the same characters are in this one, and they must battle the fog before it kills them all. A difference from the first film is that Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis' character in the original) has weird flashes and dreams from the past. It's sort of explained in the end, but the movie doesn't do the best job telling us what it was all about.\n\n\"The Fog\" (2005) fell flat when you sit it next to the 1980 version. There are a few good moments, like the kid racing home from the beach with the billowing fog chasing him. It's a really intense scene. But this remake tries to copy other scenes that were in the original, and fails miserably. The original film had a dark atmosphere which really made it creepy. I feel like this remake spent a lot of time on scenery details and special effects that did nothing for me. The 1980 movie was already done at a slow pace when compared to other films in the genre, but this remake moves it even slower which I didn't like. The writers of the remake also added some bits to the original tale that did not fully make sense to me, and the ending left me confused.\n\nThe acting wasn't nearly as effective as the original either. Each character in the remake was done MUCH better by the actor who played them in the 1980 film. Jamie Lee Curtis was more effective than Maggie Grace, Tom Atkins did a better job than Tom Welling, and Adrienne Barbeau was better in the role of the DJ than Selma Blair was. I'll give this movie a five out of ten for it's efforts in remaking a classic film. There are some good moments with the use of the fog billowing into Antonio Bay and for trying to add to the story that John Carpenter/Debra Hill told, but like most remakes it just wasn't as good as the original.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The original version of The Fog wasn't any good either. The remake doesn't work for the same reasons. It takes more time than the film-makers have to develop the characters of the town. When they meet their various fates we don't know enough about them to care. We tend to forget who they were since they were dropped from the story till the end. Worse, the cohesion of the story is marred by the Mandatory African-American character. By his own admission, he comes from Chicago and is extraneous to the action. The time spent on his character introduces the themes of racial profiling and man's inhumanity to man. There was too much on the film-makers' plate already to take off a tangent, though I suspect the character was imposed on them. See the remake of Thirteen Ghosts if you want to another example of cohesion versus social exigency. In the case of The Fog, however, I don't think it would have been an effective film, gun pointed at their heads or not. The story of the ghosts is as dry as any in dull high school history text. A remake should be done by someone who is inspired to make the original much better. I didn't get that feeling here."

The characters are all paper thin but that really doesn't matter in a movie like this, essentially a cheap slasher flick with music video gloss. Tom Welling makes for an attractive but wooden leading man. Maggie Grace looks pretty but contributes nothing except for her role in one of the stupidest endings to a movie ever. Seriously, you have to watch this turd just to see that ridiculousness. Selma Blair is largely wasted. The worst character is that of the black best friend comic relief. He's annoying as hell and he just won't die. The supporting cast pales in comparison to the great supporting cast of the original.\n\nIt's a remake of a great movie so guess what...it sucks. This should surprise nobody. There was no attempt at originality or creativity in this film. But it's almost watchable in a superficial way. Almost."

Yes, there were some bad plot points, little things that happened and no one called anyone on it, but it was a horror movie, and I rarely expect continuity and for things to make the best sense. I liked the casting, and the ending worked out very well for my feeling about Maggie Grace as an actress. Tom Welling made a very nice leading man, attractive, compassionate and believable. The set was agreeable, nice lighting and color. I went to the movies to take the bad taste of the two aforementioned movies out of my mind and to have a couple hours of mindless entertainment. This movie filled the bill quite nicely. I'm sure it will become one of those movies that I watch every time it is on HBO or Showtime!"

Not for the last time did this filmmaker confound expectations and deliver something of lasting merit.

If this movie is a horror movie so are The pirates of the Caribbean and no one is calling that horror.\n\nIf it was a movie called The Ghosts of the past (or something like it,I'm not referring to any actual movie) classified as a fantasy, drama, mystery this movie would have been just fine, not great, but you know, another average movie with a couple of really good moments and a couple of really bad ones.\n\nI do agree that the second part of the move is better and that it can in no way compare to the original from 1980. I still remember watching that as a kid (I wasn't supposed to, so I would have nightmares) being all scared and spooked. In the new Fog some of the scenes that were supposed to be scary weren't scary but beautiful - and it's hard to be afraid of something beautiful. There are huge holes in the plot and some of the things that happen just don't make sense but oh well, many movies have that it's really not such a big deal.\n\nI think the main reason people hated this movie is that most of them have seen the original and can't help but compare the two, and the second reason is that it was supposed to be scary but it wasn't. With a different type of advertising people would know what to expect.\n\nStill if we for pretend, just for a second, that this movie was indeed advertised to me a fantasy drama mystery movie, without the horror part then it deserves a solid 6 :) I think you should watch it, just remember it's not a horror movie!"

The Original has a cool, scary atmosphere conjured up by a director at the top of his game in 1979 with a great performance from Adreinne Barbeau as Stevie Wayne and Hal Holbrook playing one of the all time favourite Horror Movie characters...Father Malone.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the original Fog only currently scores a 6.8 rating!!! with this remake scoring 3.5!!!\n\nNow I don't think Tom Welling, Maggie Grace & Selma Blair are ever going to be GREAT actors but i've seen them in other stuff (Tv's Smallville, Lost and with Blair in Hellboy) and they are perfectly fine but in this film they just bored the hell outta me with each passing minute.\n\nThe makers tried to jazz things up with a big laughable special effects ending, possibly trying to make up for the rest of the yawn fest.\n\nThis is COMPLETELY Different in tone, style & atmosphere to the Original. If I could go back in time & sabotage this remake I would.\n\n3.5!!! GENEROUS I say.\n\nRocketeerFlyer gives this one a going down 1/10 (0.5 each for pretty SELMA & MAGGIE)\n\nIf you have NEVER seen any of \"The Fog\" Movies STAY AWAY from this remake and treat yourself to the Original Classic which rates a 9/10"

Another thing about the remake, where are the townspeople and supporting roles, is there anybody that lives on this island besides the few casted actors and actresses? This leads to the atrocious acting or just completely forgettable roles by the cast, people were solely by their looks instead of talent. As a viewer it's understandable, glamorous, gorgeous actors/actresses might attract people to the theaters but it's no way going to be an impressionable movie in later years.\n\nThe next thing that is about to be trashed is the special effects of the ghosts that were all extremely phony looking because of poor computer generated imagery. The Fog itself didn't look at all as menacing and the setting and cinematography of the area wasn't portrayed nearly as much as it should have been. The filming location was beautiful and it was a waste not to take advantage of the area more than they could have. The final aspect of the movie that is hateable about the film is the head-scratching ending, like what was the rational and point of this twist other than to make people mad. The bogus story, terrible acting, and lack of scary substance makes The Fog (2005) worthy enough to it's appearances in \"worst of lists\" as far as remakes go."

The ONLY saving grace in this movie is the outstanding performance of SELMA BLAIR. She's funny and sincere. Great actress, she needs to choose better projects.\n\nThe nature of the evil-that-lurks is inconsistent and confusing. The deaths are so unpredictable that the suspense is effectively lost. There are times that you feel that a character should really die but is saved. And, there are a lot of times that someone is just scrapped off the screen just like that. Horror flicks are usually no-brainers, but this movie is such a great big loose-ends galore that I can't help but wonder in awe at the blatant disjoints. I don't even want to start thinking about it."

No logic or intellectual stimulation of any sort. If I had gone to the theater to see this I would not have been a happy camper. I actually felt like the cast was a good selection, but the story line was really weak especially considering it was a remake. There was so much more that could have been accomplished here. It was a waste of an opportunity to deliver good remake of a horror classic. JM2C"

I will always remember the funny parts of the movie.

Although the cast try hard to breath life into an impossible script, it all comes to a cringe-worthy effort to watch even half ot his mega-bomb. When you have a title like this one, the audience expects at least a few cheap jump scares but there's nothing. It's like the movie makers went to a Walmart, brought a hand-held video camera, gathered some friends to join in making a \"scary movie\" and this was the result. Don't waste your time or your life on this deadly dull concoction of miserable film-making at its worse. Ed Wood could have done this much, much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "A film that aspires to nothing, that achieves nothing and doesn't add much to lives, this remake of Carpenter's classic \"The Fog\" is pure rubbish and another proof that some directors shouldn't be allowed to work in the movie business. Gladly, the person in question vanished from the industry and only makes some short films here and there, and he's about to attempt a return to the scene. I'm talking about Rupert Wainwright, whose previous effort before this thing was the disappointing \"Stigmata\". It's a mystery to me that a career with such a spasmodic quantity and no quality, the doors are still open for him. Perhaps that Disney movie he did in 1994 was good enough in cash results and probably the only thing that keeps him going in the industry. As for his work in \"The Fog\", it's just silly. A poor man's horror flick that tries to imitate the original, make some 21st century adjustments, throw some plot twists and gives nothing back to us. And I'm mad that Carpenter and Debra Hill, the ones who brought us the great 1980 film stood as producers for this wreck.\n\nThe story is practically the same: Antonio Bay, a coastal city celebrating its 100th anniversary welcomes a mysterious killing fog that is taking over its places and its people. Among them Nick (Tom Welling) with his boat business; his girl Elizabeth (Maggie Grace), this time she isn't an ordinary hitchhiker, but Nick's girlfriend who left town some months ago; the lone radio host (Selma Blair) watching everything from her lighthouse; the drunk Father Malone (Adrian Hough) and others. Replicating the same basis doesn't equal same quality, even if you add elements to make it more interesting to audiences, e.g. the whole mystery behind the fog is told to us through good yet unnecessary flashbacks presenting a story from the past. Carpenter avoided that; instead of spoon-feeding us he used of diaries read by the father character or the opening campfire scene with the old man telling spooky stories to the kids. The flashback used now is well made, possibly the most interesting and most horrific the film gets, because outside of that realm the movie is a hilarious mess.\n\nNo rooting character, goofs after goofs, one or two plot holes and some inconsistencies that it's not even fun mentioning, they're not worthy of such pinpoint. OK, one that was amazingly laughable was when Tom crashed his car (Elizabeth and the radio host kid were also there) into a boat and everyone in the car pass out. Cut to a few scenes later, when we return to see what happened to them, Elizabeth is hurt outside of the car while Tom and the kid are on the other side. No one had gotten out of the vehicle in the previous moment. That had cracking me up for a long time; and by that time I wasn't more interested in the picture. It wasn't scary, thrilling or anything. It just kept pushing things and ideas that only amounted to nothing.\n\nOne of the few things that made this tolerable was the cast. I don't see a case for qualifying none of the actors as bad, but the only bad thing for them was acting in it, getting a credit and a payment for it. Not saying there's good caliber performances but they didn't annoy me as usually bad actors tend to do while they're in a lousy film. Welling has some appeal though it only works for TV public who won't forget his \"Smallville\" days - and let's face, in the terms of a girl attracted to a guy the scenario played with him and Maggie Grace is far more realistic than Tom Atkins and Jamie Lee Curtis in the original film. Speaking of Maggie, I can't see her anything besides Shannon in \"Lost\" and that's already a stretch since I can't stand that character, and she uses of some her traits here as well (and she doesn't have Jamie Lee queen of horror appeal). Annoying as hell just like the guy playing Father Malone. Selma Blair, veterans Rade Serbedzija, Kenneth Welsh and Sara Botsford are fine but their potential was wasted in this junk. The cast made their best given the material they were forced to work with.\n\nMr. Wainwright has said this at one time: \"I think all films should aspire to be art, and all art should aspire to be entertaining.\" Well, if that's his philosophy then I wonder when did something like \"The Fog\" is allowed to be considered as art? Or for that matter, an entertainment?\" This movie cannot be considered anything except filler of time, waste of time. And if a filmmaker dares to say something like that, it means that he doesn't know much about his trade. It's not impossible what he said, it can be done but the quality of the material, whatever it is, gets very compromised. Because for art to be entertaining, it must lose its power of being an art (something that echoes/mirrors life, bringing a relevance to it) and becomes something for the masses, which is something art utopically aspires to be but isn't. It's always restricted. And now we're putting art and this dreadful experience in the same sentence. Blame it on the director for saying that stupid remark.\n\nThis one goes for the hall of shame for its lack of substantial goodness. It doesn't scare, it just makes you sleepy. I thought I was little biased since I had just seen the classic back to back with this one but even without comparing them, this remake doesn't stand on its own merits, if there was at least one. I already imagine horror fans talking about \"The Fog\" as if being one of the worst films ever made, and some confused interlocutor will ask which version they're referring to. Shame, shame. 2/10"

In fact, in its development, production and technical details it is in some aspects better than John Carpenter's version, although its only fault is not having that tense and ghostly tone, including the gloomy soundtrack that characterizes Carpenter's version so much. Still, it's a good movie and those who think otherwise are wrong. My rating for this movie is 9/10."

At least, they could lead to different ending. That would turn them on too.\n\nIf the script goes wrong, even a master would never make it better. That's my point.

        "review_detailed_main": "For starters whats with the 4 month gap between the U.S release date and the UK release date? I live in the UK and have just watched this and its ashame it wasn't released in time for Halloween in the UK but Saw 2 was good enough.\n\nIf you love the last years so called horror crap 'The Grudge, Boogyman, The Skeleton Key' the odds are you're going to like this. Its not as bad as what people have said and at least deserves a 5.0 rating.\n\nIt will upset a lot of fans who love the original, as the reason fans were excited about the remake is because, everyone would hope it did what the original didn't manage to do in terms of scares due to Carpenter not thinking of anything else scary to make the original an extra 20 minutes longer.Unfortuanaly the remake doesn't do this.\n\nThe main fault of the film, is it was definitely made for teenagers who will think this is the scariest film ever. Some of the cast are way to young, as the makers should have realised there would have been nothing wrong with having an older cast. Although Tom Welling does't do a bad job and it nice to see him in something other than Smallville (And I'm not a Smallville fan before anyone starts). Selma Blair as Stevie Wanye just doesn't work as she has a child that looks about 12 and is way to fit to be playing a mother. Also what happened to the ghosts actually killing people with hooks, thats what made the original scary and thats why the remake fails as it just isn't scary anymore, and they also got rid of the ghosts red eyes. It was like watching the same CGI as the ghosts out of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean. The ghosts now have powers to kill people by using fire, glass and a knife this isn't The Fog the fans wanted to see in the remake. One bit in particular made me angry as the ghosts now have the power to touch people and turn them into skeletons which is just ridiculous and goes against the original. Oh and another thing you thought the makers would have used was John Carpenters scary score, seeing as he produced the remake. Thats what gave the original its suspense and tension and is really missed. Instead we're given Jameriquai to listen to in one scene.\n\nWhat put me off at first was a little thing called PG-13 why????? The Fog should have been made to receive an r-rating as you wanted to see some gore or some actually decent scares, but that never really happens. It will probably receive a 15 rating in the UK, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was given a 12A in the end.\n\nAlso the plot of the story just doesn't really come together especially the ending, which is very weak. The main plot is there although the founders of Antonio Bay shoot the pirates instead of drowning them which doesn't seem as menacing as the original plot.\n\nThe actual fog effects are quite impressive when it covers the town, and one bit especially on the beach was quite scary and actually built some tension. The acting isn't to bad and the last half an hour really picks up after a slow start. Its likely to impress the audience who haven't seen the original but doesn't even compete with the Carpenter's film.\n\nFrom watching The Fog is easy to understand why some remakes should not be made and this is one of them. I had really high hopes for this film as i thought it could actually be made scarier and better than the original but just doesn't even come close. Half way through I thought John Carpenter would have been better off remaking it himself as it seemed an insult to his classic.\n\nOverall go and see it its not that bad and you'll be entertained for 100 minutes. The whole feel of the film felt like it was mad by Fox as it comes down to being aimed at teenagers. I think Stevie Wanyes speech at the end sums the film up 'Why Did It Come Back'?????????"

If you are willing to see bad CGI go watch Peter Jackons King Kong, the Computer Animations are well placed in The Fog.\n\nThe Acting is at an average, not much to moan around here.
