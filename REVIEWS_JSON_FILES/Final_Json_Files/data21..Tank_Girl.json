        "review_detailed_main": "the original comic book version of tank girl is a cheerfully nonsensical riot of sex, violence and awesome fashion. unfortunately, for some inexplicable reason, the filmmakers have decided that the film-version of tank girl has to make more sense and be more \"deep\". so they gave her an environmental motivation, a shy best friend she can empower, and a little girl whos mother figure she can be. none of this works, and it takes away a lot of the charming randomness that made the original tank girl so awesome. add some pretty bad performances, unfunny jokes and a boring plot, and you have a seriously awful movie. and yet and yet... i found myself enjoying it. is it because of my low expectations? or because of my weakness for ass-kicking female leads? the funky costume-designs? the high energy level? or was i just won over by that male strip early in the movie? (every movie should start with a cute dude getting nekkid!) whatever it was, tank girl is fun despite its frustratingly low quality - the way barbarella or xena warrior princess are fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interesting concept, creative art style, cute characters and a goofy tone throughout but that's about it. It's like the generic romantic comedy of light cyberpunk(ish?) movies, lacks real depth, has one gear and sticks to it and last but not least can't build on the universe. This is unforgivable in any movie which asks that little bit more from the audience to suspend disbelief, like one set in a post apocalyptic Australia ruled by the iron fist of a mega corporation in a fascistic regime. The creators probably thought the silly tone would make the audience overlook this lack of story building but as a result the movie ultimately falls short of the premise and fails to capitalize on the aforementioned positive aspects.\n\nAs a final note, this movie is not cyberpunk. It has some influences (just like the comic series) of cyberpunk but that is as far as it goes."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the year 2033 and Kesslee, the leader of Water & Power holds the World in his clutches as he controls all H20 after the meteor hit creating vast desert wastelands, though tank girl and Jet girl team up with some scientific kangaroo creations called Rippers who want to bring down Water and Power.\n\nWhat you get is a very colourful over-the-top and in-your-face film on a British cult comic strip. I have never read any of these comic books, so I don't know how true the film is- but from what I mostly heard and read, it's not- but who cares it looked like it would be a fun viewing.\n\nAfter watching this mess I don't know why? As I just couldn't bear to fully bag it out and that's why I gave it 5. I know it was trash- but still I found it visually good and kinda amusing\u0085 in a stupid way.\n\nThe script is awfully bad, the performances were mostly ludicrous and direction was quite tragic, as the scenes just seem to limp along without any panache. Though the film makes up for it with its upbeat soundtrack that was coordinated by Courtney Love and featuring the likes of Bjork, Hole, Iggy Pop, Bush and Veruca Salt, while it's vibrantly rich and bizarre comic backdrop is quite eye-catching, even though the sets do look kind of cheap. The added comic cartoon interludes throughout the film I found to be more satisfying at times than the actual live scenes, making you think it would have probably been better if they stuck to a cartoon version.\n\nThe performances I had mix feelings about. Lori Petty as Tank Girl was fair and brings a chirpy attitude- but the humour at times was a bit stale, especially some of her cringe-worthy one-liners and from what I grasp about the character she was playing she totally looked the part but was no where near what she acts like in the comic series. Namoi Watts as Jet Girl I thought was the standout, which isn't saying much- but she was far subtle and innocently sweet and that worked for me. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad, as he really hams it up as the villain Kesslee and Ice-T as a Ripper is unrecognisable and fairly irritating- but anyway what's new?\n\nThe direction was really muddled, mainly flashier- but no substance in the scenes to make it stand out from the average Sci-fi film and the pace of the film was a bit patchy in spots, such as the flat musical scene and when Tank and Jet girl were hanging out with the rippers at their base. The Ripper designs were reasonably good by Stan Winston, with each with their own personality and distinguishing features- but that didn't make them likable.\n\nWhile the plot, if there was one was just basically a been there done that feel and lack any sort of detail and urgency. I thought the story started out alright and was quite lively but it kind of lost steam halfway through and especially when the annoying Rippers took centre stage. There are some interesting elements thrown into the mix, like the device that sucks water out of people.\n\nFor me it's one of those films that it's so bad, it's good entertainment. So it breaks even for me."

This is a horribly dated comedy-action film set in a post-apocalyptic world ruled over by an evil megalomaniac, played by Malcolm McDowell with maximum ham. Into this world comes Tank Girl as played by Lori Petty, a loud, bratty, and entirely overbearing young heroine who proceeds to kick plenty of backside as she takes the fight to the bad guys.\n\nI remember thinking that Stallone's much-maligned JUDGE DREDD, which came out in the same year, was actually quite a fun film and TANK GIRL serves to prove that opinion; it makes JUDGE DREDD look masterful by comparison. This is a loud, brash, noisy, and stupid film, without an ounce of wit and plenty of stupidity instead. You have to wonder what possessed the producers to make such a derivative and dumb movie, filled with one-dimensional characters and no real plot amid the insanity. Modern viewers can only sit back and wonder at Naomi Watts in an awful early acting performance and the stupidity of the costumes of those kangaroo people which come straight out of a kid's film. So bad it's good? Nah, so bad it's plain silly."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people tend to dismiss this movie because of it's \"comic book\" feel and comic-book (really) transitions.\n\nI enjoyed this movie a LOT, as it has the same \"feel\" as the original comic books I remember reading, and the same style of humor. It's very well done for 1995, the dialogue is well-scripted for the intent of the movie, and the funny stuff is actually funny. Some of the action scenes are a bit \"campy\" - but then again, they're *supposed* to be that way in this kind of movie. In addition, I thought the acting was excellent, and that Lori Petty (who played \"Kit\" in \"A League of Our Own) Malcolm McDowell (practically legendary) and Naomi Watts were excellent choices for their characters, as were the rest of the supporting cast. Lori Petty hasn't been in anything \"huge\" since this movie, which is truly a pity as she is an excellent and versatile actress. Look for some interesting supporting actors, including Ice-T, Iggy Pop, and James Hong.\n\nListen to the comedic dialogue carefully - most of the punchlines are funny on several levels, which I found most refreshing, and you'll encounter a lot of funny double-entendre.\n\nDon't look for a bunch of CGI computer effects in this movie. However, well-designed and imaginative props and sets give a good feeling of \"authenticity\" to the scenes, and the visual and special effects are excellent.\n\nDon't bother critiquing little details and spurious claptrap like that with this movie - it sets out to be a comic-book-style fun action-adventure and accomplishes that goal magnificently. (The funniest thing is that the plot precept of a mega-corporation in control of the world's water supply is becoming more and more of a plausible idea and leads one to think of a possible metaphoric reference to the world oil situation) This movie might have been rated \"R\" at the time for adult situations & violence (and a little nudity), but I didn't notice a whole lot of \"foul language\", and I didn't really see much in the movie that wouldn't be put on broadcast TV today.\n\nThis movie has everything - good acting, evil villains, cute heroines, mutants, cool vehicles, explosions, big sets, a huge supporting cast, hilarious humor, great stunts, and even a classic musical number with a full chorus line! (\"Let's Do It\" by Cole Porter) It even pokes fun at beat poetry. All-in-all, well worth seeing.\n\nIf you like stuff like \"The Wizard of Speed and Time\", \"Flash Gordon\", \"Johnny Mnemonic\", \"Space Truckers\", \"Ice Pirates\", or \"Yellowbeard\" then you'll definitely love this movie. Even if you don't, see this movie anyway - it may change your mind about this genre.\n\nFrom personal experience: \"Chicks dig this flick.\"\n\nGet the popcorn & enjoy."

Unfortunately (at least I believed it was unfortunate at the time), I never got around to it and so it was consigned to the \"I'll get the video out one day\" bucket.\n\nRecently, it was screened on TV so I recorded it. I was excited. I had waited a 7 years for this. And that is the why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing despite the signs being bad initially, falling to awful, then 'oh my god' and somehow still managing to sink further by the end.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever written a review of a movie for IMDB but was compelled to do so to try to save others from the suffering I endured as a result of this movie.\n\nTo name but a few of the very worst elements (and I really am skipping a *lot* of other bad things): i) Continuous \"cool\" \"attitude\" from the \"sexy\" heroine. Note the usage quotes to indicate those terms I believe to be woefully misused. By the end I really *really* wanted the bad guys to kill her. ii) Mutants (including Ice-T!!) dressed up as human kangaroos. Suspension of disbelief became challenging at this point. iii) \"Humour\" on a par with that of David Brent in The Office. For those who haven't seen The Office, David Brent is the ultimate exponent of not-funny-but-thinks-he-is and the point of the program is largely how cretinous he really is. Actually, Tank girl's writers were possibly worse. iv) No, sorry, can't really go on as the flashbacks are too painful.\n\nTank Girl has now taken the crown as the worst movie I have ever seen away from Highlander 2. I really didn't believe it possible, but there you go."

It's got a killer soundtrack. It's chock full of feminist grrrl power. The casting is interesting, from Malcolm McDowell and Naomi Watts to Ice-T and Iggy Pop. There's a seamless flow between the comic book and the live-action. The old-school, in-camera effects are pretty flawless\u2014they dropped some serious coin. And Lori Petty really nails it, bringing a comic book character to life.\n\nLook, there's no deep moral message or \"hero's journey\" here\u2014it's based on a comic book, after all. It's just fun, escapist entertainment. I'm generally a fan of world cinema, and \"Tank Girl\" is by no means a classic.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ten years ago if someone had given you $25 Million dollars and challenged you make the worst flick possible with the money (stipulating that ALL the money had to actually be spent making the movie), it is unlikely that you could have deliberately matched Rachel Talaly's \"Tank Girl\". I blundered into a showing of \"Tank Girl\" during its short-lived (and basically disastrous) release and found it memorable for its comic page scene transitions (borrowed from television's \"Wonder Woman\") and its spoof of the action/adventure movie genre. Unfortunately the animation just makes you wish that the whole thing was animation while the moronic nature of all the live action scenes makes you question whether spoofing the genre was by design or by accident.\n\nTen years later it has some retrospective interest relative to the disparate career directions of Lori Petty and Naomi Watts. It is simply impossible to make Petty sexy; no matter how glamed-up, erotically posed, or provocatively scripted. Conversely it is impossible for Watts to not be sexy, no matter how hard they try to detune, grime-up, and disguise her.\n\n\"Tank Girl\" poses the question, why do so many people dislike it, both now and at the time of its release ten years ago? Lori Petty is the most obvious answer. Petty's basic personality embodies the most irritating qualities of Lucille Ball with none of Lucy's humor and charm. She is irritating even in her low-key roles (\"A League of Their Own\"). Apparently she was cast as \"Tank Girl\" for exactly that quality and Director Rachel Talaly managed to bring her full irritating potential to the screen. But the producers forgot to connect the dots before they spent $25 Million on production, irritating is sometimes good in supporting roles (insert Stiffer here) but not as the main character.\n\nAbout two thirds of the way into the story Petty and Watts fall into the hands of a group of genetically engineered fellows called \"The Rippers\". At first this appears to be going in the direction of \"Dark Angel\" meets \"Captain Kangaroo\". But Talaly switches direction a bit and ends up with a post-apocalyptic version of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". For a few minutes the movie is actually a lot of fun. Then it is time to get back to the basic story, which by this time everyone (viewers, director, cast, and editor) has pretty much forgotten. This does not pose the post-production problems it does in other movies because Talaly seems committed to insuring that no element of \"suspense\" is present to distract you from Petty's irritating performance.\n\nThe Tank Girl comic strip embodied a freewheeling anti-authoritarian anarchism, with some feminist and even lesbian themes. Although Talaly faithfully captures a small amount of this spirit she fumbles big time with the basic storytelling (insert no suspense). Which is hardly a revelation given her other directorial attempts (including \"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\" and \"Ghost in the Machine\"-arguably even worse than \"Tank Girl\"). If she actually liked the comic strip she should have yielded control to a competent director or at least someone with a basic talent for directing actors and for making feature films."

        "review_detailed_main": "That is my opinion of course. I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods.\n\nI do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way.\n\nHowever, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track.\n\nCharacters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky.\n\nOverall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

But it seemed like I was the only one who did; the reviews in the paper trashed it, my friends hated it, and it was out of the theater before most folks ever got a chance to see it. Now it seems to be having something of a renaissance on video. Its reputation is growing, but there is still an awful lot of silly hatred for this film out there, and I think folks are really being unreasonable about it. Okay, so this is a silly movie. So what? It was supposed to be. It's just an action flick. Check out the page for Die Hard, for example. That film rates an 8.0, while this poor movie is stuck at 4.6. Why? Sure, Die Hard had better effects; it had a slightly larger budget, too. But Tank Girl is funnier, smarter (no, really, I mean it) and has far more interesting characters. Lori Petty is sexy and mad-funny. Neither film is high art but this one is simply more enjoyable (and I like both), so why the huge difference in ratings? It seems like the expectations for this film were higher than they should have been, maybe because the feminist theme (good women kicking evil men's butts) misled people into expecting a work of serious political or social intent. But if anyone thought that, they obviously knew nothing about the film or the story coming into it. In the first place, the movie was based on a COMIC BOOK, for goodness' sake. For that matter, the comic in question was basically a feminized and humorized version of The Road Warrior, not all that serious a motion picture in itself. Also, the casting of Malcolm McDowell as the villain should have provided a clue; he's the most reliable bad guy in Hollywood, because you always know exactly the character you're going to get out of him. The trailer, with all the crazy outfits, ridiculous kangaroo costumes, and zany one-liners shouldn't have misled anyone. Plus, why on Earth would expect Citizen Kane from a film called \"Tank Girl\" in the first place? This movie is exactly what you want for kicking back and enjoying an evening: a fast-paced, engaging bit of semi-sci-fi which, surprisingly, really does achieve a few genuinely beautiful moments, especially the dust-shower scene (to Portishead's \"Roads\"). Ignore all the cynics. This film is a blast. It's pure entertainment with a good cast and zany, silly story\u0085it's the closest you'll ever get to a live-action Bugs Bunny cartoon. Just lay back and dig it. P.S. The soundtrack is fun, too."

I thought there might be some campy fun in it, a \"so bad\" it becomes good vibe perhaps, I was wrong. I had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it. Now I know why. I was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners. The special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action. It's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings, however cool they might be (an uncensored animated feature would be way better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. As a matter of fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation.\n\nIt does have some interesting songs by known artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. Once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible. I think that's when I totally tuned out. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her \"attitude\" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role. It might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves (check out the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia).\n\nRating: 3 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Tank Girl was a movie I had heard about for some years, but had never sought it out; not something I thought would make for quality viewing, some silly mid 90s comedy about some weird girl hero or other. Boy, was I wrong! This is a definition of guilty pleasure, or close to it for a mid 90s comic book movie, and it's one I would be more than happy to pop in on a sick day from work. It's a movie you have to smile at, feel like both the kid in you and the dirty bastard or girly girl loves to chomp on like some stupid comic book that has all the meat and gravy of a full-throttle action story mixed in with lots of irreverent humor. It pops and crackles like a comic book (hell, it even throws in animated segways, maybe as a way to save money, but it looks as cool as anything from the period), and it's got a weird ensemble ranging from Malcom McDowell to Iggy Pop and Ice-T... as a Kangaroo.\n\nLori Petty stars in what could be considered a real career high point. Before seeing her in this I only remembered her as Geena Davis's sister in A League of Her Own, and wondered if she could pull it off. At first her image is like a junkyard Gwen Stefani (and Stefani of No Doubt period), but she's got the attitude of a real bad-ass, which is important as her role in this often pitts her into the likes of Snake Plissken and some other cowboy types, but always with the spunk of a punk rock chick with style and wit to spare. She's in a post apocalyptic world where water is a precious commodity (though, unlike Waterworld, it doesn't flaunt the irony of 'all this water and not a drop to drink', albeit there's a hot 'dust' shower scene). A mad commander of a corporation (McDowell, subtle ham-bone if there could be an oxymoron as such) who controls water and, thus, power. He captures her for hard slave labor, but she teams up with a young Naomi Watts and escapes to a renegade gang of kangaroos as they plot to destroy the evil corporation and...\n\nYeah, kangaroos, and that's not all- one of them is really half kangaroo and half dog! It's all very silly, but it revels in its silliness, and makes a note of every other second or so reminding you how buoyant it is with its reckless energy and humor and design. It's a lot like if a Sci-fi channel of the week movie actually worked well; the production design isn't too tacky and eye-catching on a fairly low budget, the actors are all having a ball playing odds and ends of good guys or kangaroos or villainous water mongers. And at the middle is Petty, who is sweet and charming and dangerous and puts on an outfit and hair style like a reject from the latest Hot Topic catalog (and damn proud of it). You kind of have to dig what she's about in the part to dig a lot of the picture, but once plugged in- on top of stuff like McDowell's reconstruction surgery, Watts with black hair and glasses, and Ice-T and that guy from Buffy as kangaroo manimals- it's hard not to have a total gas with it. If you were a kid in the 90s, its hard not to have a go at it."

This is another in the series of big old messes to which he brings a much needed touch of class.\n\n\n\nNobody in this film (the weary veteran McDowell apart) seems to know what their character is supposed to be. There are few actual conversations, mostly confused monologues delivered to empty space; perhaps they're all too embarrased to make eye contact. There's too much budget to allow the raw charm of Repo Man, but not enough to make the FX anything other than embarrasing. Is the titular tank a tardis? Why is it the size of a winnebago inside, and is it a T-72, an M-47 or an M4? Why do bullets strike sparks when they hit sand? Everything about this film is desultory and barely adequate, and every opportunity to take a suprising direction or even provide a decent disjoint is missed. It's the slackness of indie filmmaking blended with the no-risk anodyness of Hollywood.\n\nThe biggest flaw is Petty. She switches from concussed to hyperactive more or less at random, and - while she does have a decent big eyed blank look going - she's simply too old to play a part that requires an almost unachievably idealised fantasy pubescent. Tank Girl needs the insane toothy over-confidence of youth, not the over-cosmetic and over-calculated maturity that Petty displays. She actually does manage to deliver some decently amusing one liners, but most of the time she falls slightly short of being genuinely winning.\n\nI would have given this a full 4/10 for the (initial) geek chic of Jet Girl, and for the unapologetic premise that the only thing not in short supply in this post apocalyptic world are cosmetics and ammo. However, it gets dinged one because of the comic cutscenes. Not because they're bad, but because they're the BEST thing in this mess: that just reminds us there's a fair amount of flair and verve here, being suppressed under the stifling blanket of no-risk filmmaking. And then there's the matter of the Endearing Child Hostage. I know it's a genre convention, but it's supremely annoying and utterly, bone chillingly irrelevant and unnecessary. Then there's the slight problem that towards the end, Jet Girl discovers lipstick and suddenly seems not to need her glasses. That's so teen movie that it's not even funny. So a full 1 out of 10, then. For shame, for shame."

The editing is also annoying, very MTV stylized. Another thing that's missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. The humor isn't much funny either.

        "review_detailed_main": "For those unfamiliar with the cult British comic strip, which first began in 1988, Tank Girl will come as a bit of a shock. Directed by Rachel Talalay, the film is, visually, a little jarring, and the story is bizarre and really very silly. The jokes are mostly pretty crude, the premise for the plot is needlessly complex and the acting is nothing sensational. All in all, it's hard for me personally to come up with one valid reason for why I enjoyed it so much.\n\nThe year is 2033, and the earth is now rather barren; since a meteor hit the planet 11 years ago, it has ceased to rain. Water and power have been monopolized by a big, heartless company, aptly named Water & Power, and run by evil super-villain Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). In the desert, however, lies a hippie rebellion commune who are secretly stealing water, whilst attempting to stay safe from the infamous race of monsters that live under the earth, known as Rippers. Amongst this community lives Rebecca (Lori Petty), a boisterous, fun-loving, thrill seeker with no respect for authority. But when Water & Power soldiers find out that their water is being stolen, the hideout is raided, and Rebecca is taken captive to work for the evil Kesslee. But wait; there's more.\n\nRefusing to co-operate, Rebecca is kept with countless other prisoners until she accepts the offer. Whilst here she meets a shy, submissive mechanic girl known only as Jet (a young and dark-haired Naomi Watts, sporting her natural Australian accent). Convincing Jet to rebel against the oppressive institution and break free with her to claim their lives back, they steal a plane and a tank to escape, the latter of which Rebecca takes a liking to, and thus the title.\n\nAnd the film carries on in this manner. Really, the plot is just an accessory to the outrageous absurdity that is the film and that some will find funny and others will not. Though playing a rather irritating character, Lori Petty doesn't give a terrible performance as Rebecca, aka Tank Girl. Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts and music performer Ice-T also do the best that can be expected, and they are all clearly having fun with this big goof of a movie.\n\nOne thing that the picture could be praised for, in terms of filmic value, is that it turns so many tired genres on their heads. The gratuitous violence and gaping plot holes akin to action movies (where the bad guys can never aim), the underlying voyeurism that seems to always come with Hollywood films that have any female characters, these things are all brought right out to the front and put in your face, a long overdue wake up call to film-makers who rely on such transparent cinema devices.\n\nApart from this, Tank Girl is really just a big silly joke. One that I, for some reason, actually found pretty entertaining and funny. What does that say about me, I wonder?"

With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure.\n\nWell, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall.\n\nThis story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky.\n\nThis film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor.\n\nMuch like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.\n\n3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)"

It's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is.\n\nThere are several \"modern-pop\" references in the film, which I found to be very strange, given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future. It wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either. Some better writing would have helped loads.\n\nNaomi Watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek. I think they should have probably switched roles.\n\nI'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless they were a Petty fan.\n\nTry not to see this movie. Total waste of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie adaptation of a British comic book. It's 2033--Earth had been hit by a giant comet 11 years before. It wiped out most of civilization and (somehow) caused it never to rain again. Water is in very short supply and evil Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) is hoarding it all and controlling it. He's attacked by the Rippers--a gang of mutant man-animals (don't ask). He also attacks Rebecca (Lori Petty) and destroys most of her friends. She vows revenge. That's (sort of) the plot.\n\nThe original comic book was great. Tons of sex, nudity, violence, strong aggressive women and a stubborn refusal to take itself seriously. The movie tries to recreate that--and it succeeds! The nudity is gone and sex and the violence were toned down but the strong female characters remain. It all starts out with a great opening song and cartoon images from the comic book shoved in your face. Then Rebecca orders her boyfriend Richard (Brian Wimmer) to strip at gunpoint! Then it starts to get strange... There is a plot but the story keeps taking detours with STRANGE (but fun) dialogue, a loud aggressive alternative soundtrack, animated sequences and even a show stopping song and dance number! This all somehow fits together and the movie never stops moving. Set designs are incredible--filled to the brim with pop culture. Director Rachel Talalay deserves credit for keeping this all together.\n\nThe acting is great--McDowell goes over the top (enjoyably), Naomi Watts is fun as Jet Girl and Petty is just beyond belief as Tank Girl. Loud, aggressive, snapping off one-liners left and right and a STRONG female character who never stops fighting. Just great all the way! United Artists had no idea how to market this picture (it IS difficult) so it bombed but it acquired a cult following. This isn't for everybody (a lot of critics hated it) but I loved it. A 10.\n\nBest exchange: Tank Girl asks the madam of a whorehouse to sing. The madam asks, \"What song?\" Tank Girl responds, \"Let's Do It by Cole Porter, 1929.\" The madam: \"I HATE that song\"."

I'm not developmentally delayed so the child-like humor and wit of the movie is like drinking sulfuric acid, I mean Lori Petty's acting and delivery causes real pain. Some cut-scenes show the comics this movie is adapted from and those scenes are intriguing those scenes are vivid glowing things- and when you think that its merely comic book art stills, y'know, motionless movie frames then compare it to the actual motion picture, its clear that the drawings are the best parts. Everything sucks, the lighting the acting the costumes the sets, but raise a glass to Naomi Watts, she can actually act and is gorgeous as a brunette."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Rebecca Buck (aka Tank Girl), as played by Lori Petty, we have what is probably the single most irritating live-action comic-book character ever to make it to the silver screen. The intention was clearly to make Rebecca a lovable, quirky, anarchic, spunky, funny, sexy, alternative anti-heroine with attitude, someone with whom everyone, regardless of their sex, could fall for. Petty's grating grrl-power performance ensures that the opposite rings true: she is shrill, obnoxious and tiresome in the extreme.\n\nUnfortunately, Petty's painful performance isn't the only problem with Tank Girl. Director Rachel Talalay's attempts at capturing the rebellious spirit of the comic fall flat on their face. With seemingly no understanding of what does and does not work, Talalay chucks everything onto the screen no matter how cringe-worthy, including what could qualify as the most awkward song and dance number in the history of cinema. Meanwhile, Malcolm MacDowell and Ice-T chalk up another bomb on their respective filmographies and make-up legend Stan Winston tries but fails to make human kangaroos not look as stupid as they sound.\n\nA cool alternative soundtrack adds some much needed oomph to proceedings, there are some surprisingly slick scenes of animation (that suggest that the whole thing would have worked far better as a feature length animated movie) and Naomi Watts is likable as Rebecca's nerdy side-kick Jet Girl (the actress looking great with dark hair), but it's nowhere near enough to prevent this film from being a tedious, virtually unwatchable mess."

The whole movie is about the clothes, make-up and weird haircut of the lead actress. No deadly situation can stop her from delivering yet another cool one-liner and she always look her \"best\" (3 inches of fresh make-up and a new wardrobe) even after spending days crawling in a desert. The use of very long samples from hip-back-then rock bands and the very long cartoon intermissions totally kill the little momentum the movie has going. The story and acting are as pathetic as the \"special effects\" (you can clearly see the cables in the back of the jumping half-human creatures). Worst than Battlefield Earth. 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was a Sunday in April 1995, and that I would find this Tank Girl Movie I saw advertised. I though Tank Girl being a bad ass woman would also be sexy, as I was into that sort of thing. I had to drive about 30 miles to find a theatre that still had it, and finally I found one in another State. Obviously this being a couple weeks after Tank Girl came out, this meant the movie did not do well.\n\nI watch Tank Girl and did not realize I was watching the same Lori Petty who played \"Kit\" the sister of the Baseball Star in \"A League Of Our Own\". Despite being a badass chick who always rode a Tank, Tank Girl herself was far from sexy. The hair the, tattoos, and the way she dressed, and other things about her were just too manly to be sexy,to me. The movie also interjected Cartoons of Tank Girl throughout, that at times were sexy, but most of the time were not.\n\nThe movie was really not very entertaining either and featured the typical clich\u00e9 bad guys, who were, about as predictable as watching clock movement. This movie did not feature any deep thinking, or any original ideas, and was simply meant to entertain us with snappy and sometimes \"Off The Wall\" one liners from the Tank Girl throughout, which gets old after a while. There is also interspecies issues in the movie, and the less I think about those...the better.\n\nI was kind of falling asleep in the theatre. when I noticed that one of women in the movie was changing, that being Jet Girl played by Naomi Watts (with dark hair). At that point without giving too much away, Jet Girl goes from a mumbling, mousy under-confident, and quite unattractive, glasses wearing woman to extremely sweet looking and pretty and at that very same moment...\n\nshockingly sadistic and brutal.\n\nThis contrasting change-over that indicates the prettier, the more brutal, was very shocking and for me super sexy!\n\nJet Girl's changeover is the one thing, I will always remember about this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I shouldn't hate-watch movies. I know I shouldn't. You should walk into the theater with zero expectations, leaving with an unbiased impression instead of a smirk. But yesterday, I did something most movie critics should not do: I went to hate-watch Insurgent with my bubbly teenage sister who was most definitely not hate-watching the film. I won't go into details (to be fair, I just posted my review of Insurgent only yesterday), but what I will admit is that I left the cinema with a strong feeling of meh, if that's even a feeling (the youths act like it is these days). It's a \"blockbuster\" for the teen crowd, a B-version of The Hunger Games. Its biggest crime is not being meh; its biggest crime is being so devoid of any kind of personality.\n\nIn 2015, well-crafted action scenes and statuesque leads are not enough \u2014 they might have been in 1999, but we can no longer party like its 1999, because 1999 was, well, 16 years ago. Nowadays, all we can depend on is \u0085 spunk. It's a shame that a blockbuster as lame-brained as Insurgent is going to make so much money; what does it really have to offer?\n\nWhich finally brings me to Tank Girl, the 1995 would-be blockbuster that is better known today as being the film that lost $21 million dollars at the box-office, the film that should have made a Lori Petty a star but didn't, the film that Naomi Watts co-starred in before she became the \"it girl\" from Mulholland Dr., the film that now resides in the throes of two golden words: cult classic. I was reminded of the film during, yes, Insurgent, where Watts makes an appearance as the blandly handsome male lead's mother. In the theater, surrounded by giggling teenage girls, I found myself pondering about that money-losing cult classic I had known about but never watched for years.\n\nBut enough for backstories; mine, most likely, isn't as interesting as I'd like it to be. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that it's so unfair that Tank Girl, which is exploding with spunk and personality, is confined to the sad remarkability of a cult film, whereas Insurgent, which is about as interesting as your sad Uncle Alvarez, is going to make millions upon millions of dollars. (Cut to me going outside during this dark, rainy night, falling onto my knees, and yelling \"NOOOOOOOO!\" into the air like no one's watching.)\n\nIt comes down to this: please, please don't see Insurgent. See the breakneck speeded, freakish, abstract, one-liner infused saunter of Tank Girl. It won't make you smarter, and it certainly won't change your life, but I'll be damned if it doesn't enliven your spirits with its out- and-proud weirdness.\n\nThe year is 2033. 11 years earlier, a comet hit the Earth with devastating results, causing an endless drought that has turned most of the world into a parched desert. Little of the population remains; most work for, or head, the scheming Water & Power corporation, who use their massive authority to act as a sort of new, evil government. Their latest advancement? They now have the capability to purify blood into water, which is totally reasonable and not at all disgusting.\n\nA few people have escaped the clutches of the nefarious executives, however. Among them are Rebecca Buck, aka Tank Girl (Petty). She prides herself in her unwavering wildness: she's overtly sexual, loud, gross, and fearless, deadly with a gun and tough-talking in her words. Unlike the Trises and Katnisses of today, she is blatantly ballsy. She doesn't regret her actions, and she doesn't care what people think of her. When her commune is destroyed by W & P, though, she is kidnapped by their hilariously ghoulish leader (Malcolm McDowell), who sees promise in Tank Girl's defiant attitude but is threatened by it, throwing her into slave work. But of course, she escapes, with a new friend in tow (Naomi Watts). Of course, she embarks on a crazy adventure. Of course, she ends up winning the mini-battle against the company. But who cares about predictability when it's all wrapped up in a tie-dyed package of kookiness?\n\nAssembling itself in a sphere of scale-models, campy set-pieces, outlandish prosthetic makeup, animated interludes, and a soundtrack and tone that suggests it all was funded by classic era MTV, Tank Girl swirls in a blender of batshit energy, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. I guess it wants to be too many things at once: funny, sexy, cute, action-packed, and most clearly, fun, for lack of a better term. It isn't great at everything it attempts, but what Tank Girl never fails at is being downright amusing. Petty's tough broad fa\u00e7ade is consistently charming; her presence is so essential that her hit-or-miss (but mostly miss) career can be blamed for this career-defining portrayal. Personally, I think she's absolutely fantastic, but others might not be so sure (she's so delightfully manic).\n\nWhat makes the film work is how well it recognizes the bombastic insanity of its source. The comics, from what I've seen, are eye-popping creations of exaggerated punkiness, having all the swagger of a 15-year- old brat's daydreams. That tonal emphasis is brought into Tank Girl without any misgivings, and that's why it's so much better than (here we go again) Insurgent. Insurgent is so afraid to fail that it doesn't even try to be anything other than a fill-in-the-blank dystopian-set action- romance. Tank Girl can fall flat on its face once in a while, but at least it has the nerve to do so. It's not perfect, but Netflix streaming is much cheaper than a wasted ten dollars."

It is a movie to watch with friends and enjoy the music(Bjork, Portishead, etc) and glib retorts of tank girl herself. Why the low ratings?? Maybe people just don't appreciate the humour and subtle jokes. Like the buffalo being a water buffalo! Think about it, it is very funny in context. This movie is a must-see cult classic.

However, the visuals were not as stunning as I expected. Maybe its because it's an old 90's movie, but the the ships looked they were made of cardboard, the Rippers were incredibly cheesy costumes, etc. The plot felt like something I've seen before. Goofy & overly mean villain is holding the poor masses hostage & one of the peons rises to take him down. I felt like \"Rebecca\" was a really fun character for Lori Petty, but I thought she was kind of stupid, mumbling weird things all throughout the movie. There seemed to me a lot of disjointed imagery and side events that confused the main focus of the movie. Lastly...\"Tank Girl\" rarely ever even drove her tank!"

However, if you get in the mood, and if you ever liked reading comics stories, you may survive the film. Some of the effects are good, though most of them smell cheap budget. Punk and hard rock dominate the soundtrack, as you may expect. 5/10 on my personal scale."

Structured and designed just like a comic book with jagged editing techniques and animated fragments, but Tedi Sarafian's haphazard screenplay can't be camouflaged so easily. Sarafian never follows through on his ideas, while Rachel Taladay's direction is energetic but hectic. Petty is well-cast as Tank Girl, showing lots of full-throttle enthusiasm, but she's obnoxious instead of hearty (she's constantly in the audience's face). Had Taladay been more refined, we might have been charmed by Tank Girl's sass instead of constantly being put-off. Many proper ingredients are here for a live-action cartoon, yet the film is best described as a misfire. ** from ****"

There is only one part of the plot that is acceptable (corporation controlling the worlds water), but thats the only part of the plot/rest of the movie that isnt revolting. Oh, and there's this 10 minute comic sequence of the girls customizing the tank. It's so long and boring, it'll really make you wonder who the green-lighted this junk\n\n1/10\n\nIf you ever see this movie on the shelves of a video store, it is your civic duty to try to harm it in any way possible. The store owners might get mad at you at first, but that's only because they havn't seen the movie."

Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) and the Water & Power Corporation control 95% of the remaining water. Rippers are mysterious mutants killing and pillaging without leaving a trace. Rebecca Buck (Lori Petty) live in a small isolated community. W&P attacks and Rebecca is taken prisoner. She befriends scared mechanic Jet Girl (Naomi Watts). They try to use Rebecca as bait for the Rippers. Jet Girl musters up the courage and steals the jet to join her. She steals a tank and becomes Tank Girl. They discover that her young friend Sam was sent to work in the sex club Liquid Silver. After a failed rescue, Tank Girl and Jet Girl stumble upon the Rippers' hideout. They turn out to be mutated kangaroo-human supersoldiers.\n\nTank Girl may be the lead but I love Jet Girl. Lori Petty is possibly the perfect Tank Girl. She has the great irreverent energetic wildness. This is a campy comic book movie. It doesn't get campier than kangaroo hybrids but this movie won't be restrained by that. It is broadly amateurish and unrelenting cheesy. It's no masterpiece but it's awkwardly fun. Jet Girl does put this over the top for me and it's probably the first film I noticed Naomi Watts. It's likely years later that I realized that it was Naomi Watts after she got big. It also has some good music. There is simply nothing like this movie."

        "review_title": "Sassy classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rachel Talalay 's Tank Girl is a supremely underrated piece of punk-ish post apocalyptic sass that I love to revisit again and again. It soars on the same hyperactive plane as Saturday morning cartoons, but with a delicious R-rated bite, and a spunky, out of this world lead performance from Lori Petty. It captures the breakneck pace of the comic it's based on, and indeed moves along at the speed of a hummingbird on Ritalin, rarely pausing for air. The manic colours pop off the screen, the performances leap out at you like delirious mascots on a cereal box, and the vibe is go, go go for 90 glorious minutes straight, with a thumping soundtrack to keep the energy up. Lori Petty is a sexy, ADD addled wonder as the titular heroine, a desert dwelling, adorable wiseass who finds her compound and safe haven overrun with goons of the monstrous 'Water & Power' corporation, run by the sadistic megalomaniac Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). McDowell is no stranger to playing evil bigwig sons of bitches, and this one is the goddamn prototype. He leers, recites poetry, walks barefoot on broken glass with an sweetly angelic grin, and terrorizes basically everything that moves in a perfect performance of untold, ghoulish madness. Tank Girl finds herself at odds with the corporation, and swept up in a revolt against them, aided by shy, bi curious Jet Girl (Naomi Watts, who reportedly has bad mouthed this flick in interviews these days, now that she has a high horse to sit on. Don't listen to a word). She also finds allies in mysterious desert dwellin creatures who, get this, turn out to be genetic hybrids between humans and kangaroos, bred for war. The practical effects are wondrous, letting the actors shine through the masks. Jeff Kober is a sheepish joy as the dumb one, Booga. Ice T dials up the crankiness, and third who is the reincarnation of Jack Kerouac. There's a rollicking Cole Porter musical number, no end of incredible visuals, an Iggy Pop cameo, and a constant vibe of silly fun keeping this one alive. It's like a shot of adrenaline in a technicolor juice box, and is not to be missed."

        "review_title": "You wish it could be better than it is",
        "review_detailed_main": "It feels like there's a far better film hidden somewhere under the version of Tank Girl that we got. At its best, Tank Girl is a feminist punk story filled with irrelevant humor, psychedelic animation, and explosions. At its worst, Tank Girl tells a sadly conventional and safe story, with the same old heroes and villains you've seen ten thousand times before. The result is a film that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, a film that left me wishing it could have been so much more.\n\nI went into this film with an open mind. I had never read the Tank Girl comics and had never even heard of the film before watching it (although I did check out some of the comics after watching the film). I immediately liked the setting and tone of the film. Lori Petty is a pretty excellent Tank Girl too. Cool, sarcastic, and always on the verge of breaking the 4th wall. She really carries the film, making something out of a fairly weak story. She is an unapologetic, non-traditional feminist character. And although Petty's Tank Girl may be a watered down-or at least more mainstream-version of the Tank Girl character from the comics, I'd still take her punk-ish grin over Ryan Reynold's masked winking any day.\n\nIt's a real shame they shoved her character into such a boring and conventional plot. There's a bad guy (Malcolm McDowell) trying to do generic bad guy stuff for generic bad guy reasons. He kills Tank Girl's friends, so now she's out not only for revenge but also to save the wasteland and a child who Mr. Bad has kidnapped. That'd all be fine if it was just background noise, but there are lots of loooooong and boring scenes that only exist to support this boring plot. This film needed to be more Mad Max 2 and less Mad Max 3.\n\nNot that Tank Girl is a completely boring ride mind you. There's action. There's singing and dancing. There are new friends, such as Naomi Watts' surprisingly bland Jet Girl (IMO she would have made a far better love interest for Tank Girl than dear Captain Kangaroo). Yes, some of it's lame but some of it is quite fun. The dressing room scene in the Liquid Silver club wonderfully skewer's how women are supposed to present themselves.\n\nOn the action front, by far the best action scene in the film sees Tank Girl hijack a moving semi truck from her tank, casually shooting goons with a bow while cooking hotdogs and surfing along the barrel of the tank, all while tossing out one liners that would make Arnold blush. It's random, it's silly, and it's awesome.\n\nHowever easily the best bits of the film are the few minutes of animation in the middle and at the end. These are amazing! They feel sort of like what would happen if Ren & Stimpy shot a music video set in the Mad Max universe. These psychedelic trips are over far too soon and leave you wishing you were watching whatever movie the animations came from instead of this live action fare.\n\nI was less stoked about how the film sometimes threw in comic book-style stills between scenes. This wasn't done with much consistency and it felt like they sort of forgot about it halfway through the film. The inconstant stylization and tone of the film make some of the more over the top scenes feel very out of place.\n\nAnd while most of the film features more of a punk/rock sound track, there's a really bizarre usage of a rap song (presumably by Ice-T) for about 30 seconds during one action scene. This is a very minor complaint, yet the song nevertheless felt so forced as to be emblematic of the film's core problem. Tank Girl could have been subversive yet fun feminist film that would still hold up well today. Instead it tried to be more of a badass Waterworld, and suffers greatly for it.\n\nSo overall, while the Tank Girl we got is not a bad film and has some memorable scenes, it mostly leaves me wishing I could watch the film it could have been."

I was with my girlfriend who liked watching chick flicks while I suffered. We would take turns picking movies and this time it was her turn. As per the poster this one looked like it would have some eye candy for me so I agreed. What did I get? Women in awful make up and clothes to match. Acting abilities that were none existent in both unknowns and stars. I suppose Malcolm Mcdowell thought he could try to reinact Soren in a desert full with strange crazy women. His acting came off dry and dull like most of his characters. He has been lucky to have some characters that are exceptional in his career and thats about it. James Hong is the only one that brings his character to life as small as it is. Scenes in the movie that might have been interesting are often cut with comic book pages cutting the movie to shreds. The costumes go from bad to worse. Between the awful lines and eye soar of sets and costumes, it is a movie in which to make your worst enemy suffer. We left asking, \"What the heck did we just watch?\" We both suffered through the movie and had to find something to do to save the evening. We went out to a fancy restaurant and had a great dinner. Why after all these years did I think my first impression was worse than it was is beyond me. It wasn't. In fact, maybe I can say it was not bad enough. This movie is the worst of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, i saw a video recommending some obscure movies of the 80's-90's, all was well until i reached this one on the list.\n\nIts weird to say the least. Im not entirely sure how to tackle it. Probably ill talk about the target audience first. I dont know who they were, and probably the director/writers werent sure either. You will see some dumb down scenarios where it does look like it was aimed to kids. But there are very adult oriented themes in there too in those same scenes. So definitely not for kids, and its quite boring for adults. Maybe for people in their late teens early 20's who enjoyed the punk world.\n\nNow, you should understand that the movie is a satire, of what i still dont know. I dont know if its a satire of a serious movie, or a satire of a comedy. In any case, you will see for instance \"goons\" firing at tank girl, being \"serious\" at it, while she is both returning fire and cooking a hot dog at the same time she is laughing with no cover. (its a good scene though, but weird)\n\nTank girl is the main heroine, she is like if 90's Gwen Steffani and Pee-Wee had a child. You will see her being rebel and care free at dire situations, while laughing like Pee wee all the time.\n\nThe plot, while overall is a good setting, good dystopian world in the big picture, the details came out of the mind of a 10 year old.\n\nThe main villain also came out of a cartoon. Oh, and there are kangaroo/ or who knows what are they are kind of humanoid mutants that are quite horny but dont exactly are explained in detail nor actually need to be in the plot.\n\nThere are some good bits, like the animation and the overall world they created, they are not really believable, but the movie was never meant to be a serious one. Good sets, art, music was allright.\n\nI wouldnt say it was bad acting in the movie. I actually would say that it is a very professional movie and the people involved there, except the writing. The actors just did what they could with what they had. Its just that while the pacing was ok, the plot is all over the place, some scenes are unnecessary, dont make sense or both.\n\nThe movie aimed high, and it would have done it with an actual script.\n\nSo in essence, this is a mindless flick, just like in the 80's, it is rebel, its irreverent, its funny (sometimes), but it has bad plot, it makes no sense, it tried to cover so much genres at the same time, it tried to cover all possible audiences, and it failed at everything.\n\nForgetabbe. Wont say to skip it, because there are a couple of decent bits, but you wont miss anything really. And you are not its target audience anyways, so its not the hidden jewel many people talk about. Its just a failed attempt to create a new genre."

Tank Girl miraculously slipped into the 90's pop culture scene and quickly became a cult classic. Unfortunately its silly plot, lack of character development, and disconnected story structure contributed to its poor reception. Talalays' fight to stay true to Tank Girls rich source material was a worthy cause, but United Artists clueless movie execs ultimately hurt the film's potential.\n\nThe soundtrack is a hefty slice of '90s nostalgia and goes a long way in re-experiencing the film, placing Tank Girl into film history as a unique blend of pop culture and an aspiring steampunk adaptation of a well loved comic. Decades later, Tank Girl is lost amongst similar comic book film adaptations that missed the mark like Judge Dredd, Batman & Robin, Barb Wire, and The Super Mario Bros.\n\nBecause of the film's fun costumes, Stan Winston's fabulous creature design, music video style action sequences (live-action, and animation) I wanted to give this film a higher rating than it actually deserves... but I won't."

Naomi Watts plays Jet, a mousy, yet efficient mechanic who joined Rebecca, aka Tank Girl.

Ice-T plays his standard cardboard character that he plays in every movie and you'll either like Lori Petty's girl with attitude role (especially if you are 14 year old male or younger) or you won't. Personally it started to grate on my nerves about half way thru.

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most underrated excellent fun science fiction dystopian comedy's. I like Tank Girl. The movie really surprised me I thought it will suck but it really surprised me. I saw the trailer on VHS tape in 1997 when I was 13 about this movie. When I ask about this movie in a video store they told me they did not have this movie it was not available. Today I watch this movie for the first time and I really like it. Was directed by Rachel Talalay who directed Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare and I don't like that movie that much, but Tank Girl is improvment over Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.\n\nIt stars Lori Petty, Ice-T, Naomi Watts and Malcolm McDowell and they are great excellent fantastic. The movie is based on a comic book and I never read the comic book or hear about it. But damn this movie was great. I love the soundtrack by Bjork - Big Time Sensuality great song, by Punk band Face To Face- Disconnected. Man this movie is awesome.\n\nLori Petty was so beautiful and gorgeous that time. She surfs on a tank gun awesome. This movie is great, it has action, comedy, good scenes. Awesome movie, it is not violent, it is a good movie.\n\nLori Petty and Naomi Watts had chemistry and they become good partners fighting bad guys. Malcolm McDowell was awesome bad guy. The antihero Tank Girl (Petty) as she, Jet Girl (Watts), and genetically modified supersoldiers called the Rippers fight \"Water & Power\", an oppressive corporation led by Kesslee (McDowell). After \"Water & Power\" kidnapped little girl Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower) killed all her family and imprisoned Tank Girl and torture her. With the help from Jet Girl that Tank Girl mets they plan an escape and they do escape. Armed them selfs with a tank. They designed the tank and made it in to their own weapon. To fight \"Water & Power\" they go trough desert of wasteland and they find super soldier the Rippers they made an army and go in to a fight for justice against Kesslee.\n\nDuring their journey they met a lot of comic people and they do a lot of funny stuff. The movie is set in the future 2022 that will be in 3 years. Of course there is no supply of water and the roads becomes the desert. Tank Girl and Jet Girl becomes their only hope. You have Ice-T in this movie as T-Saint a Ripper who is suspicious of the girls. I really did enjoy this movie, it could be called cheesy, flop but It is MILES way better than Street Fighter, better than Barb Wire (1996) played by Pamela Anderson. Finally Rachel Talalay did a movie I like and I enjoy! Tank Girl blow with machine guns bad guys to pieces.\n\nTank Girl is a damn good parody action movie I like it. Naomi Watts is awesome and she rocks!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Very much a product of the 90s that encapsulates an aggressive hip style, this ridiculous comic book adaptation has no discipline, is mostly incoherent and ends with a quick animation instead of an actual ending. All its stupidity aside, there's nothing quite like Tank Girl. It's a mostly terrible film that I inexplicably enjoy and I couldn't in good faith recommend it. Director Rachel Talalay seems to be as disappointed with the film as most viewers are and I could only imagine how nightmarish the shoot was, that full scenes were 'forgotten' to be filmed and in two cases, animation was added to clear that up. Tank Girl does have a go for broke attitude that never relents. Lori Petty plays the role with boundless energy and she's fine, even though a stronger editor would trim her manic behavior into a more shaped performance. It's a bizarre film that really never works, but it's plenty of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "You would think that a movie based on a harum-scarum comic book series, taking advantage of a punk-rock aesthetic would be an interesting premise. The titular hero is played by Lori Petty who up to that point was known for playing Geena Davis's annoying kid sister in A League of Their Own (1992). Here she's a zany post-apocalyptic scavenger, turned western-style avenger. After her commune is massacred by W&P, a pseudo- fascist corporation of ill-repute, she and fellow survivor Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower) are captured, separated and tortured. Tank Girl escapes the clutches of the evil Kesslee (played in full check-collecting mode by Malcolm McDowell) and tries to save the young Sam with the help of Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), Sub Girl (Ann Cusack) and The Rippers who are basically mutant kangaroos led by Ice-T in heavy makeup.\n\nDespite the inherent ridiculousness of the characters, nonsensical story elements and, I kid you not, an extended musical rendition of Cole Porter's \"Let's Do It,\" Tank Girl could have been an interesting counterculture movie. The comic books the film is based on are considered far-left staples of Thatcher Era England, featuring an ultra-violent anti-hero with (gasp) fluid sexuality. While I credit the movie for being infectiously post-feminist, when compared to it's source material, it simply doesn't go far enough.\n\nNow granted the collection and subsequent bastardization of Tank Girl IP was followed by the movie licencing of The Mask (1994) a property similar in aesthetic and humor. Similarly the source material was watered down but what The Mask lost in macabre bite, it more than made up for in cogent storytelling. Let's not forget that the editing in Tank Girl is sloppy and slow, the cinematography reaches the slumping capstone of a sub-par music video and the art design, while lovingly anarchic can't help but feel lo-fi, and not in a good way. It's just a garish, slowly paced, sophomoric and pointless film that could have been something but is plagued with half-measures."

And it's run by Kassel (Malcom MacDowell).\n\nRebecca aka Tank Girl played wonderfully quirky by Lori Petty, is the only one that can stop him, after his men storm her shelter, dredging the water supply, and kidnap her niece. She goes on a one woman army to get her back with a little help form some colorful goofy characters aka The Rippers mutant kangaroo men and Jet Girl (Naomi Watts).\n\nI honestly kind of liked this movie, I know it's not great and I'm not trying pretend that it is. But I feel it's kind of fun even for a so-so action-comedy like this, at best you can look at as an enjoyably bad film.\n\nI give it a 5/10.

Well, a quick witted heroine and her awesome sidekick. This movie is a fun romp, great music and the acting is right on. Lori Petty was the perfect pick for the part of Tank Girl, her sense of timing is great and the one liners keep coming. Rising against oppression has never been so fun.\n\nHowever there is a dark undercurrent as well, a child is stolen and Tank Girl is off to rescue. Lori Petty is perfect in her role. And her side-kick Jet (I've forgotten her \"real\" name) is wonderful too. I really identified with Jet and find that Tank Girl and Jet's examples of independent, pro-active thought and action are inspiring. The movie is incredibly fast-paced, the visuals are very there, and the story is entertaining at all points. Lori Petty embodies Tank Girl, Naomi Watts shines in a pre-fame role, Malcom McDowell is (as always) the perfect villain, and even Ice-T, in one of his first acting gigs, does pretty well behind Stan Winston's (incredible) make-up. While the plot isn't entirely original either, it doesn't really matter. The props and outfits, plus entertaining dialogue makes up for it entirely. I also loved how it sticks to its comic-roots and uses comic panels to add extra flair.\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Tank Girl\" combines the smarts and dumbs as a result falls flat as an adaptation as it tries to bring the same spirit as the comic book. As a result of the film's post-apocalyptic setting with a menacing Malcolm McDowell as the boss, we are introduced to Lori Petty's Tank Girl. As a result of Petty's Tank Girl's character traits, the audience is left unimpressed and annoyed rather than entertained.\n\nThe film has a very thin story and is composed of many ridiculous songs that make people cringe as well as poorly made animations that appear cheap and unoriginal. Despite the fresh designs within the film, the vision behind them gets lost making the entire piece messy and unorganized.\n\nPetty's role as Tank Girl lacks substance and feels superficial and like a stereotype instead of a character. Most of the film works against Petra's portrayal of Tank Girl besides Naomi Watts who acts as Jet Girl in her early role. Even the reliable McDowell's on-screen antagonist fails to impress in his performance.\n\nAlthough it has a cult following owing to its girl power beliefs and odd sensibilities, this one is suited only for the most ardent fans of the comic."

The look of the Rippers (kangaroo like human creatures) were bizarre looking but adaptable.\n\nFeatures an ending which somewhat ends abruptly but makes sense.

It relishes in its shortcomings, capturing the true sense of counterculture within every frame."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching the 1995 movie \"Tank Girl\" back in the day when it was just released, but I have to admit that I only remember the movie by its title. I didn't recall the storyline, so I sat down in 2022 to watch the movie once again.\n\nNow, I never read the comic book, despite of being an avid comic book enthusiast back in the 1990s. So how true director Rachel Talalay was to the original comic strips, I have no idea.\n\nWell, it should be noted that watching \"Tank Girl\" and getting into the whole concept and the world in which it takes place definitely requires a special mindset. \"Tank Girl\" is unique, so very, very unique, and far out there actually. And as such, then I don't think that this 1995 movie is a movie that will easily please everyone in the audience.\n\nI was adequately entertained, however this is not a movie that I have taken a particularly liking to. Nor is it a movie that I think I will ever revisit. It simply was a bit too spaced out for my liking. But hey, it was based on a comic book after all, so perhaps it is a spot on portrayal of the Tank Girl character and the world in which it takes place.\n\n\"Tank Girl\" has a pretty interesting cast ensemble, with the likes of Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts, Don Harvey, Jeff Kober, James Hong and Lori Petty in the leading role as Tank Girl herself. And I will say that Lori Petty definitely spruced up the movie with her performance.\n\nI suppose that this movie is a niche movie for fans of the comic strip, because it is not a mainstream movie.\n\nMy rating of \"Tank Girl\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

For being in the \"femme fatale\" category (the most controversial subject I've complained about before), it reeks. Call it a comedy and your life will be so much better. It's really your satire of post-Apocalypse movies, and another one from the \"alternative\" generation that shows off strong feminist superiority. Lori Petty, resembling the face of singer Gwen Stefani this time around, offers quite a lot of comical charms as a \"tank girl warrior\". The cartoon breaks compliment the story in a touchy way. Everything else leaves much to be desired, though. Only if you like unclassifiables."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, let me be clear that not everyone will like this movie. I know a number of people who just do not like fantasy or silliness in movies. If you are one of those serious people, this movie is not for you. But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness.\n\nI also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not \"Gone with the Wind\", but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well.\n\nAs for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy. I also find it has an odd attraction. Again, this movie is not for everyone. But for some of us, was entertaining for 90 minutes or so."

        "review_detailed_main": "I understand Tank Girl bombed at the box office back in 1995. Well, I'm happy to report that I was one of the few who saw it in the theaters. I'm also happy to report that I'm one of the fewer who seems to have actually enjoyed Tank Girl. While I may not hold it in as high esteem as I once did, I had a good time last night re-watching it. Tank Girl features a typical post-apocalyptic set-up: A a comet has hit the Earth, creating an 11 year drought. Most of the remaining water is controlled by the Water & Power Corp and its maniacal leader, Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). Rebecca Buck (Lori Petty) is a member of a small commune living in the Australian outback who have illegally tapped into the water supply. Kesslee sends in the troops to destroy the commune, making an enemy of Rebecca. In short order, she steals a tank, befriends a Water & Power aircraft mechanic and pilot, and joins a band of mutant human/kangaroo hybrids. Together, they join forces to take on Kesslee and his Water & Power army.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about Tank Girl is also one of its biggest weaknesses. To say that Tank Girl is over-the-top would be a gross understatement. Costuming, music, action, set-design, acting, creature effects, dialogue, visuals - it's all larger than life and generally a lot of fun. It would be easy to give Tank Girl a 10/10 for trying to be a surreal experience. And while I get a kick out of most of it, there are times where I feel Tank Girl is trying too hard. It's pretty apparent that director Rachel Talalay was going for kitschy and off-beat. But there are definite instances where it all feels forced. Instead of letting things happen naturally as part of the story, some of what Talalay throws at the viewer lacks an organic feel. The best cult movies don't try to be cult movies - they just are. And Tank Girl's frantic pace doesn't allow for much in the way of character development or plot - things Tank Girl sorely lacks.\n\nYou can't really talk about Tank Girl and not mention Lori Petty. She's the heart and soul of everything. Given what Tank Girl is - faults and all - she's perfect. Her energy is as amazing and consistent as her ever-changing hair. It's infectious and impossible for me not to enjoy. I also get a kick out of the contrast of Naomi Watts' super subdued Jet Girl. They make a good pair.\n\nOne last thing, I really like the special effects in Tank Girl. Whether it's Stan Winston's amazing Kangaroo-men, the comic book cut scenes, or the many, many explosions, it's a real visual treat.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Among them 'Tank Girl' (1995), in this film, the punk, post-apocalyptic heroine and her antagonist, a malevolent corporation, do nothing to save the day. The First time when I saw this Movie 'Tank Girl', there were some problems. First, the film is shambolic and jolting in its pacing. Because of the disjointed narrative from scene to scene, it's impossible to care about what's happening.\n\nTank Girl (Lori Petty), who plays the title role, is generally energetic, but often her over-the-top style feels forced. Instead of quirky and rebellious, she's more just irritatingly erratic. Much of the character's humor would have worked better in the comic than it does on-screen, and it frequently tries too hard to be edgy or funny.\n\nPitifully underdeveloped sidekicks and supporting characters. Malcolm McDowell's villain, (Kesslee), is an unintentionally sinister creation, but he's more of a stereotype than a villain to be reckoned with. Naomi Watts (Jet Girl) has equal potential. Still, while stunning on the big screen, she appears to have only been added as an ego-driven cameo rather than bringing anything tangible to the storyline. The hybrid kangaroo-humans are visually intriguing, but the strange beings are odd for the sake of strangeness rather than adding meaningful context to the story.\n\nOn a visual level, the film is, at times, stunning, especially when it comes to its colors and punkish design, which is often intertwined with the psychedelic, reflecting the comic's trippy sensibility. But the special effects bullet-time notwithstanding, and production design are usually cheap looking, and this is never more evident than during its cartoon sequences, which are derivative of the comic yet feel like a cop-out of scenes that might otherwise have been better shot for real.\n\nIn the end, I will rate Tank Girl a 4/10. Despite its cult status, it seems like a squandered opportunity. Its garish visuals and uneven pacing overwhelm its rebellious, feminist possibilities."

What now ensues is a really derivative, repetitive and frankly rather dull semi-animated action adventure that rehashes just about every theme in the book and over-relies on the characterisations that are seriously under-delivered by a cast that are simply not up to the task. McDowell just hams it up the whole time and the dialogue is beyond banal. Rachel Talalay could have done so much more with the sort of \"Mad Max\" elements of the story, but instead allows this to just drift into a puerile, attitudinal, drama that offers little to engage and a suite of visual effects that we have seen loads of times before. There's a brief appearance from Iggy Pop and the \"rippers\" bring a certain, welcome, randomness to this otherwise really rather uninspiring flop. Sorry, but I wouldn't bother if I were you."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1995 Tank Girl was still quite a popular but cult/niche comic book. But inevitably Hollywood was going to have a go at turning it into a movie. The result is at best uneven.\n\nSet in a post-Apocalyptic 2033 where a comet crashing into the earth some years before had turned the land into desert. The remaining water being under the control of baddie Keslee's corporation Water and Power, Rebecca (Tank Girl) is a rebellious girl who fights this corporation and it's group of dumb footsoldiers to try and remove the hold they have over the water, and keep her friends safe/alive. That's pretty much the whole plot.\n\nThe good bits about the movie - Lori Petty looks great as the heroine. She has the look, the hair, the costumes and the cheeky feistiness needed to play the character.\n\nNaomi Watts as Jet Girl is another highlight, playing it subtly and in the beginning quite shyly.\n\nIf you like hammy, over the top performances then Malcolm McDowell as Keslee you will enjoy. I do quite like him in this. He plays it with plenty of ham and camp.\n\nVisually the film looks as good as a comic book adaptation can look given it's been transplanted to real actors and sets rather than being drawn or painted. Though we will see some animated parts throughout.\n\nThe bad bits - the plot. It's just so thin, there isn't enough here to sustain a 90 minute movie, so it gets dragged out and becomes repetitive and old quite quickly.\n\nThe script - whist Rebecca's one liners seem funny at the beginning there are far too many and it becomes a drag as the action almost stops whilst she says something really dumb.\n\nIt's boring. Because of the thin plot being stretched out it just feels limp and a bit dull, which to me should be difficult given the brightness of the original comic strips. Apparently studio and other interference ended up removing some scenes from the final cut, which actually explains why there is an uneven pacing throughout. Things either feel rushed or very slow.\n\nThe animations.. Small segments of the film are done in animation rather than live action. They look good because they hark back to the comicbook source, but they don't work and often feel like they're thrown in to save those that hold the purse strings money. In fact the entire end scene had apparently been made, but was replaced by an animated sequence.. Unsure as to why - money? Not enough to make it look as good as it could? Or just bad so needed to be replaced?\n\nIn conclusion, this isn't as exciting or fun as it could have been. I won't criticise the performances of the main cast as they worked with what they were given and they do mostly look and feel the part, but the overall result of a dull and thin plot, potentially not enough money, and some uneven editing, it's just uneven and not very compelling. A film you can watch, but will lose your attention from in parts of it, and will mostly forget about afterwards.\n\nWould a remake work? Bigger budget, stronger storyline? Not sure. How popular is Tank Girl in 2024?"

The wacky zany main character is unbearable, her character is too over the top on how wacky she is. The interactions between her and the other characters is too forced. She makes no character development. The film makes no effort to make her struggle or overcome adversity, she simply gets lucky and is held captive my incompetent supervillains that for some reason keep her alive but kills everyone else that crosses him? Even know that she isn't tamed by him yet and he essentially gives her an opening to escape with no way to track her? No way to do anything about it no safety measures. The simple measure that they do gets easily circumvented. The plot is a straight rip from Mad Max, there was no creative spin at all other than the comedic aspect of the movie which at most points just feel forced. It ends up being like when someone makes a joke in front a group of people and they just nervously laugh because they feel bad if they stay quite about it. The only unique thing about this film would be the animal hybrids that have their own backstory but other than that i found their characters a failed attempt at their version of Chewbacca from Star Wars."

The film is based on a popular comic book series with comic book illustrations incorporated well into the action; the sets and costumes are also delightfully imaginative and same goes for a water bottle weapon that sucks all liquid out of a person. The dialogue is surprisingly witty too with our heroine frequently giving lip in the face of adversity. Energetic as Lori Petty is in the lead role though and memorable though her lines may be, she nevertheless comes off as rather obnoxious overall. She does not have much respect for anyone, regardless of whether they are her adversities or not, and she comes off especially abrasive by contrast to her sidekick, played in an unusually dowdy manner by a young Naomi Watts. As a narrative, the film only really ever half-succeeds too. It all starts off rather promising with the water shortage concept and the offbeat notion that a hardly muscular girl could be humanity's greatest hope, but everything turns into chaotic action towards the end and interesting as the mutant kangaroo characters are, they come off as deserving of a film of their own rather than being written off as merely genetic engineering gone awry. It is easy to see why such a haphazard film as this drew negative reviews upon initial release. No, it is not nearly that bad, but whether the film's scattered virtues amount to a positive experience is likely to vary per viewer."

If you want to watch something fun and full of attitude, something campy and endearing, this is for you. Though there are many sociological parallels to times of unrest and change, and a lot of interesting social and political undertones (like feminism, corporate greed, etc), if you're looking for something serious or something without plot holes, inconsistencies, and makes sense, give this a pass. This movie doesn't care to maintain the 4th wall and it doesn't care to follow logic, science, or even to make sense in all its details, but it is full of humor, great campy acting, and an \"I don't give a damn\" attitude that tugs at my rebellious heart strings. If I could give it 6 stars, I would.\n\nAnd for the Tank Girl Comic Book Purists out there. This movie isn't the comic book on screen. Like any good comic movie, it uses the comic book for inspiration and finds it's own way. If it took itself seriously enough to hold hard to comic book canon, the movie would have been absolutely horrible. This is Tank Girl for Christ's sake!

I felt it embodies her personality as a wild-natured, independent woman while also showcasing her feminine passion for fashion. Her various outfits definitely kept me entertained throughout the movie. It's cool to see movies that don't depict strong women by simply making them look stoic and masculine. I also thought that the design of the Rippers was better than a lot of the humanoid creature designs in more recent movies. I love how the Rippers have a distinct facial design that is easily recognizable as individual characters rather than just a copy-paste of the same creature's faces. It was interesting how expressive they were despite their seemingly emotionless beastly designs. I feel that it's a shame that we only get to see their faces later in the movie.\n\nWhile I do agree with many of the reviews on how bad the story is, I think that it is not the way to enjoy this movie. I felt that the movie is more driven by the main heroine's nature rather than the goal of saving the world from an evil corporation. One clear example of this is the scene at the Liquid Silver Club where Tank Girl spontaneously starts a musical sequence that has nothing to do with their objective of rescuing a girl. I simply understood that this movie is pretty much just about Tank Girl being Tank Girl."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, the first time I watched Tank Girl in class, it was quite unexpected. I knew from the outset that this was no ordinary action movie: set in some post-apocalyptic world, it is centered around Tank Girl-also known as Lori Petty-an extremely tough and defiant woman who drives a huge tank. The plot concerns her crusade against a corporate evil force controlling the last remaining source of water, but not for long, as in a moment it slips into a chaotic cocktail of strange characters, high-voltage action, and bizarre humor. The movie doesn't take itself seriously at all; I just found it confusing and kind of refreshing. I felt that was more about style and attitude than about having any decent plot or character development. Visuals are bright, colorful, at times cartoonish with live-action combined with animation; it's this feeling that's kind of unique in a surrealist way. At times, the fun action just feels utterly random, unrelated to anything else going on in the movie, or just the outrageous, punk-rock feel of the entire movie was the main purpose of the film. Wild, unpredictable, and all-around crazy, Tank Girl does not really make much sense with most of her acts, which is exactly the boldness that sets her character apart. Overall, Tank Girl is that sort of weird movie-messy, unpolished-yet has a lot of energy and weird charm to it. It is not the kind of movie one watches for an in-depth plot, but it is a movie worth seeing if one is searching for something odd yet fun."

But for some reason both I and everyone I show it too falls in love with her in-your face attitude and power.\n\nTank Girl is one of those movies you have to watch with an open mind, because the characters, plots and well almost everything else is very unbelievable and if you criticize it too much you'll hate every second of it.\n\nIt's an upbeat movie, that at the end with make you want to be just like her :) (I'm starting to read the comics and they're good too!)

        "review_detailed_main": "Tank Girl is a movie I find compelling for its commitment to tone, costume, and set design more than for its actual storytelling. Adapted from a comic series known for its chaotic energy, the film takes viewers on a wild ride through a post-apocalyptic world, with Lori Petty giving an unapologetically bold performance as Tank Girl herself. Her attitude and style are undeniably cool, and she brings a kind of rebellious charm to the role that is hard to forget.\n\nWhat stands out most to me, though, is the film's aesthetic. The costume design, especially for the mutant kangaroo characters, is a strange triumph. Ice-T as a \"horny kangaroo man\" is certainly an unusual casting choice, but he fully commits to the role, adding to the film's eccentric charm. Malcolm McDowell also makes an appearance, and as a fan, I always enjoy his willingness to dive into bizarre roles with such dedication.\n\nDespite these strengths, Tank Girl often stumbles when it attempts to mimic the energy of the comics. The use of actual comic strips as inserts exposes just how far the film falls short in replicating the source material's anarchic spirit. The humor, too, feels hit-or-miss, leaning toward a meta style that prefigures Deadpool-a tone I find more grating than funny.\n\nIn the end, Tank Girl is an interesting film with a distinct visual flair and a commitment to being unapologetically strange. However, it's also limited by its budget, which constrains its ability to fully capture the comic's zany, unhinged essence. While flawed, it's a unique artifact that reflects the challenges of bringing such an out-there comic to life on screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was told that this is a comic movie before people thought they were cool. Except this was a more down to earth kind of comic, takes place in a dystopian future where a comet dried somehow halted Earth's water cycle. No powers, though there are the Rangers' abilities because of being abandoned genetic super soldiers and their body suits. But it does include a super corrupt corporation that may not be out of place for Lex Luther. Though I have a hard time believing that he and his company would focus on creating mutant creatures and trying to take all the water for themselves when it would be more beneficial for everyone for them to solve the water crisis. Perhaps it's meant as some commentary on the rich and powerful often think of themselves rather than helping for the better good, even when it would affect them in the long term as well.\n\nSome style and aesthetic choices I have a hard time picking, even with considering the futuristic, fallen setting of the movie. One would be the \"water power,\" the name itself I have a hard time taking seriously,\" wearing those metal square things with green scanners over their eyes. Others include the main character Rebecca's hairstyle and what the Liquid Silver's clothes looked like among the robed men. There's one thing that I can get behind, and it's the special effects, from the Rangers' animal bodies, even the way their ears move up and down, how people's bodies get drained when the corporate leader sucks water out of them with his device, and the holographic head. I'm starting to notice a pattern in cult films that have quite good special effects that are enjoyable to watch despite having limited budgets.\n\nWeird lines like the executive saying that most of the water in the desert now belongs to water.. The other is Rebecca using oil and vacuums as innuendos out of all things when trying to provoke one of the water power guards while being transported. Another is the corporate leader thinking about the creation of the world happening by the eight deaths just from being told Rebecca killed eight of her men. Maybe it is just people losing grip of their sanity from being in the apocalypse. Despite all this, I really loved Rebecca's actress' acting. She convinced me that seeing her loved ones getting killed and facing flashbacks of their deaths and attacks devastated her. In fact, another thing that I heard about the film is that the lead is the highlight of the movie, one of the main reasons why it has a cult following. I can see why for that reason, even if the supersaturation of the flashbacks she faced and the lines she gets ruins it a few times. Plus, it's clear that she cares for Sam, the young girl that gets kidnapped and taken, and that makes her good to root for.\n\nOverall, a movie that isn't great and can weird you out a few times, but that's why it ended up being so enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tank Girl, directed by Rachel Talalay, was released in 1995. It's a wild, emergency ride that breaks all the rules of \"conventional\" film making. It's based on the British comic book series of the same title by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin. The film is set in a post apocalyptic world, where water is the most important and precious commodity. The story follows Rebecca Buck, also known as Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, who becomes a rebellious, irreverent hero fighting against the evil corporation Water & Power. The film's most distinctive feature is it's unapologetic and quirky punk, rock, aesthetic. From the vibrant costumes, to the chaotic and fast paced editing, TankGirl is a visual treat that captures the spirit of photography. The soundtrack was something to write home about. It complements the themes of rebellion very well within the film. I recommend this film to people. While it may not be a film for everyone, its unique style and daring approach make it a cult classic. It's a movie that celebrates individuality and rebellion, and it does so with a sense of humor and a lot of heart. If you're a fan of unconventional, offbeat films with strong female leads, Tank Girl is a must watch. It's a movie that doesn't conform to the usual norms and instead, creates its own wild, vibrant world. In conclusion, Tank Girl is an adventurous film that stands out for its boldness and creativity. It may be chaotic and over-the-top, but that's precisely what gives it its charm. It's a film that invites you to join in the fun, embrace the chaos, and enjoy the ride. If you're looking for something different, something that breaks the mold."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tank Girl (1995), directed by Rachel Talalay, is a wild, punk-rock sci-fi movie based on the British comic of the same name. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where water is controlled by a greedy corporation, the story follows Rebecca, nicknamed \"Tank Girl,\" a rebellious and eccentric hero who teams up with Jet Girl and a group of mutant kangaroos called the Rippers to fight back and reclaim the water supply.\n\nThe movie is chaotic and over-the-top, much like its main character. Lori Petty brings Tank Girl to life with boundless energy and a devil-may-care attitude, making her a standout as the film's quirky, fearless lead. Naomi Watts, as Jet Girl, gives a quieter but equally enjoyable performance, balancing out Tank Girl's wild personality. Malcolm McDowell plays the villain with his signature sinister flair, but his character feels underdeveloped compared to the leads.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Tank Girl is its style. It mixes live-action, animated comic panels, and punk-rock music to create a rebellious, in-your-face aesthetic. The soundtrack, curated by Courtney Love, features bands like Hole and Bj\u00f6rk, perfectly matching the film's edgy vibe. However, the movie's plot is messy and feels rushed at times, making it hard to follow. The humor and tone are hit-or-miss, and not everyone will appreciate its weirdness.\n\nDespite its flaws, Tank Girl is a fun, unapologetically strange movie with a lot of heart. It's not perfect, but it captures the spirit of the comic and stands out as a unique piece of '90s pop culture. For fans of quirky action films or offbeat heroines, it's worth checking out for its sheer originality and rebellious charm."

The sexual stuff was unnecessary in my opinion, but not deal breaking when watching the movie. When the animated clips showed I was pretty confused, but then after watching Tank Girl I read that it is based on a comic series, but even before seeing it is based on a comic, I liked the animations. It's different, as I do not think I have ever seen another movie do that type of editing style, and it made the movie even more interesting. Overall I liked the unique aesthetic of the movie, the clothes, the look of every character, and the weird personalities. Although there is not that much to the plot where she is basically fighting for herself and her friends, the actors succeeded in keeping me entertained."

Along the line of a picture paints a thousand words and saves about a half hour of filming and \u00a3500,000. As a movie though it worked, but only if you were able to survive the mental anguish of following the action and then interpreting the meaning of the graphic that popped up for 5 seconds, and back to action but one week later after whatever the graphic meant. I could do it, but for most of the audience that day the movie was too much work to follow.

I loved the wild and yet not overly complex plot to this movie, and it's so easy to get swept up in the jokes and animations and comic shots. Tank Girl herself is wild and keeps you guessing her next move (something raunchy and crude, but what *specifically*?). Jet Girl is also fun if a bit whiny (I can relate), and the Rippers are a hilarious touch.\n\n8/10 for this one, because the two-hour length flew by, and I know I'd be down to watch it again. Somehow didn't catch that this was set in Australia, but with kangaroos as the only major tip off, I'm not feeling too dumb! Would definitely recommend."

It deserved a little more success (partly thanks to Lory Petti and Naomi Watts)... and the soundtrack is so cool! Finally, (anti-)heroine Lory Petti was a really unusual and interesting character, and she played it really good I think"

It's goofy/lovable, quick-witted/smart, and it's some sort of honest exploration of women as ruthless survivors (though it sounds like the comic books did a better job than the movie). Comic book adaptations today seem to be all about the special effects and having enormous balls. The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role.\n\nAnd the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash. The Portishead and Bjork scenes especially. Yes. I should emphasize how campy this movie is in case anyone is expecting anything else."

Lori Petty is fantastic in the title role, and her one-liners still get a giggle from me on the dozenth or so viewing. Malcolm MacDowell is exceedingly memorable as the main bad guy, and you can't help cheering for him a little bit, too. If you're looking for intellectual depth, look elsewhere. If you just want to unwind and have a few laughs with some smart, sexy heroines, I cannot recommend this movie highly enough."

No one wants to see some pretty damsel swept up in the arms of some perfect, gorgeous guy. Life's not like that. Life is sweat, tears, and work. Oh yah, and reality also includes the girl PICKING the guy... We don't want some guy, full of his own self importance, picking us up and taking us to Laa-Laa land. We're people too!\n\nThis is an awesome movie, for many reasons, most of which give away the plot. So I won't spoil it for anyone... But I will tell you, I've got 7 scenes memorized straight from the movie.\n\nThat's how good it is. Oh yah, and it's not just for girls. I know a bunch of guys who think it kicks...

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Tank Girl for the first time when it was somewhat new, and enjoyed it very much, I have now seen it many times, and it is just as great. If you are looking for a movie with big name A-list stars, and huge F/X budgets, this is not that movie, but it's a safe bet you would enjoy it anyway! This movie is just good old fashioned outlandish, campy fun. Based on the British comic strip of the same name, it follows our heroine, Tank Girl, and her band of ragtag friends as they battle the evil Water & Power in a post-apocalyptic world with no rain. It has a great soundtrack that fits the film very well, lots of action, and a great sci-fi/fantasy plot with a little comedy thrown in, not to mention Lori Petty as Tank Girl makes the movie what it is, very enjoyable. Alongside her is Naomi Watts who plays Jet Girl in excellent fashion, as well as Ice-T and Malcolm McDowell as the sinister villain. The movie feels a lot like a low budget indie film that was picked up by a major studio, and there is reportedly some lost footage out there, but all in all, if you like movies like The Running Man or The Wraith or any other unconventional action/sci-fi movie, at very least, you will surely enjoy Tank Girl!"

Tank Girl (Rebecca) definitely fits the bill, a witty, take-no-crap chick who leads the way with an almost nonchalant air. And I love Tank Girl's hair and outfits. She doesn't care what other people think about her.\n\nThe writing is excellent, I think it's a great adaptation from the comics (one of the few comics I have ever read). The witty word play is fun, the story is amusing and interesting (well done as a post-apocolypse movie, if not scientifically correct) and the characters are great, especially how Tank Girl holds everything together, and Jet Girl develops through the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin I personally am a fan of both Sci-Fi and of Action movies. I harkened back to the days of \"Mad Max\" and \"Solarbabies\", \"Tank Girl's\" Genra Rivals.\n\nSo I may exibit a bias in favor of movies of this particular Genre. I thought \"Tank Girl\" was a fantastic attempt to bring the spirit of an Irreverent Comic Book Charicter to the Big Screen. I understand that in order to make a movie such as Tank Girl marketable a Studio in this case \"United Artists\" must attempt to appeal to as many people as possable. Therefor some but clearly not all of the spirit of the origional Comic Book Charicter is lost.\n\nI have heard several reports about this film and let's just say that not all of them were favorable. However many people do not read comic books and therefore don't have the background to truly judge the attempt. If they had perhaps other comic to movie projects would have been reviewed more favorabley I.E. \"Judge Dredd\", \"The Mask\", \"Barb Wire\".\n\nI must state that I don't think a movie could have been cast with more accuracy. Lori Petty is the perfect Rebecca a.k.a. \"Tank Girl\". As her charicter \"Tank Girl\" She exuded irreverence, sarcasm, and spunk. Naomi Watts renderd a perfect \"Jet Girl\" A woman struggling to become herself. Ice-T was the perfect Ney-sayer, and Malcolm McDowell was evil incarnate.\n\nPersonally I realy liked the movie. I attended the original screening at a local theater and I am an owner of the Home Video version of the film.\n\nI was terribly sad to hear that there was a lot of original footage cut from the final product. Perhaps this footage would have brought the full character development that many of the films critics thought was missing.\n\nI was Outraged that the Studio will not allow a Directors Cut. I sincerely hope they will someday. Perhaps a DVD special edition with all the missing footage... A videofile like me can only dream."

It's about babes, dancing, defiance and motorized vehicles - The basic elements of Rock and Roll.

This movie has everything:it shows scenes from the comic book,real action,and the best part is Tank Girl blowing up stuff and kicking other guys butts! THAT'S COOL!!! Unfortunately, \"Tank Girl\" wasn't a box-office hit but it was REALLY FUN TO WATCH if girls like me want to see how real girls in sci-fi flicks like this one go to war, get revenge and rock and roll. Lori Petty was so wonderful as the funky title role and Malcolm McDowell (from A Clockwork Orange and Time After Time and such cool flicks) as the supervillain who steals a whole bunch of the world's water supply is a highlight! The best part of the movie is when Tank Girl and Jet Girl does a musical number of the song \"Let's Do It\" I wish there was a sci-fi musical in the near future, WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? This movie should be recommended to everybody who likes comic books made into movie adaptations...........AND GIRLS WHO LIKE TO SEE GIRL POWER!!!!"

No, but then movies rarely do in the eyes of a fan. Was it an enjoyable experience? YES."

This is one of those movies where they threw everything on the wall to see what stuck. Imagine \"Natural Born Killers\" meets \"Mad Max\" meets \"Tomb Raider\" and throw some puppets in there and ya got this little gem. Lori Petty was born to play Tank Girl. Now, the plot may be crap, but the fact that they even tried to give it a plot is amazing, considering the sporadic epitome that is the comic. The Rippers are awesome, especially Ice-T. Malcom McDowell was always meant to play deliciously evil guys, even his villain here is a baby compared to Alex. The FX are fun to look at, the soundtrack is aggravatingly cool, and Tank Girl is everything you want from a heroin - tough and funny without being a huge slut (I'm talking to you, Megan Fox.) Leave your disbelief and your seriousness at the door and come enjoy the punk rock party that is TANK GIRL!"

Yes, the film is campy, yes the interspersed comicbook shots are a little different.\n\nI love Ice T as the grumpy ripper. I like it that Tank Girl helps teach Jet Girl how to stand up for herself. I love it that while at Liquid Silver, Tank Girl shows, through her playful rejection of the vapid hologram \"perfect woman\" image that those standards of beauty are pure junk.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite movies; sci fi that explores possibilities beyond \"using the force\" and \"boldly go-ing\" to get chicks."

The humor is a combination of high brow with a vary large sprinkling of idiocy, even managing to throw in a floor show half way through the film. It captures the feel of the British Comic quite well, while still working as a 94 minute movie. The Ripper make up is quite good, and with the exception of a couple wires that can be seen (the budget wasn't that high...) the FX are actually quite good. The flash of comic pages at key points also works quite well. McDowell is an excellent villain, and both Lori Petty and Naomi Watts do great jobs as the heroes. All in all, a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "TANK GIRL (4 outta 5 stars)\n\nA great role for actress Lori Petty (even though she was practically never heard from again after this film came out). The movie may have a few problems but none of them stem from her fantastic, funny performance. She plays a punk rebel chick in the future who runs afoul of the rich, white people (led by Malcolm McDowell) who own all the water (and hence, the power). After her desert-dwelling comrades are slain and/or kidnapped to become slaves, Rebecca aka Tank Girl comes to the rescue. She teams up with Jet Girl (a dark-haired Naomi Watts) and some terrorist kangaroos (Ice-T among them) to put end to the oppressive power-mongers. Lots of great ideas in this movie and lots of great one-liners. The action scenes work for the most part but sometimes they just don't have the panache that they need for an action picture. I also could have done without the comic strip inserts and animation scenes that pop up every now and then. The look of the movie is cartoony enough without having to \"remind\" the audience that it was based on a comic book. And then there is the Cole Porter dance sequence which (though I admire the idea behind the scene) is filmed with such a lack of visual flair that it just stops the movie dead. I mean, if you are going to put a gratuitous musical number into a movie that isn't a musical... it better kick butt! (Takeshi Kitano's recent Zatoichi, for instance.) But, really, the flaws in this movie matter less to me every time I see it. Fans of really strange, weird, science fiction comedies should get a big kick out of this movie!"

I couldn't believe this movie comes from the Australian Comic Book series \"Tank Girl\". WOW!!! I just love the future as real Cyberpunks, Cybergoths and Steam punks exist! They are usually seen in the Goth clubs and love industrial, EBM, IDM, experimental, drum 'n bass (although you don't get that in goth clubs though, same as IDM. Although, we wouldn't want to live in such a serious dystopia as this is the symbolism but it's great fun to get dressed and go listen and dance to some EBM!!! Really, they are like anime characters which have sprung out of a anime comic book! It makes life so colourful and interesting!"

The comic book is Tank GIRL get over it."

If you're expecting \"On Golden Pond\", you'll be disappointed. \"Tank Girl\" is meant to be over the top, in your face, garish, campy and fun, and succeeds admirably. Criticizing the movie for it's lack of character development is like dinging \"Forrest Gump\" for not having enough car chases. Unhook the analytical portions of your brain, get some popcorn and beer, enjoy the movie for what it is. Lori Petty makes a great cartoon character, Naomi Watts is a quiet geeky babe, Malcolm McDowell plays his standard evil crazy character. Haven't read the comics myself, I'm guessing they're a little darker than the movie (and I was really unhappy that \"Spawn\" got the Disney touch). There's a fair amount of violence, but no blood anywhere (even when someone gets sprayed with bullets at point blank range, or body parts litter the ground), and the sex is merely hinted at."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I told my dad I had to watch this film for a course on cult media he was dumbfounded. \"What do you mean Tank Girl is cult, do you know how many things you know of today that are influenced by that film?\" I didn't believe him.\n\nOne of my favorite bands is the Gorillaz and as soon as the first panel from the comic books flashed across the screen I knew exactly what he was talking about. This film is iconic.\n\nThe plotline was generic. The post apocalyptic setting was played out. The scenes jumped around sporadically from one seemingly random shot to the next. The movie was all over the place.\n\nYet, despite all these glaring flaws from an obviously low budget film from a bygone era, there were two things that stood out to me. The diamond's in the metaphorical rough that was this film, the characters and the art.\n\nI love Manic Pixie Dream Girls and while the titular character doesn't necessarily fit the bill one to one she surely is one. She's wild and crazy and all the aspects of punk rock personified. Without her antics I feel the movie would be a snooze fest, with nothing but campy action scenes to try and wake me up. She was genuinely the highlight of the film and Lori Petty made this movie what it is.\n\nNow, as I said earlier I love the Gorillaz. I have all their albums and have been to their shows when they come to my area. I was thrilled to discover that the original Tank Girl comic book is what inspired Jamie Hewlett when designing the characters. All it takes is one glance from any of the comic book panels shown on screen to see this influence. Phenomenal find for me and I will be going and reading the original stories to learn more.\n\nOverall I dont think this movie was that great as a film, My love for this movie falls entirely into the influences on pop culture that it insipred."

And it hardly ever happens in movie world that weird chicks with non giant boobs get to fight and win. Generally girl combat is a from a male vantage point which would include a Wonder Woman physique. Naturally, the losers here are men and the good guys are actually not even men but kangaroos. Anyways, I've not know too many men to enjoy this movie. Wondering if most of the bad reviews are from men. I noticed a lot of women enjoy this movie.\n\nShould be more movies like this. Its like Ice-T says in his song featured in the movie, \" she's a venomous feminist\".\n\nBut in the most delightful way."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Tank Girl\" is a wild, unapologetically chaotic ride that takes viewers on a journey through a post-apocalyptic world filled with quirky characters and outrageous action. Directed by Rachel Talalay and based on the cult comic series, this film is a celebration of punk rock energy, offbeat humor, and fearless individuality. Lori Petty shines as the titular Tank Girl, bringing a magnetic energy to the role that's impossible to ignore. Her performance is bold, eccentric, and endlessly entertaining, perfectly capturing the rebellious spirit of the character. Naomi Watts provides a compelling contrast as Jet Girl, a quieter but equally resourceful partner in crime. Together, their chemistry adds a layer of charm to the film's chaotic narrative. The visual style of \"Tank Girl\" is as wild as its heroine. The mix of live-action, comic-style animation, and vibrant costume design creates a unique aesthetic that feels straight out of the pages of the original comic. The film's soundtrack, featuring punk and alternative rock hits, adds to the high-energy atmosphere and keeps the pace fast and fun. While the plot can feel a bit scattered at times, the movie makes up for it with its unrelenting creativity and sheer enthusiasm. It's clear that \"Tank Girl\" isn't trying to be a conventional blockbuster-it's a celebration of individuality and a playful middle finger to the norm.\n\n\"Tank Girl\" isn't for everyone, but for fans of cult films, comics, and punk rock attitude, it's a must-see. It's a chaotic, colorful explosion of fun that refuses to take itself too seriously, making it a perfect choice for anyone looking for something truly unique and unapologetically weird."

Movie adaptations of comic books can be pretty bad (like Spawn, for example) or well done (like Blade). Tank Girl falls into the latter category. It is very funny, even though it sometimes tries just a little too hard. The acting is right on, and stays on throughout the whole film. There is an action scene near the end that almost ruins the atmosphere of the movie in that it makes it seem like just another unfunny action movie but luckily its short. I'd give it an 8 out of 10 because its really fun to watch but its not a master work of genius or anything. Soundtrack is good too."
