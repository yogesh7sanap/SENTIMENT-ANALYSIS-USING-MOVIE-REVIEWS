I wont mention the ending which had the entire audience laughing - Oh my what were they thinking? And to add insult to injury the thrash metal \"nettle-rash\" music as my old dad used to call it at the end credits really did aggravate an already aggravated viewing sesh!\n\nIts not awful - the people who give 1 star are as bad as the shills who give 10/10 to every movie they review and havent a clue what the ratings systems means - 1 star means its the worst movie you have ever seen; watch \"THE BAD BATCH\" with Keanu Reeves then come back and tell me you would still give this a 1 star.\n\nTo be fair Johnathon Schaech did a pretty good attempt at the original Bubba-zombie (he was the best actor in the whole thing) and the effects were not bad. The Dawn Of The Dead remake has been one of the best Zombo remakes but sadly this one is not. How very disappointing I must say! We can only hope Peter Jackson gets his Zombie movie that he has been talking about for over a decade off the ground, until then I guess us die hard zombo fans will have to make do with The Walking Dead!\n\nA fair 3/10 from me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When another remake of Day of the Dead was announced, the horror community was already up in arms. And for good reason. The last two attempts at \"reinventing\" Romero's nihilistically grim third installment in his \"Dead\" series were total unmitigated disasters. And from the sounds of it, this one was going to be no different...\n\nLow and behold, the film is released to scathing reviews left and right. And I won't sit here and pretend I don't get it, because I do, but I will say this...for whatever the hell it's worth, I personally thought it was very fun. It's trashy, cartoonishly violent (literal EXPLOSIONS of blood whenever someone gets bitten) and just plain silly at times. But I think that's why it works. It reminded me a bit of the Italian zombie flicks that were made in the wake of Dawn of the Dead and it seemed more focused on being an entertaining movie than trying to top the original.\n\nThe cast is generally pretty poor with Sophie Skelton making a bland protagonist (a sort of cross between Sarah and Dr. Logan from the original), Jeff Gum being an incredibly lame substitute for Joe Pilato's legendary Captain Rhodes and Marcus Vanco just being plain old boring.\n\nThe big exception here would be the top-billed Johnathon Schaech as our main antagonist Max. Max is essentially meant to be this movie's version of Bub, but whereas Bub was a lovable and sympathetic character, Max is a flat-out despicable monster from the get go. He makes a solid villain and the scenes where it's just him interaction with Skelton are genuinely effective. The third act really picks up thanks to shifting its focus mainly onto him.\n\nSo at the end of the day, it's not going to blow anyone's minds and if you walk into it wanting something on par with the original, then you're just asking to be disappointed. But if you're craving some old-fashioned splattery direct-to-video zombie action, you'll probably have a fun time with it."

Some of the actors deliver their lines as if punctuation is a foreign concept to them, there's no pauses or natural flow to the monotone words falling from their mouths. The lead actress does a few voiceovers throughout the film that are delivered so poorly that it sounded like she was reading them for the first time as they recorded her.\n\nWhen it comes to direction and camera work the action is your typical low budget handheld shaky cam style, it's functional, it does the job and that's about it. There's nothing special or inspired, no shots that make you sit up and take notice. Any young aspiring directors out there aren't going to be rushing out to copy this directors style, if you can call uninspired and forgettable a style. I will say that the practical zombie and gore effects are well done, though variety when it came to how things died would have been nice instead of just zombie death = headshot and human death = bite on neck from zombie.\n\nIn the end this is a very mediocre horror film full of poorly written cliched characters portrayed by mostly terrible actors, the various situations they find themselves in have zero tension because the script is so uninspired and predictable that you always know what's coming next. If you're like me you'll be rooting for the zombies after the first 10 minutes.\n\nI give it 3/10\n\nYou don't need a lot of money to make a great zombie type flick, all you need is a good script and a passionate director with a vision, for proof of this go watch The Girl With All The Gifts or 28 Days Later that both had similar budgets to this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Day Of The Dead (1985) has held its ground as one of the greatest zombie movies ever made and one of the jewels on the crown of the true king of zombie movies George Romero.\n\nWhen it was remade back in 2008 starring Mena Suvari it understandably flopped, it had big boots to fill and failed spectacularly. For whatever reason 10 years later in what is already shaping up to be one of the worst years in movie history they decided to remake it again.\n\nBloodline is exactly that, it's not just a cashgrab attempting to live off the originals name it is in fact an attempt at a remake. Sadly however they decided to change a great deal and that doesn't sit right with me.\n\nIt follows our heroine as she lives in the military bunker alongside civilians and soldiers alike. The soldiers vs scientists dynamic that made the original so memorable has been removed altogether.\n\nThey have a Bub like character, but he is an abusive stalker of our leading lady and is smarter than the rest of the zombies. Relentlessly pursuing her which is interesting but simply not Day Of The Dead.\n\nThough I don't think this is bad it certainly isn't good either. It's an offensively inferior remake of a movie that needs to be left the hell alone. All the changes to the plot have done it no favours, the pacing is dreadful, the characters are interchangeable and the \"Bloodline\" thing is pointlessly tacked on.\n\nThe Good:\n\nCouple of nice nods to the original\n\nLooks better than you'd expect\n\nThe Bad:\n\nInstantly forgettable characters\n\nAwful pacing\n\nSimply shouldn't exist\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nBeing bitten by a zombie will cause a mini explosion which sprays blood upwards of ten feet\n\nDuring the zombie apocalypse while seeing people being ripped apart and while surrounded by zombies it's best to take a leisurely walk through the middle of it all and have a telephone conversation"

The army guy in charge made sense, the main female character also had her reasons, it made sense why the zombie went after her, and the boyfriend character is also likable.\n\nI liked the original, I liked the 2008 one and I like this one too. I guess if you think the 2008 was ok, then you gonna like this movie too.\n\nPeople giving 1 or 2 or 9 or 10 points make no sense. This movie is a solid 6 from me, because it's re-watchable.\n\nUnfortunately this movie became the victim of the \"it's hip to hate the movie\" thing, since many people jumped on that bandwagon.\n\nOther thoughts: The original is made of $3.500.000 back in 1985, this one made of $8.000.000. If someone knows what inflation is, realizes that this movie's REAL budget is lower than the originals, since $3.500.000 back in 1985 did worth more than $8.000.000 in 2018."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was into zombie movies BEFORE zombie movies became cool again (some time in the early 2000s I believe when 'Resident Evil' appeared on the big screen. Therefore George Romero's 1985 film 'Day of the Dead' (or rather sequel to two classics - 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead') was a real favourite of mine.\n\nIn fact (and don't hate me for this!) even though 'Day' wasn't quite as well-received as its two predecessors, I actually liked it the most. I loved its darkness, sheer terrifying claustrophobic nature, cast, gore - in fact, everything about it. Now, skip forward a couple of decades where I'm allowed to browse the internet and I find out that - for some reason - the actual TITLE of the film, i.e. 'Day of the Dead' was never copyrighted (or something). This meant that, if I so wished, could make my own version of the film (maybe with some sort of addition-tagline just to cover myself) and not get sued. This went some way to explain 2005's 'Day of the Dead: Contagium' (don't watch it - trust me!). And possible 2008's remake of 'Day of the Dead' which confused many into thinking it was a sequel to the (quite excellent) 2005 remake of 'Dawn of the Dead.'\n\nI don't know why I watched 'Bloodline.' Maybe it's because 'The Walking Dead' is currently between seasons, or because 'Bloodlines' is on Netflix. Either way... I wish I hadn't. Although, like any good car crash, I couldn't turn it off.\n\n'Day of the Dead: Bloodlines' has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It also has some of the most obvious sets I've ever seen. The gore is okay, but too over-the-top for a film that's not supposed to be a 'comedy-horror' and the characters are more one-dimensional than your average daytime soap opera. So why did I continue to watch it? Possibly because I couldn't believe that someone was not just content with ripping off the 'Day of the Dead' title, but they've basically remade the original film... only much worse.\n\nMost of the original characters have been 'updated' (any by 'updated' I mean turned completely one-dimensional by second-rate actors), although a few names have been changed and/or applied to different characters. They've taken the setting, the characters, recreated the location (albeit badly in a set, rather than a real underground missile silo) and palmed it off as some sort of update. And - surprise, surprise - it doesn't work. They've even turned 'Bub' (aka the slightly more intelligent zombie from the 1985 version) into a slimy stalker, although, in the actor's defence, he's probably the best actor in this remake.\n\nIf you like zombie movies - great. Just watch a different one, as you're bound to have a few in your collection. Just because this is 'free' on Netflix, doesn't mean you should waste your time on it. It really is that bad. 'The Walking Dead' will be back soon enough. Even if you think the TV show is getting stale, it's still head and shoulders over this garbage."

There are good remakes of Romero's work: Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (2004) is an excellent one and Eisner's The Crazies (2010) is good/okay.\n\nDay of the Dead was already redone by Steve Miner in 2008 and as it wasn't a total failure its \"quality\" reminds me a lot of Day of the Dead: Bloodline - the production value and effects are good and far better than all those zombie flicks done by some buddies or students of filmmaking but the storytelling and acting is, let's say, improvable.\n\nIn my opinion Day of the Dead of Romero got some issues too (the acting, well, improvable) but it got an excellent atmosphere or feeling, claustrophobic and dark. Also in one point Romero did a far better job - there are no filling scenes, the tempo, everything is raw to the bone and therefore I never felt bored, stretched or something. I could imagine myself in that bunker, surrounded by the dead, wondering how that would be, what I would do etc. pp. (back then I was too young but I still managed to sneak into the cinema). Bloodline does not in any sense give me that kind of \"feel\" at all.\n\nBloodline follows just loosely the ideas/story of the original. My question here: why call it then Day of the Dead at all!?\n\nFinal words: Bloodline's story is standard, predictable, a little boring, and there is no actor on board who did inspire any real empathy on my side.\n\nWell, if you are an aficionado of all zombie related (like I am), you may dare to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "George Romero pretty much screwed up the 'Living Dead' franchise with everything from Land of the Dead (2005) onwards, but it was his to ruin. Director H\u00e8ctor Hern\u00e1ndez Vicens, on the other hand, has no place in making such a travesty as this 'Bold New Vision' of Romero's classic Day of the Dead (1985). An insult to the original in almost every way imaginable, Bloodline will give zombie fans nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFirst off, the undead in this film are referred to as 'rotters', which makes them sound like something out of a Billy Bunter comic strip. And if you thought that the vegetarian zombie in Steve Miner's Day of the Dead (2008) was a dumb idea, wait until you get a load of Max (Johnathon Schaech), who is clearly intended to be the equivalent of Bub from Romero's movie, a zombie with the ability to reason. Max is a stealth zombie, able to sneak into the military base by hanging onto the underside of a vehicle, and then slope off into the main building where he crawls through the air ducts. He's a stalker too, following pretty doctor Zoe Parker (Sophie Skelton), the subject of his obsession before he was 'turned', using his amazing tracking skills. On top of all that, he can talk too. I bet if someone passed him a few oranges, he could juggle as well.\n\nThe other zombies are of the running kind that roar like a T-Rex.\n\nThe humans are equally as irritating. Zoe might have good intentions, trying to create a vaccine to the zombie virus, but her reckless behaviour endangers all those around her, and ultimately costs the lives of almost all of those in the camp. The bad guy, Miguel (Jeff Gum), is a pale imitation of Captain Rhodes from Romero's film, and Zoe's love interest Baca (Marcus Vanco) is merely pretty-boy eye candy for the ladies. There's even a cute kid in the form of Lily (Lillian Blankenship), who Zoe risks all to save (certainly, many die so that she can live).\n\nI guess what this film clearly illustrates is just how great Romero was in his prime: his first three zombie films still stand as three of the best the genre has to offer, even after all of these years.\n\n3/10, purely for the gore."

He never uses the hammer and there's absolutely no reason or explanation for him to grab the hammer and it's never brought up again, so why is it in the scene?

The acting is good but not as intense as it was in the original but the only real thing I see to complain about is the ending feels rushed with a little bit of unresolved conflicts near the end with nothing epic in the fates of any of the characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Day of the Dead: Bloodline' drew me into seeing it, with a cool poster/cover, an intriguing if not particularly original premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive as well as the low rating and poor reviews.\n\nIt is sadly however yet another film seen recently, hence some reiteration because the exact same strengths and flaws those films have are present here, that to me was incredibly disappointing considering its potential which it doesn't do anywhere near enough with. 'Day of the Dead: Bloodline' is terrible, with a plethora of problems (huge ones too) and doesn't do enough with its potential, which was hardly small. There is next to nothing to recommend.\n\nWhether it is a sequel or remake of 'Day of the Dead', by default the vastly superior film being actually good, and how it fares as well doesn't matter so much to me. It's how it fares on its own terms, on that front this film is an abysmal failure.\n\nLets start with the sole positive. The scenery is atmospheric and spooky.\n\nUnfortunately, the scenery is not done justice by the rather direct to video schlocky way it's shot and edited and the drab colour palette, so much so it was hard to appreciate it, it was very clear that the film was made in a rush with no care or enthusiasm. In particular, the camera work was a nauseous assault on the eyes with its excessive amateurish-ness.\n\nGoing on further to the negatives, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. Their annoying and illogical decision making and behaviours frustrates.\n\nMaking the film feel bland and forgettable with not enough heart put into it. The effects are ropy at best, the sound quality is obvious and utilised cheaply (being too loud in the build ups and people's reactions) and it's best not mentioning the uniformly lumbering and monotonous acting that shows a huge indifference to the situation and what is going on.\n\nDialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clich\u00e9s and no depth whatsoever, while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags on forever with very little going on worth caring about and useless padding, never recovering. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. Would not have minded the lack of originality (the film is extremely derivative and in a dumbed and watered down way) if the story and atmosphere were at least alright in execution, in reality they were both very poorly done.\n\nA lot of 'Day of the Dead: Bloodlne' has underdeveloped plot elements and often nonsensical, illogical and confusing character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. The ending makes the film finish on an incomplete and confused whimper.\n\nThere is not enough threat with goofy looking make up for the zombies that act more bored out of their minds than undead scary, and what there is of it tends to be used poorly. It is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, completely failing to show any sense of horror or creativity, also too reliant on gratuitous elements that it thinks makes things unsettling but actually cheapens everything. Everything here is neither creative, suspenseful or nail-biting. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction is leaden and like their heart was not in it or ill at ease, with the chemistry between the characters and actors coming over as constantly random and aggressive with the subtlety of an axe.\n\nOverall, awful, completely bloodless and more dead than the zombies. There is no redeeming value apart from an element that is difficult to appreciate with it being complemented so badly. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The zombie makeup effects, blood and bite effects were top notch. It was really well done. The story had potential but miserably failed. Not a single person in this film can act and what the hell is that accent? Everyone speaks like a freakin pornstar!\n\nHonestly, i don't know why i should recommend this movie to anyone! But if you have watched all the zombie movies in your watch list and can't find anything so far, go for it.\n\n\n\n((( SPOILERS BELOW )))\n\nThe main characters makes a whole lot of stupid decisions. How the hell did that place swarmed up with thousands of zombies in a single night? Earlier morning when they went out on a supply run, there were like 5 or 6 zombies by the gate and few more on the road which they killed half of by the end of that scene. Then the following night the place overflows with thousands and thousands of zombies and they keep shooting and shooting. They're on a freakin hill, how did all those zombies get there overnight?\n\nAlso i can't believe how the main subject zombie(max) able to hang down the humvee without anyone ever spot him! They made a perimeter check and placed soldiers in place before going into the hospital, but he was able to avoid contact with ALL of them and hop under the vehicle. That little girl(lily) was dumb as a brick, she went straight into a pool of zombies when she was scared away by said zombies. Just great. I'm not asking it to be completely realistic, I know some movies are made just for the mindless fun, but where's the fun in this?\n\nJustifiable reasoning should be given for each events that are happening, which is what you're failed to do and gave me a severe migraine! I expected a lot seeing the movie name, disappointed nonetheless!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you have seen the original Day of the Dead, please remember it was by far the worst of the original trilogy, and was less than acceptable at best as the conclusion to Romero's series. Bloodlines unfortunately can't fix the original and ends up missing more than it hits.\n\nBoth Dawn and Night have been remade since the 1990's - both very successfully. However I always believed the most potential for a remake was with Day. Enter Day of the Dead: Bloodline.\n\nThe plot is similar to the original. Sometime after the zombie apocalypse, a small base is holding out, and looking for a cure. People will get eaten, gore will be seen, throats will be ripped out.\n\nWhile the original was a B movie from the 80's, Day:Deadline is a C movie from the 2000 -teens. The acting is abysmal, but who really cares? The plot has more holes than I could list in this review's word limit, but it's a zombie movie, and the original content wasn't great to start with.\n\nThere has been an honest attempt to update and clean up the original, but the remake isn't much better. Low budget and a general clumsy development of ideas limit this film to just another zombie \"B\" movie of which there have been so many. It's too bad, because this story does have some potential.\n\nIt's a movie. It's a 'B (really C)' movie. It has zombies it in. If you are still interested, watch and you will find something to enjoy in it. If you are not interested, by that description, then you probably would not like it even if it was great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Zombies take over the world. A couple of months earlier we learn how all this started. A corpse is brought to medical school. A group of students studies the cause of death and learns that it's some variety of influenza. Meanwhile one of the students, the pretty Zoe is stalked by one patient who carves her name into his forearm. When the tries to rape her the corpse reanimates and attacks the crazy guy.\n\nYears later what's left of humanity is holed up in some military base surrounded by zombies. Zoe is the main physician there, she's involved with one of the military guys, brother of the main military guy. Civilians are living in RVs and tents inside the base. When they run out of medicines Zoe suggests they raid the med school storage. On the way there the Humveee breaks down, and once at the university they're attacked by zombies, including Zoe's abuser Max who's developed smarts over the years and manages to make it to the military base unnoticed. He's captured eventually and Zoe studies his blood in order to try and develop a vaccine against zombiefication. Of course Max breaks free and thanks to the overall stupidity of the humans, zombies overrun the base. Will the military be able to stop the zombies in time for Zoe to finish her vaccine?\n\nDay of the Dead: Bloodline is a zombie B-movie that features the lovely Sophie Skelton (a Brit playing an American of course), who makes for a dynamic and compelling lead without being too bossy and annoying. Most importantly, it has the most charismatic main zombie I've seen in a long time. Johnathon Schaech does an outstanding job as the smart zombie in love. The movie is violent and gory. But it has plenty of weaknesses--the secondary cast is goofy as your typical military that looks like no military but in oversize pristine uniforms. While the zombies have gotten smart the humans have gotten dumber and this movie features countless acts of human stupidity. That said, the main concept of the script is good. But editing makes a couple of goofs.\n\nOverall, this is a good zombie flick but not one that should be associated with the Romero series, not sure why anyone can these days make something called \"Day of the Dead.\" In any event, it's nothing to get too upset about. Enjoy this movie for what it is. It sure is better than many of the countless awful low budget zombie movies out there and is plenty entertaining."

The acting was from bad to worse and the story just dragged on in a dreary fashion, as if the director was making it up as they went along. Everything you have ever seen in a zombie movie is seen here yet unbelievably, the survivors (even the soldiers) never have a weapon with them at all times.....no guns, machetes or knives!? However! The thing that stood out so stupidly was the fact that these zombies could represent their country, for the 100 metres at the Olympics. They made Cheetahs look slow and they all seemed to have the strength of Hercules. A great many 'Film Directors' today are totally messing up the zombie genre, to the point where they are mainly in the comical (because the story/zombies are literally laughably stupid), or they are just absolutely DrEADful films!\n\nI always believe everyone should watch a movie themselves and determine its worth (as everybody's tastes differ) but, sometimes you really should just believe an individuals review. PRO's: Best thing about this movie are the special FX (hence the 1 star I have given it) and the end credits... CON's: Nothing new, good or interesting and, there is no time spent watching refund of your life :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Day of the Dead: Bloodline is a remake to George A. Romero's classic zombie film which showed how society has crumbled after the apocalypse. And a group of refugees and what is left of the military are hiding in an underground bunker. The trailer to this film seemed very promising and looked like it was going to be a lot of gory fun like how 2004 Dawn of the Dead film looked. Now don't get me wrong, the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake has to be the best remake yet. Which succeeded over the original. Now Day of the Dead: Bloodline however, was very disappointing and even the worse film ever. Not sure where to start about this film.\n\nWe can all say the acting was horrible. Go figures since it was a straight to dvd movie, were it is most likely fitting in the sci fi channel. The cast performance was horrible and amateur with the acting. Main character Sophie Skelton playing a character that was once a med student and now she is capable of trying to come up with a breakthrough of a cure to the virus. Yes, it was unbelievable.\n\nThe direction was horrible. Characters make stupid decisions. A little girl runs away from the zombies and runs towards the herd of undead to escape? What was her logic in that. Who knows. A military soldier gets very close to a chained up zombie to taunt it. We can know were that is going. And no characters make a bright decision at all in the movie.\n\nThere was no scares. Or excitement with this film. Yes, the zombies are fast. The action is so dull. It does not build the suspense to even care on what is going on. The practical effects was horrible. Every zombie biting a person and causing the blood to outburst was cheesy.\n\nI enjoyed the original Day of the Dead for what it was. It may not be strongest George A. Romero's zombie movie like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. But the 1980s music, set design, make up, and the creepy scary tone of being surrounded by flesh eating undead worked great in his classic movies. This remake does not do anything to make it better besides making it a cheesy forgettable zombie movie. Plus if you seen the original, you may miss Bob the friendly undead that the scientist experimented. Unlike the remake, which had a forgettable undead that outsmarts the others.\n\nOverall, Day of the Dead: Bloodline is a horrible film. Acting is atrocious, the direction was dull and terrible, and there was no scares or thrills to make this worth watching. If you are a fan of the original you will be disappointed. I would not recommend the film at all.\n\nI rate the film 1 out of 5 stars."

Not even the learning about how to find a way to stop the apocalypse was right, this remake trying to find a cure while the original was teaching zombies how to be human again. This is as good as watching maybe something under the rating of Jeepers Creepers and I think needs a 5.5/10. They made the setting a camp and most of it takes place above ground and the only character keeping his place like from the original was the leader."

However, that was just a false presentation, as the movie had very little to do with that classic zombie movie.\n\nThe storyline was adequate, albeit quite predictable and generic.\n\nThe special effects were that one and only thing that kept me glued to the movie to get through to the end. The zombies, however, were running, which is a huge no-go in my opinion. But it gets worse, the zombies were also making this insanely inhuman growling sound that would scare even a ferocious lion. Those sounds were just so absurdly ridiculous and it didn't work in any sense for the movie.\n\nThis was a zombie movie that snuck in under the radar and will vanish just as unseen.\n\nThere is very little to be had here for a zombie afficianado, so don't get your hopes up."

Well none of the zombies were smart. There was one character who LOOKED like a zombie, but wasn't. He was partially immune to the zombie virus and had certain systems of his body succumb to the virus, while retaining some higher level brain function.\n\nAll in all, it's not that good, but not nearly as bad as what other reviewers are claiming.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm gonna start off by saying that I know this isn't a good movie; espescially with the significant flaws this film carries and that's what I wanna start with...the flaws.\n\nFlaw number 1: The Acting... The acting ranged from bad to somewhat tolerable. Their behavior was barely even realistic, the main actress was so monotonous half the time it was like listening to a robot while other times she was close to human behavior but just not quite.\n\nFlaw number 2: The Dialogue... None of the things they say is remotely believable to what people would say in situations the characters are put in; not even the way they try to connect with one another.\n\nFlaw number 3: The Characters... The characters or atleast the human characters are poorly written and incredibly dumb even by typical horror movie standards. They make poor descisions left and right you don't really care if they die.\n\nSome people criticized the gore sequences where zombies would drag a person off-screen and an explosion of blood would shoot out. Personally, I wasn't bothered by this since I'm used to over-the-top gore with movies like Evil Dead 2, Dead-Alive & the Wrong Turn movies (excluding the first one) but it's still worth mentioning. Because the film relies heavily on these things it's no wonder why people were disappointed with this movie. Now that we've gotten the flaws out of the way, lets point out all the good things that won over my approval.\n\nFirst thing that I'd like to bring up is the cinematography. Even if you didn't like it, you have admit the film is still wonderfully well shot; you have to admire the people behind the cameras. They get alot of cool shots throughout the movie like the zombie appearing before the camera and spitting out a fountain of blood from its mouth which is one of my favorite shots in the movie.\n\nSecond is the action sequences... This movie was pretty crazy when it came to the action. There was alot of gun firing, stabbings, pucnhing, zombies biting and ripping people apart, it was just awesome.\n\nThird, the special effects were amazingly well crafted that they stand up to the special effects seen in the original Day of the Dead.\n\nFourth is the story... The story I felt was actually pretty good. It was the same premise told in a different way which was kinda like the way Dawn of the Dead 2004 did with the original.\n\nFifth, the gore... The gore was awesome, don't really need to say much there.\n\nSixth is the villain and the actor playing him... I know I said the acting wasn't good but actor Jonathan Schaech did a good job playing the lead zombie villain in the movie. He's pretty much the best thing about this movie, which I know isn't saying much but it still counts for something.\n\nAnd finally the seventh reason is the fact that it's faithful to the original 1985 classic. It doesn't make a movie good when it's faithful to the source material but atleast this version wasn't too derivative as the 2008 remake was if you can even remember it. I'm not trying to convince anyone to watch this movie, my review is just stating that this movie wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. True it has flaws but I think if they hired actors for their talents rather than their looks which is clearly obvious and hired better writers it would have probably been a much better film. It's a fun stupid movie that was worth watching but that's just my opinion."

They used a second of the original music in the beginning.. boo only a second 3. The mood seemed right at first 4. They carried over some of the dialogue of the original\n\nWhat I hated about it:\n\nEverything else.. they changed so many of the core elements from the original that I find it hard for them to say they were trying to stay faithful to the original. They changed so many core elements key to the original film that it felt wrong, including one beloved character that is obvious now the psycho demon like creature that seems as if it were birthed by a demon and the joker..\n\nThey also removed the key storyline of what the mission was in the original .. for the most part, in the first movie it was a major story element and in this remake the key plot lines of the original are throw away pieces that are just there for fillers..\n\nThis is a piece of junk and it dishonors Romero ..

But when it goes far beyond the limit of normal stupid choices, the movie becomes The Suicide Games, in which the characters are trying to one-up each other's zombie maulings. \"Okay, we're doing something that has to be done now, and that alone would be so boring it would make the movie boring, so to make it exciting, we're gonna do it in the middle of a bunch of zombies. Who wants to be the zombie food this time?\" To which someone raises their hand high in the air, bouncing on their heels \"Ooh! Ooh! I will!\" And that one is pointed out as the lucky winner, and the one next to them is disappointed, but they'll get another chance next time.\n\nWell, if not being boring was their goal, they accomplished it.

I have seen the original as well as at least one remake and this movie doesn't resemble them at all.\n\nNext, most of the acting is this movie is terrible. The lead actress Sophie Skelton was the only one that was even kind of good. The terrible dialog made her seem less talented than she is. I know she is better because I have seen her in other things such as Outlander where she was much better.\n\nLastly, the blood spray effects when people are bitten or ridiculous. Unless everyone's blood pressure was 1200/800 instead of 120/80, no one would spray blood like they were a balloon popping. Some of the other effects were ok, but nothing special.\n\nFor the guys out there, the one thing this type of movie usually has is a few hot girls showing off their assets, but this movie even fails there. If not for the gore, it might as well have been rated PG. At least if you skip the beginning and ending credits, it only wastes about 82 minutes of your life."

        "review_title": "Day of the Dead is remade once again, and while somewhat closer to the 1985 film, it's also simultaneously a step down from the '08 version",
        "review_detailed_main": "Five years after a zombie outbreak, med student Zoe (Sophie Skelton) serves as the doctor to the refugees and military personnel in High Rock Bunker, possibly the last human stronghold. High Rock is overseen by the stern and commanding Miguel (Jeff Gum) whose brother Baca (Marcus Vanco) is Zoe's boyfriend. On a supply run to Zoe's former university to get medical supplies, Zoe's stalker and attempted rapist Max (Johnathon Schaech) has become a zombie, but due to variations in his body chemistry he is more intelligent and \"human\" than other zombies and has retained his obsession with Zoe. Max is able to sneak into High Rock but is soon captured at Zoe's request as she believes he could provide the source for a vaccine.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced yet another remake of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead would be produced a mere 5 years after the release of the previous one. Much like Day of the Dead projects Day of the Dead 2: Contagium and Day of the Dead '08, executive producers James Glenn Dudelson and Robert Franklin Dudelson of Taurus Entertainment were involved with the project as they own the rights to the title (even if their company Taurus Entertainment is strangely absent). Initially it was announced that House at the End of the Street director Mark Tonderai would helm this remake upon initial announcement, but after a five year period between announcement and release Tonderai was only credited as \"co-writer\" while directing duties went to first time feature director H\u00e8ctor Hern\u00e1ndez Vicens. According to initial announcements, the film was originally going to feature the slow moving zombies seen in the original Day of the Dead with the release also throwing shade at the PG-13 zombie blockbuster World War Z, however this proved not to be the case as the film uses \"runners\" made popular by 28 Days Later and Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake leading me to believe this was probably a very troubled production with a lot of behind the scenes meddling. Day of the Dead: Bloodline does stay closer to the source material than it's '08 counterpart and features some intriguing ideas, but in execution it's a boring and pretty stupid slog.\n\nI start off by saying only one complementary point on this movie in that I actually did like Johnathon Schaech as the film's antagonist Max who's a more sinister revision on \"Bub\" from the 1985 film and Bud from the 2008 film in that he's a more \"human\" zombie. Unlike the good natured Bub and Bud from the previous films, Max is established as being a sinister presence in the story who has retained his humanity and guile, but when that humanity was originally an obsessed rapist it does lead to some interesting possibilities. Unfortunately, that's where my complements for this movie end because everything aside from the novelty of a zombie stalker is done pretty poorly.\n\nSophie Skelton has proven herself to be a solid actress in other things such as the Starz series outlander, but much like Menu Suvari in the previous film, Skelton doesn't speak with much conviction here and her performance may be even worse than Suvari's was in '08 because there's a decent amount of voice over narration that when she speaks sounds very boring and unenthused. The movie also doesn't have much in the way of interesting characters with most of them being pretty forgettable and full confession: I had to watch this twice because the first time I fell asleep 30 minutes in because of how boring it was. I suppose there's less usage of unconvincing CGI than there was in the first film so the terrible fire effects and CGI Rocky Mountains are absent, but while there is some gore, it's not particularly impressive and we still have CGI blood spurts that just aren't convincing. But the absolute death nail in this movie for me was the incredibly stupid decisions made by characters that allow many of the disasters to happen including but not limited to: Wandering off from the group by yourself with no back-up, letting zombies IN to the secured compound to get samples from them, or brazenly getting up in the face of a captured zombie and taunting it.\n\nMuch like how Day of the Dead '08 existed solely because Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead was a hit, Day of the Dead: Bloodline only exists because The Walking Dead was a phenomenon. There's nothing wrong with chasing trends, but when you barely put any effort into your trend chasing with substandard effects, acting, and writing, that's where my leeway runs out."

The previous remake was pretty bad, so I figured that this would be better than that one at least. That's... not how it worked out, unfortunately.\n\nFor starters, the acting is astonishingly awful. I watch a lot of B-Movies, I'm used to bad acting, but nothing that was said in the movie felt right in the slightest; it was stilted and wooden like they were trying to channel too much intensity into every conversation. It wasn't even amusing like some movies acting, instead being painfully dull. I must admit, I skipped about five minutes halfway through because I realised that it was just going to be five minutes of unlikable characters talking angrily at each other. I didn't miss much.\n\nThe special effects are sometimes decent, but most of the time it's high-pressure sprays that just look goofy. There was one bit where someone got dragged behind a counter and then the bloodspray shoots up from the opposite side of where it should. With characters like this, the least you could hope for is them satisfyingly getting munched on, and we didn't really get that. The makeup on the zombies is pretty decent, at least.\n\nThe story itself is basically similar to the original, but without the intelligence, wit, or social commentary. Instead we get more characters doing stupid things because, well, that's how they keep the plot moving! They wander off, don't lock doors behind them, assume flimsy materials will hold back hundreds of zombies... I wouldn't expect them to survive a romantic comedy, much less a horror movie. I am astonished that they somehow survived five years between the opening and the main film.\n\nI saw a review that described it as \"More Fulci than Romero.\" In fact, it was that comparison that intrigued me. The thing is, Fulci movies don't have great characters, or deep stories, but what they do have is satisfying gore and grue, an unsettling atmosphere, and music that's eerie and fitting. The only music from this that comes to mind is the end credits metal, which is already fading from my memory. None of it is notable in any way.\n\nDay of the Dead: Bloodline is no Romero. It isn't even Fulci, or Bava (I'm thinking Lamberto, but either works), or even Lenzi. It is a failure on just about every level that somehow, astonishingly, makes me wish I was watching the 2008 remake instead.\n\nAnd that's incredibly sad."

The movie made bad movies seem no so bad. I feel bad for the actors who are trying to make a name in Hollywood but also need to make a paycheck. The movie starts out as a flashback from a scene that is never referenced in it again! The directing seemed to be so juvenile that even a high school student film would fare better. Not sure if this could be called a remake since it lacks the story line of the original and the non sensical killing was moot. I'm glad the director was kind enough to limit it to 90 minutes."

All of the women look exactly the same. All the men look exactly the same. They are all young actors, which is not believable in the slightest for this sort of story. One actor was so bad they had to overdub all of his lines... I wonder if it is even the actual actor's voice?!\n\nZimmermann has been a casting director for decades... he worked on hundreds of movies from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood to Hellboy 2. Stansheva has been casting for 15 years, but mostly low budget movies. Regardless, these two people should not have a job after casting this movie with the horrible actors that they used.\n\nCongratulations to the makeup effects and cinematography. Hopefully this movie didn't hurt their careers much.\n\nOverall the director is to blame for this horrible crap. This is the last movie he has directed, and that might be for the best."

Romero's third instalment in his original zombie movie trilogy, in which he clearly reflects some aspects of modern psyche and society of the USA if not the world in the era the films were made and BLUH BLAH BLUH!

There are some interesting concepts such as a new look at zombie virus and cure, but the execution isn't very well done.\n\nI would recommend this film only to big zombie fans who want to get there fix, the movie isn't horrible but it edges onto poor.

We're to believe Zoe, played by Sophie Skelton, never mentioned the hospital before, or any of her childhood to Baca, right? Not credible. Then there's Miguel, who didn't prefer Rhodes (Pilato) to Miguel (Jeff Gum). Sure, Miguel, like Rhodes, is actually the good guy of the story and is only trying to keep people safe, and Gum's performance was great and filled with intensity, but I just felt Rhodes had more depth. More layers to him. In the end, Bloodline just wasn't as good or as fulfilling as it should have been, especially Max. Disappointing!"

Just... don't. All the other performances are unwatchable, the plot is complete garbage, you know everything in advance and it's stupid decisions all over the place.

Rubber faced zombies stalk the city street set and deliver much theatrical bloodletting: cascades of the stuff shoot out toward the camera. Then we get to know the characters - sullen, pretty, some in love with each other, most just delivering deadpan military-isms: earnest recriminations and stoical retorts. Curiously, it's a bit bland, the gore scenes committed perfunctorily, creepy moments and dark corners just the same as you will probably have seen before, rolled out with an alarming lack of tension.\n\nIn horror films such as this, heroic leads have to make illogical decisions. You could blame heightened emotions, the stress of the relentless apocalypse, or simply the need to place them in jeopardy. But they're such a torpid bunch, you're not really bothered about what happens to most of them.\n\nZoe, the main character, is well-meaning, pretty, brave, and is ultimately responsible for the death of hundreds. Most interesting is Max, the undead attempted rapist regularly taunted at close range by our heroes. My score for the film is 5 out of 10."

High hopes shot down, cut up or eaten. \"Bloodline\" is the type of film that gives away 90% of the plot during the first 10 or so minutes. The film is not as bad as some have written. Still, \"Bloodline\" is a take on George A. Romero's classic that probably shouldn't have been taken."

It took a great first movie (day of the dead 1985) and tore it apart and crapped on it. Now, the three main things that I find make the movie a mess\n\nThe acting and characters- the actors are all awful, no suprise there. Not a single one is believable at all in their roles. Also, the characters SUCK. They have no development, and the ones that do you don't like anyways. They also making some of the dumbest decisions I have ever seen, some that are minor and will slow down the plot to ones that ruin everything.Nice job, main character who I forgot the name of. You ruined everything with your dumb plan that makes NO sense. You killed everyone, except all the kids, of course, because this film doesn't take a single risk.\n\nNext up, the production design and technical things- it all sucks. What a surprise. The movie is blandly shot, the action scenes are terrible, the music sounds awful, the sets look fake, the CGI looks atrocious, the practical stuff even looks fake because of how bloody simple things like stabs get. All of it is just awful, and is embarrassing, as I have seen low budget films have much better everything. To make it even worse, the editing and pacing makes me think a student filmmaker from the 4th grade made it The only thing I can commend about it is that the props look real, but that can be pretty hard to mess up.\n\nFinally, the script, dialogue and plot- there isn't much to say here. The dialogue all sounds extremely fake, the script was poorly written, and the plot was nonsensical. It was one of the dumbest movie plots I think I have ever seen.\n\nDon't watch it. It's not worth it. It's not even a so bad it's good. Heck, it's not even a one out of ten. It's like a 0.5/10. It's The worst film I have ever seen, and a complete Trainwreck on every level."

The idea that those responsible for it were trying to appeal to fans of the original is insulting, since the only way to pull this up is to take every single one of those fans as some kind of mindless teenager without criteria and the work of Romero as some generic cheap bloodbath.

Yet the first few minutes would seem to introduce a completely different result.\n\nAt the expense of a well-made make-up work, Day of the Dead: Bloodline is accompanied by a poor-quality script: rough in the way it reels off the events, banal in the references to the original film, stuffed with clich\u00e9 scenes, and discounted beyond belief, especially in the end. Many - too many - are the obscure points which, needless to say, are accompanied by an at times disarming acting. To save the shack only Johnathon Schaech as an almost sentient zombie, think a little !?\n\nCertainly with Day of the Dead: Bloodline we did not hope to find the perfect zombie movie, but at least a film capable of resting the foundations on a well-structured story.

Perhaps it means unforgivable ignorance on my behalf, but I simply looked a nice film on Netflix and came across this. Trailer seemed okay, so I figured, what the heck? This means that perhaps my opinion would have been more harsh had I had the whole \"I must compare this to the original and deduct one point for each and every difference\" thing going. I honestly don't understand why people do that to themselves.\n\nSo, Bloodline was to me like a Friday night family dinner. It isn't made by a chef, it isn't a taste-bud orgasm and it might even not contain your favorite childhood dish. It's just nice. The film is a regular Zombie flick with a nice story and a main plotline which I haven't seen done so far (again, this is a remake, so I guess any compliments belong there and not here). The acting is good enough for the overall level of the film. I personally dislike the amounts of blood and gore (zombies tearing out bits of flesh don't impress me, simply looks like an unrewarding and unnecessary way to spend a budget, sorry) but I suppose a Zombie flick trying to be classic needs some of that.\n\nAll in all? I had fun. I was entertained. I wasn't swept off my feet or had my mind blown, I simply enjoyed the dynamics between the characters and the overall post-apocalyptic battle scenario. I'm sure you could find better Zombie flicks, as well as worse. Nothing much left to say, as for better or worse the film doesn't leave a lasting impression. Watching it won't be as painful as others here say, so watch a trailer and decide for yourselves."
