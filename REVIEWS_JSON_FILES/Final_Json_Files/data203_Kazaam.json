        "review_detailed_main": "Well, adolescent really(19). Like Howard the Duck, Kazaam was a movie I loved as a child but looking back on it I was shocked at how low my taste buds were as a kid. Granted, there are some funny moments specifically the ones with the flying toasts and the bicycle race. And it is not the worst movie of 1996, Ed and especially Bio Dome are worse. However, the special effects are really quite substandard, and the rest of the production values are of direct to video quality and shoddy ones at that. The story is predictable with only a few worthwhile scenes to favour, the sight gags suffer from poor comic timing and the script is childish and simplistic. The characters I really dislike here, the kid is annoying, the villain is one of the lamest I have seen in a long time while Shaquille O'Neal's Genie with his awful rapping(then again I dislike rap intensely, and that is the least problematic of his performance) grated on me fast. The acting doesn't fare much better either, while the direction is literally non-existent and the soundtrack is only tolerable if on mute. This is of course my opinion, disagree all you want, I guess I just didn't like it. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor. He's bullied by neighborhood kids, which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag.\n\nThe story is just plain stupid and extremely clich\u00e9. About a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father.\n\nEven at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea. It's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made. i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the plot."

He grants the kid three wishes (all which are not that great) and through it all, a friendship develops.

His father is involved in selling bootleg tapes and is involved in some kind of scheme with Malik, the Middle Eastern owner of the club. Max's final wish is for his daddy to have a second-chance.

Immediately, he pulled distribution of Shazam and reshot the movie with Shaq. To save on expenses, the scenes got longer and included a lot more filler - a far cry from quippy, fast-paced Sinbad version.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies, but with humanity. Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie- yes, a RAPPING genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits, all ending in him in a Christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him. So, yeah, expect really cheesy bits, including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky (and, regrettably, not knocking out the two main characters, particularly the kid). What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! The main plot of the film involves this kid, played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of Frank Capra (where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily), who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box. Then \"hiarity ensues\" as the kid makes the Shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father.\n\nThis really sappy, contrived son and father story would be bad enough, as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies (i.e. the \"two chances in life\" speech from father to son). But it's Shaquille O'Neill who is both the reason to watch the film (ironically), and the obvious sinking crux of it all. His plot line involves him, when not getting the over-talky treatment from Capra, to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career. On top of this, he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box. So is there a camp factor to the movie? Up to a point, but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart-felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material. One might ask if the people making the movie, who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon, if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing. I'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid. But I'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq-machine.\n\nSo, if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie-turned-rapper-turned-wisecracker, all the more fun to you. Hell, it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel. But if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells, stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996, and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's."

Most notably, the rap battle between the boy and Shaq, where they repeat \"We ain't men, we genie.\"\n\n* Scowling at a piece of toast. * A boom box that shoots a shower of sparks * A grown man showering in front of a child * A rapping genie, that despite boasting his lyrical skills, always starts every rhyme with \"I am Kazaam\" * More than an hour of your life wasted\n\nThese are what you have to look forward to in watching this.\n\nI'm troubled that anyone thought this would make money, or legitimize Shaq's rapping career in the minds of children.\n\nIf you have a choice between sitting in gridlock traffic for 9 hours, 10 straight hours of oral surgery or watching Kazaam, Kazaam wins by a slight margin. There's no more positive endorsement I can give."

I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young, but I must've been an idiot then, because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that. Although, once the thrill of mocking it is done, you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness.\n\nIf you see it on TV, try this: consider, as your watching the film, removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers. If you do that, it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him. That's kinda funny, and disturbing.\n\nA horrible example of film.

How many times did you just want Kazaam to die a horrible death when he started rapping? And the writing was atrocious -- do **NOT** show this movie to little kids! You will put them at risk for brain damage with lines like: \"Francais? I love it 'beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup'!\" and \"You smell like a hippopotamus butt.\" Many others follow, as well. And the ending was horribly melodramatic -- I will not spoil it so you can see it for yourself. Overall, I would like to thank Conan O'Brien for discovering this horrible movie that every family can enjoy...making fun of.\n\nP.S.

First of all, this movie appeared to have a large budget, yet the director clearly forgot to address Max's snaggle tooth. With all the special effects in this movie, they could've at least made this kid look like he kept a dentist appointment. Now, let's move on to the major flaw of this movie--Shaq. It appears that this guy can do it all--play basketball, rap, and act. However, these last two things are severely lacking. His raps consist of such memorable lines as, \"I'll be the cream for your coffee,\" \"I'll green eggs and ham it,\" and \"fresh out the box like a premature burial.\" This rap song was awful....it was right up there with his breakthrough flops \"I'm Outstanding\" and \"Biological Didn't Bother.\" Possibly the worst scene of the movie was the recycled after-school special speech by the soon-to-be step-father, Travis. We cringed when we heard Travis reassure Max that he would not take the place of his father. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes with Max's father that we left the room for. However, when we returned we caught the tail-end of some poorly acted \"bad-guy\" scenes. This movie was plagued with weak walk-on parts, such as 'Da Brat and Spinderella. We found it very preposterous how Shaq became a pop music icon after \"rapping\" one stinkin' song in a dingy club. We also found the recycled \"school is cool\" message to be extremely played. In particular where Shaq plays Max's tutor (a job that seemed extremely far-fetched for Shaq). In this movie, Shaq claims that he is more intelligent than a Harvard grad. Once again, this is just stupid. In reality, Shaq has the equivalent of a 5th grade education, as evidenced by his stammering as he struggles through the cue cards. Overall, this movie is unbearable and painful to watch. Shaq should really look into other hobbies in the off-season, and Francis Capra should receive dental assistance before even thinking about going to another audition."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching this film as a semi-retarded adolescent and not enjoying it due to the vague underlying themes that flew over my head at such a young age. However, last week, passing this movie in the Blockbuster Mega-Discount bin, I decided to re-watch it and see if my opinion has changed.\n\n(I tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, without losing some of the movie's flair. I feel I have succeeded) I must say, spending that 2.50$ plus tax was the greatest decision of my pitiful and shameful life. In the 5 days I have had the VHS, I have watched this film at least 15 times, I unfortunately lost track after blacking out naked on my carpet on the 2nd day. This movie goes down in history as one of the 5 greatest drama sequels of all time, and If I had to put a rating on it's comedy factor, I would give it 4 thumbs way up. I found myself laughing throughout the entire film, calling my friends and family to repeat jokes I had heard. The casting in this film is absolutely excellent, with Shaq leading the performance like a Frenchman in a yogurt factory. The story revolves around a genie named Shaq, and a small Italian boy named Max. Upon finding a magic stereo player, Max discovers a small black genie living inside, and offers to give him a place to sleep and eat for a week. Ironically, this is where the theme of pedophilia comes into play, with multiple scenes of Max and Shaq showering together and close up shots of them smiling. I hate to repeat myself, but as a child, I understood nothing about this subject. However, as a fleshy man, I see it in a new and blinding light.\n\nThere are several moments throughout the play where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the film certainly make up for it. The end is griping, and keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it. At the same time, I cry when the credits roll and long to see Shaq's black face one more time (of course, I will rewind the movie at this point and watch it over again).\n\nOn a final note, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect. This is the epitome of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. The casting is amazing, the special effects are mind-blowingly realistic and stunning, the fully orchestrated soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and amplifies the experience. If I were to put a grade on this, I would have to give it a 9/10, losing a point because of the slight nudity (i'm not the biggest fan, but I won't say no!). But, this is not a movie to be rated, it is a movie to be bought, watched, and enjoyed. Do yourself a big favor and buy this movie, your taste buds will thank you."

Sure it didn't age well(subjective) but I went with the nostalgic factor more than anything. Having my boy there was a bonus.\n\nThe movie is nothing special from kid movies of that era. I also enjoyed movies like The 3 Little Ninjas when I was a young, which seem ridiculous today but I'm not hating up on them because they worked for that time. Way worse movies you could compare it with. Watch it for the fun of it, it's really not that bad."

Lenny Henry makes a much better genie than Shaq, though. I can't believe the casting for this film. Shaq should learn that sportsmen don't make actors. Just look at Frank Bruno. And what is it with Francis Capra? I had to kick the telly over every time he came on, he is that annoying. Who else thinks it's ironic that 'Capra' is latin for goat. Well, Francis and Shaq can be proud of this one. Like Frank Bruno can be proud of his acting. As far as films go, this one smells 'like a hippopotamus butt'. And we're talking one smelly hippo.

Besides, anything with Francis Capra can't be all bad, just look at his work on Veronica Mars! Capra was a really cute kid and I found my own son could relate to him as he came across warm and accessible. As For O'Neal, this is a similar role as he played in Steel. If you saw one movie, you saw his style in the other. There is a reason Basketball pay him so much and he'll follow yo that career with one in Law Enforcement, but if you need a big friendly guy for a fantasy movie, he will be your ticket!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The good thing about watching movies years after they come out is that you can form a nuanced opinion without the influence of the cultural reception at the time. Watching Kazaam taught me that there's nothing nuanced about how terrible this movie is. You heard it was bad. I heard it was bad. We can now agree that there's nothing clouding our judgment.\n\nThis movie reeks of the decade it was made in. Physically-incapable-of-acting basketball star Shaq is the title character, a genie that lives in a boombox. The protagonist of the movie is Max, a bratty kid that finds Kazaam in an abandoned building. We're supposed to sympathize with Max because he's bullied, but he's such a little jerk that it's actually cathartic to watch him get bullied. Kazaam and Max make an unlikely pair, not just because a 7 foot tall black man follows a little white boy around New York like a lost puppy, but also because Kazaam wants to go through the three wishes to gain his freedom (and hopefully get far, far away from this kid), and Max, in a completely realistic and tightly written portrayal of the selfish child that he is, decides that he doesn't want to use any of the magic wishes his genie is begging him to make.\n\nThe \"plot\" of the film revolves around Max learning that his mother lied to him all these years and that his father actually lives in the city, so he goes off to see his father for the first time in however many years (Kazaam is along for the ride). He's crushed to find out that his dad is a total sleazebag (like father like son) music executive and eventually it's up to Kazaam to use his miraculous powers not to end poverty, war or world hunger but to mend this broken white family. There's another sleazebag that figures out Kazaam is a genie and plots to steal him out from under Max.\n\nIf you found Shaq's non-acting to be distressing, prepare yourself for the trauma that is his rapping. This movie fails in just about every conceivable way. A story about a kid and his genie should be pretty straightforward but somehow, most of the characters are unlikable, the plot is dull and predictable, and I'll sound like a broken record if I keep talking about the acting. Space Jam, this is not."

        "review_detailed_main": "This isn't as much of a film as it is a giant promotional campaign by Touchstone Pictures to market the NBA's worst free thrower with his extraordinary height. Not only is this obviously forever trapped in a time capsule set to 1996, but everything in this film is done so bad that it's completely laughable.\n\nIf I had a handful of cardboard cutouts, they would be far more dimensional than any of the people that acted in this film. It's obvious that Shaq not only fails at free throws, rapping and being a video game character, but his acting is absolutely dreadful. He's a \"rapping\" (actually a RHYMING) genie that moved into a boombox and is summoned when a boy named Max (played by a young Francis Capra) stumbles upon him after being chased by bullies. Throughout the movie, Shaq becomes a subject of slavery as Max owns him until his three wishes are granted. That's pretty much the whole plot, unless you're actually going to include a meaningless subplot about \"finding the true father\".\n\nIt doesn't get any better from there. Shaq demonstrates his mad rapping skills by appearing at a night club where he becomes a selected guest. Guess how fast Theodor Geisel was spinning in his grave when he brought forth the detestable line of \"Let's green egg and ham it!\" Probably around the same speed that would also be brought forth by those two live action adaptations that shall not be named.\n\nThen there's some phenomenal acting. I'm talking about the magical french toast. That performance was far more convincing than anything you could expect Shaq to give us. Too bad this film killed its career.\n\nSpeaking of career killers, ever noticed what happened to Paul Michael Glaser after he directed this film? It's a long story.\n\nGranted, it's not one of THE worst things I have ever seen, but it's very close. Kazaam is proof that pitching a non actor as a main character usually does not give satisfactory results. With all this time wasted in the production of this film, I bet Shaq could have gotten some more practice at free throws. The most shocking thing about this? Shaq actually got ANOTHER lead role a year later, but that's a whole different story subject."

Whoever disses this movie is an un-gangster weirdo who I assume smells funky. Yo me and my sizzles were like yo this movie gansta. I was like I gotta write to Shaq make a sequel bro!!! I call it Kabaam, or Jumanji I haven't decided either one is gansta. I also came up with a really gansta rap: Yo Yo Yo im a gangster, My name Kazaam, Shazaam, Babaam yo yo yo gansta."

It is a great family movie to watch. I loved this movie when i was young and i would still watch it today if i saw it on T.V. I love the plot, the humors and the actors in this movie. It is very entertaining for young kids and will keep them interested in the t.v. screen. I recommend watching this movie with your kids for a great family bonding time. It is cute and meaningful and might teach your children a thing or two. If your children are 10 or younger, they will definitely like it."

Personally, giving the overall movie a rating of 2.6 is a little harsh, don't ya think? It wasn't that bad, but then again I tend to enjoy ALL movies and I only know of a few that was a waste of film! It all depends on the viewer and their perspective of things. Im an artist so naturally I'm a little more open minded when it comes to judging things, but honestly, what did you TRULY expect from this movie? What would YOU have done differently? This is a general question. For me, once you can answer that, then you'll see how ridiculous panning this movie is.lol ^_^"

He can give him junk food to the ceiling though. I'm not allowed to spell shack the traditional way it is spelled. wait I'm not allowed to put spiteful remarks? remember when shack did that caramel crunch commercial? it is pretty much an hour and a half of that. that still means that I really like it. well all and all it was a great movie that I saw right when it went straight to video. shaq is really tall and i look foreword to still owning this DVD.

It may not be the best movie ever made (it isn't by far), but it is very enjoyable to watch. Shaq did have a few rap records that many enjoyed. This movie is a lot about his rapping and the catchy rhymes make it all worth-while. I recommend it to any Shaq fan who is up for a laugh. It is also a great movie for little kids as it actually does teach a lesson. I thought Shaq did alright acting. He had another role in an even better film by the name of Blue Chips starring Nick Nolte. His role was rather limited but all in all some decent acting from an athlete."

Think about it; the acting was definitely above par for such a film, the direction was great, and the musical score was beautiful. It was subtle enough that I could hardly notice it but left me tapping my feet noticeably from the for the entire film.\n\nI love this film, always have and most certainly always will. It might not be The Godfather and it might not be Titanic but it is definitely not one of the 100 worst movies of all time. To place this piece of work there is dishonest and over all wrong! Enjoy this fantastic family movie."

I'm just puzzled to why he had such a short notable acting career, then again he did play 15+ seasons in the NBA so he never really quit acting...

When Mr. Henry Spencer saw his child for the first time i cried. Some of my friends watched this movie with aww when i should six sense. They really like bruce willis. Bruce willis was dead the whole time. *sorry for spoiling*. Bruce willis was also very good in die hard. That movie gets a 7/10 because the title does not make sense cause he survives and does not as the title says die hard. Or maybe it does because the villains do die hard so i guess in that way its really up to to viwer interpretation on weather the title makes sense, so ill leave that up to you to explore. Now back to kazam. The moment i heard shaqs complex line delivery using the technique known as \"yelling every single line\" i knew this movie was a masterpiece. What did his movie teach me? Well, my father wasnt a very prominent part of my life, so shaq really served as sort of a father figure to me. This movie taught me that its ok to not have a dad, as long as theres someone like rap god b-ballin genie shaq to fill that role. \"I am kazam\""
