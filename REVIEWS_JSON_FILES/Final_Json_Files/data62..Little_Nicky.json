Roasted upon its release as one of the worst films of all time Little Nicky turns out to be an okay comedy. Actually this is the kind of movie that has all of the ingredients to be a screamingly funny comedy, but somehow things don't work.\n\nNicky, the son of the devil and an angel is sent to make his way in the world while one of his many brothers tries to take throne of Hell from their father. Casting everyone from Harvey Keitel to Rodney Dangerfield this is a film that fits into the Adam Sandler universe since several characters from some of his other films appear. Its a film that on star power alone should work, but it never catches fire. Sure there are laughs but on the whole nothing ever hangs together to form a full movie. I've seen the film several times and can't figure out what went wrong. Even Adam Sandler as Nicky, in one of the worst portrayals in screen history, isn't the reason this doesn't work. There is something else, some other reason.\n\nStill its worth seeing if you like okay comedies. It never scales the heights its ideas and bits say it should be reaching. If its on try it and see if its for you, you certainly could do worse."

For some reason it's panned over other far worse ones he's churned out of the gumball machine (ever re-watch Billy Madison? What the hell were we/they thinking back then?), but when you part the curtains of Sandler Stigma\u0099 and really just look at what the movie is in itself, it's a hoot. What other film can boast Rodney Dangerfield playing Harvey Keitel's dad in heell? That's right, Keitel is the red beast himself, coming down off a ten thousand year unholy monarchy, with no plans to retire. This infuriates his two wicked sons, played by Tiny Lister (must have been a different devil-mom) and a slick Rhys Ifans. They depart the inferno and set up their own devilish franchise up in New York City, raising all kinds of hell, the most amusing of which is lowering the drinking age to ten (where were these guys when I was that age?) and forcing Regis Philbin to say naughty things on live primetime. Their younger, slightly retarded brother Nicky (Sandler) must pursue them on their haunts and trap them in a magic flask before it's too late. Dumb concept, right? Sure it is, but try and tell me it's not hilarious m, especially with the amount of inane visual gags and trippy production design these folks have dreamed up. Between Hitler dressed as a slutty maid getting a pineapple repeatedly rammed up his rectum to a giant gorilla massaging mammaries that have sprouted on a dude's head like fleshy succulent pigtails, there's no shortage of wtf moments. Sander picks an odd character mask as usual, sporting a metal-head swoosh of a haircut and lisping his way through his lines sounding like he had a stroke from watching Billy Madison dailies one too many times. Patricia Arquette is in it, as a sweet, shy girl he meets topside and the closest thing to a sane person you'll find in this madhouse. Cameos abound, from usual Sandler cronies like Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, Peter Dante and Allen Covert, to randoms like Michael McKean, Clint Howard, Laura Harring, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osborne, Reese Witherspoon as Nicky's angelic mom and Quentin Tarantino as a blind preacher. I don't really know what else to say about the thing, because its it's own thing and you either rock out with it, or you don't. Visually it's never boring, the script was conceived in the toilet and jumped straight to the gutter, the performances are all garishly obnoxious and the overall tone is that of an sixth grade birthday party gone rogue."

Based on the previews I've seen and what I've heard, I believe he's made worse films than this, but luckily I didn't waste my time with any of those. This is his worst film that I've seen.\n\nThe story is predictable and dull. They only focus on the jokes here, as it is one of those very low comedy type of movies. Those can be entertaining at times, but this one was not. The jokes are not even funny! I don't remember laughing a single time. It's all just a bunch of bad jokes, one after another, in an almost incomprehensibly bad movie. Far too over the top for me. Do not recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first watched this movie, I was cracking up! And it was one of those incidents in which I was in a crowded theater where I was pretty much the ONLY one laughing at most of the gags! It wasn't exactly embarrassing, but kind of weird. Then again, most of the people that came to see it were mothers and fathers with little children. Please ignore the PG-13 rating--this is NOT a movie for the young ones! I think anyone who has seen Sandler's previous films should know that by now. His sense of humor may be immature, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate for little eyes to see.\n\nI watched this movie again, after I bought the DVD. First of all, I was impressed to discover the cool Easter eggs! It's actually the first DVD to be presented in InfiniFilm. But since it was used as an Easter egg, it wasn't credited as the first InfiniFilm feature. Well, as I learned a lot more about the behind-the-scenes work on this movie; mostly involving special effects, makeup, costume and set design; I gained a better respect for those who were responsible for making \"Little Nicky.\" I thought of it as more than a shallow comedy. It's obvious that the producers of Sandler's previous films didn't have to bend over backwards to produce any flashy effects--in fact, most of them were made on a modest budget.\n\nHowever, the laughs faded away a little. Since this is a silly, superficial comedy, don't expect to pick up on any subtle humor that you might've missed the first time around. I always found Sandler's schtick very silly and meaningless. But he's one of those guys who can make me laugh at things for no apparent reason. Almost as if I'm laughing AT him. I've seen \"Billy Madison\" countless times and I still roll with laughter every time. But with \"Little Nicky\" most of the jokes that I found silly-funny on my initial viewing were just silly on my second.\n\nOne thing to anticipate is a stellar cast. You'll be surprised at the kind of celebrities that pop up in the cameos. Some of the big-name stars include Harvey Keitel, Patricia Arquette, Quentin Tarantino, Reese Witherspoon and (my personal hero) Rodney Dangerfield! And that's just to name a few. It would also help if you've seen Sandler's past films, especially in one particular scene with one of our mystery cameos. You'll be treated to a great inside joke. And of course, expect to see many of Sandler's regulars including Allen Covert, Clint Howard, Peter Dante, Blake Clark and Jon Lovitz.\n\n\"Little Nicky\" is not a thoughtful piece and will probably do nothing to contribute to mankind. But it's a very funny comedy that I simply advise you don't watch over and over again. You'll enjoy it a lot the first time! Of course, the DVD has some really cool features, so if anything pick that up.\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The unwritten law from the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy, is Play It Straight and They Will Laugh; and Woody Allen will tell you that Less is More. Unfortunately, neither Stiller nor Allen were involved with this movie, which in the final analysis, is much `less.' As in `witless,' `tasteless' and `humorless.' Oh, it'll make you laugh at times, but you'll hate yourself in the morning for it. Simply put, in regards to credible comedy, `Little Nicky,' directed by Steven Brill, comes in somewhere near the bottom of the food chain, cinematically speaking. One of the running gags in this film has Nicky responding metaphorically to whomever, when they ask where he comes from, `The south-- the \u0091deep' south--' Which is somehow ironic, because that's exactly where this kind of humor seemingly originates, and belongs.\n\nSatan (Harvey Keitel) has come to the end of his ten-thousand year reign in Hell, and has called together his three sons, Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom `Tiny' Lister Jr.) and Little Nicky (Adam Sandler), to announce which of the three he has chosen to succeed him as ruler of the Nether world for the next ten-thousand years. Suffice to say that his decision is not well received by the boys, however-- at least not by Adrian and Cassius, who rebel by bolting from this most southern of regions to take up residence in the topside world of the mortals, the souls of whom it is their inherent duty to corrupt. But in so doing, they inadvertently freeze the fire at the gates of Hell, rendering them impassable to all the fallen souls who would enter there; and so it is destined to remain until the two return, which they are not likely to do of their own accord. The situation quickly takes it's toll on the health of Satan, who in his suddenly weakened state is unable to pursue the errant pair himself, and since only a spawn of Satan can match up to another spawn of Satan, the job falls to Little Nicky-- the only other one around who meets the criteria-- who is summarily dispatched to earth to collect his brothers and bring them back down to Hell, whereupon the fire will be rekindled, the gates reopened, and all will once again be...well...'bad.' It's a tough assignment, though, as Nicky's brothers have the ability to possess anyone in the world they so choose, which will make identifying them something of a problem. Not to worry, however; Satan is providing some help for Nicky-- a dog named Mr. Beefy (voice of Robert Smigel), who has experience among the mortals, and will be able to help Nicky negotiate what to him will be virgin territory. And with that, Nicky is off on his quest-- and the laughs begin. Not!\n\nThe story itself is a flight of fancy, a fantasy, which on paper at any rate probably had some possibilities; if only it had been placed in more capable hands. Brill was given a golden opportunity to deliver a movie with some real snap and zing to it, but he dropped the ball, big time, and instead presents the material with little imagination, and the result is a very basic what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of film. There's just nothing beneath the surface at all. Sure, it's a comedy (and that's debatable), but even a film that's not supposed to be taken seriously has to have some substance to it, and this one does not. It almost seems as if Brill approached the project with the attitude that Adam Sandler's presence, alone, would make whatever he put up on the screen work. Bad miscalculation. Scenes that could have been clever, or at least mined for some real humor, are for the most part simply crude, and in most cases lack any redeeming merit whatsoever. His biggest mistake, though, was putting all his eggs in one basket by expecting Sandler to carry the day (and the film) just by showing up. He apparently didn't understand that Sandler is an actor who needs a director who can keep him on task-- he needs direction, and plenty of it-- and he didn't get it from Brill.\n\nSandler has been better-- much better; as Robbie, in `The Wedding Singer,' for instance, or even as Bobby, in `The Waterboy.' Both films in which he created a character that was at least credible or viable within the context of the story. But his `Nicky' just doesn't get the job done, because he fails to even really create a character at all, but instead `plays at' creating a character, which is something else entirely. Someone-- and the most likely suspect would be Brill-- should have told him that merely contorting his face and exaggerating the perpetually pubescent whine in his voice is not what it takes to `create' a real character. And, regardless of the genre in which the actor is playing, it's absolutely essential that the character he presents is real and believable within the environment and the setting of the story. If he's playing a devil in Hell, that devil had better be real, or it's simply not going to work; and this film proves it. And lowering the bar to go after cheap laughs can't save it, either.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Rodney Dangerfield (Lucifer), Patricia Arquette (Valerie), Peter Dante (Peter), Jonathan Loughran (John), Dana Carvey (Referee), Jon Lovitz (Peeper), Kevin Nealon (Gatekeeper), Michael McKean (Chief of Police), Quentin Tarantino (Deacon) and Reese Witherspoon (Holly). A real artist will earn every laugh he gets, and it's genuine; it's something real, and it's worthwhile. This film generates some laughs, to be sure-- but they're not earned, and consequently, they're plastic, and they're disposable. And yes, there IS a difference. Any doubts, just ask Ben Stiller or Woody Allen. Or Steve Martin; or Lucille Ball, Joan Davis, Red Skelton or W.C. Fields. And while you're at it, maybe you can pass on what you learn to Adam Sandler. It may help. 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is about one of the sons of Satan coming to Earth to prevent a disaster of apocalyptic proportions--though why Satan and Nicky would want to prevent this is beyond me.\n\nAdam Sandler is talented and has made some decent films. However, he's also made a lot of crap. For every good film like THE WEDDING SINGER or THE WATERBOY, he's made lame films like an unnecessary remake like MR. DEEDS (with Sandler having the nerve to try to replicate a film classic that starred the great Gary Cooper) as well as LITTLE NICKY. Sure, there are a few films that fall towards the middle (CLICK comes to mind), but in general his films tend to either be very good or very, very bad. I am a high school teacher and can tell you that most kids seem to like all of Sandler's films, but if he ever wants to address a wider audience or be seen as an artist and not a buffoon, a few more films like LITTLE NICKY will kill these dreams forever! Of course, he's richer than the Pope, so perhaps he doesn't mind that he often makes crap.\n\nWhy is LITTLE NICKY so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that is just isn't very funny and often substitutes dirty and smarmy material for real laughs. While making a comedy about Satan and Hell is already a tough job, it could have come off much, much better (such as the case of BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY). Here, it just seems like a film written by 7 year-olds--the sort of kids that might find Bevis and Butthead's humor a bit too sophisticated and cerebral!! Crude jokes (such as an obnoxious and sexually obsessed dog as well as a scene where demons shove pineapples into Hitler's rectum) almost always fall flat and at almost no time does the script head towards the clever or the funny. It's just crude and nasty.\n\nLow, stupid and completely without value. Heaven help us, a lot of people amazingly think this is a GOOD film!! Look at all the people who actually gave this crud a score of 10 and act as if it's comparable to films such as GONE WITH THE WIND or DR. STRANGELOVE!!! This is ample evidence that, in general, people are stupid and will pay to see anything! In addition, the fact that people like this is proof that the predictions in the film IDIOCRACY aren't too far from true today!\n\nBy the way, you might find it very interesting to look at the statistics for the ratings. About as many people loved it as hated it. However, if you look by demographics such as age, you'll see that the older you get, the more likely you'll hate the film. I am now 44, so I can't imagine hating this film even more when I am in my 60s! In addition, the top reviewers on IMDb and IMDb staff rate the film significantly lower than the general public."

It was like the creators of the movie stayed up way too late dreaming up ways to make this character pathetic.\n\nThis might have been an ok movie, but every time Sandler's character came into a scene (most scenes), I just cringed by the pathetic overacting. After seeing this movie, I hated Sandler for a while until I recalled him in The Water Boy, a movie I enjoyed. It wasn't Sandler so much as the incredibly stupid way he was directed and how his character was designed.\n\nThere was a lot to like about the movie otherwise, but that character kept coming in so often, that the overall enjoyment of the movie was completely ruined.\n\nI guess you might like Little Nickey if you enjoy the sights and sounds of a shivering miniature poodle that won't stop whining and barking for a second. On second thought the poodle isn't as obnoxious.\n\nWords fail me. This movie totally stank thanks to that one character."

Sandler, while acceptable in just about all his other movies to this date (excluding that one where he's on a boat.), he's f*cking terrible in this. No words can explain how bad his performance is, its shallow, its half-a*sed, its not funny, its just ridiculously awful. To quote another disappointing movie, the ringer, 'I've seen better acting in porno'. As a whole, the supporting cast is also terrible. Nicky's sidekick i guess you'd say is a talking pit-bull glances at a doorstep that says 'i love acting' on it, he pis*es on it and says 'you love acting, well i love pis*ing', and to make matters even more mind numbingly awful the pis* is cgi'd obviously. Oh thats the next thing, the effects and production. This paragraphs dedicated to acting so let me get back on track. Usual members from the happy Madison gang are here, i've spotted like 4 people that are also in grandmas boy, and other crap flicks like the animal and Mr deeds and crap. Performances are half a*sed too, at most times secondary actor just read a line or two devoid of emotion or any form of acting. One standout role though is Quinton Tarantinos cameo as a blind preacher who appears about 3 times, other then that, nothing.\n\nThe production is awful. Hell looks, for lack of a better and less offensive term, retarded. There is around 3 sets I've noticed. Nickys room, the entrance to hell, and the (INSANELY BOTCHED) throne. Nicky's room is literally covered in stickers of heavy metal bands, problem is, i counted like over 9000 Ozzy stickers and one big metallica one, obviously the set designers know nothing about metal, nor the crew/cast. The throne is just like a mass hall, except the size of a small house basement, there's nothing that resembles artistic detail at all, it'd pass for a normal room to me. the gates also stupid, there's some rock like walls and a cheap frozen fire effect for the gate it self, no effort seemed to be used. the sad thing is, the gate is easily the most used. The rest of the sets on earth are one apartment room, a basketball stadium thing(I'm not a sports fan.), a park shoot, and the rest is all sidewalks. Oh yeah hell breaks loose by the end, and the sets turn into cgi awfulness, its so awful that by that point i went on my laptop and started chatting. The CGI is as awful as you'd expect from 1999/2000, but...its used throughout the whole movie. in fact all the special effects in the movie were cgi i noticed, of abysmal quality.\n\nLast thing i'm going to rant about is the script, 'What we're they thinking!?' - avgn. Its a comedy, to be a 'good' comedy, it has to be funny. Unfortantly it isn't, its like a stream of half baked jokes like Nicky spinning his head around to entertain his friends (Oh he's doing the exorcist thing, thats pure comedy.), and Satan sticking a pineapple up Hitler's a*s. At a glance, you'r still likely to ask to your self, 'whats the point.'. The plot it self is rubbish. If two brothers out of hell for some reason make the devil have 'a week' to live, wouldn't another one shorten his life span even more thus making his coming to earth a bad idea. The brothers deceiving the humans is also like 'wut?'. They possess a minister and tell everyone 'let the Sin, be-Gin', to which a completely packed church gets out of their seat and everyone starts cheering. Yeah, thats very likely to happen. These parts are somewhat spaced out, because until like the last 20 minutes, Nicky does nothing but walk around, and do nothing. None of the jokes are funny, the plot is literally insane, its lost in its own continuity also.\n\ni'm not going to spell check this review cause i feel that the movie sucked so bad that it's not worth the time of what i've already written. It sucks, it sucks even on a Adam Sander level. Its not funny, its not entertaining, its just downright lame. Bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad production, bad just about everything. To the mind of a child, its acceptable, but for a audience over 12 (The movies rated pg13 by the way.), its damn near worth destroying. I wouldn't watch this movie again if i were paid too, even for a million, i'd rather have my dignity."

From the sarcastic dog's snoring to the Chicago record to Quentin Tarantino's blind preacher, it's got plenty of proper laughs. Yes, it's crude, but it's clearly not made to be sophisticated - the special effects are terrible and Adam Sandler is at his cheesiest best. That's what gives this movie its charm - the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nLet's not forget the soundtrack - personally, I think it's probably one of the most awesome out there - with everything from P.O.D to AC/DC, Foo Fighters/Dave Grohl, Scorpions, Van Halen and more.\n\nGo into this movie with high expectations & a view that everything has to have the utmost artistic integrity, special effects and the best acting and you'll be bitterly disappointed. Watch it with an open mind for silly, dark comedy and b-grade charm and you'll probably be pleasantly surprised!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a great film and one of the best films of the year, contrary to what so many others say. This is the second most underrated & unappreciated movie of 2000, following Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2. There is nothing to not like about this movie, it is virtually non-stop laughs from beginning to end.\n\nReading some other user's reviews I'm stunned at their disdain and hatred for this great film. People always say that this is no Citizen Kane...well duh...to quote Highlander \"There can be only one!\". Now I'm not saying that this movie is in the same league as Citizen Kane, but that doesn't mean it's bad. This is an epic Sandler piece, and his funniest to date, and is quite possibly the definitive Sandler film.\n\nUnlike most people, I loathed Big Daddy, writing it off as cheesy and overly sentimental; a one-joke gag stretched beyond its limits. Luckily that does not apply to this film, every aspect of this film is great, from the surprise cameo by \"CHUBS\" (Carl Weathers) to Harvey Keitel's hilarious turn as Papa Satan. You've gotta love a movie that lets Quentin Tarantino use his \"unique\" acting \"ability\" to his advantage in a brilliant performance as the religious zealot. My favorite cameo belongs to B-Movie God Clint Howard...after this movie, I don't think I'll ever look at him the same way again! The Cameos are worth the ticket price alone!\n\nThe story was top-notch and was brilliantly executed. This film definitely shows maturity in Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy's writing abilities, as they created a complex and involving storyline, and great and hilarious characters.\n\nI recommend this film to any film fans. Give this one a shot, regardless of your personal view of Sandler and his talent. Sandler is one of the most underrated and ridiculed acts out there today, which is sad considering his remarkable talent. How many other performers out there today write, produce, and star in their own films?\n\nI give this one * * * * * * out of * * * * *"

It has no funny moments, Sandler makes a complete fool of himself and they even take the time to rip off Sandler's masterpiece \"Happy Gilmore\" in an admittedly clever cameo by Carl Weathers.\n\nBut the biggest sin of all is the wasted and I do mean WASTED all-star cast that includes everyone from Ozzy Osbourne to Rodney Dangerfield. How in the world did anyone associated with the making of this bomb think that this would be funny, let alone watchable? Sandler is a good actor although I do consider him an acquired tastes and this is definitely not his finest hour. Another problem is that the film looks incredibly ugly. The set design looks like the love den of a Ridley Scott/Tim Burton enthusiast.

It's the sort of movie that you only see if you're ready for sheer goofy nonsense. As it was, this was one of several devil-related movies released in 2000, although the \"Exorcist\" re-release was the only other one worth seeing. Also starring Patricia Arquette, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealon, Reese Witherspoon, and Henry Winkler."

Maybe I was looking for what it is people rave about with all Adam Sandler films; I guess I just couldn't really come to terms with the simple fact that this is not good entertainment. It's not even bad entertainment. Heck, I don't think it can be classified as 'entertainment', period. The film has so many flaws that even the most anal-retentive viewers finally tire off counting them. Early in the film, two of Satan's sons decide to go up on earth, upon learning that neither of them will be the devil in the next 10.000 years. What I'm wondering is, did this never happen before? Didn't they even consider the possibility of it? Satan is the epitome of all things evil, wouldn't he be smart enough to know that his own sons might pull a fast one like that? The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. The acting is about as flat as a pancake that has been run over by several trucks. The characters are cardboard cutouts who spout clich\u00e9 lines. The humor is juvenile, consisting of lame slapstick and childish gross-out comedy. The script seems like it could have been written by a child, which is no surprise, seeing as how Sandler penned some of it himself. You want a good laugh? See a good comedy. You want to spend the 90 minutes of your life you might waste on this movie wisely? Go watch a good movie. Or even one that is slightly better than this. Won't be hard to find. Simply put: You want entertainment? Look elsewhere. I recommend this only to hardcore Adam Sandler fans, as no one else could possibly enjoy it. 1/10"

In my opinion he is among the best comedy actors of the 1990s-2000s despite some poor choices. And this, despite not among his best work, it's also enjoyable.\n\nThis movie is about the devil (played by veteran Harvey Keitel) that sends his younger son (Sandler) for taking back his two brothers to hell. He has to go to New York and in the meanwhile he meets his mother (an angel played by Reese Whiterspoon), he joins a basketball game, goes in and out from various night clubs and it ends in various other funny scenarios.\n\nThis is the plot. While for many according also to the reviews in this site it may seem dumb and low-brow it has also his entertaining factors. Despite Sandler's way of talking and mannerisms are annoying, in the end it made me snicker. Almost all the other actors in the cast (Harvey Keitel, Reese Whiterspoon, Patricia Arquette, Rhys Ifans and even legendary director Quentin Tarantino) have small roles but they are also entertaining. I have to agree with the haters that the humour at times is offensive and in a few fragments a bit gross, but it's not that important in the end.\n\nWorth recommended to all fans of silly comedies and fans of dark humour as well."

You're right! Sandler simply loves the effect a 1 or 2-liner has on an audience! So what else you got? 4) It was extremely well-written. 5) It was pretty scary..no joke! 6) There's a talking bulldog who went out with a sewer rat!\n\nSeriously, watch Little Nicky; it's warm-hearted and a lot funnier than <Big Daddy>.

In one wild night on the weed, the motley crew listen to \"Chicago\" songs backward, while Nicky regales the mortals with his head-twisting feats. Sandler is over the top with his crazed persona, but still hilarious. Rodney Dangerfield also appears in one his last films as Nicky's foul-mouthed grandfather, while Reece Witherspoon makes an unexpected cameo appearance as his angelic mother.\n\nI know a lot of people who've seen this movie don't rate it, but I've always found it - in context - a highly entertaining romp squarely aimed at the adolescent, young adult market and an ideal video accompaniment to a beer and pizza evening."

This is the first time I have gone to a movie and actually become ANGRY watching a comedy. I only thank god I did not pay to see this. And look I am dumbing this movie down on the Adam Sander level. I have not expected much from Adam Sandler movies.. I have NOTHING against the guy.I mean I like Adam Sandler. I just find his movies OK.. but leave it to him to not even reach the absolutely 1 one millionth of an inch bar that has been set. If reaching the bar for this movie was a inch high.. he would be digging under ground for 2 miles.\n\nTrying to describe the movie does not do its futility justice. No words, phrases, interpolative dances or biblical scrawling have yet to be invented to describe the absolute time decaying event that is sitting through this film. I only watched it because I knew that i was truly in the moment of history.. a cinematic event on the level of the Hindenburg crashing.Its seemed as if the four horsemen of the Apocalypse rode through the screen laughing and exalting your every minute as you sat through each frame decaying frame after another. If films had a smell, this film would reek of absolute desolation and despair. If failure had a smell it would be this film. I looked at it in wonder as if why would someone put this train wreck on film..why because we are someone what drawn to human tragedy.. well I cant answer those question.. Biblical scholars and Pyscholgist can better explain the deep corners of the mind that this film tends to attack.\n\nIn closing NO FILM can try to be as bad as little Nicky .. films can only come close to being as bad as this film was. we have hit the Rosetta stone of absolute cinematic failure..And hopefully those of us who have seen it came away without having our eyes bleed and our bodies turned to stone. And for that reason if you want to see the benchmark for futility.. you should see this film.. just so you can know how bad a film can be. Thank god I survived....or did i?"

I sat in a movie theater listening to a teenage audience laugh hysterically at this movie. Come on. The only reason I stuck around to finish the movie is I was listening to that feeling that tells you \"This movie cannot suck any worse, it has to get better.\" Lo and behold, it does not even reach a watchable level. What is funny about a man with breasts on his head? It might have been a little funny when the same sight gag was done in Weird Science. The other thing that I cannot understand would be is this a horror film or a comedy.

It's just that Sandler has so dominant part of the film, that his inability to act more than one character really hangs like an iron ball on the leg of the film.\n\nMaybe most hardcore Sandler fans will like this more than I, but I still can recommend this for at least one viewing so you can make your own mind about the flick. But personally I doubt I'll be adding this on my DVD collection."

Adam Sandler was good in Big Daddy, The Waterboy etc, but this.. this was a huge downer. Actors like Quentin Tarantino, and other well-known characters should be ashamed of having participated in this piece of junk. What a terrible cast this movie had. The whole idea behind the movie, with a sympathic devil in hell and a retarded son thats a nice guy, should have started several alarmbells in my head urging me to not see this movie, but they were obviously all victims to a powerfailure.\n\nThere were hardly any laughs, even you had a 2-seconds laugh now and then. Some punchlines were just so dumb and malplaced that you felt like walking out on this one. And thats my advice to you, if you ever get lost in the city and accidently end up in a theathre showing this movie."

A time when bringing in familiar faces made the viewing experience exiting and fun and not for the sake of a cash cow.\n\nThe lines don't always hit the mark and the dialogue can be pretty cheesy at times but it doesn't tarnish the outcome by any means, there are still some great one liners and funny material to go around.\n\nTo finish off, is this movie a masterpiece? Not at all its pretty far from it, but if you are looking for a laugh and a giggle that comes from a good place this 90 minute comedy is were its at."

It screams for recognition and unfortunately got little to none and perhaps (as his next project has director Paul Thomas Anderson attached) when Adam Sandler pulls a miraculous Jim Carrey 360 into an actual actor of artisitic merit, this will be the overlooked gem. The special fx look crisp and cutting edge. Hell itself is fantastic. the actors give their all with effective comic timing. even non-comedians like harvey keitel. it effectively blended a slight surrealist tinge with some pretty crude and lowbrow humor, which is not an easy task. it also touched on the subject of religion, being satirical without being offensive. make no mistake, the film is no masterpiece. it falls victim to many of the same serious pitfalls that stifle other comedies made by former SNL members. It also overcompensates in an idealistically complex plot that leaves quite a few loopholes that audience members might scratch their heads at. But screw it, movies like this don't win awards anyway and at the very least it shows remarkable potential and growth for the writing time that has spawned the majority of the Sandler-driven movies to date. it has terrific cameos by the likes of dana carvey, henry winkler, regis philbin, etc. the final 20 minutes loses momentum a bit and drags on for a while, but all is rewarded by the end."

I laughed myself silly. This flick is raucously entertaining, but you need to appreciate Sandler's humor, which is an acquired taste, like beer. History will be kind to Sandler I think.

I truly enjoyed \"The Wedding Singer\" and \"Happy Gilmore\", but then, those movies were actually funny! \"Little Nicky\", unlike \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", isn't even unintentionally funny.

        "review_detailed_main": "Why do I say Yeah, Ozzy? Because Ozzy Osbourne made this film. I don't care who wrote it, I don't care who starred in it, and I don't care who directed it, if Ozzy hadn't been in Little Nicky, there would be absolutely no reason to watch it. Even the great Harvey Keitel, who obviously makes an excellent Satan, was ill-used if for no other reason than that idiotic deterioration that left him as nothing but a pair of arms and a mouth. Come on, people! Whose dumbass idea was that?! Anyway, Ozzy's was only one (by far the best one, mind you) of a whole series of cool cameos. We see a whole succession of great cameos in Little Nicky. Ozzy causes every rock and roll fan in the audience to jump up and cheer by biting the head off of the devil when he turns into a bat. Chubbs, Happy Gilmore's late, one-handed golf instructor shows up in a scene in heaven, along with Reese Witherspoon, who effectively plays the part of Little Nicky's angel mother who happens to also be an absolute bimbo. Rodney Dangerfield is his traditional self as the father of Satan (`Even in Hell I get no respect.'). John Lovitz has a scene early in the film where he sits in a tree spying on some woman while she changes, and he's listening to `Lady's Night,' the song that he performed in The Wedding Singer, which was obviously a much better film than this one. Even Dan Marino who, in my opinion, was made famous more by Ace Ventura than anything else, had a great part where he tries to sell his soul to the devil just to win a football game. And, of course, someone was amazingly able to get The Great Quentin Tarantino to play the part of a hideously creepy religious nut, in the second best cameo in the film (even Quentin can't compete with Ozzy). I could go on and on about the cool cameos in this movie.\n\nHow about Little Nicky's room in Hell? What a great room for the son of the devil! Can I say something, by the way? The religious right attacks Marilyn Manson for every little thing he does, but I hereby officially bet any amount of money that no religious group on the planet will ever defend him by pointing out that there was not a single picture or poster of him in Nicky's room in Hell. You have to notice this when you see posters of Metallica, Ozzy (of course), Ministry, Motorhead, Korn, AC/DC, Slipknot, Black Sabbath, etc. No one ever accused Korn of driving kids to worship the devil, yet the devil's son seems to be one of their biggest fans.\n\nThere was a little too much cheesy comedy in this movie. And yes, I realize that it is a `Happy Madison' picture, and that these movies are characterized by their cheesy comedy. But the gigantic pineapple up Hitler was a step in the wrong direction. And how about that damn dog? Remember the scene where he shoots an arrow at Adrian, Nicky's evil brother? Of my GOD, that was ridiculous. And then there were John and Pete, a couple of idiot rock and roll fanatics that appear throughout the film in a series of dumbass scenes that make all rock and roll fans look bad. Although it was cool when one of them asks Nicky what was recorded backwards on Ozzy's record, and Nicky says that `the Blizzard' always delivered his message straight. Too bad they didn't use a Marilyn Manson song to do that, but as much as I respect him and love his music, he doesn't even come close to Ozzy.\n\nLittle Nicky has a lot of cool stuff in it, such as an excellent soundtrack (notice the surprisingly good re-mix of Stupefy, by Disturbed, during the end credits), but most everything else is just pretty bad. And besides that, the soundtrack during the film was used as little more than to pack songs into the movie so that they could sell the soundtrack later, although some of the songs worked really well where they were put into the movie (Particularly Powerman 5000's `When Worlds Collide'). Little Nicky is sent to earth to capture his rebelling older brothers, because they escaped from hell, freezing the entrance and causing their father's deterioration. And then the Son of Satan meets some girl and falls in love with her! Everything about that little subplot was just awful, except for the way that he barely rescued her from the subway train late in the film, but it was actually a good decision to cast Patricia Arquette in this role. Except, remember when Nicky was explaining possession to her? `What do you mean, \u0091possessed?' Come on, Patricia, POSSESSION. Didn't you learn anything from starring in Stigmata?\n\nThe plot of Little Nicky is of no value or interest whatsoever, it's the cameos that make it worth watching. Clearly, there can be no satisfaction derived from watching Adam Sandler's breathy performance as the son of Satan as he `releases the evil' and then `releases the good.' The plot and story are inconsequential, but the movie is still pretty funny at some points, so it's not a complete waste of time. It pays great homage to rock and roll stars as well as previous successful comedies, but if you're not a rock and roll fan or if you haven't seen a lot of these goofy comedies, you are almost sure to be disappointed by Little Nicky."

After watching this movie casually two times (hey, with 5 people in our family we watch a lot of our movies at least two times), I checked out the \"Deleted Scenes\" section on the DVD. Oh my God, WHO EDITED THIS MOVIE??? Yeah, I wouldn't put my hand up EITHER. All I can say is keep your day job because anybody with any sense in the movie industry can see from watching this movie and the deleted scenes that you don't have a CLUE! I couldn't believe how many deleted scenes there were that had us absolutely cracking up laughing -- not only that, but also how many deleted scenes there were total, 21 in all. 3/4 of those scenes were incredibly funny and we kept wondering why they cut them -- they cut their own throats.\n\nAah well, there's nothing we can do about this ... unless I can find the name of the person(s) who did the editing. In short, this movie could have been a pile of laughs, but the laughs all ended up on the cutting room floor (and, thank God, the DVD). The DVD would be worth buying if they worked all those cut scenes back into the movie in an alternate version, but as it is it's not and it barely rates a 7 out of 10 stars."

This movie has great (or at least good) potential as a comedy \u0096 but is ruined by a grating lead performance, poor scriptwriting, and increasingly lame jokes. Worst of all, however, is the totally inept direction \u0096 had the film been delivered to better talent, it could have easily been Adam Sandler's best comedy. It's one of his worst, simply because the amateur handling is similar to that of worse duds like Battlefield Earth. Sandler's Billy Madison wasn't anything special but at least it was adequately made.\n\nNo faults in the cast. With performances and cameos including Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Rodney Dangerfield, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Reese Witherspoon, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Schneider, Michael McKean, Robert Smigel, Regis Philbin and Carl Weathers, the film's flaw is its script \u0096 the talented actors are required to mutter extremely contrived dialogue, and most of the time they do so quite embarrassingly. Watching Keitel is painful \u0096 he's not even trying. You know you're in trouble when a film's best performance is by Quentin Tarantino \u0096 in this case, as a blind preacher who has a habit of injuring himself (every time we see him it's a new brace, bandage, etc.).\n\nThe plot is basically this: titular character 'Little' Nicky (Sandler) is the son of Lucifer (Keitel), whose other two sons leave hell in search of fun 'up north' in New York City. Their journey magically breaks the gates of hell, or something, and as a result this causes the Devil to wither away. Nicky is left as the only possible source of salvation, having to travel north, bring his evil brothers back and save his dying father (how does someone in hell die? Don't ask me.).\n\nThe movie has a few clever gags for movie buffs \u0096 Elephant Man and Scarface references being the best, if not very subtle. The film's problem is that it quickly runs out of steam \u0096 it's a one-trick pony and is only able to sustain its screwball antics for so long until it becomes a chore to sit through.\n\nOne thing I have to give credit to Sandler for is that, although his comedies may not be perfect, most of the time they are somewhat amusing and aren't as commercially sloppy as Little Nicky. By that, I mean that this movie is a by-the-numbers Hollywood product \u0096 it moves from Point A to Point B to Point C, introducing all the typical clich\u00e9s of the genre. Sandler's comedies have always been weak in terms of romantic subplots \u0096 the tacked-on relationship in Happy Gilmore was laughable, and Madison's was even worse. Didn't matter much because the films relied on jokes. Not here. Jokes are rare. The romantic subplot is the worst so far in any of his films \u0096 I felt sorry for Arquette, and I was disturbed by how shallow her character was written. (She meets Nicky \u0096 a muttering, mumbling, evil idiot \u0096 in New York, treats him nice, goes out on a date, and then he swears at her and makes obscene gestures and tells her that he's the spawn of Satan and she gives a cute smile and goes on a magical Satan-powered flight across the city with him. Absolutely pathetic.)\n\nCharacters are handled as throwaways \u0096 Dangerfield's potentially-hilarious performance is watered down and never given full opportunity, showing up once and a while to add a few laughs to a flat sequence. Keitel's performance is weak and Sandler has once again created a grating voice \u0096 Little Nicky sounds just like his geeky character from SNL who would show up on Weekend Updates to give music reports. A better comedian might really find a character to play underneath the surface \u0096 Sandler isn't able to because, to be fair, he isn't much of a comedian. As a result his performance is painfully blunt \u0096 about as subtle as a hammer over the head. Instead of playing a wacky, annoying person in his next movie, why doesn't he just play himself? That's what he's always been good at. There's a reason Happy Gilmore is still his best comedy, and Punch-Drunk Love was so great.\n\nThe gratuitous cameos become almost as annoying as the constant merchandising tie-ins and references (I counted Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Popeye's Chicken, and the television show Felicity, not to mention the rock soundtrack that cuts back and forth to one song after another without using them to any real advantage).\n\nThe cameos? That's Chubbs Peterson from Happy Gilmore ('It's all in the hips!') and Henry Winkler, apparently not reprising his role as the coach from The Waterboy. Those two were fun enough, but the Rob Schneider reprisal is lame \u0096 having the same character show up time and time again to say the same thing ('You can do it!') isn't clever if he's annoying to begin with. The movie is one big Adam Sandler Celebration \u0096 it references Gilmore, Madison, Waterboy, and even lines from the films (having said 'It's all in the hips!' about three times). Then there's the inclusion of characters from Sandler's music CDs \u0096 mainly Whitey the Coach, who is played by Dana Carvey, and who was later voiced by Sandler in the animated flop 8 Crazy Nights.\n\nAll in all the movie tries to be a number of different things and becomes absolutely nothing at all. It wants to be a social and religious satire but is content to stay within the PG-13 guidelines, so it never becomes as raunchy or funny or downright refreshing as Dogma. Kevin Smith is a daring director and is capable of extending the craziest of material into something clever. Steven Brill, the director of Little Nicky, is considerably less talented and as a result his movie \u0096 which similarly moves towards an apocalyptic ending a la Dogma \u0096 becomes a complete and under mess, totally predictable and stupid.\n\nLittle Nicky is a big disappointment."

The cast is good, the premise is creative, and if you're looking for a goofy comedy to sit back and veg out to, then it's a decent watch.\n\nYou won't find anything spectacular here, but it's still a good comedy for what it's worth.

Every awful, poorly written gag and joke comes like a punch in the stomach, and it never relents. I'm almost surprised the film wasn't shelved, but since Adam Sandler is \"hot, hot, hot\" that just wouldn't happen. I was annoyed that the film did such poor box office (before I had seen it), since it seemed as thought Sandler and co. were being punished for trying something new. After seeing it however, I couldn't be happier that it bombed."

Valerie Veran (Patricia Arquette) comes to help him when his magic flask is stolen.\n\nThe basic concept of this movie is actually pretty good and has great comedic possibilities. I almost laugh at times but Adam Sandler's ridiculous performance really hurts the movie. It borders between stupidity which is good and annoying which is bad. That's the movie in a nutshell. I want to laugh at the stupidity but the annoyance keeps me from liking it. There are great actors in this including aging icon Rodney Dangerfield but this is all about Adam Sandler.

Badly written by Sandler, Tim Herlihy & Steven Brill, with the latter directing with a blunt sabre, Little Nicky relies purely on stupid crass jokes for its worth and forgets to put any semblance of a heart in its mix. It does try with its odd and underwritten romance sub-plot {featuring a bemused Patricia Arquette}, but the whole thing exists purely to make stoner's and air heads laugh. It actually looks real nice in HD, and the soundtrack is pretty rocking. While the number of star cameos makes for an interesting {bemusing in a why? sort of way} viewing. But this really is only for those who think that toilet waste and talking dogs are the highest forms of conceptual comedy. The most evil question of all in a film about Satan and his offspring? Is how in the hell did the likes of Harvey Keitel {stepping in after AC/DC axeman Angus Young dropped out} ever agree to be a part of this dirge?\n\nStraight to hell boys, all of you. 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "People are always asking the question if Adam Sandler is a little, how is it said, off his rocker. With the wild CDs he puts out and the zany films he's in, a person could think that he might be crazy. But lately he's been losing his touch. With the success of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy, he's been shying away from the normal Adam Sandler stick that everyone who loves him enjoys to see. Well Adam Sandler fans rejoice because he is back with a vengeance. Little Nicky is the wild and craziest Sandler film I have ever seen. It may not be the best (I think all will agree with me that that title goes to Billy Madison) but it is the edgiest. The plot revolves around the Satan (Harvey Keitel) after a certain amount of years has to pick a new ruler of Hell. He has to choose from his three sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.) and Nicky (Sandler). When he decides to choose himself as the new ruler Adrian and Caussius are livid. They decided to go through the fire of hell backwards and conquer Earth, making it the new Hell. In doing this they are slowly killing Satan, he loses body parts and his power the longer they're on Earth. The only one that can save Earth and Satan is the incompetent and very stupid Nicky. So he goes to Earth to learn how to use his powers and stop his brothers from making Earth the new hell. On the way he meets a cast a characters that is about a mile long. There are so many cameos in this film I lost count. There are many SNL former members (none from the likes of Rock, Spade, or Myers) but there are a very few noticeable one. The comedy is border line on rated R material as there are many gross jokes related on sexual humor, some drug related gags and just some disturbingly funny images. All a person would expect in an Adam Sandler film and more. Sandler pulls off the weird voiced Nicky just like he did Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. He's always the stand out in his film but everyone else pulled off their characters as best as they could. They were all believable. For those Sandler fans who have seen any of his films, that including Happy Gilmore, will get a very funny and enjoy surprise with one of the cameos. Along with the normal Sandler antics the soundtrack is right on the money. Each song goes along with the action on the screen. In the end, Little Nicky is a funny and at times wild comedy from mastermind Adam Sandler. It will gross, gag and grab all at the same time."

Technically the movie's put together fairly shoddily, the plot is far from cohesive, the dialogue's mediocre at best, and yet somehow I got a good handful of laughs despite this. The sheer randomness and ridiculousness of it all keeps you off-balance enough that the occasional good one-liner comes through and can make you chuckle.

His other two sons are p***ed, and go to Earth to wreak havoc. Ahh... but their leaving causes problems and Little Nicky has to get them back before his dad withers away. Nicky comes to earth, discovers Popeye's chicken (damn good mashed potatoes too), and deals with a world he's never been in before.\n\nForget the story, forget the acting. The story here just strings along funny stuff, so don't expect much more. What's different here is Sandler is not his annoying, non-funny self. Look for some good cameos, including a hilarious Ozzy cameo. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously; it's stupid fun and it knows it is and doesn't try to be much more. Some jokes fall flat, but enough work well enough that it's worth seeing if they're showing it on cable. 6/10"

And now, we have Sandler not as low budget which is fine, but it is slightly dropped down this time from those classics.\n\nNot that I'm saying this film is not a must see, far from it. Sandler here plays one of his most difficult roles as half satan/half angel (Satan played by well choiced pick Harvey Keitel and angel played by Reese Witherspoon) who must stop his bad brothers (Tiny Zeus Lister and Rhys Ifans) from controlling earth, but only by mastering his powers. Dumb plot, damn right, one of the dumbest. But it is risen from that much by spots of drop dead hilarity and other ones that bring out chuckles. Overall, goody good, though it is no comic treasure.\n\nOne thing more, the thing that makes this film goody good is the small parts and cameos including: Rodney Dangerfield (Lucifer in his hilarious role), Rob Schnieder, Clint Howard, Henry Winkler, Robert Smigel, Ozzy Osbourne, Carl Weathers (back again in dead-pan funny Chubbs), Jon Lovitz, Kevion Nealon, Dana Carvey (so many SNL stars), Allen Cobert, Michael McKean and in the biggest (and funniest) surprise of the film, Quentin Tarantino as the blind preist (by the way, love the inclusion of Chris Farley into heaven).

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie, with its low-rent effects and terrible production values, should have been horrible. Well, I'm part of the minority that thinks that this movie was neither really good nor bad; it was funny, and as far as I'm usually concerned, that alone makes a comedy worth watching. But the production values, direction, editing, dialogue, etc were not very good, and people have a right to not like a movie with problems like these.\n\nSo what was good about it? It was just a lot of fun, the way bad movies sometimes can be. The cast is top-notch; even heavyweights like Harvey Keitel (as the devil, and he did a superb job), Patricia Arquette, and Reese Witherspoon (hilarious as a valley girl angel) seem to be having a great time here. The regulars from other Adam Sandler movies are also entertaining, and the cast is rounded out by a veritable who's who of comedy talent, like Jon Lovits, Rodney Dangerfield (basically doing his usual schtick as Lucifer, the devil's father), Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, George Wallace, Michael McKean, Ellen Cleghorne, Clint Howard... sure most of these people are washed up, but who cares? They're still funny; Jon Lovits in particular shows how good he is in these small parts (something he's done many times in the past). Robert Smigel is also good as the voice of Beefy the dog. Rounding it out are Rhys Ifans (who I'm not really familiar with) and Tiny Lister (inspired casting!) as Nicky's brothers, a host of cameos, many of whom play themselves (Regis and Ozzy are hilarious, and Henry Winkler and Carl Weathers appear, referencing older Adam Sandler movies), and of course Sandler himself as Little Nicky, the devil's nicer son. As I said before, the cast is great; they seem to be having a really good time, and they are really what make the movie worth watching. You can forgive the movie the bad dialogue and poor production values if it's this funny.\n\nI think above all, it's important to just try not to take the movie so seriously. Although the dialogue is bad, the one-liners are often hilarious, and although the production values are bad, the sight gags are often hilarious. So enjoy the movie for what it is: an entertaining, if not well-done, piece of fluff, along the lines of, say, Cheech and Chong, not up to the quality of Sandler's other movies (and I stand by that, I think there is real quality in movies like \"The Wedding Singer\" or \"Happy Gilmore\" or even \"The Waterboy\"), but still pretty damn funny in it's own right."

The story is similar in this, built on the typical heroes journey, but with a twist. The actors are pretty good too, everyone bringing their part, each pretty unique from each other, the play is pretty good.\n\nI think some of the best is the customs and the design, the set. Hell is colorful, bright red and black, heaven is white, but the middle ground is concrete grey, city brown, and the park. A very nice change for the eye inbetween sets. Someone built this really well.\n\nOverall I like this movie, because it does not have great expectations. It's just simple, light jokes. I often watch movies in english, instead of dub, and complex jokes either fall flat on their face, because it's just not funny for me, too much effort for a little turn, or I don't even understand how it was supposed to be funny. Not in this case. It's clean, and understandable. It's not over-over-pulled like most american jokes are.\n\nI liked this movie a lot."

Despite a handsome production full of expensive CGI effects, big set pieces, and surprise guests in cameos, this Adam Sandler vehicle has no new jokes and plenty of obvious targets. Even with the large budget and a strong supporting cast, Sandler still can't shake off the doldrums and give us a comic performance he believes in. \"Little Nicky\" backs itself into a hoary corner, winding up with a showdown between evil and not-so-evil that raises not a single chuckle.

Sandler's worst movie; even though he's never going to make a Citizen Kane, that still says a lot.

        "review_detailed_main": "Little Nicky seems almost like the last film Adam Sandler is going to make. Various characters from his previous films pop up in the appropriate and inappropriate places. His usual mix of gross out humor and sweet natured humor is slightly askew, in favor of the gross out humor. And having two other screenwriters helping him on the script didn't really go over as well as his usual tandem of writers. Still, the film does make you laugh when you shouldn't and the depiction of hell is a lot more amusing than in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.\n\nMaybe Sandler wants to grow up. Maybe he wants to do something different. Either way, don't expect him to do Shakespeare for a while.\n\nAdam Sandler's Nicky was a promising character. He's the son of the devil who just isn't evil enough. When Dad decides to extend his reign over the underworld for another 10,000 years, Nicky's two older brothers don't like the idea. So they close the gates of hell and make Manhattan the new Hades. Nicky, of course, has to bring them back to save dear old dad. Hilarity ensues.\n\nThe rest of the cast, Patricia Arquette as the love interest, Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer, Clint Howard as the gatekeeper, add some amusing bits to the scenery. Arquette is probably the only actress around that can look pretty in the grotesque sense. And the various cameos from SNL regulars (not to mention a few surprises) can either be amusing or stupid. Still, Adam's fans will eat this one up. The curious should spend no more than matinee prices. But those who know that they want to see it will."

Or that it looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, had a clumsy soundtrack, poor pacing and worst of all the unforgivable waste of actors such as Harvey Keitel, Michael McKean and Rhys Ifans? Adam Sandler is at his most unlikeable here too, doing nothing but moronic schtick that we have seen many times before and better.

The film stars Adam Sandler as Nicky, the youngest son of Satan, who is sent to Earth on a mission to prevent his two older brothers from taking over Hell and wreaking havoc on both the underworld and the mortal world.\n\nNicky is an awkward and kind-hearted character who struggles to fit in among humans due to his demonic appearance and powers. Despite his shortcomings, Nicky is determined to fulfill his father's wishes and save both realms.\n\nThe film is filled with slapstick humor, crude jokes, and over-the-top characters, typical of Adam Sandler's comedic style. It features a star-studded cast including Harvey Keitel as Satan, Patricia Arquette as Nicky's love interest, and Rhys Ifans and Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr. As Nicky's brothers.\n\nWhile \"Little Nicky\" received mixed reviews from critics, it has since gained a cult following for its absurd humor and memorable moments. Fans of Adam Sandler's brand of comedy are likely to enjoy the film's quirky characters and offbeat storyline.\n\nOverall, \"Little Nicky\" is a fun and entertaining comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a lighthearted romp through the underworld with plenty of laughs along the way."

It's no wonder why despite an a-list cast, including Adam Sandler, Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, and Rodney Dangerfield, memorable cameos, like Ozzy Osbourne!!, one effed up plot, and not to mention Adam Sandler (did I mention Adam Sandler?) this movie was called one of the worst films of the year. However, today is Comedy Central's lucky day! Movie's that tank equal big bucks on television. This movie is the ultimate Comedy Central movie, terrible in every sense of the word, but loved by hardcore comedy fans everywhere.\n\nAnd that is where I came across this movie.\n\nThe movie itself is god awful. Although stocked with some pretty memorable one-liners (\"even in hell i get no respect\") and some of the weirdest, but greatest, cameos ever put onto paper, they are mostly cheap laughs. However, as much as I hate to, I have to give an A for effort. This movie has some interesting special effects and an interesting commentary on the punk rock/metal culture. End. Sandler, as the son of Satan, plays the part to \"perfection.\" As the third son of Satan, oddly reminiscent of Sandler's Waterboy (an outcast with a speech impediment), he has to save all of hell and of earth from the wrath of his two far superior brothers, one played by Rhys Ifans who I believe gives one of the only decent performances in this movie. Sandler is everything that a movie critic despises. He's irritating, and acts terribly. The rest of the acting is sub-par as well, even from the great Harvey Keitel, but I guess it's hard to give anything as the part of Satan in a comedy such as this one.\n\nBad acting + cheap laughs + box office flop= Comedy Central gold!\n\nGo see Little Nicky, coming to a cable channel early in the morning, near you!"

Rodney Dangerfield, Patricia Arquette, Howard Keitel, Reese Witherspoon and Tiny Lister had worthy performances. However, despite all of the talent involved, there was just something that lacked in this movie as opposed to Sandler's other movies that just didn't appeal to me and although I don't like to admit it, the movie had me glancing at my watch at several points.\n\nI especially like how Sandler always puts guys from his previous movies or his former SNL comrades into certain roles. Half of the fun of his movies is picking out characters played by actors that have showed up in his movies before. Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, the guy who played Nicky's gay roommate and both of Nicky's \"heavy metal\" followers did a great job. However, despite all of this, the movie seemed to lag and failed to reel me in.\n\nOzzy Osbourne's appearance as well as the tip-of-the-hat mention to Chris Farley were both awesome. However, they couldn't really save this one. Chalk it up as Sandler's first setback, but I'm sure that he will manage to recover and deliver as he has in Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy and the Wedding Singer."

You can see how powerful Sandler has become that the studio let him play the lead character in such a demented, cartoon faced way. The voice is like something a seventh grader might come up with on a long field trip bus ride and by the end of the trip, his friends (who found it amusing at first) would be begging him to stop the annoying voice. Sandler is so limited as an actor I guess he was more comfortable totally playing a cartoon. I guess he is an acquired taste and if he all he wants is to make 13 year old boys laugh, then he has succeeded. But after showing a bit of human element in WEDDING SINGER, he immediately went back to the one dimensional, unbelievable human being in WATERBOY and then continued it with this latest opus. His films make money, and if that's all he is after, then he wins. But if he truly wants to make well written, strong comedies - he's failed as bad as Pauly Shore."

In this movie the adults are all over thirty and act like twelve year olds. I can't recall when I've seen a comedy movie as lame as this one.\n\nThe beginning of the movie was okay but soon after the signs of a sucky movie begin to emerge. After about fifteen minutes of this garbage I knew I had been deceived and suffered thru the rest of the toilet humor, recycled jokes and repeating themes, and gritted my teeth until it was over.\n\nThere was only one mildy funny scene in the which the devil takes over the earth and addresses the morally corrupted crowd and tells them that he present them with Henry Winkler. Henry Winkler walks on stage and says good evening and then the devil says: \"covered in bee's\". A swarm of bee's attack's Winkler and the whole scene was just a few seconds and I did chuckle at that.\n\nLater in the movie the writers had him swarmed a second time, just in case you didn't laugh the first time. I though he had died. This in fact appears to be the writing strategy through out the entire movie, that is, find something that is amusing and then repeat it again and again.\n\nI gave this movie the lowest possible rating: 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a huge fan of Adam Sandler's for at least 4 years now (I'm only 15). I have seen and own nearly every more he has appeared in--from Going Overboard to his latest, Little Nicky--and I must say that if I had to rank this among my favorite Sandler movies, this has to be one of his worst.\n\nFrom a comedy standpoint I felt it wasn't nearly as funny as some of my personal favorites such as Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and Billy Madison. One or two things made me laugh, but not as much as I expect from a Sandler movie. The various other comedians featured in the film, to me, were pretty boring, too. I didn't even realize that Dana Carvey was the referee until I saw him in the cast on this page; Rodney Dangerfield did his usual comedic shtick even though I thought it wasn't as good as some of his jokes I've heard in guest appearances on Leno; Kevin Nealon's character is just plain not funny (I thought he was hilarious in Happy Gilmore). Jon Lovitz, on the other hand, was pretty funny though with the help of an oversized bird. The one thing I really did enjoy was the reference to a previous Sandler movie using one of its characters (for you Adam Sandler fanatics: You will enjoy that part).\n\nThe plot itself, I felt, was pretty stupid in my opinion. OK, so maybe Sandler's films--with the exception of Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer--aren't made to be for critical acclaim, I felt that for once the critics had every right to say what they did about this flick. It may be that I'm not into those fantasy-type movies, but the story was just so lame that it I wouldn't wish for Satan himself to see this God-forsaken movie.\n\nI haven't seen it since the second day it was in theatres, and I do plan on buying it eventually to complete my Adam Sandler collection, but for those that haven't seen it I advise you NOT to waste $20 on the DVD, 15 bucks buying it on VHS, or even $5 at your local Blockbuster. If you really do want to see this movie for yourself, try to do so while at someone else's house who owns the movie or already rented it. And for all you other Sandler-maniacs out there, let's hold our hands together and pray than in his next movie he can put all this trash behind him, and return to the comedic glory he has previously attained."

Oddly, and I can't explain it really, but I have a weird feeling that this movie is going to age well. In five or six years I think \"Little Nicky\" will look better and will seem funnier. If you haven't seen it yet, wait a while. The film has something in common with the process of dying, in that it's better than \"The Waterboy\" and \"Big Daddy\". So I'll give it that."

On top of that, his character in this has a problem with speaking because he got hit by a shovel, which by itself is already a reason to doubt this movie.\n\nThe story itself is quite poor. Nicky's two brothers escape hell,where Nicky and his family (mum excluded) live, causing the fiery gate to hell to freeze. Nicky is send to earth with a flask from which his brothers have to drink from so Nick can take them back to hell.\n\nThere is a scene where Nicky drops by the house of a woman he met recently on Earth and who he flipped off (under possession by his brother). She uses pepper-spray on him, causing him to fall. He does not die though, because when he gets close to the ground his fall is stopped and he floats. He flies back up and explains who he is to her. The woman , who was flipped off, spoken to in a devilish voice and sees Nicky fall down and floating/flying after she pepper-sprayed him (implying she is frightened by him) then suddenly accepts him. Oh, so you're the Devil's son? Well, that makes sense, lets be a couple.\n\nAlthough I didn't like this movie, I didn't give it a 1. I haven't because it has some funny moments (The Chicago record with the dark message and Ozzy Osbourne. I also liked the reference to Happy Gilmore close to the end of the movie."

That turned out to be one of the best things about it. I thought the voice he had for Nicky was hilarious and able to be easily mimicked between me and my friends. Rhys Ifans played a hopefully star-making performance as one of Nicky's brothers. Another thing I should note about the film is it's use of current music which I can not stand in most movies. For some reason, most of the music in the film seemed to fit. When Nicky is in Heaven and they start playing Filter's Take My Picture, something in my mind clicked that this was right. The song fit in with the atmosphere created for Heaven. The funniest part in the movie which gets a 10 out of 10 is the beginning of the film starring the highly underrated Jon Lovitz. I did laugh my ass off at many parts of the film (like Nicky's Face on Scarface's in a clip shown by police) but Jon Lovitz had me me rolling with his peeping tom character. Sandler redeems himself from Bulletproof."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nicky (Adam Sandler) is the youngest and most soft spoken son of Satan (Harvey Keitel). Satan's 10,000 year reign is coming to an end, with Satan slated to choose a successor, whom Nicky is certain will either be his manipulative scheming brother, Adrian (Rhys Ifans), or his cruel muscle headed brother Cassius (Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.). After Satan decides to prolong his reign another 10,000 years believing none of his sons are ready for the responsibility this angers Adrian and Cassius who leave Hell with plans to rule Earth freezing the gates of Hell as they leave and weakening Satan who begins to deteriorate. Now, Nicky is charged with going to Earth and bringing his brothers back to Hell before the balance of Good and Evil is destroyed bringing about the apocalypse.\n\nThe first starring vehicle for Adam Sandler under his then new production company Happy Madison, high expectations were placed upon Little Nicky after Sandler's previous comedy, Big Daddy pulled in over $200 million worldwide. The film became a major disappointment with not only the expected critical derision, but also commercial disappointment as the movie opened at a respectable #2 at the box office behind heavyweight smash Charlie's Angels, but a particularly crowded holiday frame that included the following weeks Jim Carrey's The Grinch resulted in the film dropping off quickly of the top earners and making $39 million in the U. S. not even recouping it's $85 million production budget. International markets didn't help either with the worldwide total being just shy of $60 million. The movie is seen as a black mark on Sandler's usual bank-ability, but a mostly forgotten one as his comedies following this have been able to breeze past the $100 million mark, barring outliers like Eight Crazy Nights. Little Nicky was even called the \"Worst Comedy of All Time\" by MST3K host/writer Mike Nelson but even with all that said I actually find myself liking Little Nicky just enough.\n\nI think Little Nicky's biggest asset is in its supporting cast who are all wickedly funny playing farcical takes on Hellish minions. Harvey Keitel is a lot of fun as Satan (with a joyfully bad taste scene involving Adolf Hitler and a pineapple giving a decent laugh). Both Rhys Ifans and Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr. Are fantastic playing Satan's reckless power hungry sons and there's some really funny scenes of them wreaking havoc on Earth by possessing prominent political and religious leaders and steering mankind towards sinful behavior involving debauchery, perversion, and violence (albeit fairly tame due to the PG-13 rating). The scene in St. Patrick's Cathedral where Adrian possesses the Cardinal and mocks the parishioners with comments on drugs and adultery is very funny (albeit with some problems in delivery) and it shows there's a really strong foundation for comedy. Allen Covert is easily my favorite character in the film, playing a struggling actor named Todd who becomes Roommates with Nicky and serves as a really amusing straight man to Nicky's demonic shenanigans. I also enjoyed John (Jonathan Loughran) and Peter (Peter Dante), a pair of Satanic metalheads who swear loyalty to Nicky after they discover he's a spawn of Satan.\n\nWhile there's definitely enjoyment to be had from the insanity on display, there are some notable drawbacks. The most obvious one is the voice Sandler uses for Nicky being sort of this half whispering half wheezing delivery that just isn't pleasant to listen to and doesn't yield itself to comic delivery. There's also a rather tacked on love story between Nicky and Patricia Arquette as Valerie Veran, a design student that Nicky falls for, and it isn't all that funny or sweet and just feels like it's there for the sake of being there. But unfortunately the weakest point is the comic direction by director Steven Brill who plays too many of the gags by directing actors play scenes too over the top or spout hackneyed lines like \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" that kneecap otherwise promising comic points such as the St. Patrick's Cathedral scene. Prior to Little Nicky, Brill had written the Mighty Ducks trilogy for Disney and directed the Disney fat camp comedy Heavyweights for Producer Judd Appatow and star Ben Stiller, I can see this comic style working if this were a younger skewing comedy, and to a point I suppose it is, but it feels like it deflates much of the film's comic potential. There's also some lowbrow gay panic/transphobic humor but it was the early 2000s so it'd be surprising if that wasn't in there.\n\nLittle Nicky is a flawed but mostly enjoyable. In terms of comedies involving Hell I don't like Little Nicky as much as Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Kevin Smith's Dogma, but I did like it more than Highway to Hell or Stay Tuned. It suffers from having a lead performance that works against Sandler's talents and direction that doesn't know how to meter delivery, but it has some decent supporting work and a few visual gags that did make me laugh."

The Waterboy is probably the more effective movie with similar themes but Little Nicky is no slouch, and it has very enjoyable riffs on the theme and some incredible classic moments. There is the wicked funny \"battle\" at the end where the minions of hell are disarmed by Popeyes chicken and other of Nicky's inventions, for example.\n\nReese Witherspoon and Quentin Tarantino make guest appearances as a Legally Blonde-type bubbly blonde angel with a cell phone and a catastrophe-heralding blind soothsayer in a cheap suit on the New York City streets respectively. Just by these two characterizations you should know the type of buoyant brilliance consistent in the film.\n\nThe film is actually hilarious. I loved the devil whose punishment for failure was a pair of tits on his head, and the ongoing joke of the pink brassiere he decides to wear and the other romances that develop because of his new assets. There are plenty of other moments of originality and pure devilish humor (guess the torture for Hitler) that does set this film apart in its own right despite having a nod to other Adam Sandler stories.\n\nI give this movie 8/10 because I enjoyed it a super great deal and even liked the message it imparted in its own funny way about the power of small enjoyable things over stark antagonistic entities. I thought it was a successful film with even some rare dimension to it even if partly incidental to the humor. It's a sweet film even though it can be indecent in a way that's kinda hard not to love. Who doesn't want to see some transvestite nipple rubbing now and again. Just me? Ok.\n\nAnyway, do watch this film, it's worth it, even if I took a star off just because I wanted to like the dog sidekick more than I did. This film is definitely better than its 5.5/10 and I would like seeing it get more love than it has."

Its up to Nicky to save the day. First, this movie may not appeal to a lot of people out there, its twisted and all out weird. But its funny, you have Jon Lovitz in the start playing ladies night while perving at a hot mum and later gets humped by a horn dog bird in Hell. Sandman;s voice is super funny in this and his laugh reminds me of Muttley the cartoon dog. You have Rodney Dangerfield playing Lucifer who has a few funny moments and the 4pm punishment appointment of Hitler. There is also Tarantino playing the crazed preacher plus Beefy the dog who got kicked out of the strippas. And don't forget about SNL alum Dana Carvey. The movie fails in going to fast and losing track what is happening. Would have been nice to see more of Dangerfield and even John Whiterspoon (Mr Jones for you Friday fans) could have had more screen time. The two fans of Nicky played by regular Sandman dudes also had their moments. The movie does awesomeeee with the rock music playing hits from Van Halen, P. O. D, AC/DC and Disturbed. The comedic elements do get sloppy and unoriginal and not that creative however it does have funny moments. The film is a forgettable comedy maybe because the jokes do not connect, overall 5.5/10."

The jokes are juvenile, tasteless, sexist, and just plain awkward. Some laughs are good like a dog shooting a harpoon out unexpectedly & a hilarious Ozzy Osbourne cameo. Then there are the ones that are cringey like practically every scene with Allen Covert & the awkward scenes of Reese Witherspoon as Nicky's mom. It doesn't help either that for the whole movie you have to hear Sandlers grating speech impediment impression. Sure theres far worst comedies out there & this one isn't that bad to sit through, but definitely one not worth coming back to that often."

Very wealthy, true, but he has never been funny, and never will be, and in most of his recent movies he seems to be vying for the crown of King of Smarm. I hate all of his characters, but Little Nicky is the worst I've ever seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to say, I completely agree with your 3/10 rating for the film \"Little Nicky - Satan Junior\". This movie had so much potential, but it fell flat in so many ways.\n\nFirst of all, I have to mention Adam Sandler. He is undoubtedly a talented actor and has given us some great films like \"The Wedding Singer\" and \"The Waterboy\". However, he has also made some real stinkers, and \"Little Nicky\" is definitely one of them. It's disappointing to see someone with such potential continuously churn out movies that are just plain bad. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to remake a classic like \"Mr. Deeds\" with Sandler in the lead role? It's insulting to the original and to the audience's intelligence.\n\nNow, let's talk about the film itself. The biggest problem with \"Little Nicky\" is that it's just not funny. The humor is crude, smarmy, and often relies on shock value rather than genuine laughs. Making a comedy about Satan and Hell is a tough job, but it could have been done so much better. Just look at \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\" for example. That film managed to tackle similar themes in a clever and funny way. \"Little Nicky\", on the other hand, feels like it was written by 7-year-olds who think Beavis and Butthead's humor is too sophisticated. The crude jokes, like the sexually obsessed dog and the scene with demons shoving pineapples into Hitler's rectum, are just tasteless and not funny at all.\n\nWhat's even more frustrating is that there are people out there who actually think this film is good. I mean, seriously? Comparing \"Little Nicky\" to films like \"Gone with the Wind\" or \"Dr. Strangelove\" is just absurd. It's a low, stupid film without any value. It's disheartening to see that there are people who will pay to see anything, regardless of its quality. It's like the predictions in the film \"Idiocracy\" are becoming true today.\n\nInterestingly, if you look at the statistics for the ratings, you'll see that as many people loved the film as hated it. However, if you break it down by demographics, you'll notice that the older you get, the more likely you are to hate the film. It's clear that the film didn't resonate with a more discerning audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Little Nicky was an older film by Adam Sandler in which has been forgotten by many because it was panned by critics and was considered a flop with its large budget. It is considered one of his worst films and it suits as it. The main problem with Little Nicky is that it is a comedy without humor. The screenplay, wastes most opportunities for laughs on routine pratfalls and lame devil on earth jokes. Some attempt at cleverness comes with the arrival of two goofy dudes, Pete and John (Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran), but these apostles are more like Led Zeppelin hangers on than disciples of the potential anti-Christ. However I found his talking dog Beefy to be a highlight of the film. He was there to guide Nicky and help him survive on earth.\n\nSandler has good intentions but his character comes off as annoying. If you dislike his character you are most likely not going to enjoy this film. The supporting cast around Nicky is made up of a who's who list in Hollywood that, unfortunately, has little to do. Rodney Dangerfield (as grandpa Lucifer), Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Neelon, Michael McKean, Carl Weathers, Rob Schneider, Henry Winkler, Ozzie Osbourne and Regis Philbin, among others, make their appearances in cameo perfs. Overall the film has some moments worth watching but don't expect a hilarious type comedy"

Then came the Wedding Signer, it was what I like to call a movie that everyone can enjoy. Yet it still sneaks in great Adam Sandler humor. I true high quality film that most people should recognize. Waterboy came next; it sort of went back to the Madison format again. After that, Big Daddy came and went. I was happy to see Adam Sandler trying new things, but still packing in his good old humor... ok, now that I have rambled on lets get to my point.\n\nLittle Nicky... Whenever I hear that a new Adam Sandler movie is coming out I get excited because I hope it is going to make me roll on the floor, like Happy Gilmore did, but when I saw the preview for Little Nicky, I did not want to see it at all. It just seemed way too strange to be funny. Well, I went to see it anyway. I wanted to prove myself wrong.\n\nThis movie just was not funny. (ok it had a few moments) But it was generally just stupid. It was so bad I have almost lost all my respect for Mr. Sandler. I am sorry. This movie is not believable in any way. I just don't understand how a movie like this could have even been made. I would like to give some more specific examples, but it would just take too much out of me. Just Do yourself a favor, and forget about seeing this one."

But there is a lot here to like. Harvey Keitel and Rodney Dangerfield as Satan and his father, Quentin Tarantino as a crazy, blind priest (but I still think he should try directing again soon!) and many other good moments. The climax goes on much too long and the toilet humour never really works. When all is said and done- LITTLE NICKY is an average comedy- no more no less. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "But for those of you who are undecided, for those of you who are thinking, \"Maybe it's time I gave an Adam Sandler movie a chance\", do me a favor, will ya? DO NOT RENT Little Nicky. Go out and rent a GOOD Sandler flick like The Wedding Singer, dig up your old Saturday Night Live videos of Sandler as Opera Man or Peter Brady, or even watch old re-runs of The Cosby Show where you might catch a young Adam Sandler as Theo's pal, Smitty. Whatever you do, promise me you'll think twice about going to see Nicky. Title-character Nicky (Sandler) is one of three spawns of Satan (Harvey Keitel), living in Hell (literally), getting kicked around by his two older brothers, Adrian and Cassius (Tom \"Tiny\" Lister, from Friday fame), and generally just trying to be a good evil son to his father. After evil Dad denies them the right to take over Hell once his 10,000-year reign has come to a close, Adrian and Cassius decide to take their anger up to Earth -- at the same time, freezing the portal to the flaming gateway to Hell. Unfortunately now that the gateway is frozen, there are no more souls to feed Satan (and keep in mind, this is a BAD thing), so his body slowly begins to deteriorate (a finger flops off here, an ear is shed there, etc.) It's now up to Nicky to bring his brothers back home before his father rots away. Faced with fast-moving public transportation, a Jack-Nicholson-mimicking mutt named \"Beefy\" (Nicky's \"earthly guide\"), a retentively stuck-up actor for a roommate, and a growing love interest in homely-looking Patricia Arquette, Nicky finds it difficult just staying alive, much less retrieving his satanic sibs and saving Hell. Yeah, it's confusing to me, too, why anyone would care enough to save Hell, but I'll chalk it up to \"It's an ADAM SANDLER movie -- I'm supposed to be ENJOYING this.\" Yeah... whatever.\n\nWhile Nicky does have its moments (the cameos in this thing are unbelievable!), there's little excuse for this movie. It's like watching a long, drawn out, really dumb Rodney Dangerfield joke -- complete with RODNEY DANGERFIELD (as Grandpa Lucifer I might add)! What seems to start off well and amusingly so turns into a hodge-podge of weak (and surprisingly archaic) one-liners, jokes the size of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man coming down Fifth Avenue, and THE most annoying assault on the auditory senses... Adam Sandler's voice-choice for Nicky. Think Renfield from the original Dracula (1931) crossed with Baron von's assistant from Frankenstein (1931). I could only take so much of either character when I saw both films... and they came back to haunt me in this one throughout its ENTIRETY. Might as well have been in Hell, let alone sitting through a movie about it."

Without getting into spoilers that's all I can really say about the fighting scenes. I also like how Whitey is in this movie for a little bit. Seeing him made me have a good laugh. Now for the bad scenes in this movie. There's a lot of jokes that aren't funny and make you question what you're watching. The only theory I have for these jokes being in the movie is that Adam Sandler made the jokes and thought it would fit the movie. A lot of them don't. Also a scene contradict itself literally two or so minutes after Little Nicky was told to do a thing. In conclusion, watch a better Adam Sandler movie like Grown Ups 2 and only watch this movie if you want to see a bad Adam Sandler movie or you're watching all of his movies."

Ryhs Ifans starring as Nicky's evil brother Adrian is gloriously over the top and completely steals the show. Adrian and Nicky's other evil brother Cassius decide to go up to earth to corrupt the people and their father the Devil himself (amusingly played by Harvey Kietel) sends Little Nicky after them to bring them back cue sub-plot about the Devil dying because Adrian and Cassius have frozen the gates to the entrance of hell, etc etc. This leaves Little Nicky till midnight to get them back before his father, the unholy one himself croaks. Once Nicky gets upto earth he does the usual stranger to the world routine embarrassing himself with his lack of social and moralness. His love interest is completely blink and you'll miss her and thats about it really. Check out cameos from Henri Winkler, Carl Weathers as Chubbs (Its all in the HIPS!) and Quentin Tarantino.

        "review_detailed_main": "We all know by this point that Adam Sandler is not one to go for high-brow humor. He prefers to entertain his audience of college students and teenagers with a cornucopia of absurdities and toilet jokes. Little Nicky is much the same, but with two major differences.\n\nThere is a heavy dependance on special effects in this film. Nicky, as the Devil's son, obviously resides in Hell and Sandler's version of Hell is pretty impressive looking, at least in wide, panoramic shots of the geography. The special effects are put to good use here, but it isn't very scary. Hell looks like a fine place to live, and as the Devil, Harvey Keitel seriously downplays both the Devil's evil side and his funny side, doing little to add to the film. There is little to be scared of in this Hell. Except for the occassional gross-out gag.\n\nNicky goes to Earth to prevent his brothers, the two most evil characters, from corrupting the souls on earth and thereby, in a convuluted and pointless plot, killing Nicky's beloved father. While on earth, Nicky is aided by a talking bulldog, a couple of metalheads looking for some cred, and a shy but sweet girl played by Patricia Arquette.\n\nSandler always has a love story in his films, but never has one been so juvenile. Nicky is little more than a shy teenager, new to earth and awkward in expressing himself, and the scenes where he falls for Arquette are ineffective and cloyingly sensitive. Hearing the Devil's son talking about butterflies in his stomach, in a film that features a character sprouting breasts on his head, struck me as an odd juxtaposition. 10 year olds will love some of the jokes and they might even enjoy the cheesy romance, G-rated as it is, but would you want your 10 year-old going to a movie that features an enormous bird attempting to copulate with Jon Lovitz?\n\nSandler needs to choose an audience, this movie is splintered down the middle as he attempts to appeal to 5th graders with his goofiness and to college kids with his scatalogical side. It never reaches any level of cohesiveness, though it remains entertaining in fits and starts. Between the special effects, the sap and the raunch, the movie gets lost in the mix. Next time, Sandler should choose one audience and ride it all the way through."

I've never come across Adam Sandler before but this has to be his best performance. I also enjoyed Beefy, Satan & Nicky's crazed disciples. In fact the whole ensemble was funny and there were some great special effects. Perhaps it is a little disgusting in places but I wasn't offended by it. All I know is I was kept laughing from start to finish and thoroughly enjoyed it. I purchased this on video soon after viewing it on cable and laughed all over again. A definite 10.

        "review_title": "Underrated Comedy",
        "review_detailed_main": "Yeah, Adam Sandler comedies back in the day were hit-or-miss, but Little Nicky actually does something different. The title character is the youngest son of the devil, and is sometimes bulled by his older brothers, Adrian and Cassius. However, after their father, the prince of darkness, decides to continue his rule, seeing the three are not ready as they have not learned to balance good and evil, which maintains the stability of his rule, Adrian and Cassius decide to escape to Earth and turn it into their own Hell to rule. Angered, Satan sends Nicky to bring them back, but on his mission, he ends up experiencing many things, even falling in love.\n\nThis movie is a funny one. Despite having the clich\u00e9s most of these PG-13 comedies have (as some of the humor can be raunchy), the movie is way underrated. Adam Sandler does a good job as the title role, and the movie has a good selection of stars, like Robert Smigel of SNL fame voicing talking bitpull guide Beefy, Rodney Dangerfield as Nicky's Grandpa Lucifer, and off course, the various cameos they managed to squeeze in (including two from past Adam Sandler comedies). The movie has some funny scenes (like the one with Harlem Globetrotters getting riled up by Cassius' antics while disguised as a referee). It gets a eight because some of the jokes are a miss to me, plus the movie uses Popeye's Chicken as a plot device near the end (thus being blatant product placement, although TV airings censor the logo, possibly because of copyright issues). But still, this is a neat movie, and I am liking this better than Dogma."

I think is one of the best comedies in 2000, maybe Shanghai Noon is a good comedy too. Finally I want to thank everyone looking at my comment :) Ever hear of a movie that is suppose to be the extreme of one sort or another that doesn't live up to its billing? Little Nicky is one of those films. Roasted upon its release as one of the worst films of all time Little Nicky turns out to be an okay comedy. Actually this is the kind of movie that has all of the ingredients to be a screamingly funny comedy, but somehow things don't work."

He fails to make the choice and Adrian and Cassius get slightly annoyed and head for Earth. This blocks the gates of Hell and causes the Devil to fall apart. This is where Nicky comes in, who is instructed to search for his brothers and bring them back within a week. On Earth, Nicky needs to dress in warm clothing and experiences things like eating and sleeping for the first time in his life. He meets and falls for a slightly geeky, design student named Valerie (Patricia Arquette) and has difficulty in finding his brothers.\n\nAdam rules the comedy genre once again!"

Just like cops'll go after kids with long hair, or dark skin, critics have tried to be AGAINST movies they think will make considerably less money than others, or movies they just plain don't understand. Just look at the reviews for <There's Something About Mary>. Yeah, don't *those* critics feel like idiots now.\n\nThe point I'm trying to get here is, no this Sandler movie doesn't look low-budget; it looks high-budget. It's not even his best movie, in my opinion. But you know what? It's a damn-good movie. It reflects Sandler's humour with the usual cool style. Believe me, *anyone* is a fan of Sandler movies will really like this movie. And I'm not being paid to say this.\n\n\n\n-Sep"

I think the best part of this movie is watching Harvey Kietel's character rotting away as the devil; it's all so insane I can't help but love it! This movie isn't meant to be a deep, philosophical experience, but it is meant to make people laugh, which it will if you really love Adam Sandler's type of humor, otherwise look elsewhere for your movie watching enjoyment."

If I lived in the 80's, I would probably be just like Paul and John, the metalheads. Quentin Tarantino was funny as the blind deacon, too. I feel sorry for Adam that one of those angels was his Mom, cause they were damn hot! There were a whole bunch of funny cameos. At one point I thought that possibly every person who had ever been on a movie with him was in this one! All in all, probably the funniest of his movies. I gave it 10 stars out of 10!"

It is one of my favorite comedies, along with Ruthless People, Clerks, Big Business, and All of Me, to name a few. So, if you enjoyed these others I've listed, give it a try.

If you notice...a large portion of them decided to give it a bad review and then tell people to go see The Wedding Singer. This is the problem. People went to see it or rented it, in a lot of cases, expecting another \"Wedding Singer\" or another \"Big Daddy\"...however, shortly into the movie they realized that this was not the case...and...since they dislike movies like this anyway, they decided it was a bad movie. No. It's a bad movie only in the minds of those who don't like this kind of comedy. That would be like me...going to see Titanic and giving it a bad review, while not mentioning the fact that as a general rule I did like romantic tragedys.

This Sandler flick however is very classic, granted a lame story line, but you still have the late great Rodney Dangerfield as the original Lucifer, you have the great Harvey Keitel as the devil himself, awesome guest appearances by tiny \"zeus\" lister, Dana carvey, Reese Witherspoon, Quentin Tarantino, Jon Lovitz, will Ferrell, Patricia arquette, Ozzy Osbourne, and a few old school Saturday night live alumnies.

Little nicky is great for all kids and parents. The sets are great and the scenes in heavan are the best. Chub from Happy Gilmore shows up in Hevan as Nickys moms and friends mambo instructor. These are just some of the funnies moments of Little Nicky. I suggest that if you want to laugh you go see little nicky!"

I'd also like to note that I have an education, am a huge cinema buff and love a wide range of movies so I am not speaking from the mouth of an easily entertained, fart-joke appreciating below 90 IQ personality.\n\nThis is a great movie. Honestly, people try and take things too seriously! This is an original, funny, thoroughly entertaining film. The acting is great, the characters are unusual and its nice to see A grade actors such as Harvey Keitel lowering themselves and having some fun.\n\nSandlers character (and no I am not a huge Sandler fan - some of his movies are very good - some are very bad) is utterly adorable, and although I have read comments saying that his mangled face just isnt funny - I thought it was great - it takes alot of effort to hold that kind of feature (Olivia D'abo in Waynes World 2 almost dislocated her jaw trying to maintain the same sort of expression)although people have viewed this as an attempt to get cheap laughs from stupid people, I think it was a very good example of dark humour.\n\nI realise that by no means is this film a brilliant cinematic masterpiece nor am I trying to make it out to be, but what it is is alot of fun. Dont think too much, just sit back and enjoy it!"

If you're looking for something deep and meaningful, why are you watching Adam Sandler? The humour is typical, but for once the story had more than a one gag plot (how many movies have you seen involving the gates of hell freezing over?) and twisted several times before the end of the film. I think the real controversy for some here was the religious (or sacreligious) content, but it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's not theology, it's comedy! Also, fans of Metallica, Van Halen, Ozzy, etc. will not be disappointed...."

Any one who has watched the film will appreciate it as much as I do and i recommend it to any real fan of Adam Sandler movies and any one new to comedy. \"I'm from the South, the deep South, hee hee hee\" Little Nicky. \"I've got BOOBS on my head, ARGH\" one of many hilarious demons."

I found it to be a great distraction from tax season (I'm an accountant in Canada) and helped me \"recharge\" myself for the next work day.\n\n8 out of 10 stars."

I thought the 2 guys that were friends with Nicky were really good too, I loved the part where Nickys in central park, scoring and then he turns his head and says \"I'll eat your hearts\" Classic!
